Ghost (age twenty-eight) had never imagined that he would find himself in the situation that he was in presently. Sitting on a patch of rotted floorboards, with his back to the equally rotted door, he was regretting some of the decisions he had made with his life. However, there was no time for introspection, as his companion, a field researcher by the name of Kevin Starnes (age nineteen), replied, \u201cThat would be because of Two-Sixty-Nine, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and what exactly is Two-Sixty-Nine?\u201d</p>\n<p>Quickly checking a paper from the sheaf of files that he was holding, Starnes read, \u201cThe files aren\u2019t very clear, as no one\u2019s been able to catch the thing so far, but this one says, \u2018What has been determined is that the large creature was roughly humanoid with distinct moose-like features. The creature was described in a wide range of attributes, as with many cryptids, although all reports indicate the creature is bipedal with two arms, moose-like antlers, and a towering stature.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, basically, what we\u2019re looking at here is a moose man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we haven\u2019t tried just shooting it, or drugging it, or anything like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we opened fire with the tranquiliser darts when we found it, but then it just started chasing us. We ran back the way we came, right past your research team, and then scattered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how we ended up here. Fantastic. I\u2019m going to go urinate in the corner now, before I have a chance to actually get the piss scared out of me, eh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trundling over to what he assumed to be the corner of the dank former dwelling, Neil went about his business with gusto, humming a jaunty tune as he relieved himself. Turning his head just enough to keep an eye on both Starnes and the door, Neil inquired, \u201cSo, as long as we\u2019re here, do you think you could tell me why there were multiple research teams sent to investigate this thing? I mean, maybe an armed Mobile Task Force would be able to handle a man-eating monstrosity better than a bunch of nerds in lab coats and hiking gear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dWell, technically speaking, with the dentition of a moose, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Two-Sixty-Nine would be able to properly consume any kind of meat, much less human flesh.\u201d Unfortunately, this was all that Kevin Starnes had a chance to say in reply: a particularly large hoof impacted the opposite side of the door, splintering the damp wood, and driving itself through four tenths of his spinal column, five ribs, and several of the more important organs in his thoracic cavity.</p>\n<p>Bursting through a previously unnoticed back door into the twilit woods, wang in hand, Neil ran as fast as he could manage from a grisly array of odours, and what he was sure would be an embarrassingly moose-related death. Hastily repackaging his groin-bound goods, he tried not to focus on the approach of the oddly-proportioned creature, its swift hooves making dull thuds in response to the moist squishing of his feeble-by-comparison footfalls on the mossy, rain-damp ground. Cursing with what little breath he could muster, it came as somewhat of a surprise to the other people in the pit when he fell in with an astonished \u201cAssnugget cuntface.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neil R. Ghost had found the rest of his original research team. Well, they had found him, but no one was about to play semantics. He had, in fact, been pulled into a hollow formed by the roots of a long-dead cedar, by one Doctor Owen Hamilton (age thirty-nine), and silenced with a hand over the mouth from researcher Andrea Barclay (age thirty-two), two of his initial five-man group of scientists and researchers.

Ghost (age twenty-eight) had never imagined that he would find himself in the situation that he was in presently. Sitting on a patch of rotted floorboards, with his back to the equally rotted door, he was regretting some of the decisions he had made with his life. However, there was no time for introspection, as his companion, a field researcher by the name of Kevin Starnes (age nineteen), replied, \u201cThat would be because of Two-Sixty-Nine, sir.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, and what exactly is Two-Sixty-Nine?\u201d \n\n\n\nQuickly checking a paper from the sheaf of files that he was holding, Starnes read, \u201cThe files aren\u2019t very clear, as no one\u2019s been able to catch the thing so far, but this one says, \u2018What has been determined is that the large creature was roughly humanoid with distinct moose-like features. The creature was described in a wide range of attributes, as with many cryptids, although all reports indicate the creature is bipedal with two arms, moose-like antlers, and a towering stature.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, basically, what we\u2019re looking at here is a moose man?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd we haven\u2019t tried just shooting it, or drugging it, or anything like that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, we opened fire with the tranquiliser darts when we found it, but then it just started chasing us. We ran back the way we came, right past your research team, and then scattered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how we ended up here. Fantastic. I\u2019m going to go urinate in the corner now, before I have a chance to actually get the piss scared out of me, eh.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrundling over to what he assumed to be the corner of the dank former dwelling, Neil went about his business with gusto, humming a jaunty tune as he relieved himself. Turning his head just enough to keep an eye on both Starnes and the door, Neil inquired, \u201cSo, as long as we\u2019re here, do you think you could tell me why there were multiple research teams sent to investigate this thing? I mean, maybe an armed Mobile Task Force would be able to handle a man-eating monstrosity better than a bunch of nerds in lab coats and hiking gear.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201dWell, technically speaking, with the dentition of a moose, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Two-Sixty-Nine would be able to properly consume any kind of meat, much less human flesh.\u201d Unfortunately, this was all that Kevin Starnes had a chance to say in reply: a particularly large hoof impacted the opposite side of the door, splintering the damp wood, and driving itself through four tenths of his spinal column, five ribs, and several of the more important organs in his thoracic cavity.\n\n\n\nBursting through a previously unnoticed back door into the twilit woods, wang in hand, Neil ran as fast as he could manage from a grisly array of odours, and what he was sure would be an embarrassingly moose-related death. Hastily repackaging his groin-bound goods, he tried not to focus on the approach of the oddly-proportioned creature, its swift hooves making dull thuds in response to the moist squishing of his feeble-by-comparison footfalls on the mossy, rain-damp ground. Cursing with what little breath he could muster, it came as somewhat of a surprise to the other people in the pit when he fell in with an astonished \u201cAssnugget cuntface.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeil R. Ghost had found the rest of his original research team. Well, they had found him, but no one was about to play semantics. He had, in fact, been pulled into a hollow formed by the roots of a long-dead cedar, by one Doctor Owen Hamilton (age thirty-nine), and silenced with a hand over the mouth from researcher Andrea Barclay (age thirty-two), two of his initial five-man group of scientists and researchers.

One of the research directors launches into a thanks for my retrieval of Seven-Twenty-Eight, and asks me quite politely to handle the three more like it arriving later in the week. It\u2019s not like I have a choice, I suppose. I stretch out my arm to hang up the phone, but the director interjects with another fun piece of information: I\u2019m needed to round up a retrieval team and investigate claims of a living breakfast somewhere in the States. I think I might resign some time in the very near future.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "728 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/728", "year": 2009}, "784incident1": {"created_at": "2009-02-18T19:58:00", "creator": "DrClef", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-18T19:58:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-18T19:58:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "Added rating module.", "date": "2009-02-18T21:52:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-19T17:14:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-19T17:14:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-14T18:07:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

The microphone should pick up any vocalizations made by Skip Seven-Eight-Four.\" Doctor Lorenzo indicated a microphone and a speaker located on the console. \"Speak into this microphone. It will transmit to the speaker in the communications module. Seven-Eight-Four should be able to pick up the vibrations through contact.\"</p>\n<p>\"That will not be sufficient, Doctor Lorenzo.\" Director Valentine's eyes were hard as flint, matching the steely grey of her hair, and her voice carried the snap of many years of authority. \"I need to get inside the containment chamber and speak to Andrews directly.\"</p>\n<p>Lorenzo hesitated. \"Ma'am,\" he said, his lilting, Castillian accent tinged with doubt, \"Seven-Eight-Four is a highly dangerous Keter-Class SCP that has already claimed the life of at least one other human being. I can't recommend that you be allowed in there.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your objections are duly noted and overruled.\" She opened her briefcase and handed a manila envelope to the perplexed scientist. \"My papers. As of 0600 hours this morning, Overseer Eleven has given me clearance for direct access to this artifact.\"</p>\n<p>The Spaniard glanced over the papers. \"Looks like it's all in order,\" he sighed. \"Except for the fact that it's absolutely loco. All right. There's a changing room to the left of the main entrance for Foundation personnel. Remove all your clothes and personal effects and change into scrubs. Angie will get you a respirator and some goggles and brief you on the safety procedures.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Doctor Lorenzo.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>She had expected the interior of the containment chamber to be dark and gloomy, filled with shadows and grime, a monstrous home for the monster it contained. The brightly lit chamber was far less dramatic, but given the choice between drama and safety, Valentine preferred the one that let her walk out alive.</p>\n<p>Seven-Eight-Four's tendency to assimilate any silicon and metal it came into contact with meant that steel and glass were verboten. Transparent acrylic and concrete were the materials of choice. The heavy concrete container rested at the bottom of a deep pool of acetone, the sharp odor of the solvent cutting through her paper-and-cloth respirator mask. The acetone was a safety measure: the nanomachines that made up the artifact's mechanical portions were very similar to proteins, and would disintegrate under heat and heavy solvents.</p>\n<p>She tried not to think about the fail-safe measure that relied on the first method.</p>\n<p>\"You didn't have to come in here with me,\" she said.</p>\n<p>The figure in the blue hazmat suit next to her shook its head, the gesture muted by the loose hood. \"I'm responsible for this artifact,\" Lorenzo said. \"I'm not letting an outsider in here alone.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. Please tell the Deltas to raise the artifact.\"</p>\n<p>Lorenzo nodded to the two figures in orange hazmat suits, who began to turn the capstan on the far side of the chamber. A series of ropes and pulleys, all made out of non-metallic materials, raised the heavy concrete chamber out of its acetone bath like a monster rising from the sea depths. A third D-Class, carrying a sprayer on its back, stood by nervously, fiddling with the controls of his device. \"If I may ask, what's the reason for all this?\" Lorenzo asked.</p>\n<p>\"Psychological analysis,\" Valentine said. \"Overseers want to find out what's going on in his head.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really? Because I can tell you right now. Nothing. He's like an animal, all he knows is food and pain. I know he was some kind of agent before, but he's just a monster now.\"</p>\n<p>\"He wasn't just 'some kind of agent,' Lorenzo, he was a member of Pandora's Box. He's the one who stopped Steel Doll. He's helped capture over a dozen SCPs in the wild, three Keter-Class. He was\u2026 he IS a hero, and he deserves better than to be treated like a caged beast.\" Her last words were punctuated by the heavy thud of the containment chamber being locked into place, suspended just over the pool of solvent.</p>\n<p>Lorenzo's lip twisted into a half-sneer, half smile. \"I'm sorry. I'll be sure to show the proper respect,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"See that you do. Is it possible for me to speak to him directly?\" Valentine asked.</p>\n<p>\"There is a port on the top of the chamber for replenishing the nutrient bath. We normally keep it sealed except when attached to the pipe, but\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Do it.\"</p>\n<p>Lorenzo nodded and shouted something in Spanish to the figures in the orange haz-mat suits. They flinched noticeably. One of them protested in the same language, only to be shouted down by Lorenzo. There was a brief hesitation, then one of the D-Classes started to gingerly approach the concrete cube, while the other two grabbed sprayers and looked on nervously. \"Please stay behind the yellow line, Director,\" Lorenzo said. \"We've been trying to train him not to cross the line using aversion therapy. It's been\u2026 well, we've had some success.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\" Valentine stepped back over the spray-painted line on the floor. \"Any particular reason why the containment crew is mostly Spanish-speaking?\"</p>\n<p>\"Easy to acquire. Some third-world dictator needs a few trouble-makers disappeared? We need a few warm bodies. Mutually beneficial agreement.\" Lorenzo smiled. \"I think the guy climbing the ladder's here for calling Hugo Chavez a fat bastard on national TV.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm.\" Valentine crossed her arms. \"Convenient.\"</p>\n<p>\"Absolutely. Oh, hang on, here it comes. This is actually pretty cool,\" Lorenzo said, chuckling nervously.</p>\n<p>The D-Class opened the port, then hastily ran down the ladder and back to his companions, picking up a spray tank and strapping it to his back. Slowly at first, a tendril of steel and glass emerged from the opening, swaying back and forth like a snake. A bulbous growth appeared at the end, then split open to reveal a small blue gem the size of a marble. \"We're pretty sure that's a visual receptor of some sort,\" Lorenzo whispered. \"It seems to be made up of thousands of tiny photoreceptors and lenses, kind of like an insect's eye.\"</p>\n<p>\"How well does he see?\" Valentine asked.</p>\n<p>\"Well enough.\"</p>\n<p>The tendril snaked towards the two scientists, approached the yellow line, hesitated. The sapphire-blue eye turned towards the D-Classes, who gripped their sprayers tightly. The thing paused, then withdrew about a meter from the line. The orange-suited men relaxed visibly.</p>\n<p>\"If it crosses the line, it gets a full spray from the solvent, then reduced nutrition for a week,\" Lorenzo explained. \"It seems to be the only way to get it to obey.\" He smiled at Valentine. The older woman just stared back at him coldly, and the younger scientist coughed and cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>Valentine turned her attention back to Seven-Eight Four, which seemed to be reconfiguring itself. A blob of nanomaterial oozed down the length of the tendril (like a mouse being swallowed by a snake, she thought), then formed itself into a crude face, a second blue eye opening up next to the first. Valentine had seen photographs of Agent Andrews before his accident, and recognized the pudgy cheeks and pursed lips: the rest of it, however, was crude, a vague approximation of a human face formed by a mind that had nearly forgotten what it looked like.</p>\n<p>\"Andrews,\" Valentine said. \"Can you hear me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Seven-Eight-Four can pick up air vibrations,\" Lorenzo chimed in. \"It talks back by forming and vibrating\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Shut up.\" Valentine cut Lorenzo off angrily. \"Andrews,\" she repeated, \"Can you hear me?\"</p>\n<p>The mouth opened, and a membrane stretching across the back, just behind the teeth, began to vibrate. \"yessssss,\" it said, in a buzzing, electronic approximation of a human voice. \"i kckkckkcan hear yyyou.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you know who I am, Andrews?\" Valentine said.</p>\n<p>\"anddddddrrrrrers is deaddeddeddead i am sevensevev\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you know who I am, Andrews?\" Valentine repeated sternly.</p>\n<p>The eyes turned and regarded Valentine closely. \"dirrrrecccctor jjjjjanice valenvalentine. yoyoyou werrrrrrrre the one the one who reckakckakrcruited mmmmmmme from em em em eye yay titititieee.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Andrews,\" Valentine said, smiling.

It depicted a young woman wearing a blue hospital gown laying on a bed, hooked up to a respirator, her eyes staring blankly up at the camera flash. \"And what if I told you,\" the Director said, \"that Beatrix Maddox is still alive?\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/784incident2\">Part 2: Negotiation</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/784incident1\">The 784 Incident: Part 1: Contact</a>\" by DrClef, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Valentine screamed, and then the tendrils lunged forward and wrapped around her, dragging her up into the air. A thousand cruel, sickle-like blades formed themselves around her in an iron maiden, barely dragging against the surface of her hazard suit. \"SECURITY!\" I screamed. \"EMERGENCY SPRAYERS, FULL\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!\" Valentine screamed. \"STAND DOWN!\" She turned back to the cold, implacable eyes of 784's optics, unafraid of the razor-edged blades. \"wait\u2026\" she repeated.</p>\n<p>\"fleshhhhh esh flesh matitititititttters flesh matters not,\" 784 chitters. \"only only mimmmmind.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't let you see her,\" Valentine said, \"but I can cancel the order for the Class A Amnestic.

By the way, what the fuck is that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh. Doctor Lorenzo was by here earlier, with a formal request for an audit on 784 and Doctor Valentine. He thinks she's out of line, and using improper containment procedures. Wanted me to check up on it.\"</p>\n<p>\"That still doesn't explain the\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm just about to get to that. You see, when I first took on this position, every day I'd have people come in and complain about the stupidest fucking things. Their boss cracks one joke or makes them miss one break they come in here whining and screaming and begging for an Audit Towards Termination. So I've started testing them to see if they're serious. One of the tests is I put a knife on my desk and tell them that if they really want me to do the audit, they'll cut off a finger. When they pick up the knife, I tell them it's okay, they can stop.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 I guess Lorenzo really felt passionately about that audit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Cut off his own middle finger, held it up, and threw it in my face, and implied me and my mother had improper relations, using many four letter words.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 cool.\"</p>\n<p>\"I sent him down to the infirmary.\"</p>\n<p>\"So, are you gonna do that audit?\"</p>\n<p>\"I kinda have to now.\"</p>\n<p>\"You getting soft on me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't let it get around, I've got a reputation to uphold.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem.

She touched her eyepatch, a souvenir of a bad drop over Kosovo that had sent a piece of debris flying into her left eye. That eye tended to ache when there was trouble, and it was hurting like hell now.</p>\n<p>\"That ain't fair, Lieutenant.

What do you want me to do about it? Put you in for a transfer to Headquarters?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, sir,\" Chang gulped. 'Headquarters' was a euphemism for being reassigned as D-Class personnel: a literal kiss of death for any Mobile Task Force member. \"Just making a completely off-hand and innocent observation, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\"Keep it that way, Chang. I'm not getting shot in the head over your lousy griping.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heads up, here comes the Iron Bitch now,\" Vicks said. He dropped his clove cigarette on the ground and crunched it under his boot.</p>\n<p>\"Ten-hut!\" The members of Mobile Task Force Delta Nine (Feynman's Folly) snapped to attention as Assistant Director Janice Valentine entered the briefing room. \"As you were,\" Valentine said, laying down her laptop computer on the table. \"You people probably want to get out in the field and start killing things, so I'll make this brief. Agent Sandoval has called in a report of a highly dangerous biomorph moving through the Crystal Caverns. 784 is being dispatched to contain it.

Nice digs.\" Clef moved to the center of the room, picked up a broad sheet of what appeared to be thin plastic. He rapped in the center of it: the substance was incredibly strong, for being so thin and delicate. \"What's this?\"</p>\n<p>\"784 makes them. Looks like he uses them to build nests, or something.\" Chang pointed to the piles of the substance all around the room, arranged in a vague circular approximation. \"Since it's harmless, they let him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" Clef reached down and picked up a USB stick drive, reading the text written on the side. \"You're letting him read Eric Drexler?\"</p>\n<p>\"Director Valentine's idea, sir.

Hey, can I borrow your cat for the weekend?\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess. Why the hell you'd want to borrow that mangy stray who always misses the fucking litter box, I don't know, but sure, go ahead. You'll probably find him trying to bang Josie. Stupid bastard's too dumb to realize that no matter how much she smells like she's in heat, you can't get it on when the lady don't got no lady parts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks. By the way, what the fuck is that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. Doctor Lorenzo was by here earlier, with a formal request for an audit on 784 and Doctor Valentine. He thinks she's out of line, and using improper containment procedures. Wanted me to check up on it.\"\n\n\n\n\"That still doesn't explain the. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm just about to get to that. You see, when I first took on this position, every day I'd have people come in and complain about the stupidest fucking things. Their boss cracks one joke or makes them miss one break they come in here whining and screaming and begging for an Audit Towards Termination. So I've started testing them to see if they're serious. One of the tests is I put a knife on my desk and tell them that if they really want me to do the audit, they'll cut off a finger. When they pick up the knife, I tell them it's okay, they can stop.\"\n\n\n\n\". . . I guess Lorenzo really felt passionately about that audit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Cut off his own middle finger, held it up, and threw it in my face, and implied me and my mother had improper relations, using many four letter words.\"\n\n\n\n\". . . cool.\"\n\n\n\n\"I sent him down to the infirmary.\"\n\n\n\n\"So, are you gonna do that audit?\"\n\n\n\n\"I kinda have to now.\"\n\n\n\n\"You getting soft on me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't let it get around, I've got a reputation to uphold.\"\n\n\n\n\"No problem. Just shoot Gerald in the face and they'll be calling you \"Clef the Killer\" again in no time. Plus, you'll make Bright two grand.\"\n\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\n\"Never mind.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"You know,\" Chang said, \"I've done a lot of freaky, fucked up things for this group. I've mowed down an entire Sunday School classroom with a Squad Automatic Weapon because they were infected by some hell virus that turned them into bloodthirsty mutants. I've seen the sea glittering behind the gate to hell. . .\"\n\n\n\n\". . . all these moments will be lost like tears in rain?\" Roybal quipped.\n\n\n\n\"Shut up, Roy,\" Chang snarled.\n\n\n\n\"Make me, assgike,\" Roybal snapped back.\n\n\n\n\"Both of you motherfuckers drop it right now or I'll chop off your balls and make dango out of them,\" Takahashi sighed. She touched her eyepatch, a souvenir of a bad drop over Kosovo that had sent a piece of debris flying into her left eye. That eye tended to ache when there was trouble, and it was hurting like hell now.\n\n\n\n\"That ain't fair, Lieutenant. Just cause you don't got any doesn't mean you have to take it out on those of us that. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Sergeant Chang, you have ten seconds to get to the fucking point before I get my gelding tool,\" Takahashi interrupted.\n\n\n\n\"Well, ma'am. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Sir, Chang, I'm a fucking officer, not a housewife or a whore.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, sir, all I'm trying to say, sir, is that riding herd on a fucked up zombie nano-machine monster thing is the most fucked up thing I've had to do in a career built off of doing fucked up things, sir,\" Chang said.\n\n\n\n\"And? What do you want me to do about it? Put you in for a transfer to Headquarters?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, sir,\" Chang gulped. 'Headquarters' was a euphemism for being reassigned as D-Class personnel: a literal kiss of death for any Mobile Task Force member. \"Just making a completely off-hand and innocent observation, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\"Keep it that way, Chang. I'm not getting shot in the head over your lousy griping.\"\n\n\n\n\"Heads up, here comes the Iron Bitch now,\" Vicks said. He dropped his clove cigarette on the ground and crunched it under his boot.\n\n\n\n\"Ten-hut!\" The members of Mobile Task Force Delta Nine (Feynman's Folly) snapped to attention as Assistant Director Janice Valentine entered the briefing room. \"As you were,\" Valentine said, laying down her laptop computer on the table. \"You people probably want to get out in the field and start killing things, so I'll make this brief. Agent Sandoval has called in a report of a highly dangerous biomorph moving through the Crystal Caverns. 784 is being dispatched to contain it. You will accompany it to the operations area and provide whatever support it asks for. That is all. Are there any questions?\"\n\n\n\n\"Um, yeah,\" Chang said, raising his hand. \"What the fuck is a biomorph?\"\n\n\n\n\"She means a monster, idiot. Like a big, fucking, slimy monster,\" Hopkins sighed. \n\n\n\n\"Fuck you, asshole, I was asking the lady a fucking question,\" Chang snapped.\n\n\n\n\"Suck my cock, assgike.\"\n\n\n\n\"I got a fuckin' question for the nice lady,\" Vicks said, waving his hand in the air. \"How come we don't got no fuckin' maps, no fuckin' info about the target, no motherfuckin' support or any mission objectives?\"\n\n\n\n\"784 has all the information you will need to know,\" Valentine protested.\n\n\n\n\"So how come the fuckin' Skip gets to know all about the mission, and not us?\" Chang whined.\n\n\n\n\"Because you idiots don't NEED to know. And if it weren't for the fact that Foundation regulations REQUIRE there to be a task force in support of any SCPs deployed in the field, I'd have all of you morons reassigned to clean toilets until judgement day!\" Valentine shouted.\n\n\n\n\"What the fuck did you just. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"TEN-HUT!\" Takahashi shouted.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck that, Lieutenant, this bitch just. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"YOU ARE IN DIRECT DEFIANCE OF AN ORDER, SERGEANT CHANG!\" Takahashi screamed. \"I SAID, ATTENTION!\"\n\n\n\nThe room fell silent. \"Everyone but Chang and Vicks, get your gear and assemble in the hangar in ten minutes. Private Vicks and Sergeant. . . sorry, CORPORAL Chang will change into PT gear and report to 784's containment facility, where they will spend the duration of the mission cleaning the chamber. I recommend that he also take the time to contemplate, in great detail and with a deep sense of reflection, the meaning of the word, 'insubordination.' Dismissed.\"\n\n\n\n\"But Lieutenant. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"DISMISSED!\" Takahashi shouted. The six other members of Delta Nine filed out of the room in silence.\n\n\n\n\"Your men seem to lack discipline,\" Valentine observed. She placed her papers back in their manila envelope. \"I suppose that's all one can expect from a Mobile Task Force led by a woman.\"\n\n\n\n\"Forgive me for saying this, Assistant Director, but that seems rather ingenuous coming from you,\" Takahashi retorted.\n\n\n\n\"Not at all.

If you'll excuse me, ma'am.\" Takahashi put her heels together, bowed at the waist, and turned on her heel, walking out of the room at a crisp pace.\n\n\n\n\"God, I hate that bitch,\" Valentine sighed.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"I hate that fucking bitch,\" Vicks griped. He dipped the mop into the bucket and squeezed it out harshly. \"God, if I get my hands around her neck, I'm gonna choke her till her eyes bug out. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Shut the hell up, Vicks. It's your damn fault we're in here anyway.\" Chang lifted up the toothbrush and studied the tile grout closely. \"Eh, good enough for government work.\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't know why the Lieutenant don't just pop that bitch one.

A man stood in the doorway, wearing a white lab coat and a hat that could only be described in, awe-struck terms, as 'nifty'. He was grinning, a huge, impossibly wide grin, and his nose was red and large enough to resemble a tomato. Aside from that, he looked pretty much nondescript. \"If I am, I can come back another time.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no problem, sir. . . Dr. . . Mr. Clef.\"\n\n\n\n\"Clef's my nickname.

Nice digs.\" Clef moved to the center of the room, picked up a broad sheet of what appeared to be thin plastic. He rapped in the center of it: the substance was incredibly strong, for being so thin and delicate. \"What's this?\"\n\n\n\n\"784 makes them. Looks like he uses them to build nests, or something.\" Chang pointed to the piles of the substance all around the room, arranged in a vague circular approximation. \"Since it's harmless, they let him.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see.\" Clef reached down and picked up a USB stick drive, reading the text written on the side. \"You're letting him read Eric Drexler?\"\n\n\n\n\"Director Valentine's idea, sir.

He's coming!\" Chang shouted.</p>\n<p>Takahashi swore and grabbed her nine mil, checking the chamber and magazine for ammunition. Thirteen rounds wasn't gonna be enough. Hell, a thousand rounds wasn't gonna be enough for this one. She took cover behind a soda machine, the lurid red and white advertisements on the box casting a strange counterpoint to the amber emergency lights. The rifle in her hands felt small and inadequate compared to that which was approaching.</p>\n<p>The first sign of trouble was Valentine. The older woman was naked, her pale skin laced with stretch marks and pale blue veins, and she was slowly staggering out of the darkened corridor, pale body laced with blood. \"Jesus, she's alive!\" Vicks gasped.</p>\n<p>\"Stand fast, Vicks!\" Takahashi ordered. \"Director Valentine, come here!\"</p>\n<p>The older woman turned slowly, then slumped against the wall. Takahashi swore again, turned to Vicks and Chang. She pointed to her eyes with two fingers, then gestured down the corridor, and pumped her fist once. Vicks and Chang nodded grimly and headed down the corridor, sweeping the corners with their flashlights and pistols. They took up positions on either side of the hallway, then nodded to Takahashi.</p>\n<p>\"Thomas, you're with me.\" The lieutenant ran to Valentine's side. The woman's head was lolling on her shoulders, and her body was covered in a thin sheen of sweat, matting her hair to her skull. \"Hey, bitch, are you alive?\" Takahashi whispered.</p>\n<p>Valentine's eyes opened: the sclera of her eyes were red from ruptured blood vessels, and her speech was slurred. \"Lieu\u2026 loo\u2026\" The older woman coughed up blood. \"Got away\u2026 hit the sprayers but he got out of containment\u2026 he could be anywhere by now. Damn\u2026 stupid of me. I didn't\u2026 thought I had him in check\u2026 Hit the ground hard, feel bad\u2026\" She slumped forward. Her entire back was covered in blood, and there seemed to be a large welt forming on the back of her head.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck\u2026 Thomas, help me get her on the ground. We gotta immobilize her head.\"</p>\n<p>\"Think it's a concussion?\"</p>\n<p>\"Concussion, contusions, aneurysm, whatever it is, this bitch hit her head hard.\" The two of them laid Valentine down on her back. Takahashi tabbed her communicator. \"This is Delta-Nine to Site Control, we have a man down, request immediate medical assistance.\"</p>\n<p>\"Delta Nine, be advised that we are currently in the middle of\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I know you're having a Kondraki Moment, you asshole, but you can spare a couple of stretcher bearers to take one woman to the infirmary! Takahashi out!\"</p>\n<p>\"Lieutenant!\" A taller man was running towards them, huffing and puffing under the weight of several large nylon bags. He was closely followed by two paramedics, carrying a backboard, neck-brace and trauma kit.</p>\n<p>\"Roybal! Thank God you're here! What's the situation?\"</p>\n<p>\"The situation is fucked. Casualties are in double digits already. Someone let the goddamn Sharpie Ball out of its container and it rolled over an entire Task Force.\" He tossed one of the bags to the ground. \"We're not gonna be getting any backup.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, if it's just us, then we'll be just fine.\" Takahashi said. She unzipped the bag and pulled out a large weapon, that looked rather like a science fiction raygun. \"We're Feynman's Folly. We've trained for this scenario. This is what we do.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see\u2026 and off the record, sir?\"</p>\n<p>\"Off the record? We're up against a former member of Omega-7 in the body of a Keter-Class SCP.\" Takahashi snapped an energy pack into her HERF gun. \"We're fucked.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thought so,\" Roybal admitted.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They'd been moving through the corridors of the darkened hallway for fifteen minutes when Chang raised his hand, signalling the others to stop.</p>\n<p>Takahashi saw it a moment later: a hulking mass coiled up in the corner like a pile of steel spaghetti, slowly throbbing rhythmically, as if to a slow, gentle breathing. A claw reached out and touched the wall, tearing through the plaster drywall and etching away at the steel underneath. Already, a portion of the steel seemed to throb and dissolve, melting into another tentacle that incorporated itself into the mass.</p>\n<p>She unslung her weapon slowly, gestured to the other three members of her strike team. Firing line. Standard formation. Fire on my mark. The four soldiers slowly raised their weapons towards the creature.</p>\n<p>\"NOW!\"</p>\n<p>There was a low shriek, like a camera flash charging, except much, much louder, and then a loud crack of thunder as a blast of High Frequency Electromagnetic Radiation pulsed through the air, ionizing the atmosphere in its wake. Four pulses of crackling blue-white energy lanced into the mass of nanobots, tearing huge chunks out of the coiled steel tentacles.</p>\n<p>The monster let out a roar, and then it lunged, terrifyingly fast, crossing the thirty yards between it and the task force in a single leap. Chang went down first, crushed under the mass of steel, his broken body leaving a red smear as the thing rushed on, shrugging off HERF blast after HERF blast, the powerful energy pulses dealing damage, but not enough, not enough to stop the monster from forming a buzzing chainsaw out of one of its tentacles and using it to shear Vicks' hands off at the wrist before tearing into his guts, not fast enough to stop it from grabbing Roybal's ankle and pounding him against the ceiling until he stopped screaming and flailing and just made wet noises like a bag of cement, not enough to stop it from grabbing Takahashi around the throat and lifting her up into the air, choking the life out of the young woman.</p>\n<p>She felt her vision start to blur as her world began to go dark. Already, she could see the thing's nanomachines tearing the squad's weaponry apart, incorporating them into its own mass. As her vision swam and her consciousness left her, the last thing she heard was a voice, sneering and sinister, in her ear\u2026</p>\n<p><em>I always told you you lacked subtlety and grace.</em></p>\n<p>Takahashi had enough presence of mind to realize what that meant\u2026 and to spend her last life's breath screaming in horror and dismay.</p>\n<p>The last sound she'd make as a living creature.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ten minutes later, the woman that Thomas and the two paramedics had brought to the infirmary opened her eyes. She pulled the IVs out of her arm, cutting off the flow of painkillers (such a pain to bypass the morphine) and got to her feet.</p>\n<p>One of the medics tried to stop her, but she ignored him, walking through the halls of the infirmary to the third floor, to the place where she was trying to go. She placed her hand over the doorknob, and a thin tendril of nanomachines emerged from the back of her head, from the carefully hidden plate that she had disguised as a portion of skull, despite the fact that the entire back of the skull had been scooped out and the contents removed. The nanomachines broke through the lock in moments, and the one who wore Valentine's body entered the Intensive Care Quarantine unit.</p>\n<p>It made its way to the back of the facility, to a small bed in the back, where a young woman lay slumbering. It placed its hands over her face, and the tendrils extended, penetrated the back of the neck, probed delicately around the connections. Yes, just as it suspected. The injuries could easily be healed.</p>\n<p>The medic was shouting now, grabbing a phone and calling for help: the cries annoyed it, so it lathed a portion of steel piping, part of the bedframe, into a crude spear and threw it into the medic's throat. One by one, its nanomachines relaced the broken neurons back into place, carefully repaired the damage to its loved one's brain.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Agent Beatrix Maddox opened her eyes for the first time in months. \"What\u2026 who\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"It's me, B,\" Valentine's mouth whispered. \"I came for you.\"</p>\n<p>There was a gentle cough, as Clef cleared his throat. The Assistant Director stepped over the fallen body of the paramedic and faced the couple - one in an old body newly repaired, the other in a new body not its own - and smiled.</p>\n<p>\"Agent Andrews,\" he said. \"How nice of you to drop by.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/784incident6\">Part 6: Escape</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/784incident5\">The 784 Incident: Part 5: Breaking Point</a>\" by DrClef, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It was enough.</p>\n<p>Andrews-in-Valentine looked into the face of his own death, in the form of a HERF grenade held in the hand of the smiling Assistant Director. The object, a Foundation original, was a variation on the classic flash-bang grenade, specifically intended for use against electronic threats. Pull the pin, release the spoon, count to four, and a pulse of high frequency electromagnetic radiation would fire, destroying any circuitry more complex than a lightbulb and battery.</p>\n<p>Clef casually dangled the pin from his left finger as he held the grenade in his right hand, spoon still pressed inwards. Andrews lowered the second spear he had lathed from Maddox's bed frame. The point of the weapon gently touched the bloody tile floor, where the paramedic's blood slowly flowed towards him.</p>\n<p>\"You know,\" Clef said, idly, \"I always suspected that this entire facility was built on a slight slant. It always did make me feel off-balance.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you going to kill us?\" Maddox whispered. She was resting her head on Andrews' shoulder, body still weak from her long months spent comatose.

It was enough.\n\n\n\nAndrews-in-Valentine looked into the face of his own death, in the form of a HERF grenade held in the hand of the smiling Assistant Director. The object, a Foundation original, was a variation on the classic flash-bang grenade, specifically intended for use against electronic threats. Pull the pin, release the spoon, count to four, and a pulse of high frequency electromagnetic radiation would fire, destroying any circuitry more complex than a lightbulb and battery.\n\n\n\nClef casually dangled the pin from his left finger as he held the grenade in his right hand, spoon still pressed inwards. Andrews lowered the second spear he had lathed from Maddox's bed frame. The point of the weapon gently touched the bloody tile floor, where the paramedic's blood slowly flowed towards him.\n\n\n\n\"You know,\" Clef said, idly, \"I always suspected that this entire facility was built on a slight slant. It always did make me feel off-balance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you going to kill us?\" Maddox whispered. She was resting her head on Andrews' shoulder, body still weak from her long months spent comatose. A few bedsores were visible on her back, the open hospital gown framing the angry red friction uclers on her skin.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that depends,\" Clef said. \"I've already got two containment breaches in progress.

It extended its arms out and dropped the knife onto the ground. It closed its eyes and smiled as it walked down the dock towards where Beatrix Maddox lay dead on the cold, hard wood.</p>\n<p>The sniper's bullet pierced its skull just as it reached her, and it slumped down on top of her, arms outstretched, their two bodies laying on top of each other like two lovers embracing in their sleep.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>\u2026 in other news today, Italian police are investigating the murders of two American tourists in the Tuscany region.

The face that was not the one he'd been born with looked back.</p>\n<p>The man now known as Assistant Director Clef had accumulated many scars over a long career\u2026 a career built on lies and deceit. He ran a finger along his newest scar: a wide, deep gash across his belly, where Agent Andrews had delivered a final blow, one last Fuck You to the world before dying.</p>\n<p>Memories rose unbidden, the words whispered in the voice of Director Valentine, but the words, the intent, all Andrews'.</p>\n<p><em>\"You're not a soldier.

He checked the chamber. One bullet. That would be enough. The rest were gravy.</p>\n<p>He put the muzzle of the gun to his temple and closed his eyes.</p>\n<p>Click.</p>\n<p>He opened his eyes and smiled. \"It works better,\" he said to himself, \"when you take the safety off first.\"</p>\n<p>Then he picked up his can of shaving cream and straight razor and got to work shaving.

You'll be dead before you get two steps!\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't plan to. Because the truth is, Clef, I never wanted to. All I wanted to do is to tell you something. . . to tell you the truth.\" Andrews leaned down close, and the voice of Director Valentine whispered into Clef's ear.\n\n\n\nClef's face went pale, and he shuddered.\n\n\n\nThen Valentine's body stood and turned towards the lake. It extended its arms out and dropped the knife onto the ground. It closed its eyes and smiled as it walked down the dock towards where Beatrix Maddox lay dead on the cold, hard wood.\n\n\n\nThe sniper's bullet pierced its skull just as it reached her, and it slumped down on top of her, arms outstretched, their two bodies laying on top of each other like two lovers embracing in their sleep.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n//. . . in other news today, Italian police are investigating the murders of two American tourists in the Tuscany region. The motive is believed to be robbery. Residents of this peaceful town are horrified at these recent events, the first murders in over a century. . .//\n\n\n\n-----\n\nHe splashed water over his face and looked into the mirror. The face that was not the one he'd been born with looked back.\n\n\n\nThe man now known as Assistant Director Clef had accumulated many scars over a long career. . . a career built on lies and deceit. He ran a finger along his newest scar: a wide, deep gash across his belly, where Agent Andrews had delivered a final blow, one last Fuck You to the world before dying.\n\n\n\nMemories rose unbidden, the words whispered in the voice of Director Valentine, but the words, the intent, all Andrews'.\n\n\n\n//\"You're not a soldier. You're not a hero. You're not even a murderer. You're nothing but a bully. . . and SCPs are the nerdy kids who you like to beat up to hide the fact that you're nothing but a lonely, empty shell of a man.\"//\n\n\n\nHe picked up the handgun that was by his sink and removed the magazine. He checked the chamber. One bullet. That would be enough. The rest were gravy.\n\n\n\nHe put the muzzle of the gun to his temple and closed his eyes.\n\n\n\nClick.\n\n\n\nHe opened his eyes and smiled. \"It works better,\" he said to himself, \"when you take the safety off first.\"\n\n\n\nThen he picked up his can of shaving cream and straight razor and got to work shaving. He was extremely cautious handling the keen-edged blade. A man could kill himself like that, if he wasn't careful.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["784incident6", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "action", "bleak", "chase", "doctor-clef", "military-fiction", "tale"], "title": "The 784 Incident: Part 7: Conclusion - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/784incident7", "year": 2009}, "a-day-of-infamy": {"created_at": "2009-04-30T18:59:00", "creator": "Waxx", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Waxx", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/waxx", "comment": "", "date": "2009-04-30T18:59:00"}, {"author": "Waxx", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/waxx", "comment": "typos that I somehow missed.", "date": "2009-04-30T19:24:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "rating module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:57:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Today, however, he was simply trying to enjoy her loving stare, and attempted to push all confidence issues (that's what he thought was probably the real problem, a lack of self-esteem that made it hard to believe that anyone as gorgeous and intelligent as she would want to be with a slob like him) and just enjoy the dinner. The kindness emanating from Antoinette was directly counterbalanced by the sullen heat baking off his glaring son, a tiny Asian adopted boy glaring through a lock of black hair, which was why he was not all together saddened when his buzzer began beeping.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry Antoinette, it's a wonderful meal, but I have to go. Business at the base.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, but try to be back as early as possible,\" she said coyly and winked, and the boy made a rude gagging sound. He was furious at his son, who for the last couple years he become resentful for almost completely unexplainable reasons, but still a small smile played across his lips; yes, at least for tonight, he thought he could stop worrying about what he had done to deserve her.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"So what do we have here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Some kind of creature resembling, according to the eyewitness reports, a 'lizard hog with gigantic horns' was rampaging through the building, breaking through each room, really knocking down the walls themselves with its head.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" said Doctor Glut, not really listening. The event itself wasn't his line of work.</p>\n<p>They both walked quickly and surely through the motel, which was divided into smaller sections by hanging plastic sheets. Doctor Glut was a man in his fifties, with greasy black hair streaked with gray, and a lab coat that hung over his potbelly. As they moved towards the person he was supposed to deal with, Doctor Glut pulled on an extremely thick black leather glove that went up to his right elbow.</p>\n<p>He shoved aside the curtain and stepped into a tiny area framed by similar tarps. A light on a stand glared brightly at the man tied to a chair. Doctor Glut crouched and looked him in the eyes.</p>\n<p>\"What did you see?\"</p>\n<p>\"Some kind of monster. Look, <em>it bit a guys legs off,</em>\" he whispered empathetically, looking fearful and asking for sympathy from the Doctor through his eyes. Doctor Glut shook his head slightly, little more than a twitch, and then briskly moved to one of the tarps, holding it aside.</p>\n<p>\"What's behind this one?\"</p>\n<p>One of the soldiers, dressed in black and wearing a gas mask, replied, \"Well, when the site received structure damage, several walls separating rooms were knocked down. That hole leads into a bathroom.\"</p>\n<p>Doctor Glut grabbed the man, cut the ropes, and pulled him out of the chair, dragging him away.</p>\n<p>\"Sir, this is your work area. You're not supposed to leave it. We're really short on space.\"</p>\n<p>Doctor Glut disregarded him and turned sideways, working his way into the bathroom. Forcing the man to kneel, he plunged his face into the toilet with his leather-clad right arm. The man struggled, but Doctor Glut continued to force his head down as he gurgled, and choked, and struggled, flailing madly, drinking in the dirty water and screaming whenever his mouth left the surface for a few seconds. Doctor Glut pushed his hardest, holding him steadily under for a good amount of time, and then wrenched him out, the man's wet hair flinging around his terrified face.</p>\n<p>\"No, you saw nothing.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The sensory deprivation chamber was completely dark. It seemed to be a very large area, narrow but with a high ceiling like a chapel or tower, because when the door opened, a long thin crack of bright golden light appeared in front of the man. There was the sound of a scraping chair, and then the room became completely illuminated.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Jason,\" said Doctor Glut, staring intently at the man in front of him.</p>\n<p>The man, amazingly, smiled and piped up, almost perkily, \"So you guys are like the men in black or something? And now you're just going to delete my memories! I knew you guys and all that stuff was real. That's why I was watching the sky when it flashed on by.\"</p>\n<p>His stubbly face was actually grinning with awe, his fringe beliefs validated. \"Even though I won't recall any of this, it's still cool that I experienced it. So how are you going to do it? Like a flash of light or an injection or something?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm afraid not, Jason.\"</p>\n<p>Jason Strobixzek began to scream.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>There was the sound of bone hitting meat, thrashing, and someone yelling out and falling to the ground. The door opened and Doctor Glut walked out, massaging his hand, and adjusting the large ring with a sharp gaudy gemstone speckled with blood and pieces of a man's lips on it.</p>\n<p>\"What is William Gun's cover story that the guys created?\"</p>\n<p>\"He slipped and fell into a lake,\" said a specialist standing near by and watching the beating, \"And almost drowned. All he is to remember is thrashing and bobbling up and down. Nothing about the tentacles\u2026or the\u2026 mud creatures.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, well, I think you're going to have to modify it a little bit so he was thrown into the lake, Benjamin. Like a group of kids\u2026 beat him up or something\u2026\", he said, trailing off and crackling his knuckles nastily.</p>\n<p>One of the guards said, \"Administering a Class A Amnestic, Doc?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that's right.\" he said ruefully.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"So what, it's all a lie?\" asked Doctor Qalet, as they walked down the hallway to their prospective jobs.</p>\n<p>\"Look, no one knows everything. You probably have a secret about the Foundation's inner workings that I don't have, and I know stuff that would make your toes curl. It's just, no one can possess too much information. For their own safety. So we create these half-truths, to make things sound gentler, more humane. So people have pieces of the troubling stuff we do, but never the whole picture. They don't have to get their hands too dirty or feel too guilty. We divide the\u2026 the sin\u2026 amongst ourselves.\"</p>\n<p>\"I take it the injections are one of these 'half-truths.'\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, the mind\u2026 The mind is much more complicated then that. A simple syringe isn't the perfect solution. Okay, most of the amnestics in our possession can muddle the ability to form new memories and block out some of the more recent ones, true, so sometimes they're useful, but ninety percent of SCP-civilian contact is over a long-term time period. That's a fact. They don't just bump into them and then go about their merry way. We can deal with that type easily. But some objects become ingrained. Lives are changed by them, communities form around them, beliefs are created. How would a simple chemical choose which of these memories in a long chain of them to block? It's much too intricate and convoluted. So what we do is we sit down with them. Talk to them. And then we brainwash them\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Gulag style\u2026 Okay? We don't have the wonder drug. It's a myth to make scientists sleep better at night. So they can write it up in their reports, a shorthand term for a very long and arduous process. So they can order the torture and desecration of civilians without knowing that's exactly what they're doing. Just another part that's hidden, secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"What exactly is a Class A Amnestic, then?\"</p>\n<p>\"Class B and C are good for recent memories. Some times it can go without a hassle. But Class A\u2026 Class A does absolutely nothing. It's a mild sedative, Muhammad. That's all. A mild sedative that the scientists give them, that calms the people down. Its looks like they're forgetting, or emptied out, but they're just stoned for a couple seconds. But it makes the scientists feel better and they think that the civilians will get to continue their normal everyday lives soon. That it's all over for them. So they send them to us, thinking its just the tying up of a few loose ends, some paperwork to get written down, some orders to be looked over, finalized, and approved, not the beginning of the real process. But that's what it is. The start. Not the end, because its not just a one day thing, in and out. Sometimes they stay with us for months, years\u2026 The researchers and level four personnel think they're sending them to the exit, to be checked over, but really, we take them somewhere else\u2026 for a very long time.\"</p>\n<p>Muhammad Qalet was very quiet for the rest of the way down the hallway. They stopped by a thick metal door. \"Well here's my office\u2026 I have some business to do now.\" He cast his eyes down, and then looked up. \"I hope I haven't unnerved you too much\u2026 But you wanted to know. And I think you need to understand\u2026 It's just, we don't have the technology yet. When you analyze the problem, everything is so primitive in reality. Nothing's as advanced as we think it is. Consider a rocket ship. Sounds so futuristic, doesn't it? But it's just a metal tube with a silly ancient explosion that's been around for hundreds of years coming out of the bottom. Nothing special. Just like our methods. Not impressive at all. Not some highly ingenious pill or liquid\u2026 just a well aimed strike with a hammer to the forehead. \"</p>\n<p>With that he threw the hatch open and entered. His office was a small, dank, modern-day dungeon. An emaciated man was chained to the wall. \"Well hello there, Mr. Kynosiky! Have you come to the conclusion I arrived at yesterday? That you're insane? And imagined the whole thing?\"</p>\n<p>The starving bag of bones whispered, \"It's all very fuzzy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's a start! Come stand up. Get up, get up! We have some exercises to do.\"</p>\n<p>Doctor Qalet stared in horror and fought back the powerful urge to cry out in dismay. He fled the scene quickly, attempting to push it out of his consciousness. He succeeded, because sometimes you don't need strange scary men in black to wipe out memories with fire and heat and whips and mind games\u2026 Sometimes all that is necessary is a convenient lie or an overwhelming guilt complex that can't be solved.</p>\n<p>Sometimes forgetting is very easy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Doctor Glut produced a well-used handkerchief and wiped at her face. It was well-used, because frequently in his line of work he had to clean off spittle running down people's chins. A lot of his treatments tended to create drooling.</p>\n<p>He poked with the thin needle, which had a current of electricity running from the boxy machine down the wires attached.</p>\n<p>\"Cindy, you moved into the city when you were 22 years old. When you arrived you found a job as a cashier at a small grocery store.\"</p>\n<p>The women mumbled her agreeance groggily. \"That's right, isn't it. Now it says here you want to eventually make your way to California.\" He poked her again. She twitched slightly. \"Well guess what, that's exactly what your goal is. You're saving up money to become an actress! You'll probably have enough soon too.\" He picked up another pin and poked two at once. There was a crackling sound and a little bit of blood exploded on his face. \"Dammit, turn down the voltage, Jim.\" The man fiddled with a few dials and buttons, then picked up a large syringe with an extremely thick needle. \"Inject her in the left cortex.\" Jim didn't have to pierce bone, skin, drill a tiny hole, or go through her nose or back of the neck into the spine, because the top of Cindy's head had been sawed off and removed. Doctor Glut lifted up the electric pin again and poked at her slightly burnt frontal lobe.</p>\n<p>\"The only thing is\u2026 You can never visit your family again, Cindy. You got in a very big fight with them, okay?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Doctor Glut walked down the sidewalk, enjoying the fresh breeze, staring down at his boots and the cracks they moved over. He only barely noticed the bicyclist speeding his way, and threw himself to the side. The bicyclist, apparently distracted by something, skidded, and tipped over, moving a couple knee scratching, skin grinding feet before coming to a stop. \"Are you all right?\" Doctor Glut asked, but the man avoided his extended hand, and got up slowly, not looking in Glut's eyes, like he was in a daze. He got on his bike silently and sped away.</p>\n<p>To Ryan Glut he looked strangely familiar.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Doctor Glut entered the room to check up on Jason, to see how the process was working. The man's eyes spun madly in their sockets, he clawed at phantoms in the air, and screamed about incoherent colors. \"Well then, the mixture of LSD and other hallucinogens seem to be working fabulously,\" said the brainwasher to his colleague. \"It all fits together\u2026 Crazy guy living alone, believes in conspiracies, grows a little marijuana in his basement, wears tie die shirts\u2026 And then, one day, he overdoses on drugs and runs through town screaming about a gigantic plane covered with feathers in the sky. What else are people going to think?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can we purge his system then?\"</p>\n<p>\"No\u2026 other people may not believe him but that's not good enough. By the time we're done with him he wouldn't believe himself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because he can't, he wouldn't be able to. We'll have destroyed his mind. You know, when we're finished. When we're done, even without the acid in his system, he'll do nothing but gibble and garble. It's truly going to be one bad trip\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Increase the dosage.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you sure?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes\u2026 positive. Drop it in liquid form directly into his eyes. And for god sakes make sure the restraints are tight. Jessica still has claw marks on her cheeks. And when you're finished\u2026.\"</p>\n<p>He peeked halfway out of the door. \"Strip him down and put him in the woods near his hometown.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Would you like anything?\" the girl at the register said as she scanned the last object, a carton of eggs, and began blowing a bright pink bubble of gum. \"No, that will be all, thank you.\" He looked up from his wallet and handed her his card. The desert town was partially structured around the military base, so Foundation credit got him a discount here. \"Wait\u2026 You remind me of someone. Have we met before?\" he asked, smiling, casual. Her response was odd: she averted her gaze and looked away. \"No,\" she said, almost whimpering. \"Are you sure\u2026? I mean I'm just struck by the most powerful sense of deja vu\u2026\" He trailed off. She still didn't change her odd behavior. \"Okay,\" He picked up the two brown paper bags. \"Well, I just thought\u2026 You know, maybe you have a sister or something?\" he said awkwardly, and then left without waiting for her to answer the question.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day he was very troubled.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Why did this happen to me?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Sometime the world gets a little weird for no reason. People occasionally\u2026 just fall through the cracks of reality, of society, and strange things happen for no reason\u2026 It can't be helped.\"</p>\n<p>He allowed himself a moment of weakness and patted the man on the arm. \"Can\u2026 you hold my hand\u2026\" the man said with tears in his eyes, \"While you guys do whatever you're going to do. Or just talk to me. And have a conversation.\"</p>\n<p>Doctor Glut blinked. \"I'm scared,\" the man said.</p>\n<p>\"No\u2026 I can't\u2026 We can't talk.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"You'll bite your tongue off,\" he said and then leaned forward and put the block of wood between the man's teeth.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>All the faces were a blur, all causing the same sense of deja vu. They all danced with memories just behind his recollection. And he swore they all had the same shadow of recognition behind their vacant dead eyes. Speaking of which\u2026when had people become so zombie-like lately? Had he missed something? Now it seemed everyone around him was staring off into space, walking and jerking like automatons, or speaking in emotionless monotones. Going about the motions. Not living life\u2026 Or was he just being critical? Was there something wrong with the economy, something that caused a lot of stress or worry or something? He worked in the government sector\u2026 So\u2026 He truly realized just how isolated he was from popular culture. There could be some phenomenon that just recently starting affecting these people, but he wouldn't know. It would never affect him. He looked around on the small downtown street and saw only blank expressionless masks. That still caused something to go off in his brain.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A man walked in front of Ryan on accident. They struggled foolishly, he would go one way, and so would Glut. Back and forth, both trying to get by, Doctor Glut with a silly grin on his face. When they finally worked it out, (Glut had to lightly put his hands on the man's shoulders) Glut's smile at the absurdity of it faded\u2026 The man had almost been in tears.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Regaski's teacher had called him in; the boy was misbehaving in class, acting up, getting in fights, and not doing his homework. The teacher, an intelligent, slim-looking black man, seemed disconnected through the whole interview, and finally ushered him out of his office without anything really being solved.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He noticed a lot of people made mistakes around him. Little slips in grammar or syntax\u2026 Almost as if they were nervous. Some even subconsciously slipped into old accents or languages.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He was almost sure he had spent a lot of time with this one sexy looking number in a jogging suit, running down the trail. He stopped her and she looked ready to bolt, her entire body stiff and erect. He asked if they went to high school or grew up in the same town or maybe even if she was a maintenance worker at the base or something. She chatted pleasantly but in a detached and halting manner with him as long as he wanted\u2026 But he got nothing\u2026 And when she left he had noticed a few drops of blood on the ground. She had been clenching his hands together so tightly she had punctured the skin with her long painted nails.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>25 years earlier</strong></p>\n<p>A much younger Doctor Glut, with longer pure black hair and a slightly oily face, with a splash of remaining acne held his hand gently to the pretty girl's chin, feeling her smooth pale skin and forcing her to look at him. She had green eyes and straight strawberry blond hair, and was like a skittish little animal. His eyes moved over her childish body somewhat lecherously. There was something horribly perverse about the scene.</p>\n<p>Her eyes were solemn.</p>\n<p>\"Just repeat after me and everything will be fine.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A contraption was drilled on his head, a miniature portable MRI, that swirled and beeped around his skull. Doctor Glut glanced at the screen showing the brain illuminated with different colors.</p>\n<p>\"Now, Chris, pick up the phone.\" Speaking through a microphone.</p>\n<p>Chris slowly picked up the phone and said in a drugged voice, \"Hello?\"</p>\n<p>An insanely happy tone came out of the other end and said, \"Mr. Black, you've been hired. You'll need to pack up your bags and move immediately. We have a great future ahead of you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>A part of the brain turned bright red. Glut pushed the button, and the machine began to spin faster and then zapped it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Extract from the The Handbook of Black Ops Mental Conditioning 1992 Second Edition, Written in Part by Doctor Glut, Doctor Synclaire, and Doctor Smithchrist</strong></p>\n<p><em>Much like in psychology, when a patient can develop strong displaced feeling for his counselor, a civilian can achieve a strong bond as well, in a much shorter time, due to the fact that we control their food, water, and interaction. As an infant is dependent on its mother, the patient is dependent on us. The shattering of the ego and the complete mastery over all their necessities sometimes means that the new personality can form around the brainwasher. Often in this view, the conditioned will hold the manager of the procedure in awe, and subconsciously elevate them to a godlike level. Now this can take the form of extreme sexual attraction, grudging respect that turns into worship, and even a puppy like cringing and urge to please, which is of course initially faked but becomes real over time. Of course, such sentiments can also go in the opposite direction\u2026.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Thanks for the paper, Jase.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey no problem Mr. Glut!\" said the retarded man, grinning stupidly like a dog at the compliment. Jason had been delivering papers for years and on this fine day when Ryan mowed his lawn and his neighbor, the gaunt Mr. Kynosiky chattered amiably but distractedly as he hosed his flowers, Ryan felt he deserved to have it mentioned. Deserved his loyalty to be remarked upon.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a cold chill shot down his spine. It wasn't the fine mist of the hose that Mr. Kynosiky had accidentally aimed his way (god couldn't that man focus a little, he never seemed to have his head on straight) or the sudden gust of wind that made a couple of the papers in Jason's bag rustle away (he didn't bother chasing after them; the boy was really simple, he would have had a hell of time running after one little sheet and probably get hit by a truck, so why bother) but the thought that hit him in an instant. \"Oh god, not him too.\"</p>\n<p>Ryan felt very dizzy and went inside. That night he loaded his revolver, although he didn't quite know why.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When there was a crashing sound downstairs around 4:00 a.m, Glut jumped up immediately and grabbed the gun from under his pillow. He was ready for this; he wanted something. Something to rage at, something visible and tangible to fight, not this vague sense of creeping unease he had been dealing with. He ran downstairs, spinning the chamber aggressively, flicked the light, and exploded vengefully on his dew-wet lawn. It was only kids, and he lowered his gun disappointedly. He didn't even bother to shout them away.</p>\n<p>Three of them sprinted away, some laughing mischievously, some frightened out of their wits and afraid that they were going to go to jail forever for throwing a rock through his window, but one collapsed to the ground at the sight of him, framed in the porch glow, and began twitching, having a seizure. Glut shoved the pistol inside his pajama pants waistline and ran towards the boy. The little child was frothing at his mouth and his limbs were jerking spasmodically. Glut ran with him inside and laid him on a counter, the tiny body bouncing up and down dangerously. He reached to call an ambulance, and then it echoed in his mind:</p>\n<p><em>\"If you ever think about what happened on September 15 again, you will fall to the ground. You will jerk and twitch. You will die. It hurts so much. It pains you to remember.\"</em></p>\n<p>The urge to reach the hospital was gone. Instead he called Line 5.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Doctor Glut meandered without reason in the center of the small shopping mall, bored and looking for something to do to pass the time while he was on leave. If a workaholic felt purpose and fulfillment only at his normal job, and was considered slightly disturbed or wrong because of this, what would that make him; he who was workaholic at an abnormal job, who only found fulfillment while operating racks and damaging minds. A sadist? Would he seem a complete monster in comparison? Or was it all the same, a driven man was a driven man regardless of his job; the difference in work had absolutely no bearing on the final viewpoint and judgment of him, at least in that respect. Everyone had to do something after all. Glut thought about this philosophical question as he browsed halfheartedly for a gift for his wife. He really had nothing better to think about\u2026 And maybe because of this lack of turbulence or occupying problem on his mind, maybe because of the relative dullness of the environment he was in, or maybe just because enough time had passed for it to click, he saw it. The pieces of the puzzle came together. And it drove him mad.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he whispered, realizing the terrible and unexplainable pattern.</p>\n<p>The man over there trying on coats; he had only to restrict food and keep him in solitary confinement before he developed Stockholm Syndrome and became easily pliable. The old lady by the decrepit mini-golf course, he had to break almost every bone in her body. She was a stubborn bitch, refusing to give up her beliefs. The younger chap down by the food court had been so disturbed when Glut walked in, showed him the report that proved what he saw was true, agreed with his story, and then shoved it in a small slot and burned it. It bothered Glut too, that control of what was real or not. He had got it from 1984 and instilled the mechanism that next day after reading it. It was one of his most effective techniques. The hunched broken looking lady with stringy hair\u2026 oh god\u2026 He had destroyed her slowly, formerly a proud sensual older woman, with insults and tricks and false compliments. Everyone in the mall, at one point in his life, was someone he had brainwashed. Oh god. Oh god! Everyone in the entire town too?! Could it be possible? He thought so\u2026 After all, he was a man at the top of his profession\u2026 He must have worked on thousands. More than enough to fill a small town in the middle of nowhere. Day in and day out, laboring endlessly. And no wonder he didn't realize it right away, with so many successes how could he remember each face? They trickled in anyways, one by one, blending in\u2026 It didn't spring on him all at once.</p>\n<p>He was now running, frantically, wildly, towards the entrance of the store. He burst out and tripped over a curb, falling to the ground, splayed out and moaning. They gathered around him but no one helped. He realized now why he could never connect with anyone, why he had no friends. They weren't really there, the people around him. He had shattered them. They were missing something, and he was the one who had stolen it.</p>\n<p>\"No!\" He gurgled and jumped up, sprinting to god-knows-where, just trying to outrun the thoughts that he knew deep down were true. But why? He asked in a shrieking voice. Why was this happening to him?! Some conspiracy, he thought, paranoia overwhelming him. The Foundation was trying to break him down, shun him out of his own department that he had helped create years ago. It was a power play, a gambit. But, no, that wasn't it. Impossible. It was too risky. Alter every single file so their cover stories all have them moving to his home town? Someone would notice that big of a change. And too dangerous. Their conditioning could break down. It was certainly already failing. The weird looks he got. The flashbacks he saw going on like movies behind their brows. The boy, oh god the boy. No, the Foundation wouldn't risk the possibility of having secrets escape, come to light, just to destroy him.</p>\n<p>It was some cosmic joke, he decided, madly, uncomprehending and fully understanding at the same time, realizing the basic inexplicability of it all and giving in. Random occurrence that happens from time to time. Bad luck my friend. Maybe there was some karma involved, some punishment, retribution for his years of darkness, an ironic hell, but he thought, as much as he could think at that point, that it was just some scrapping away of reason and cause and effect and the chaos that was the true world had seeped in, fucking up his life for absolutely no reason. It came back to him: <em>\"Sometimes people just fall through the cracks of reality,\"</em> he had said.</p>\n<p>And that's what he was sure had happened to him; the sane world just left him behind for no clear logical reason.</p>\n<p>The car screeched and hit him, sending him flying. He caught the eye of the driver - his body was probably still trying to deal with the massive amounts of hormones he had put in his bloodstream, and his arm looked bent and knobbly, had he broken it, he couldn't recall\u2026 And he saw it. He knew him. His pasty teenage face curdled in shock.</p>\n<p>He knew him.</p>\n<p>\"He sees me!\" Glut screamed in his head incoherently and began crawling, twisted leg behind him, snot and blood and tears running down his face. He finally realized where he was going. His home. His gorgeous, happy, peaceful tiny little home, with the kitchen where he and his wife read together and played games, the quiet study, seemingly entirely composed out of dark, supple, delicious-smelling leather, where dust became motes of light incarnate, the basketball court where he tried and tried again, a labor of love, to earn that suspicious boy's trust, the bedroom where he learned to be proud of his body as his aroused wife sprayed herself across him, erasing years of embarrassment and shame in one glorious moment, all the little niches and crannies, each one with an equal amount of comfort, safety and softness everywhere.</p>\n<p>He just wanted to go home.</p>\n<p>But there was a darker purpose as well. He had to see. He had to see if the last refuge, the sacred, had been infiltrated and sullied by the encroaching insanity. He stumbled through the door and collapsed onto the ground. His wife screamed and ran towards him, kneeling down and putting her arms around him frantically, asking in a panic, \"Whats wrong, Ryan?! Jesus! Ryan!\" Her voice was high and wavery.</p>\n<p>He turned his head away and buried it in her thick red locks, sobbing like a small child. He pushed his face further into the sweet smelling hair and clutched at her body in comfort.</p>\n<p><em>\"Please let this at least be pure. Let it be true. True love. I have\u2026 I have nothing else. If this is all an illusion, this marriage, this relationship, I will have nothing left.\"</em></p>\n<p>Nothing came to him for a moment, and he almost breathed a sigh of relief. But then it came back. Sure it took him a little longer\u2026 she was his first after all, but eventually it resurfaced.</p>\n<p>It came back and he was lost. Of course she loved him! How could she not? He was an imposing figure in her mind, an authoritative father god in the background of her every thought. He was terrible and majestic. No wonder she was always so amorous and horny around him. No wonder she always agreed with him and took his word as law. He wasn't a human to her, he was an archetype! He had mastered her as a child\u2026 Reduced her\u2026 Diminished this brilliant, gorgeous human who could have done something for the world. Destroyed her. She had left college for him, studying to be a lawyer, the moment they bumped into each other. Like she had been waiting for him her whole life. And she had\u2026 He had came to her, all-knowing as a little girl, and thirty years later he had reaped what he had sown.</p>\n<p>He bit a piece of his tongue off when he shouted in dismay. He pushed her away in disgust, but at himself or her he did not know. He staggered drunkenly, eyes huge and bloodshot, froth like a mad dog running down his face as he mumbled and screamed at himself, and he groped at his last chance for salvation. Or was he just uncovering the final revelation as soon as possible to make the destruction of his mind faster? Either way he had to know, empty cold curiosity overwhelmed him. He opened the safe and took out his son's adoption records. He had to know if he had raped his own child.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Glut, wearing an open throat shirt that flapped around him gently and a hat, stared into the rice fields as the ship glided across the top of the river. The long wooden vessel stopped rowing near a patch of mud and Glut got out, walking between reeds in the exotic locale. The agent nodded at him respectfully and said, \"I'm glad you could come.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"It's not a problem. I was in the neighborhood. What seems to be the situation?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Over here.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>They walked for a little bit through the tiny village and the agent said, \"A bunch of schoolchildren.

Too large an amount is needed. It could be deadly. So alternative methods are required.\" He said all this in a perfectly calm and reasonable voice.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"So what are you going to do then?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Don't worry Hans, he's an expert.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>The researcher looked confused. \"Like what?

Never trust your own mind. Question your thoughts, because they're always wrong!

It seemed to be a very large area, narrow but with a high ceiling like a chapel or tower, because when the door opened, a long thin crack of bright golden light appeared in front of the man.\u00a0\u00a0There was the sound of a scraping chair, and then the room became completely illuminated.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Jason,\" said Doctor Glut, staring intently at the man in front of him.\n\n\n\nThe man, amazingly, smiled and piped up, almost perkily, \"So you guys are like the men in black or something?\u00a0\u00a0And now you're just going to delete my memories! I knew you guys and all that stuff was real. That's why I was watching the sky when it flashed on by.\"\n\n\n\nHis stubbly face was actually grinning with awe, his fringe beliefs validated. \"Even though I won't recall any of this, it's still cool that I experienced it. So how are you going to do it?\u00a0\u00a0Like a flash of light or an injection or something?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Jason.\"\n\n\n\nJason Strobixzek began to scream.\n\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n\nThere was the sound of bone hitting meat, thrashing, and someone yelling out and falling to the ground.\u00a0\u00a0The door opened and Doctor Glut walked out, massaging his hand, and adjusting the large ring with a sharp gaudy gemstone speckled with blood and pieces of a man's lips on it.\n\n\n\n\"What is William Gun's cover story that the guys created?\"\n\n\n\n\"He slipped and fell into a lake,\" said a specialist standing near by and watching the beating, \"And almost drowned.\u00a0\u00a0All he is to remember is thrashing and bobbling up and down.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing about the tentacles...or the... mud creatures.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, well, I think you're going to have to modify it a little bit so he was thrown into the lake, Benjamin.\u00a0\u00a0Like a group of kids... beat him up or something...\", he said, trailing off and crackling his knuckles nastily.\n\n\n\nOne of the guards said, \"Administering a Class A Amnestic, Doc?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" he said ruefully.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n\"So what, it's all a lie?\" asked Doctor Qalet, as they walked down the hallway to their prospective jobs.\n\n\n\n\"Look, no one knows everything. You probably have a secret about the Foundation's inner workings that I don't have, and I know stuff that would make your toes curl.\u00a0\u00a0It's just, no one can possess too much information.\u00a0\u00a0For their own safety.\u00a0\u00a0So we create these half-truths, to make things sound gentler, more humane.\u00a0\u00a0So people have pieces of the troubling stuff we do, but never the whole picture.\u00a0\u00a0They don't have to get their hands too dirty or feel too guilty.\u00a0\u00a0We divide the... the sin... amongst ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\"I take it the injections are one of these 'half-truths.'\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, the mind...\u00a0\u00a0The mind is much more complicated then that.\u00a0\u00a0A simple syringe isn't the perfect solution.\u00a0\u00a0Okay, most of the amnestics in our possession can muddle the ability to form new memories and block out some of the more recent ones, true, so sometimes they're useful, but ninety percent of SCP-civilian contact is over a long-term time period.\u00a0\u00a0That's a fact.\u00a0\u00a0They don't just bump into them and then go about their merry way.\u00a0\u00a0We can deal with that type easily.\u00a0\u00a0But some objects become ingrained.\u00a0\u00a0Lives are changed by them, communities form around them, beliefs are created.\u00a0\u00a0How would a simple chemical choose which of these memories in a long chain of them to block?\u00a0\u00a0It's much too intricate and convoluted.\u00a0\u00a0So what we do is we sit down with them.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to them.\u00a0\u00a0And then we brainwash them...\n\n\n\n\"Gulag style... Okay?\u00a0\u00a0We don't have the wonder drug.\u00a0\u00a0It's a myth to make scientists sleep better at night.\u00a0\u00a0So they can write it up in their reports, a shorthand term for a very long and arduous process.\u00a0\u00a0So they can order the torture and desecration of civilians without knowing that's exactly what they're doing.\u00a0\u00a0Just another part that's hidden, secret.\"\n\n\n\n\"What exactly is a Class A Amnestic, then?\"\n\n\n\n\"Class B and C are good for recent memories. Some times it can go without a hassle.\u00a0\u00a0But Class A... Class A does absolutely nothing.\u00a0\u00a0It's a mild sedative, Muhammad.\u00a0\u00a0That's all.\u00a0\u00a0A mild sedative that the scientists give them, that calms the people down.\u00a0\u00a0Its looks like they're forgetting, or emptied out, but they're just stoned for a couple seconds.\u00a0\u00a0But it makes the scientists feel better and they think that the civilians will get to continue their normal everyday lives soon.\u00a0\u00a0That it's all over for them.\u00a0\u00a0So they send them to us, thinking its just the tying up of a few loose ends, some paperwork to get written down, some orders to be looked over, finalized, and approved, not the beginning of the real process.\u00a0\u00a0But that's what it is.\u00a0\u00a0The start.\u00a0\u00a0Not the end, because its not just a one day thing, in and out. Sometimes they stay with us for months, years...\u00a0\u00a0The researchers and level four personnel think they're sending them to the exit, to be checked over, but really, we take them somewhere else... for a very long time.\"\n\n\n\nMuhammad Qalet was very quiet for the rest of the way down the hallway.\u00a0\u00a0They stopped by a thick metal door.\u00a0\u00a0\"Well here's my office... I have some business to do now.\"\u00a0\u00a0He cast his eyes down, and then looked up.\u00a0\u00a0\"I hope I haven't unnerved you too much... But you wanted to know.\u00a0\u00a0And I think you need to understand...\u00a0\u00a0It's just, we don't have the technology yet.\u00a0\u00a0When you analyze the problem, everything is so primitive in reality.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing's as advanced as we think it is.\u00a0\u00a0Consider a rocket ship.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds so futuristic, doesn't it?\u00a0\u00a0But it's just a metal tube with a silly ancient explosion that's been around for hundreds of years coming out of the bottom.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing special.\u00a0\u00a0Just like our methods.\u00a0\u00a0Not impressive at all.\u00a0\u00a0Not some highly ingenious pill or liquid... just a well aimed strike with a hammer to the forehead.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"\n\n\n\nWith that he threw the hatch open and entered.\u00a0\u00a0His office was a small, dank, modern-day dungeon.\u00a0\u00a0An emaciated man was chained to the wall.\u00a0\u00a0\"Well hello there, Mr. Kynosiky!\u00a0\u00a0Have you come to the conclusion I arrived at yesterday?\u00a0\u00a0That you're insane?\u00a0\u00a0And imagined the whole thing?\"\n\n\n\nThe starving bag of bones whispered, \"It's all very fuzzy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's a start!\u00a0\u00a0Come stand up.\u00a0\u00a0Get up, get up! We have some exercises to do.\"\n\n\n\nDoctor Qalet stared in horror and fought back the powerful urge to cry out in dismay.\u00a0\u00a0He fled the scene quickly, attempting to push it out of his consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0He succeeded, because sometimes you don't need strange scary men in black to wipe out memories with fire and heat and whips and mind games... Sometimes all that is necessary is a convenient lie or an overwhelming guilt complex that can't be solved.\n\n\n\nSometimes forgetting is very easy.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Glut produced a well-used handkerchief and wiped at her face.\u00a0\u00a0It was well-used, because frequently in his line of work he had to clean off spittle running down people's chins.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of his treatments tended to create drooling.\n\n\n\nHe poked with the thin needle, which had a current of electricity running from the boxy machine down the wires attached.\n\n\n\n\"Cindy, you moved into the city when you were 22 years old.\u00a0\u00a0When you arrived you found a job as a cashier at a small grocery store.\"\n\n\n\nThe women mumbled her agreeance groggily.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's right, isn't it.\u00a0\u00a0Now it says here you want to eventually make your way to California.\"\u00a0\u00a0He poked her again.\u00a0\u00a0She twitched slightly.\u00a0\u00a0\"Well guess what, that's exactly what your goal is.\u00a0\u00a0You're saving up money to become an actress!\u00a0\u00a0You'll probably have enough soon too.\"\u00a0\u00a0He picked up another pin and poked two at once.\u00a0\u00a0There was a crackling sound and a little bit of blood exploded on his face.\u00a0\u00a0\"Dammit, turn down the voltage, Jim.\"\u00a0\u00a0The man fiddled with a few dials and buttons, then picked up a large syringe with an extremely thick needle.\u00a0\u00a0\"Inject her in the left cortex.\"\u00a0\u00a0Jim didn't have to pierce bone, skin, drill a tiny hole, or go through her nose or back of the neck into the spine, because the top of Cindy's head had been sawed off and removed.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Glut lifted up the electric pin again and poked at her slightly burnt frontal lobe.\n\n\n\n\"The only thing is... You can never visit your family again, Cindy.\u00a0\u00a0You got in a very big fight with them, okay?\"\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDoctor Glut walked down the sidewalk, enjoying the fresh breeze, staring down at his boots and the cracks they moved over.\u00a0\u00a0He only barely noticed the bicyclist speeding his way, and threw himself to the side.\u00a0\u00a0The bicyclist, apparently distracted by something, skidded, and tipped over, moving a couple knee scratching, skin grinding feet before coming to a stop. \"Are you all right?\"\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Glut asked, but the man avoided his extended hand, and got up slowly, not looking in Glut's eyes, like he was in a daze.\u00a0\u00a0He got on his bike silently and sped away.\n\n\n\nTo Ryan Glut he looked strangely familiar.\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\nDoctor Glut entered the room to check up on Jason, to see how the process was working.\u00a0\u00a0The man's eyes spun madly in their sockets, he clawed at phantoms in the air, and screamed about incoherent colors.\u00a0\u00a0\"Well then, the mixture of LSD and other hallucinogens seem to be working fabulously,\" said the brainwasher to his colleague.\u00a0\u00a0\"It all fits together...\u00a0\u00a0Crazy guy living alone, believes in conspiracies, grows a little marijuana in his basement, wears tie die shirts...\u00a0\u00a0And then, one day, he overdoses on drugs and runs through town screaming about a gigantic plane covered with feathers in the sky.\u00a0\u00a0What else are people going to think?\"\n\n\n\n\"Can we purge his system then?\"\n\n\n\n\"No... other people may not believe him but that's not good enough.\u00a0\u00a0By the time we're done with him he wouldn't believe himself.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because he can't, he wouldn't be able to. We'll have destroyed his mind.\u00a0\u00a0You know, when we're finished. When we're done, even without the acid in his system, he'll do nothing but gibble and garble. It's truly going to be one bad trip...\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Increase the dosage.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes... positive.\u00a0\u00a0Drop it in liquid form directly into his eyes.\u00a0\u00a0And for god sakes make sure the restraints are tight.\u00a0\u00a0Jessica still has claw marks on her cheeks.\u00a0\u00a0And when you're finished....\"\n\n\n\nHe peeked halfway out of the door. \"Strip him down and put him in the woods near his hometown.\"\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\n\n\"Would you like anything?\" the girl at the register said as she scanned the last object, a carton of eggs, and began blowing a bright pink bubble of gum.\u00a0\u00a0\"No, that will be all, thank you.\"\u00a0\u00a0He looked up from his wallet and handed her his card.\u00a0\u00a0The desert town was partially structured around the military base, so Foundation credit got him a discount here.\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait... You remind me of someone.\u00a0\u00a0Have we met before?\" he asked, smiling, casual.\u00a0\u00a0Her response was odd: she averted her gaze and looked away.\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" she said, almost whimpering.\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you sure...? I mean I'm just struck by the most powerful sense of deja vu...\" He trailed off.\u00a0\u00a0She still didn't change her odd behavior.\u00a0\u00a0\"Okay,\" He picked up the two brown paper bags. \"Well, I just thought... You know, maybe you have a sister or something?\" he said awkwardly, and then left without waiting for her to answer the question.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the day he was very troubled.\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\n\"Why did this happen to me?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes bad things happen to good people.\u00a0\u00a0Sometime the world gets a little weird for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0People occasionally... just fall through the cracks of reality, of society, and strange things happen for no reason...\u00a0\u00a0It can't be helped.\"\n\n\n\nHe allowed himself a moment of weakness and patted the man on the arm.\u00a0\u00a0\"Can... you hold my hand...\" the man said with tears in his eyes, \"While you guys do whatever you're going to do.\u00a0\u00a0Or just talk to me.\u00a0\u00a0And have a conversation.\"\n\n\n\nDoctor Glut blinked.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm scared,\" the man said.\n\n\n\n\"No... I can't...\u00a0\u00a0We can't talk.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"You'll bite your tongue off,\" he said and then leaned forward and put the block of wood between the man's teeth.\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\nAll the faces were a blur, all causing the same sense of deja vu.\u00a0\u00a0They all danced with memories just behind his recollection.\u00a0\u00a0And he swore they all had the same shadow of recognition behind their vacant dead eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of which...when had people become so zombie-like lately?\u00a0\u00a0Had he missed something? Now it seemed everyone around him was staring off into space, walking and jerking like automatons, or speaking in emotionless monotones.\u00a0\u00a0Going about the motions.\u00a0\u00a0Not living life... Or was he just being critical?\u00a0\u00a0Was there something wrong with the economy, something that caused a lot of stress or worry or something? He worked in the government sector... So... He truly realized just how isolated he was from popular culture.\u00a0\u00a0There could be some phenomenon that just recently starting affecting these people, but he wouldn't know.\u00a0\u00a0It would never affect him. He looked around on the small downtown street and saw only blank expressionless masks.\u00a0\u00a0That still caused something to go off in his brain.\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\nA man walked in front of Ryan on accident.\u00a0\u00a0They struggled foolishly, he would go one way, and so would Glut.\u00a0\u00a0Back and forth, both trying to get by, Doctor Glut with a silly grin on his face.\u00a0\u00a0When they finally worked it out, (Glut had to lightly put his hands on the man's shoulders) Glut's smile at the absurdity of it faded... The man had almost been in tears.\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\nRegaski's teacher had called him in; the boy was misbehaving in class, acting up, getting in fights, and not doing his homework.\u00a0\u00a0The teacher, an intelligent, slim-looking black man, seemed disconnected through the whole interview, and finally ushered him out of his office without anything really being solved.\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nHe noticed a lot of people made mistakes around him.\u00a0\u00a0Little slips in grammar or syntax... Almost as if they were nervous.\u00a0\u00a0Some even subconsciously slipped into old accents or languages.\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\nHe was almost sure he had spent a lot of time with this one sexy looking number in a jogging suit, running down the trail.\u00a0\u00a0He stopped her and she looked ready to bolt, her entire body stiff and erect.\u00a0\u00a0He asked if they went to high school or grew up in the same town or maybe even if she was a maintenance worker at the base or something.\u00a0\u00a0She chatted pleasantly but in a detached and halting manner with him as long as he wanted... But he got nothing... And when she left he had noticed a few drops of blood on the ground.\u00a0\u00a0She had been clenching his hands together so tightly she had punctured the skin with her long painted nails.\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\n**25 years earlier**\n\n\n\nA much younger Doctor Glut, with longer pure black hair and a slightly oily face, with a splash of remaining acne held his hand gently to the pretty girl's chin, feeling her smooth pale skin and forcing her to look at him.\u00a0\u00a0She had green eyes and straight strawberry blond hair, and was like a skittish little animal.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes moved over her childish body somewhat lecherously.\u00a0\u00a0There was something horribly perverse about the scene.\n\n\n\nHer eyes were solemn.\n\n\n\n\"Just repeat after me and everything will be fine.\"\n\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n\nA contraption was drilled on his head, a miniature portable MRI, that swirled and beeped around his skull.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Glut glanced at the screen showing the brain illuminated with different colors.\n\n\n\n\"Now, Chris, pick up the phone.\" Speaking through a microphone.\n\n\n\nChris slowly picked up the phone and said in a drugged voice,\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello?\"\n\n\n\nAn insanely happy tone came out of the other end and said, \"Mr. Black, you've been hired.\u00a0\u00a0You'll need to pack up your bags and move immediately.\u00a0\u00a0We have a great future ahead of you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\nA part of the brain turned bright red.\u00a0\u00a0Glut pushed the button, and the machine began to spin faster and then zapped it.\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\n**Extract from the The Handbook of Black Ops Mental Conditioning 1992 Second Edition, Written in Part by Doctor Glut, Doctor Synclaire, and Doctor Smithchrist**\n\n\n\n//Much like in psychology, when a patient can develop strong displaced feeling for his counselor, a civilian can achieve a strong bond as well, in a much shorter time, due to the fact that we control their food, water, and interaction. As an infant is dependent on its mother, the patient is dependent on us.\u00a0\u00a0The shattering of the ego and the complete mastery over all their necessities sometimes means that the new personality can form around the brainwasher.\u00a0\u00a0Often in this view, the conditioned will hold the manager of the procedure in awe, and subconsciously elevate them to a godlike level.\u00a0\u00a0Now this can take the form of extreme sexual attraction, grudging respect that turns into worship, and even a puppy like cringing and urge to please, which is of course initially faked but becomes real over time. Of course, such sentiments can also go in the opposite direction....//\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\"Thanks for the paper, Jase.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Hey no problem Mr. Glut!\" said the retarded man, grinning stupidly like a dog at the compliment.\u00a0\u00a0Jason had been delivering papers for years and on this fine day when Ryan mowed his lawn and his neighbor, the gaunt Mr. Kynosiky chattered amiably but distractedly as he hosed his flowers, Ryan felt he deserved to have it mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Deserved his loyalty to be remarked upon.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a cold chill shot down his spine.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't the fine mist of the hose that Mr. Kynosiky had accidentally aimed his way (god couldn't that man focus a little, he never seemed to have his head on straight) or the sudden gust of wind that made a couple of the papers in Jason's bag rustle away (he didn't bother chasing after them; the boy was really simple, he would have had a hell of time running after one little sheet and probably get hit by a truck, so why bother) but the thought that hit him in an instant.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh god, not him too.\"\n\n\n\nRyan felt very dizzy and went inside.\u00a0\u00a0That night he loaded his revolver, although he didn't quite know why.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\nWhen there was a crashing sound downstairs around 4:00 a.m, Glut jumped up immediately and grabbed the gun from under his pillow.\u00a0\u00a0He was ready for this; he wanted something.\u00a0\u00a0Something to rage at, something visible and tangible to fight,\u00a0\u00a0not this vague sense of creeping unease he had been dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0He ran downstairs, spinning the chamber aggressively, flicked the light, and exploded vengefully on his dew-wet lawn.\u00a0\u00a0It was only kids, and he lowered his gun disappointedly.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't even bother to shout them away.\n\n\n\nThree of them sprinted away, some laughing mischievously, some frightened out of their wits and afraid that they were going to go to jail forever for throwing a rock through his window, but one collapsed to the ground at the sight of him, framed in the porch glow, and began twitching, having a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0Glut shoved the pistol inside his pajama pants waistline and ran towards the boy.\u00a0\u00a0The little child was frothing at his mouth and his limbs were jerking spasmodically.\u00a0\u00a0Glut ran with him inside and laid him on a counter, the tiny body bouncing up and down dangerously.\u00a0\u00a0He reached to call an ambulance, and then it echoed in his mind:\n\n\n\n//\"If you ever think about what happened on September 15 again, you will fall to the ground. You will jerk and twitch.\u00a0\u00a0You will die.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts so much.\u00a0\u00a0It pains you to remember.\"//\n\n\n\nThe urge to reach the hospital was gone. Instead he called Line 5.\n\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n\nDoctor Glut meandered without reason in the center of the small shopping mall, bored and looking for something to do to pass the time while he was on leave.\u00a0\u00a0If a workaholic felt purpose and fulfillment only at his normal job, and was considered slightly disturbed or wrong because of this, what would that make him; he who was workaholic at an abnormal job, who only found fulfillment while operating racks and damaging minds.\u00a0\u00a0A sadist?\u00a0\u00a0Would he seem a complete monster in comparison?\u00a0\u00a0Or was it all the same, a driven man was a driven man regardless of his job; the difference in work had absolutely no bearing on the final viewpoint and judgment of him, at least in that respect.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone had to do something after all.\u00a0\u00a0Glut thought about this philosophical question as he browsed halfheartedly for a gift for his wife.\u00a0\u00a0He really had nothing better to think about... And maybe because of this lack of turbulence or occupying problem on his mind, maybe because of the relative dullness of the environment he was in, or maybe just because enough time had passed for it to click, he saw it.\u00a0\u00a0The pieces of the puzzle came together.\u00a0\u00a0And it drove him mad.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" he whispered, realizing the terrible and unexplainable pattern.\n\n\n\nThe man over there trying on coats; he had only to restrict food and keep him in solitary confinement before he developed Stockholm Syndrome and became easily pliable.\u00a0\u00a0The old lady by the decrepit mini-golf course, he had to break almost every bone in her body.\u00a0\u00a0She was a stubborn bitch, refusing to give up her beliefs.\u00a0\u00a0The younger chap down by the food court had been so disturbed when Glut walked in, showed him the report that proved what he saw was true, agreed with his story, and then shoved it in a small slot and burned it.\u00a0\u00a0It bothered Glut too, that control of what was real or not.\u00a0\u00a0He had got it from 1984 and instilled the mechanism that next day after reading it. It was one of his most effective techniques. The hunched broken looking lady with stringy hair... oh god... He had destroyed her slowly, formerly a proud sensual older woman, with insults and tricks and false compliments.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone in the mall, at one point in his life, was someone he had brainwashed.\u00a0\u00a0Oh god.\u00a0\u00a0Oh god!\u00a0\u00a0Everyone in the entire town too?!\u00a0\u00a0Could it be possible? He thought so... After all, he was a man at the top of his profession... He must have worked on thousands. More than enough to fill a small town in the middle of nowhere. Day in and day out, laboring endlessly. And no wonder he didn't realize it right away, with so many successes how could he remember each face? They trickled in anyways, one by one, blending in... It didn't spring on him all at once.\n\n\n\nHe was now running, frantically, wildly, towards the entrance of the store. He burst out and tripped over a curb, falling to the ground, splayed out and moaning. They gathered around him but no one helped. He realized now why he could never connect with anyone, why he had no friends. They weren't really there, the people around him. He had shattered them. They were missing something, and he was the one who had stolen it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"No!\" He gurgled and jumped up, sprinting to god-knows-where, just trying to outrun the thoughts that he knew deep down were true. But why? He asked in a shrieking voice. Why was this happening to him?! Some conspiracy, he thought, paranoia overwhelming him. The Foundation was trying to break him down, shun him out of his own department that he had helped create years ago.\u00a0\u00a0It was a power play, a gambit. But, no, that wasn't it. Impossible. It was too risky. Alter every single file so their cover stories all have them moving to his home town? Someone would notice that big of a change. And too dangerous. Their conditioning could break down. It was certainly already failing. The weird looks he got. The flashbacks he saw going on like movies behind their brows. The boy, oh god the boy. No, the Foundation wouldn't risk the possibility of having secrets escape, come to light, just to destroy him.\n\n\n\nIt was some cosmic joke, he decided, madly, uncomprehending and fully understanding at the same time, realizing the basic inexplicability of it all and giving in. Random occurrence that happens from time to time. Bad luck my friend. Maybe there was some karma involved, some punishment, retribution for his years of darkness, an ironic hell, but he thought, as much as he could think at that point, that it was just some scrapping away of reason and cause and effect and the chaos that was the true world had seeped in, fucking up his life for absolutely no reason. It came back to him: //\"Sometimes people just fall through the cracks of reality,\"// he had said.\n\n\n\nAnd that's what he was sure had happened to him; the sane world just left him behind for no clear logical reason.\n\n\n\nThe car screeched and hit him, sending him flying.\u00a0\u00a0He caught the eye of the driver - his body was probably still trying to deal with the massive amounts of hormones he had put in his bloodstream, and his arm looked bent and knobbly, had he broken it, he couldn't recall... And he saw it. He knew him. His pasty teenage face curdled in shock.\n\n\n\nHe knew him.\n\n\n\n\"He sees me!\" Glut screamed in his head incoherently and began crawling, twisted leg behind him, snot and blood and tears running down his face. He finally realized where he was going. His home. His gorgeous, happy, peaceful tiny little home, with the kitchen where he and his wife read together and played games, the quiet study, seemingly entirely composed out of dark, supple, delicious-smelling leather, where dust became motes of light incarnate, the basketball court where he tried and tried again, a labor of love, to earn that suspicious boy's trust, the bedroom where he learned to be proud of his body as his aroused wife sprayed herself across him, erasing years of embarrassment and shame in one glorious moment, all the little niches and crannies, each one with an equal amount of comfort, safety and softness everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe just wanted to go home.\n\n\n\nBut there was a darker purpose as well. He had to see. He had to see if the last refuge, the sacred, had been infiltrated and sullied by the encroaching insanity. He stumbled through the door and collapsed onto the ground. His wife screamed and ran towards him, kneeling down and putting her arms around him frantically, asking in a panic, \"Whats wrong, Ryan?! Jesus! Ryan!\" Her voice was high and wavery.\n\n\n\nHe turned his head away and buried it in her thick red locks, sobbing like a small child. He pushed his face further into the sweet smelling hair and clutched at her body in comfort. \n\n\n\n//\"Please let this at least be pure. Let it be true.\u00a0\u00a0True love. I have... I have nothing else. If this is all an illusion, this marriage, this relationship, I will have nothing left.\"//\n\n\n\nNothing came to him for a moment, and he almost breathed a sigh of relief. But then it came back. Sure it took him a little longer... she was his first after all, but eventually it resurfaced.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt came back and he was lost. Of course she loved him! How could she not? He was an imposing figure in her mind, an authoritative father god in the background of her every thought. He was terrible and majestic. No wonder she was always so amorous and horny around him. No wonder she always agreed with him and took his word as law.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't a human to her, he was an archetype!\u00a0\u00a0He had mastered her as a child... Reduced her... Diminished this brilliant, gorgeous human who could have done something for the world. Destroyed her. She had left college for him, studying to be a lawyer, the moment they bumped into each other. Like she had been waiting for him her whole life. And she had... He had came to her, all-knowing as a little girl, and thirty years later he had reaped what he had sown.\n\n\n\nHe bit a piece of his tongue off when he shouted in dismay. He pushed her away in disgust, but at himself or her he did not know. He staggered drunkenly, eyes huge and bloodshot, froth like a mad dog running down his face as he mumbled and screamed at himself, and he groped at his last chance for salvation. Or was he just uncovering the final revelation as soon as possible to make the destruction of his mind faster? Either way he had to know, empty cold curiosity overwhelmed him. He opened the safe and took out his son's adoption records. He had to know if he had raped his own child.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n//Glut, wearing an open throat shirt that flapped around him gently and a hat, stared into the rice fields as the ship glided across the top of the river. The long wooden vessel stopped rowing near a patch of mud and Glut got out, walking between reeds in the exotic locale. The agent nodded at him respectfully and said, \"I'm glad you could come.\"//\n\n\n\n//\"It's not a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I was in the neighborhood.\u00a0\u00a0What seems to be the situation?\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Over here.\"//\n\n\n\n//They walked for a little bit through the tiny village and the agent said, \"A bunch of schoolchildren. In that school house over there.\u00a0\u00a0They saw something they weren't suppose to.\u00a0\u00a0For the last couple weeks, their teacher has been showing them... Well...\u00a0\u00a0They call it magic.\"//\n\n\n\n//A scientist with goggles and a charred sleeve on his lab coat standing by a totem in the town square walked up to them. \"Why can't we just use a Class A Amnestic? I know we don't have any on us, but why did you cancel my order for a boxful to be delivered here, Kramar?\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Amnestics are notoriously unreliable,\" Agent Kramar said, sharing a private smirk with Doctor Glut.//\n\n\n\n//Doctor Glut attempted a more diplomatic approach, and rested his hand on the man's arm.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's unsafe to use Class A Amnestics on children.\u00a0\u00a0Too large an amount is needed. It could be deadly. So alternative methods are required.\" He said all this in a perfectly calm and reasonable voice.//\n\n\n\n//\"So what are you going to do then?\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Don't worry Hans, he's an expert.\"//\n\n\n\n//The researcher looked confused. \"Like what?\u00a0\u00a0He's a SCP that's working for us or something?\u00a0\u00a0Does he have powers... Or hypnosis eyes...\" He trailed off as they both left him behind.//\n\n\n\n//\"I hope this is all ethical!\" Hans said, calling after them.//\n\n\n\n//\"Goddammit,\" whispered the agent in a sneering voice, \"now because of him we're going to need to find a soundproof room.\"//\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\n//\"She was a witch. And she could conjure fireballs. And juggle them. It was amazing,\" said the boy, a shaven head rascal who looked like a miniature monk in his robes, unaware anything was wrong.//\n\n\n\n//\"Now, little one... Children... Children have active imaginations. You fantasize about things.\u00a0\u00a0You're notoriously unreliable. You can't trust yourself, okay. You have to only believe in what I say.\"//\n\n\n\n//\"I know what I saw, I say-\"//\n\n\n\n//Glut slapped him across the face. \"Who's the adult here? Children are stupid! Children are silly.\u00a0\u00a0You are a baby. You make up games and they become too real and then you start believing in them. You were playing and it got out of hand.\u00a0\u00a0Don't trust yourself. Never trust your own mind.\u00a0\u00a0Question your thoughts, because they're always wrong! You're always wrong!\"//\n\n\n\n//It had begun.//\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\nWhen he came to from the blackout, his worried and frightened wife holding onto him tightly, cradling up his torso as he laid sprawled on the tiles, he was still laughing. A few seconds later he realized he couldn't stop.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["prev", "next", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_adult", "_licensebox", "bleak", "horror", "psychological-horror", "tale"], "title": "A Man At the Top of His Profession - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-man-at-the-top-of-his-profession", "year": 2009}, "agent-apocalemur-s-journal": {"created_at": "2009-04-02T05:36:00", "creator": "apocalemur", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "apocalemur", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/apocalemur", "comment": "", "date": "2009-04-02T05:36:00"}, {"author": "apocalemur", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/apocalemur", "comment": "", "date": "2009-04-04T22:29:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Maybe I should have stayed in bed. When I got outside, it was growing onto the branch that the robins were nesting in. It grew right up to the nest. When it touched the robin in the nest, it stopped growing. A few seconds later, the robin fell to the ground, dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 200\u2588<br/>\nI called in sick to work today.

I saw it growing.\u00a0\u00a0It was growing up the side of the tree so quickly, I could see it. Yesterday, it was just a little sprig. That's some plant.\n\n> \n\n> It also looks like there's a pair of robins making a nest in that tree.\n\n\n\n> \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 200\u2588\n\n> I got up early to get a look at that plant.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should have stayed in bed. When I got outside, it was growing onto the branch that the robins were nesting in. It grew right up to the nest. When it touched the robin in the nest, it stopped growing. A few seconds later, the robin fell to the ground, dead.\n\n\n\n> \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 200\u2588\n\n> I called in sick to work today.\u00a0\u00a0I had to call in sick, because they never would have believed me if I said I had been chased away from my car by a purple vine that was growing out of the eyes of a dead bird.\u00a0\u00a0The ivy looked like it was growing towards me, and I wasn\u2019t taking any chances.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn\u2019t about to end up like that robin.\n\n\n\n> \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 200\u2588\n\n> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is dead.\u00a0\u00a0My only sister\u2026dead.

While Task Force members are usually culled from the best special forces units from around the world and are given the latest and most advanced equipment, their duties are usually restricted to SCP protection and surveillance, which seems to be a tragic waste of resources and talent. This can mostly be blamed on the fact that the formation of Task Forces are usually reactionary measures to the unpredictable nature of SCPs.</p>\n<p>Agents, on the other hand, are largely derived from civilian sources such as local and federal law enforcement agencies. They are often similarly equipped, but are given the actual duty of tracking down and recovering SCPs. While the vast majority of SCPs are rather harmless and can easily be dealt with by Agents, there is currently no viable way under the current system for first responder Agents to deal with violent or unpredictable SCPs, or rival SCP seeking organizations. Mobile Task Force Delta-7 is an exception, but as we all know, they are currently committed to tracking ORIA agents and lack the flexibility or resources to expand their mission profile.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the Foundation lacks an actual offensive military option. While the Foundation has been able to carry on this far by co-opting government resources and forming Task Forces in times of emergency, the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifact's theft of SCP-112 and threats of an impending attack by the Church of the Broken God reveal the need for a cohesive, elite offensive military unit more than ever before.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> My solution to this problem is to form a brand new Task Force that will not be tied to a singular Site or SCP. Instead, this Task Force will perform the dual role of first response and hostile recovery of SCPs. This should serve as a suitable counter to outside threats, as well as giving the Foundation a means to directly recover SCPs from rival organizations. They will also serve as primary offensive support for Field Agents to reduce reliance on local law enforcement.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> I must admit though, the formation of a brand new Task Force is a decision not taken lightly. Also, due to the nature of their duties, the initial casualty rates of this new Task Force are expected to be extremely high, with an estimation of 70% losses after the first ten missions. This is why I am only requesting personnel who fit the following criteria:</p>\n<p>*Current Task Force members and Agents facing disciplinary action that can/will result in demotion to D-class, transfer to Keter duty, or termination.<br/>\n*Prospective Task Force and Agent applicants with questionable pasts or qualifications.<br/>\n*D-Class personnel who have proven themselves to possess exceptional skill or abilities.<br/>\n*Remnants of Task Forces that have suffered high casualties and now face disbandment.<br/>\n*Any personnel with practical skills that Foundation supervisors feel like getting rid of.</p>\n<p>It is of my opinion that some these personnel are not useless, and may in fact still prove quite useful to the Foundation if not for their unfortunate infractions. These personnel will of course undergo a rigorous screening process to weed out the promising ones from the dead weight.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I would like to hope that you are able to see the Foundation's glaring weaknesses as clearly as I have. I believe it is time for us to take a more aggressive approach to dealing with rival organizations.

Being an Agent is like playing Splinter Cell: maybe not the earlier games where you're a ninja sneaking through buildings alone, but Double Agent, where you also have to infiltrate organizations. You work alone. You gather information. You pursue objectives on your own initiative. When you find an SCP, you call in help, or if you think you can do it alone, retrieve it yourself.

Now you move in. No matter how subtle you are, people are going to remember six guys in black suits with submachine guns storming a building. So you minimize impact by being fast, violent, and hella aggressive. You're the hammer, the SCP is the nut.

They are not formed to CONTAIN specific SCPs. They are formed to EXPLOIT them: Pandora's Box with Able, Puddle Jumpers with the Wading Pool, Lotto Steppers (before his sad demise) with Stanley Cubic. Either that or they're experts in certain types of SCPs: Mole Rats train in specific techniques to navigate and escape from dimensional SCPs that alter local geography, for instance.</p>\n<p>Finally: under NO circumstances should the SCP Foundation create an offensive military force.

A researcher has been asking questions, and, worse, questioning Bright. And so it is that Dr. Jack Bright calls Dr. Heiden to his office, for some\u2026 discussion.</p>\n<p>Heiden is ushered into the room by an old man, the young doctor is clearly incredibly uneasy. \"\u2026Dr. Bright, you requested my presence?\"</p>\n<p>\"Heiden.\" Bright smiles lightly. \"Please, take a seat.\" Gesturing at the comfy looking chair across the desk from himself. Heiden takes a moment to look around the room uncomfortably before sitting in the chair.</p>\n<p>\"Hold on just a moment, please.\" Dr. Bright pulls out a small remote from his pocket and begins clicking buttons. The red lights on the cameras in the office go off, the door locks shut, and all other machines go dead. \"There. Much better.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden gulps nervously before saying \"\u2026yes, sir.\" Bright's actions did absolutely nothing to settle Frederick's raging nerves. Somehow he suspects that was intentional.</p>\n<p>\"Now then, there will be no recordings if you choose to be insubordinate. For the record, my cane is in the corner behind you, and my hands are empty. I am doing this in an attempt to provide an air of open conversation, that seems to be needed.\" He nods his head solemnly, before continuing. \"Now, it seems you may have some unresolved issues with me. Shall we discuss these?\"</p>\n<p>Heiden's mind races\u2026 but once again, honesty remains Frederick's policy. He takes a moment to compose himself before speaking. \"Yes, sir. On my first, ah, incident with the Foundation, I encountered SCP-963. It was used to subdue a prisoner, an armed android with which I am sure you are familiar.\"</p>\n<p>Bright nods his head. \"Sonia Velamour. She was 29, had no siblings, and her parents were deceased. She once loved a man, and he turned her into a cyborg. Yes, I am aware of her, go on.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden stares at Bright, taken aback by the information. \"\u2026 yes. I initially protested this action, but as it was undertaken in the heat of a combat situation, it is understandable that my protests were ignored. I inquired as to the nature of SCP-963, and was offered access to a redacted file containing a briefing on the object. I am an ethicist by vocation, Doctor Bright, though my - \"</p>\n<p>Bright snorts. \"It is a devious and despicable item.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden seems caught incredibly off-guard by this statement. He fumbles for a moment before continuing. \" -ah, well. My review of the file included sections regarding retaining brainwiped bodies for future use - actually, four.\"</p>\n<p>\"That is correct.\" Bright touches the teardrop tattoo under his eye. \"I found it wiser to keep bodies on hand, instead of trusting to the fickleness of fate to provide me with new ones should an incident arise. By keeping these bodies in stasis, I have found myself capable of extending their life span.\"</p>\n<p>\"To be frank, sir, this is among the most hideous crimes I have ever seen systematically inflicted upon a group of people, D-class or no. I have tremendous difficulty justifying it to myself and as a result, I may have behaved in a manner inconsistent with the attitude expected towards senior staff.\" Heiden coughs, still nervous about sounding off to a superior. \"\u2026to cut directly to the heart of the matter, sir, what entitles you to their bodies?\"</p>\n<p>Bright smiles \u2026ah\u2026 brightly. \"Ah, yes, entitlement. You are aware that D-class are executed on a monthly basis, yes?\"</p>\n<p>Heiden nods. \"I am aware. I genuinely believe that death is preferable.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well then, let us take a look at my bodies. Do you have any issues with my usage of simian bodies?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am\u2026 unnerved by it, I admit, sir.\" Heiden ponders a moment, and his speech lapses into a more informal pattern. \"It's not\u2026 it's not as visceral, though. It doesn't keep me awake at night. It's just another mildly disturbing thing that happens at work.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then that takes care of two of the stored bodies.\" Ticking off two fingers on his hand. \"Let's move on to this one. Hank Ashton, 42, convicted pedophile and child killer. He enjoys strawberry ice cream, and the reflection of his knife in a young girl's eyes before he cuts her throat.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden nods. He sees where Jack is going with this. \"He deserves to be dead. Unless exposure to SCP-963 has been proven to be identical to a brain transplant- and considering the nature of SCP-963, I doubt proof is forthcoming anytime soon- I do not believe use of the object to be justified.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is identical to a brain transplant. The recipient's brain is completely wiped clean.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll not press further after this one question- but how are you certain? The device is a twisted, disturbing thing. What happens to the 'data' that is wiped?\" Heiden just wants to be <em>sure</em>.</p>\n<p>Bright wags a finger at Heiden, hoping to explain. \"Think of it as a computer. All the files are moved to the trash bin \u2014\" he taps 963 \u2014 \"and new files are overwritten. While there may be some small indications the files were once there, you have to work to find them. Sadly, a poor copy is kept in the trash can. It is why I keep myself out of there, as much as possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 the consciousness never <em>dies</em>, then. It's just sequestered away?\" It just sounds so\u2026ugly, to him.</p>\n<p>Bright shakes his head. \"The consciousness dies, but the memories remain.\"</p>\n<p>\"So\u2026 it's as if you piggybacked your consciousness on a corpse.\" Heiden regrets how crude that sounds, but he's trying to fit it in his head.</p>\n<p>Bright snaps his fingers. \"Exactly. All the functions become mine. Even the ones you don't think can be changed. Every body I am in beats with the same pulse, breathes in the same manner, walks with the same steps.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden frowns. That's\u2026 <em>bizarre</em>.

But even were it not mistaken, there is another reason why I\u2026deserve\u2026 these bodies.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden tilts his head to the side slightly. \"\u2026I don't understand. Continue, sir?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am the Foundation.\" Bright stares at Heiden, a slight smile on his face. In his eyes\u2026 well, you read the report, and the theories, right?</p>\n<p>Heiden got a <em>heavily</em> redacted version of the report, it seems. He stares at Bright, feeling more than a little stupid. \"You\u2026 you are the Foundation?\" The only theory he's hearing right now is 'crippling megalomania', on the level of 'I am the Law!'. \"Sir, the SCP Foundation, while I am aware \u2026requires the work of minds such as yourself, is - as far as I know - a collaborative effort of many. To be blunt, I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>Bright stands up, and begins to pace, gesturing with his hands. \"Currently, you are a junior researcher, and I am a Senior Staffer in charge of personnel.

I, will be the Senior Researcher in charge of Personnel.\"</p>\n<p>\"In 50 years, you will, god willing, be ready to retire, and leave your work to a trusted researcher, who was brought into the Foundation under me. I will still be the Senior Researcher in charge of personnel.\" Bright focuses his gaze on Heiden, making sure he's getting it.</p>\n<p>\"In 75 years, if you are still alive, you will be suffering from dementia, and other mental deterioration, barely in control of your own bowels. I, however, will be in a body as young as they give me, training a new generation of Researchers.\"</p>\n<p>Heiden, with dawning horror, realizes what Dr. Bright is driving at.</p>\n<p>Bright stabs a finger at his desk, to make the point. \"In 100 years, you will be dead, and the researchers you taught will be nearing retirement themselves.

Do you <em>want</em> this?\"</p>\n<p>Bright shakes his head sadly. \"No one held 963 before me. It was created for another man, but he failed to make it work. I am its first, and only, resident. There is no escape from 963.\" Jack considers the question for a silent moment. \"Do I want it? No. But who else am I supposed to trust to get it done?\"</p>\n<p>Uneasily, Heiden continues. \"You don't have to run the Foundation, Dr. Bright. You're not Atlas - no human is.

Hell, when it comes to sex, do you know how hard it is to have something touch you, but never your partner, not even for a second? The positions get wild enough I have to pay for it.

It isn't all that reassuring.</p>\n<p>\"You\u2026 you really can't be rid of it, can you?\" Heiden pauses but a moment. \"I, ah\u2026 my condolences to you, sir.\" Heiden doesn't know what to say.

A researcher has been asking questions, and, worse, questioning Bright. And so it is that Dr. Jack Bright calls Dr. Heiden to his office, for some... discussion.\n\n\n\nHeiden is ushered into the room by an old man, the young doctor is clearly incredibly uneasy. \"\u2026Dr. Bright, you requested my presence?\"\n\n\n\n\"Heiden.\" Bright smiles lightly. \"Please, take a seat.\" Gesturing at the comfy looking chair across the desk from himself. Heiden takes a moment to look around the room uncomfortably before sitting in the chair.\n\n\n\n\"Hold on just a moment, please.\" Dr. Bright pulls out a small remote from his pocket and begins clicking buttons. The red lights on the cameras in the office go off, the door locks shut, and all other machines go dead. \"There. Much better.\"\n\n\n\nHeiden gulps nervously before saying \"\u2026yes, sir.\" Bright's actions did absolutely nothing to settle Frederick's raging nerves. Somehow he suspects that was intentional.\n\n\n\n\"Now then, there will be no recordings if you choose to be insubordinate. For the record, my cane is in the corner behind you, and my hands are empty. I am doing this in an attempt to provide an air of open conversation, that seems to be needed.\" He nods his head solemnly, before continuing. \"Now, it seems you may have some unresolved issues with me. Shall we discuss these?\"\n\n\n\nHeiden's mind races\u2026 but once again, honesty remains Frederick's policy. He takes a moment to compose himself before speaking. \"Yes, sir. On my first, ah, incident with the Foundation, I encountered SCP-963. It was used to subdue a prisoner, an armed android with which I am sure you are familiar.\"\n\n\n\nBright nods his head. \"Sonia Velamour. She was 29, had no siblings, and her parents were deceased. She once loved a man, and he turned her into a cyborg. Yes, I am aware of her, go on.\"\n\n\n\nHeiden stares at Bright, taken aback by the information. \"\u2026 yes. I initially protested this action, but as it was undertaken in the heat of a combat situation, it is understandable that my protests were ignored. I inquired as to the nature of SCP-963, and was offered access to a redacted file containing a briefing on the object. I am an ethicist by vocation, Doctor Bright, though my - \"\n\n\n\nBright snorts. \"It is a devious and despicable item.\"\n\n\n\nHeiden seems caught incredibly off-guard by this statement. He fumbles for a moment before continuing. \" -ah, well. My review of the file included sections regarding retaining brainwiped bodies for future use - actually, four.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is correct.\" Bright touches the teardrop tattoo under his eye.\u00a0\u00a0\"I found it wiser to keep bodies on hand, instead of trusting to the fickleness of fate to provide me with new ones should an incident arise. By keeping these bodies in stasis, I have found myself capable of extending their life span.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"To be frank, sir, this is among the most hideous crimes I have ever seen systematically inflicted upon a group of people, D-class or no. I have tremendous difficulty justifying it to myself and as a result, I may have behaved in a manner inconsistent with the attitude expected towards senior staff.\" Heiden coughs, still nervous about sounding off to a superior. \"\u2026to cut directly to the heart of the matter, sir, what entitles you to their bodies?\"\n\n\n\nBright smiles ...ah... brightly. \"Ah, yes, entitlement. You are aware that D-class are executed on a monthly basis, yes?\"\n\n\n\nHeiden nods. \"I am aware. I genuinely believe that death is preferable.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well then, let us take a look at my bodies. Do you have any issues with my usage of simian bodies?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am\u2026 unnerved by it, I admit, sir.\" Heiden ponders a moment, and his speech lapses into a more informal pattern. \"It's not\u2026 it's not as visceral, though. It doesn't keep me awake at night. It's just another mildly disturbing thing that happens at work.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then that takes care of two of the stored bodies.\" Ticking off two fingers on his hand. \"Let's move on to this one. Hank Ashton, 42, convicted pedophile and child killer. He enjoys strawberry ice cream, and the reflection of his knife in a young girl's eyes before he cuts her throat.\"\n\n\n\nHeiden nods. He sees where Jack is going with this. \"He deserves to be dead. Unless exposure to SCP-963 has been proven to be identical to a brain transplant- and considering the nature of SCP-963, I doubt proof is forthcoming anytime soon- I do not believe use of the object to be justified.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is identical to a brain transplant. The recipient's brain is completely wiped clean.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll not press further after this one question- but how are you certain? The device is a twisted, disturbing thing. What happens to the 'data' that is wiped?\" Heiden just wants to be //sure//.\n\n\n\nBright wags a finger at Heiden, hoping to explain.\u00a0\u00a0\"Think of it as a computer. All the files are moved to the trash bin --\" he taps 963 -- \"and new files are overwritten. While there may be some small indications the files were once there, you have to work to find them. Sadly, a poor copy is kept in the trash can. It is why I keep myself out of there, as much as possible.\"\n\n\n\n\"I\u2026 the consciousness never //dies//, then. It's just sequestered away?\" It just sounds so...ugly, to him.\n\n\n\nBright shakes his head. \"The consciousness dies, but the memories remain.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"So\u2026 it's as if you piggybacked your consciousness on a corpse.\" Heiden regrets how crude that sounds, but he's trying to fit it in his head.\n\n\n\nBright snaps his fingers. \"Exactly. All the functions become mine. Even the ones you don't think can be changed. Every body I am in beats with the same pulse, breathes in the same manner, walks with the same steps.\"\n\n\n\nHeiden frowns. That's\u2026 //bizarre//. Wait, where does he work again? \"Acknowledged, sir. My conduct towards you was based on an understanding of SCP-963 that was mistaken, and for that I apologize.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good. But even were it not mistaken, there is another reason why I\u2026deserve... these bodies.\"\n\n\n\nHeiden tilts his head to the side slightly. \"\u2026I don't understand. Continue, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am the Foundation.\" Bright stares at Heiden, a slight smile on his face. In his eyes\u2026 well, you read the report, and the theories, right?\n\n\n\nHeiden got a //heavily// redacted version of the report, it seems. He stares at Bright, feeling more than a little stupid. \"You\u2026 you are the Foundation?\" The only theory he's hearing right now is 'crippling megalomania', on the level of 'I am the Law!'. \"Sir, the SCP Foundation, while I am aware \u2026requires the work of minds such as yourself, is - as far as I know - a collaborative effort of many.

There are many explanations I could give for this, countless stories of failures and failed ideas and the inability of one lonely species to see the truth, endless tales of ignorance and of the worst possible living sin, stupidity. But none of these reasons are excuses, and in any case I am not looking for sympathy. So suffice to say that our planet was dying, while we yearned to live.</p>\n<p>I was in the Council of Sciences. Several years earlier, we had sat down the most formidable minds of our time, and broken down our situation, assessing the level of our threat- dire, indeed, very dire- and more importantly, discussing what we would need for a solution. It was called the Thirty Year Plan. The common people thought this referred to what we were going to do over the next thirty years to solve their problems. In actuality, it was the maximum calculated length of time we had until civilization broke down, and possibly methods of lengthening that time.</p>\n<p>We would need land, and food, and fuel, and we didn't have the resources to attain any of it. We did, yes, have a prototype starship available to us, and enough energy to power it many light years, but the starship could not carry a city, and there was already talk of breaking it down and using the power source to produce heat or food or any of the supplies already in dire need. Our planet was dying. Our people were starving. We needed hope.</p>\n<p>Then it came, out of the stars, like a gift from the gods we had officially denounced. We spotted it in the atmosphere long before it touched the surface of our planet, and a rocket was sent to retrieve it from orbit. It fell to earth in an unpopulated desert, and was removed by a single unmarked van. We couldn't afford to get anyone's hopes up.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate to be chosen to help study the Artifact. The bulk of it was badly dented, stained, and entirely foreign to us. It was made by hands, and the hands were not ours.</p>\n<p>There was some manner of electrical devices built into it, although they were all but melted and ashen ropes now. The only item we could recover was a single, beautiful, golden disk, covered in tiny circular ridges on one side and engraved all over on the other. We all stared at the markings. They were unlike anything we had ever seen.</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to jump to conclusions,\" said my good friend Professor Maddy, after some discussion, \"But these drawings could, after some imagination, be a star map of sorts.\" He indicated a set of abstract dots and lines. \"And these,\" gesturing to an outlined shape, \"Could almost be life of some sort.\" He was saying what all of us were thinking, what we didn't want to think. I put my hand on his back. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" I said gently.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said the Head of the Council. \"Absolutely. Research on this item must start immediately, but not a <em>word</em> of this is to be given to the public. Does everyone here understand? Not a <em>word</em>.\" He looked around, expression softening. \"False hope is another commodity we cannot afford.\" Everyone understood what he meant.</p>\n<p>The next day, I was assigned to speak at a protest in the city of Voss. This was the part of my job I hated most. Voss was impoverished, hungry, massive, and angry, perhaps rightfully so. I would have to smile, and try to address and support their concerns by feeding them lies, hopefully by mentioning the Thirty Year Plan as much as I could. That always seemed to reassure them.</p>\n<p>I stood, later, in a crumbling and formerly-grand auditorium in Voss. The entire room was packed with filthy, hungry, extinguished souls, all of them staring at me, dead silent.</p>\n<p>\"I would like to c-commend you for your concern,\" I stammered. \"But your g-government, and the Council of Sciences, have only your best interests in\u2026 In mind, and we are working on finding solutions to the most pressing issues we face, namely the food and water shortages, the economic sh-shortfalls, as well as pollution. We want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to deal with these. I will now f-field questions.\" I tugged at the collar of my shirt, as the room dissolved into angry muttering. A young reporter with a microphone stood up.</p>\n<p>\"Professor Rook,\" she addressed me, \"You say you are addressing the poverty and the food and water shortages in communities around the planet. What exactly are you doing?\"</p>\n<p>I adjusted my hat normally. \"We are developing new and improved filtration methods and agricultural practices,\" I said, \"Which should drastically increase the amount of food raised. The\u2026 Uh, the production and implementation of these techniques will require a sub\u2026 substantial new workforce, thus increasing hiring. This, and more, is all covered in the Thirty Year Plan.\"</p>\n<p>Another reporter stood up. \"You know, all the officials I've heard have talked about the Thirty Year Plan, but I haven't heard any specifics yet. What is the Thirty Year Plan going to do about overpopulation? About our waning food populations? About the poverty? Professor, what <em>is</em> the Thirty Year Plan?\"</p>\n<p>\"The Thirty Year Plan cannot be fully disclosed, because we believe that total disclosure will alter the intended results,\" I read off of my prompter. \"Suffice to say that the Thirty Year Plan is being enacted as we speak, and is showing results.\" Deemphasize, deflect, reassure. Easy enough.<br/>\nThe crowd had begun shouting about the lack of results. I felt small.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the back, a well-dressed man stood up. He didn't have a microphone, and his loud voice carried his words.</p>\n<p>\"Professor Rook,\" he said smoothly. \"I recently discovered an unrevealed government report- it my have been somewhat confidential, I apologize- but it stated that some sort of object- known as the Artifact, I believe- fell out of the sky several days ago, and, let me quote the report- 'It is certainly man-made, although it is engraved with multiple symbols not recognized, and is nearly positively non-terrestrial in design.' What can you tell us about the Artifact, professor?\"</p>\n<p>The room was silent. I felt as though I had been punched in the chest. I had written those words. The Artifact. They knew about the Artifact.

There are many explanations I could give for this, countless stories of failures and failed ideas and the inability of one lonely species to see the truth, endless tales of ignorance and of the worst possible living sin, stupidity. But none of these reasons are excuses, and in any case I am not looking for sympathy. So suffice to say that our planet was dying, while we yearned to live.\n\n\n\nI was in the Council of Sciences. Several years earlier, we had sat down the most formidable minds of our time, and broken down our situation, assessing the level of our threat- dire, indeed, very dire- and more importantly, discussing what we would need for a solution. It was called the Thirty Year Plan. The common people thought this referred to what we were going to do over the next thirty years to solve their problems. In actuality, it was the maximum calculated length of time we had until civilization broke down, and possibly methods of lengthening that time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe would need land, and food, and fuel, and we didn't have the resources to attain any of it. We did, yes, have a prototype starship available to us, and enough energy to power it many light years, but the starship could not carry a city, and there was already talk of breaking it down and using the power source to produce heat or food or any of the supplies already in dire need. Our planet was dying. Our people were starving. We needed hope. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThen it came, out of the stars, like a gift from the gods we had officially denounced. We spotted it in the atmosphere long before it touched the surface of our planet, and a rocket was sent to retrieve it from orbit. It fell to earth in an unpopulated desert, and was removed by a single unmarked van. We couldn't afford to get anyone's hopes up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI was fortunate to be chosen to help study the Artifact. The bulk of it was badly dented, stained, and entirely foreign to us. It was made by hands, and the hands were not ours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThere was some manner of electrical devices built into it, although they were all but melted and ashen ropes now. The only item we could recover was a single, beautiful, golden disk, covered in tiny circular ridges on one side and engraved all over on the other. We all stared at the markings. They were unlike anything we had ever seen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"I don't want to jump to conclusions,\" said my good friend Professor Maddy, after some discussion, \"But these drawings could, after some imagination, be a star map of sorts.\" He indicated a set of abstract dots and lines. \"And these,\" gesturing to an outlined shape, \"Could almost be life of some sort.\" He was saying what all of us were thinking, what we didn't want to think. I put my hand on his back. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" I said gently.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Head of the Council. \"Absolutely. Research on this item must start immediately, but not a //word// of this is to be given to the public. Does everyone here understand? Not a //word//.\" He looked around, expression softening. \"False hope is another commodity we cannot afford.\" Everyone understood what he meant.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I was assigned to speak at a protest in the city of Voss. This was the part of my job I hated most. Voss was impoverished, hungry, massive, and angry, perhaps rightfully so. I would have to smile, and try to address and support their concerns by feeding them lies, hopefully by mentioning the Thirty Year Plan as much as I could. That always seemed to reassure them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI stood, later, in a crumbling and formerly-grand auditorium in Voss. The entire room was packed with filthy, hungry, extinguished souls, all of them staring at me, dead silent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"I would like to c-commend you for your concern,\" I stammered. \"But your g-government, and the Council of Sciences, have only your best interests in... In mind, and we are working on finding solutions to the most pressing issues we face, namely the food and water shortages, the economic sh-shortfalls, as well as pollution. We want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to deal with these. I will now f-field questions.\" I tugged at the collar of my shirt, as the room dissolved into angry muttering. A young reporter with a microphone stood up.\n\n\n\n\"Professor Rook,\" she addressed me, \"You say you are addressing the poverty and the food and water shortages in communities around the planet. What exactly are you doing?\"\n\n\n\nI adjusted my hat normally. \"We are developing new and improved filtration methods and agricultural practices,\" I said, \"Which should drastically increase the amount of food raised. The... Uh, the production and implementation of these techniques will require a sub... substantial new workforce, thus increasing hiring. This, and more, is all covered in the Thirty Year Plan.\"\n\n\n\nAnother reporter stood up. \"You know, all the officials I've heard have talked about the Thirty Year Plan, but I haven't heard any specifics yet. What is the Thirty Year Plan going to do about overpopulation? About our waning food populations? About the poverty? Professor, what //is// the Thirty Year Plan?\"\n\n\n\n\"The Thirty Year Plan cannot be fully disclosed, because we believe that total disclosure will alter the intended results,\" I read off of my prompter. \"Suffice to say that the Thirty Year Plan is being enacted as we speak, and is showing results.\" Deemphasize, deflect, reassure. Easy enough.\n\nThe crowd had begun shouting about the lack of results. I felt small.\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the back, a well-dressed man stood up. He didn't have a microphone, and his loud voice carried his words.\n\n\n\n\"Professor Rook,\" he said smoothly. \"I recently discovered an unrevealed government report- it my have been somewhat confidential, I apologize- but it stated that some sort of object- known as the Artifact, I believe- fell out of the sky several days ago, and, let me quote the report- 'It is certainly man-made, although it is engraved with multiple symbols not recognized, and is nearly positively non-terrestrial in design.' What can you tell us about the Artifact, professor?\"\n\n\n\nThe room was silent. I felt as though I had been punched in the chest. I had written those words. The Artifact. They knew about the Artifact. I watched the man fade into the crowd again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Y-yes, the, uh, the anomaly- the Artifact, as it's known- does present some curiosity to us, but it's... Certainly not a definite symbol of anything. Research is... R-research is ongoing.\" The prompter was black. Silence.\n\n\n\n\"Why didn't you tell us?\" A voice screamed. A civilian somewhere.\n\n\n\n\"We, uh, we didn't want to g-get anyone's hopes up...\" The mass broke into screams and boiled like a pot of water. I felt sick. I felt like a monster. Security rushed in. The meeting ended shortly after that.\n\n\n\nThey had to change our hotel reservations. They put security in the lobby. Nobody found us. I called Maddy, asking about the Artifact. \n\n\n\nThey had found nothing. They had bounced light off of it, scanned it, studied it, measured the ridges, put them through our best codebreaking programs. Nothing at all.

Your young mind runs wild with imagination, only heightening your fear of the night and that which you can\u2019t see. Fortunately your father senses that all isn\u2019t well in your world and steps quietly inside the room. He sits on the edge of your bed and asks why you\u2019re still awake, in an awkward combination of stern and gentle that is so characteristic of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a monster under my bed, papa,\u201d you whisper quietly, so as not to disturb or otherwise make it aware of your presence above. Your father smiles and gives a quiet laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to look underneath the bed?\u201d he asks with a grin. You nod, and his next words surprise you. \u201cNo, Pasha. There are no monsters. They are all dead.\u201d Incredulous, you sit up slightly and ask, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Still smiling, he pats your head and says, \u201cPasha, your grandfather killed them all in the Great Patriotic War. Go to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>You believe him, and sleep finally takes you.</p>\n<p><strong>A Russian Federation army base, February 1995:</strong></p>\n<p>Snow billows and swirls around your face, obstructing your view of the man-shaped bullseye target hundreds of meters away. In your white-knuckled hands rests an almost ancient Mosin Nagant 91/30 sniper\u2019s rifle, a relic left over from the Second World War, relegated to use as a training instrument for new potential marksmen. The metal is frozen and has lost much of its bluing, exposing the roughly milled receiver to the harsh elements you are now subjected to. The trigger group rattles and one of the lenses is cracked, sometimes making it difficult to concentrate. The wood is rotting away due to the dank storage arsenals it has resided in for so many years, but also displays a number of crude carved markings on one side of the stock-a previous owner\u2019s morbid scorecard.</p>\n<p>When your instructors distributed the weapons to you and your fellow marksmen candidates, the rest of them clucked their tongues and mocked the pitiful appearance of the weapons. Their jokes and spiteful comments escaped your ears at the time.</p>\n<p>It is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen, and is everything a weapon of war should be: old, battle worn, and victorious, with scars to prove it. You sense prophetically that years from now you will wish you had this weapon to call your own, but sadly you too will return it to the armorers to be given a cursory cleaning and then a dip in storage oils, until the next recruit comes along. It seems an unfair existence for something with so much history behind it, but you suspect it is more fitting than hanging on a collector\u2019s wall as a showpiece, never to be used again.</p>\n<p>Your eye peers through the scope, ignoring the cracked lens and seeking out the target through the mire of snow and fog ahead of you. You wait, wait for a chance, wait for God to clear the skies for you. A sudden break in the squall rewards you with a few fleeting moments of clear sight, exactly what you need.</p>\n<p>You pull the trigger without hesitation, causing your instructor to turn from the spotting scope next to you and smile for what you think is the first time in his life.</p>\n<p><strong>Chechnya, May 1995:</strong></p>\n<p>Your senior sergeant glares at you. He is covered in an unspeakable and inescapable filth that infests this place, and eyes with scorn your clean (relatively speaking) uniform. Especially that marksman\u2019s badge that you only just earned little under a month ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, boy!\u201d he barks, and you stand at rigid attention. \u201cGive me that fucking badge. Once you\u2019ve killed something like the rest of us, you can have it back.\u201d Obediently you surrender it to him, understanding your place in this war all too well, having to prove and reprove yourself to these men who have known nothing but misery and death for the past year.</p>\n<p>You are attached to your first patrol the next day, in what on the map is labeled Grozny but in reality exists only as a smoldering cemetery of skeletal buildings, charred vehicles and mostly unburied corpses. Though the battle is officially over, it remains a place of wholesale slaughter and devastation, and you wonder why anyone would deem such a godforsaken place to be of any importance. Your squad picks its way through mountains of rubble and around mass graves, sweeping up a few stragglers here and there.</p>\n<p>Out of the corner of your eye you spot a teen aged boy, his face covered in a few dirty rags and carrying a soldier\u2019s rucksack over one shoulder. The sergeant screams at him to halt but instead the boy breaks into a run, darting away from you. Your sergeant turns to you, pointing, and bellows, \u201c<em>Snaiper!</em>\u201d leaving little doubt in your mind as to what he is ordering you to do. Before you even realize it your SVD is nestled snugly upon your shoulder and the scope is at your eyes, the graduated sights already aligned on the fleeing figure. The rifle jumps violently in your hands and the boy drops to his knees, blood spilling from the exit wound in his chest as he gasps for air. Dust settles around him, and he is still.</p>\n<p>Your sergeant jabs a fist in the air, ordering the rest of the squad to hold as the two of you fall out to examine what was in that bag. Approaching the corpse, your eyes notice something you had missed before: long strands of dark brown hair fall from the crude balaclava, now jarred out of place and showing the boy\u2019s facial features more clearly. You are suddenly overwhelmed by the realization that \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t a boy at all, but actually a young girl- only about 17 or so by the looks of it. Her blood soaks the charred ground and her empty brown eyes stare lifelessly at the perpetually cloudy sky. Your hands begin to shake as you riffle through the bag and you pray, pray to god that there are grenades or something, anything to justify taking this girl\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>All you find are a few meager scraps of bread.</p>\n<p>Nausea overtakes you and you fall to the ground and retch violently, your sergeant standing over you with his ever-present scowl. He grabs you with his giant\u2019s hands and forces you to stand on your feet and look him in the eye. \u201cLooks like you can shoot after all, boy,\u201d he says as he pries open your clenched hands and returns the marksman\u2019s badge.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/784incident7\">The Mediterranean, present day:</a></strong></p>\n<p>Jimmy Durante\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Seeing You\u201d lilts through the air from a radio somewhere on the street below you, conveniently distracting passersby just finishing their antipasti at the streetside caf\u00e9s. The beach is deserted save for a young girl sprawled across a tiny dock, her shapely legs kicking playfully in the warm Italian water, frilly pastel-yellow dress glowing in the soft luminescence of the setting sun. A smile plays across her face-she\u2019s pretty, and you find it difficult to maintain your professional detachment whilst observing her through the rifle scope.

Your young mind runs wild with imagination, only heightening your fear of the night and that which you can\u2019t see. Fortunately your father senses that all isn\u2019t well in your world and steps quietly inside the room. He sits on the edge of your bed and asks why you\u2019re still awake, in an awkward combination of stern and gentle that is so characteristic of him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere is a monster under my bed, papa,\u201d you whisper quietly, so as not to disturb or otherwise make it aware of your presence above. Your father smiles and gives a quiet laugh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you want me to look underneath the bed?\u201d he asks with a grin. You nod, and his next words surprise you. \u201cNo, Pasha. There are no monsters. They are all dead.\u201d Incredulous, you sit up slightly and ask, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Still smiling, he pats your head and says, \u201cPasha, your grandfather killed them all in the Great Patriotic War. Go to sleep.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You believe him, and sleep finally takes you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**A Russian Federation army base, February 1995:**\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Snow billows and swirls around your face, obstructing your view of the man-shaped bullseye target hundreds of meters away. In your white-knuckled hands rests an almost ancient Mosin Nagant 91/30 sniper\u2019s rifle, a relic left over from the Second World War, relegated to use as a training instrument for new potential marksmen. The metal is frozen and has lost much of its bluing, exposing the roughly milled receiver to the harsh elements you are now subjected to. The trigger group rattles and one of the lenses is cracked, sometimes making it difficult to concentrate. The wood is rotting away due to the dank storage arsenals it has resided in for so many years, but also displays a number of crude carved markings on one side of the stock-a previous owner\u2019s morbid scorecard. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When your instructors distributed the weapons to you and your fellow marksmen candidates, the rest of them clucked their tongues and mocked the pitiful appearance of the weapons. Their jokes and spiteful comments escaped your ears at the time. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen, and is everything a weapon of war should be: old, battle worn, and victorious, with scars to prove it. You sense prophetically that years from now you will wish you had this weapon to call your own, but sadly you too will return it to the armorers to be given a cursory cleaning and then a dip in storage oils, until the next recruit comes along. It seems an unfair existence for something with so much history behind it, but you suspect it is more fitting than hanging on a collector\u2019s wall as a showpiece, never to be used again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your eye peers through the scope, ignoring the cracked lens and seeking out the target through the mire of snow and fog ahead of you. You wait, wait for a chance, wait for God to clear the skies for you. A sudden break in the squall rewards you with a few fleeting moments of clear sight, exactly what you need.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou pull the trigger without hesitation, causing your instructor to turn from the spotting scope next to you and smile for what you think is the first time in his life.\n\n\n\n**Chechnya, May 1995:**\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your senior sergeant glares at you. He is covered in an unspeakable and inescapable filth that infests this place, and eyes with scorn your clean (relatively\u00a0\u00a0speaking)\u00a0\u00a0uniform. Especially that marksman\u2019s badge that you only just earned little under a month ago.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou, boy!\u201d he barks, and you stand at rigid attention. \u201cGive me that fucking badge. Once you\u2019ve killed something like the rest of us, you can have it back.\u201d Obediently you surrender it to him, understanding your place in this war all too well, having to prove and reprove yourself to these men who have known nothing but misery and death for the past year. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You are attached to your first patrol the next day, in what on the map is labeled Grozny but in reality exists only as a smoldering cemetery of skeletal buildings, charred vehicles and mostly unburied corpses. Though the battle is officially over, it remains a place of wholesale slaughter and devastation, and you wonder why anyone would deem such a godforsaken place to be of any importance. Your squad picks its way through mountains of rubble and around mass graves, sweeping up a few stragglers here and there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Out of the corner of your eye you spot a teen aged boy, his face covered in a few dirty rags and carrying a soldier\u2019s rucksack over one shoulder. The sergeant screams at him to halt but instead the boy breaks into a run, darting away from you. Your sergeant turns to you, pointing, and bellows, \u201c//Snaiper!//\u201d\u00a0\u00a0leaving little doubt in your mind as to what he is ordering you to do. Before you even realize it your SVD is nestled snugly upon your shoulder and the scope is at your eyes, the graduated sights already aligned on the fleeing figure. The rifle jumps violently in your hands and the boy drops to his knees, blood spilling from the exit wound in his chest as he gasps for air. Dust settles around him, and he is still.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your sergeant jabs a fist in the air, ordering the rest of the squad to hold as the two of you fall out to examine what was in that bag.\u00a0\u00a0Approaching the corpse, your eyes notice something you had missed before: long strands of dark brown hair fall from the crude balaclava, now jarred out of place and showing the boy\u2019s facial features more clearly. You are suddenly overwhelmed by the realization that \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t a boy at all, but actually a young girl- only about 17 or so by the looks of it. Her blood soaks the charred ground and her empty brown eyes stare lifelessly at the perpetually cloudy sky. Your hands begin to shake as you riffle through the bag and you pray, pray to god that there are grenades or something, anything to justify taking this girl\u2019s life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All you find are a few meager scraps of bread.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nausea overtakes you and you fall to the ground and retch violently, your sergeant standing over you with his ever-present scowl. He grabs you with his giant\u2019s hands and forces you to stand on your feet and look him in the eye. \u201cLooks like you can shoot after all, boy,\u201d he says as he pries open your clenched hands and returns the marksman\u2019s badge.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**[[[784Incident7|The Mediterranean, present day:]]]**\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jimmy Durante\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Seeing You\u201d lilts through the air from a radio somewhere on the street below you, conveniently distracting passersby just finishing their antipasti at the streetside caf\u00e9s. The beach is deserted save for a young girl sprawled across a tiny dock, her shapely legs kicking playfully in the warm Italian water, frilly pastel-yellow dress glowing in the soft luminescence of the setting sun.

A single tear rolled down her face and splashed on the food. \"Get the hell up and clean that up,\" the lunch lady said, and Vanessa slowly got to her feet and started to gather up the fallen food.</p>\n<p>Then a hand reached down and helped her. \"Here,\" a soft, gentle voice said. \"Let me help.\"</p>\n<p>She looked up into the face of the most handsome man she had ever seen. His eyes were limpid blue, green, and brown orbs, their sparkling hues warming her heart, and his perfect white skin peeked from under the collar of his immaculate white labcoat. A broad smile on his face as he carefully wiped the tear from her cheek and licked it off the tip of his finger. \"Beautiful girls shouldn't cry,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not beautiful,\" Vanessa mumbled.</p>\n<p>\"I think you are. I've thought so for a long time,\" Doctor Clef said. \"I've watched you for a very long time, you know.\" He picked her up off the ground and carried her away, while Alexis and her stupid friends looked on jealously.</p>\n<p>\"Are you sure this is a good idea,\" Vanessa whispered. \"I mean, what if the other senior staff see?\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck the senior staff. Love is greater than this,\" Clef growled, and he started to take off her blouse. \"But first, you need to know something,\" he whispered into her ear.</p>\n<p>\"Anything,\" gasped Vanessa.</p>\n<p>\"Late at night,\" Clef uttered, \"I put on a black hat and apron and fight crime as Chowderclef.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>\"My god.

I'm a rapist, this is what I do, rape and things like that.\"\n\n\n\nIt was then that he was clobbered by a bowl of chowder, steaming hot and packed with delicious clams and white potatoes, cooked just to firmness, with quite a few celery bits as well to give snap and flavor. It was New England clam chowder, for the figure who stood on the rooftop wearing a black apron and a tall chef's hat made of black cloth (blacker than the blackest of blacks that a black-wearing goth kid would wear at midnight) was not fond of tomatoes in his clam chowder, and considered it an abberation, nay, a heresy, which must be purged.\n\n\n\nJoe Knife screamed in pain as he raised his gun and fired it at the rooftop, but the black-clad, mysterious figure was too fast for him, and vanished in a flash of black cloth. \"Come out!\" he screamed. \"Who the hell are you? Where the fuck are you coming from?\"\n\n\n\n\"Right here,\" said a voice, and it pounded him in the back of the skull with a ladle.\n\n\n\nJoe Knife grabbed the back of his head. \"OW! That HURTS!\" he shouted. \"And you didn't answer my question, who are you?\"\n\n\n\nThe mysterious stranger drew himself up to his full mysterious seven feet of height, and the grin on his face was wide and mysterious. Moonlight glinted off the horns on his forehead.\n\n\n\n\"The name is Clef,\" he said. \"Chowderclef. Defender of the World.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n+ CHOWDERCLEF, DEFENDER OF THE WORLD\n\n++ CHAPTER 1: THE BADASS AND THE HOT CHICKS WHO WANT TO BONE HIM, OR BE BONED BY HIM\n\n-----\n\n\n\nSite 19 was in a tizzy. \"Oh no!\" shouted Doctor Rights. \"All the SCPs are out of their pens!\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll save you!\" said Doctor Clef, and he ran into the room with his shotgun.\n\n\n\n\"Oh noes,\" said SCP-682. \"It is Clef. He gong to kill us.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ha ha ha!\" said Doctor Clef, and he shot at SCP-682 with his shotgun rocket missiles. \n\n\n\n\"Argh!\" shouted SPC-682, and it fell down and was ded.\n\n\n\n\"You saved us!\" said Doctor Rights, and she kissed him. And then they had sex.\n\n\n\n\"The SCP Foundation would fall apart without Doctor Clef here,\" said Doctor Gears, and he gave Clef a promotion to O5.\n\n\n\nTo everyone at Site 19, Doctor Clef was just a mild mannered researcher, an ordinary guy like any other.\n\n\n\nBut Doctor Clef had a sekrets. At night, when the rest of Site 19 was alseep, he put on a black chef's toke and a black aporn. And he went to the Site 19 kitchen and he made a big pot of clam chowder. Then he went to Gotham City or Night City or Metropolis and he fought crime. He was Chowderclef! Defendeer of the innocent and the protector of the world.\n\n\n\nThis si his story.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n//\"I'm sorry to call you away from your work on such short notice.\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Always glad to help out a senior staff member.

The figure sitting in the chair across from him slowly blinked its uncannily colorful eyes (damn it, he could never figure out what color they were supposed to be) and carefully read the pink slip of paper in his hand. \"Your psychological evaluation indicates that it's been years since you last took a break. You need to let off some steam.\"</p>\n<p>\"I did have a break. I took a very nice trip to Italy,\" Clef said levelly.</p>\n<p>\"I went to bar. Was fun. Met new friends,\" Strelnikov insisted.</p>\n<p>\"A covert mission with six MTF operatives to eliminate a target is not a vacation, and nor are the five weeks in the hospital spent recovering from that nasty gut wound either.\" Dr. Glass sighed. \"Look. Just take the damn vacation. I don't care where you go, or what you do, just spend at least one week where you're not worrying about the fate of the world.\"</p>\n<p>\"That would be\u2026 difficult,\" Clef said, folding the piece of paper into precise thirds. \"Might as well ask me to stop breathing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is stupid,\" said the other man sitting across from the psychologist, as he glared at his own pink slip of paper. \"Is not like Chechens will stop being Chechens because I'm fatigued. War is not nine-to-five job.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then\u2026 at least make saving the world a secondary priority. Think of it as\u2026 periodic maintenance. You take your car in for a tune-up every ten thousand miles. This is your time to get a tune-up.\" Dr. Glass sighed.</p>\n<p>\"Can't I get a tune-up in the shop? Perhaps I could spend some time at the training facility instead, or in the field\u2026\" Clef muttered.</p>\n<p>\"Can spend time drinking vodka. That is proper Russian vacation.\"</p>\n<p>\"No. No field operations, no training, no paperwork, nothing. Just\u2026 get some rest. You've certainly earned it. Enjoy your vacations, gentlemen.\"</p>\n<p>The door closed with a kind of epic finality, leaving two of the most dangerous men in the Foundation standing in the hallway, clutching pink slips like a pair of delinquent teenagers sent to the principal's office. The entire support staff of the Human Resources and Training division sat in their cubicles studiously staring at their monitors. One of them, a young lady wearing a very nice pantsuit, was desperately typing the Lord's Prayer over and over into Notepad. Another was whispering a Buddhist sutra under his breath.</p>\n<p>The tension was finally broken by a sigh from Clef, who rubbed the back of his neck with the pink slip of paper. \"So,\" he said, \"I hear Brazil is nice this time of year.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The airport bar was crowded, full of weary passengers stopping in to have a bite to eat and a few drinks before allowing themselves to be carted off in the big Airbuses and Boeings. Strelnikov and Clef strolled in quietly and took the only two empty seats at the long bar, nodding curtly to the bartender and those next to them before settling in for the two hour wait. Their attire was ostentatious and drew odd looks from the other patrons: Strelnikov in his olive drab dress uniform with peaked cap, and Clef in a Hawaiian shirt with obscene portrayals of people engaging in coitus printed in flamboyant colors.</p>\n<p>Their chosen drinks said much about their character. The bartender, hair in a muss from a long day, pointed at Clef and made eye contact, silently inquiring.</p>\n<p>\u201cBombay Sapphire Martini, stirred, not shaken, two ice cubes only, 6:1 gin and vermouth, two olives, one onion, and if you bruise the vermouth god help you,\u201d Clef responded dryly, as if the bartender should have already known. The bartender\u2019s expression went blank for a moment, before he nodded slowly and turned to Strelnikov. \u201cAnd you, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVodka.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Strelnikov gave him the dirtiest of looks. \u201c\u2026Ice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny preferred brand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dmitri\u2019s stare hardened and he clenched his fists on the bar. \u201c<em>Vodka</em>. With <em>ice.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The alcohol was forthcoming and it both lightened their mood and loosened their tongues accordingly as they imbibed. As the first rounds went through them, they developed a lively and appropriate discussion.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see, Dmitri, a good drink is smooth\u2014you have just a small sip and the flavor and aromas combine and are enough to take your breath away. It\u2019s like the touch of a beautiful woman, something exquisite and rare, something you hold in your hand and show people so they can see what a classy son of a bitch you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink? Drink is not status or class symbol, Doktor Clef. Drink is a drink. You drink it. And you get drunk. And then you are drink more, until you have drink so much that is make you sober again.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve understood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their spirited debate continued, beginning to draw the attention of the other customers. Slowly their heads and chairs swiveled to lock on the two oddly dressed gentlemen as they argued and jabbed at one another\u2019s tastes. As their collection of empty vodka and martini glasses grew and grew, the argument mellowed and became a happy, family oriented story telling extravaganza.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to see his face when I killed him, Dmitri. That\u2019s why I had the snipers hold their fire. See, I came in behind him like this,\u201d accompanied with gesticulation of the hands, \u201cand swiped him across the face with my pistol. Then he stabbed me and some things happened, and blah blah blah, I ended up in a hospital for a few weeks. Good times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Strelnikov nodded approvingly. \u201cIn Chechnya, our supplies always run low. So I was force to hold my fire many time and resort to use of bayonet.\u201d He waggled a finger and pointed at Clef, \u201cMany Chechens get it in the face and neck, Doktor Clef. Many. Much blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEver drive over thirty people in a tank?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes armored personnel carrier count? What about unarm combat, you snap necks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe spine is usually easier for me, Dmitri. A lot of people prefer the traditional twisting-head neck snapping action but I usually stick with grabbing them by the hair and shoving a boot into the small of their back as hard as I can. It\u2019s a personal preference really.\u201d Strelnikov couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce, on night mission, we find rebel camp in bombed warehouse. I send two team, yes?\u201d He holds up two fingers. \u201cTwo team, into each entrance, and I climb through window alone, with just knife and pistol. They were sleep, guards sleep, everyone was sleep. We come in and slit all of their throats in the night and leave them for crows.\u201d He coughs. \u201cLater that night I find out there had been a mutual cease fire called,\u201d he concludes with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, man, I know. Once, I was trying an experimental chainsaw that we thought was a possible item for containment. There ended up being a D-Class riot and, well, I was on hand with the chainsaw and one thing led to another. Next thing I know, I\u2019m standing on a pile of D-Class bodies holding the saw over my head and screaming in bloodlust, then someone comes in and tells me it was just the annual costume party and half of my research staff is now dead.\u201d A shrug. \u201cTurns out the saw was just a normal saw, too.\u201d Strelnikov nodded sadly, feeling Clef\u2019s disappointment, pausing for a moment and then saying quietly:</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just kid about cease fire, Doktor Clef.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Oh. I wasn\u2019t. It really was a costume party.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dmitri sighed and turned back to the bar and asked for another drink, except nobody answered. He craned his head over the bar and found the bartender, pale as a ghost, trembling on the floor with a phone in his hand, poised to dial. Strelnikov shrugged and plucked the bottle himself, pouring a glass and turning back to face Clef. He took a quick look behind him.</p>\n<p>The bar was completely empty.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Considering who we work for, you'd think they could afford to give us better seats than coach,\" Clef griped. \"Seriously. Charging us five bucks for a dry ham sandwich and a half can of soda. This is highway robbery.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is better than Aeroflot in 1980s,\" Dimitri pointed out. \"Food recognizable. Cabin actually pressurized. Stewardesses smile at you instead of scream.\" He raised an eyebrow at the attractive young lady coming down the aisle with the beverage cart. \"And are much prettier. Aeroflot stewardesses all fat old bitches with horse face.\"</p>\n<p>\"I dunno, a boiled beet and some horse-leather meat might actually be a step up from this\u2026 thing. What the hell are these little green flecks, anyway?\" Clef muttered, poking the sandwich with his finger. \"Lizard bits?\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe is sperm from 682. Big lizard wet his beak in your sandwich, no?\" Strelnikov quipped, making a \"jerking off\" motion with his left hand.</p>\n<p>\"I wish, it would improve the taste\u2026 excuse me, miss? Miss?\" Clef said, reaching across Dimitri from his window seat to tap the stewardess on the elbow. \"I'm sorry, miss, but you seem to have messed up my order. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, not a pus and plastic one. From the taste of this, it seems that you've confused the two.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see, sir,\" the stewardess sighed. \"I'm sorry you don't like the taste of your sandwich. If you'd like a refund\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want a goddamn refund, I want an edible sandwich,\" Clef interrupted. \"Now, I'm sure that somewhere in that cart under the piles of dried-out human ejaculate and styrofoam sponge, you've got something edible, so how about bending that pretty ass over and looking a little harder, sweet cheeks?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ahhhh,\" the stewardess said. She turned to Dr. Clef and grinned, a wide, mirthless smile showing too many teeth. \"So, I see, what you're really trying to say is that <em>you're</em> the asshole here!\"</p>\n<p>She leaned across Dimitri, her voice low and stern, but carrying through the suddenly silent cavern, as she addressed the bemused Clef. \"Listen up, bucko. I don't make the damn food, I just serve it. If you've got a problem, you can write a goddamn letter to the people who do. But wait until we get on the ground. Until then, it's another six hours to S\u00e3o Paulo, and I'll be damned if I have to spend it listening to you bitch the whole way. So either shut up and eat your sandwich or stop complaining about it, or I'll duct tape your mouth shut and tape you to the chair.\" She stood up straight. \"And my name's not sweet cheeks, asshole. It's Lucy.\"</p>\n<p>There was a moment of stunned silence, broken by a smattering of applause, then the stewardess continued down the aisle, serving sodas and coffees to the other, appreciative passengers. Clef leaned back and smiled. \"I like her,\" he admitted. \"Girl's got spirit.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's nice,\" Dimitri sighed. He unbuckled his seatbelt and stood up slowly.</p>\n<p>\"Where are you going?\" Clef asked. \"The in-flight movie's about to start.\"</p>\n<p>\"To take a shit\u2026 and pretend I don't know you,\" Dimitri said.</p>\n<p>Clef shrugged and leaned his chair back as far as he could, ignoring the angry stare from the fat lady in the seat behind him. He was just drifting to sleep when a loud scuffling sound and scream drew his attention.</p>\n<p>\"DO NOT MOVE!\" screamed the bearded man, who held a knife to the throat of Lucy the flight attendant. There were two other men, holding similar weapons: one held a hand grenade, pin out, over his head. All three were wearing kaffiyehs and camouflage t-shirts. \"This plane now belongs to the Holy Army of the Chechen Independent Republic!\"</p>\n<p>\"Allahu Akbar!\" screamed one of the other men. \"God is great! Long Live Chechnya!\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you have got to be fucking kidding me,\" Clef winced.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The jostling of the aircraft in the turbulent skies made it difficult for Strelnikov to piss. It always struck him as odd; he\u2019d have no qualms about jumping out of an airplane into a combat zone, but something as simple as taking a leak inside of one gave him hell. The complexities and nuances of the human psyche escaped him at the time, and he chided himself for \u201cbeing a pansy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He finally got control of himself and was about to go when the door was rudely kicked open and someone grabbed him by the shoulder, dragging him into the aisle. He quickly buttoned himself and stumbled along, too surprised to offer effective resistance. The Chechen took a good look at his uniform and noticed the Russian crest on his hat\u2014with a quick decision he began dragging him to the front of the aircraft.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaught with your pants down, Dmitri?\u201d Clef muttered as they dragged Strelnikov between the rows of seats, the irony of his witticism wasted. Thinking quickly, he threw his foot out into the aisle just in time to catch the Chechen\u2019s ankle, sending him face first into the carpet and taking Dmitri down with him. The two others immediately rushed forward to try and subdue Clef, one still holding the hand grenade over his head and shouting angrily in a Chechen-Russian dialect.</p>\n<p>Strelnikov immediately recognized it.</p>\n<p>They were Chechens.</p>\n<p>They were on the plane. His plane.</p>\n<p>There were Chechens on his plane. Three of them.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026That is three too many,\u201d he said out loud. Clef gave him an odd look as he immediately began biting the tripped man\u2019s nose, drawing a short knife from the inside of a jackboot and proceeding to punch the man in the kidneys. With the knife.</p>\n<p>Clef wasted no time and nearly leapt over the heads of the terrified passengers in front of him, lunging for the approaching men. He connected with the one carrying the knife, knocking him to the floor also. Clef hauled back and slammed the palm of his hand into the man\u2019s face, quickly shattering the bridge of the man\u2019s nose. The man winced and staggered back, clutching his heavily bleeding nose, as Clef casually disarmed him with a complicated aikido wrist lock. He then drove the knife into the man's heart as Strelnikov finished rendering his man into a bloody, dying mess.</p>\n<p>There was only one left, still holding the hand grenade and seemingly unsure of what to do now that their plan had completely deteriorated. \"Don't move!\" he screamed. \"I have a bomb!\"</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, Clef and Dmitri rotated their heads upward, rising from the bloodied corpses like something out of a cheap horror flick, except instead of a dramatic musical score, there was only the wailing of the outboard turbofans as the pilot increased throttle. \"I don't care,\" Clef said.</p>\n<p>Dmitri just smiled. Steel teeth gleamed.</p>\n<p>The terrorist's eyes darted nervously between the two men, and he took a frightened step backward.</p>\n<p>It would be his last. Lucy\u2019s foot caught the man in the back of the knee and sent him stumbling forward, right into Strelnikov\u2019s knife. Clef deftly snatched the grenade from the man\u2019s hand, paying careful attention to make sure he kept pressure on the spoon. Dmitri\u2019s bloodied steel teeth glistened underneath the cabin lighting, offering the man a most disquieting last sight of this earth.</p>\n<p>He withdrew the knife as violently as he had inserted it, a spray of blood splashing across the passengers nearest him, letting the body collapse supine on the floor. The occupants of the cabin stared in shock and awe at the brief, bloody conflict, offering no applause as Clef took his seat, grenade in hand. Strelnikov walked past, heading aft.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to make piss.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"We have a problem,\" Clef said, when Dimitri came out of the restroom, buttoning up his pants. Compared to the Russian, who was a bloody, gory mess, the stuck-up prick had somehow managed to avoid getting any blood on him at all, despite the violence of the past few minutes.</p>\n<p>\"No problem. Chechens dead now,\" Strelnikov pointed out.</p>\n<p>\"That's the problem. Three dead terrorists on an airplane, a plane full of grateful passengers, media, heroism, a parade, our faces in the paper? Do you see where I'm going with this?\" Clef pointed out.</p>\n<p>Strelnikov considered the implications of the Director's words. \"Inconvenient,\" he murmured. \"Doktor Glass will lecture us muchly about definition of 'relaxation' and 'low profile.'\"</p>\n<p>\"To say the least. Wait here. Then follow my lead when you have a moment.\"</p>\n<p>The gangly, big-nosed doctor took a deep breath, then squared his shoulders and walked back down the aisle, to where the rather shaken young stewardess was sitting in the front of the plane, nursing a cup of coffee. Strelnikov couldn't hear what he said over the sound of the plane engines, but he could see the way that their body language changed.</p>\n<p>Clef said something while standing back near the front row.</p>\n<p>Lucy said something back, still holding the coffee cup in both hands.</p>\n<p>Clef said something else, leaning forward just a bit. He smiled.</p>\n<p>Lucy smiled back. She rolled her eyes and wiped moisture off her cheeks.</p>\n<p>Clef nodded and laughed. He leaned against the wall next to her, looking down at her and gesturing.</p>\n<p>Lucy began to play with her hair.</p>\n<p>Clef stroked his chin.</p>\n<p>Lucy began to stroke her face behind the ear.</p>\n<p>Clef winked.</p>\n<p>Lucy stroked her throat and collarbone.</p>\n<p>Clef came walking back down the aisle. He walked past the bathroom and into the galley.</p>\n<p>Lucy bit her lower lip, then followed Clef into the galley. There was the sound of a latch being undone, and a door opening.</p>\n<p>Dimitri counted to twenty, then poked his head into the galley as well. The ladder leading down to the baggage compartment was open. He slid down and into the darkened baggage compartment.</p>\n<p>The first thing he saw was Clef easing Lucy's unconscious body onto a cargo compartment. There was lipstick on his collar, and the doctor's previously buttoned-up Hawaiian shirt was opened up a bit. He tossed a ring of keys to Strelnikov. \"See if you can get our bags,\" he said. \"They're probably in one of those locked cargo containers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doktor,\" Strelnikov said patiently, \"Please just tell me this. What is point of finding bags now?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to leave them behind when we jump.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI no jump without chute. I have done this once, was not fun. Break many bone.\u201d Strelnikov opened the lockers and riffled around, grabbing the baggage and motioning for Clef to follow. \u201cI have better idea.\u201d They navigated the depths of the aircraft, working their way through access ways and maintenance corridors that usually only the lowliest of wing wipers ever have to crawl through. The aluminum skin of the aircraft vibrated from the air moving around it, and the noise was deafening. Finally, they stopped in the very bottom of aircraft.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wait, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The pilot had changed course, ostensibly heading where the Chechens had instructed him to, but in reality veering towards an abandoned military airstrip. The concrete along the runway was cracked in places, with weeds breaking through and angling skyward. The terminals had long since been bulldozed; all that remained now were a few rusting corrugated hangars and a dilapidated, disused control tower. He steadied his hands on the yoke, knuckles white and eyes alert, still shaken from the events earlier. Though he hadn\u2019t seen the massacre firsthand, Lucy had told him about it in grim detail. Where was she, anyway? He needed a drink, badly.</p>\n<p>The inboard flaps dropped a few degrees, then a few more, increasing the plane\u2019s lift and drag, flaring the nose slightly and slowing it down. The whine of the engines decreased in intensity, causing the aircraft to slowly descend toward the runway below. Clef and Dmitri felt the shudder of the fuselage as they lost altitude, and heard the telltale hydraulic hisses that indicated the undercarriage was about to drop.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on! Wait until we slow!\u201d Strelnikov shouted, but it was lost in the noise. Clef gave him a confused expression but knew enough about gravity to warrant already clutching the legs of the gear. The aircraft slowed, dropping to within a few hundred feet of the ground and flaring more, nearly within ground effect. The hatch covers dropped open and the landing gear unfolded, exposing them to a harsh burst of wind that threatened to tear them away, the ground below flashing by in a terrifying blur. The concrete rose to them with alarming speed as the pilot brought the big passenger liner down\u2014the wheels made contact and screeched in annoyance, reluctant to carry the tremendous weight.</p>\n<p>The pilot applied brakes and the aircraft decelerated, rolling to a stop at the end of the runway. They leapt from the undercarriage and sprinted across the tarmac to a nearby line of trees, looking back in time to see the ridiculous rubber slides inflate for the other passengers to make a considerably more undignified exit. They knelt in a small thicket of trees, watching to make sure nobody followed them.</p>\n<p>Aboard the aircraft, Lucy picked her head up and groaned. That son of a bitch\u2014and to think she almost <em>liked</em> him, despite who he worked for. She sighed and rubbed her temples, pulling a cell phone from a pocket of her uniform and dialing a secure line. The phone chirped and queried her for access codes, which she dutifully punched in, surprised that they were correct considering her foggy state of mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cLieutenant Parks, reporting. I have two probable Foundation assets, track from my location and prepare to deploy a shadowing team immediately.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"I have to admit,\" Clef said. \"Your idea was much better.\"</p>\n<p>The two men lurked in the treeline for a few minutes, watching the Special Forces soldiers board the plane and get the passengers out through the inflatable slides. A man in a black suit and tie was going from passenger to passenger asking questions: he seemed annoyed at not getting the answers he wanted. Up top, a young man in camouflage gear leaned out the left side doorway and vomited onto the tarmac. Finally, several men wearing medical garb started easing three stretcher-bound bodies down the slide.</p>\n<p>\"You want stay and watch more?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nah, I've seen enough. Let's get going.\"</p>\n<p>They moved silently through the underbrush, crossing the electrified fence with the aid of some wire cutters and a sleeping bag, and then made their way out into the desert. There was a cracked asphalt two-lane highway under the baking sun, stretching out into the distance.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" Clef said, grinning. \"It's not Brazil, but it's certainly far enough away from work for Glass. Let's go hitching.\"</p>\n<p>\"First we must find out where we are. Is not good if we wind up in Death Valley. Then is no other people for miles.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem, I'll just check my GPS.\" Clef said. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, turned it back on, and brought up the mapping software. \"FUCK,\" he growled. \"This is bad.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where we are? Bolivia? Death Valley?\"</p>\n<p>\"Worse,\" Clef said grimly. \"Texas.\"</p>\n<p>As if on cue, the silence was broken by the sound of a battered pickup truck coming around the bend. Two men in white cowboy hats pulled up to the agents, their rusty old Ford emblazoned with a Confederate flag across the back windshield, a pair of shotguns on the roof, and a dead deer across the hood. The strangers rolled down the window as their car ground to a halt by the side of the road. The man in the passenger seat, a grizzled-looking one-eyed cowboy with unruly black hair, spat tobacco juice on Strelnikov's shoes and sneered.</p>\n<p>\"Mind tellin' me what you pair of Mexican Jew lizard faggots are doin' in our neck of the woods?\" he growled.</p>\n<p>Clef and Dimitri shared a bemused glance. \"You have got be fucking with me,\" Dimitri muttered.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The blood boiled behind Strelnikov\u2019s eyes. He looked over their attire and felt a wave of nausea nearly overtake him\u2014how could anyone dress like this? He felt a sudden need to adjust his cap in a vain attempt to counteract their atrocious appearance. Clef just laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2018n the hell are ya\u2019 lookin\u2019 at, y\u2019stupid or somethin\u2019?\u201d The one-eyed cowboy leaned out the window as the driver turned down the radio, which had previously been blaring Toby Keith at an obnoxious volume. \u201cOh, lemme guess, you\u2019re one a\u2019 them commies, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spat again. \u201cI fought you assholes in \u2018Nam.\u201d The driver nodded. \u201cHe fought y\u2019assholes in \u2018Nam!\u201d Clef\u2019s smile grew to obscene proportions.</p>\n<p>Not being one to let a statement like this go unchallenged, Strelnikov immediately rose to the occasion and jabbed a finger in the man\u2019s face. \u201cYOU KNOW <em>NOTHING</em> OF WAR. I FIGHT IN CHECHYNA BOTH TIME AND I MEET <em>BABIES</em> ON THE BATTLEFIELD THAT WERE HAVE MORE HONOR THAN YOU, COWARD. MY GRANDFATHER TOOK BERLIN WHILE YOUR ANCESTORS SIT ON THEIR ASS DRINKING SCHNAPPS AND HOPING THAT THEY NOT HAVE TO FIGHT LIKE WE DID. YOUR ENTIRE COUNTRY IS <em>BABIES</em>. ALL OF YOU, <em>BABIES</em>.\u201d His finger trembled with rage while Clef suppressed a guffaw. The redneck stared at him in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Wot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Strelnikov punched him in the mouth.</p>\n<p>The redneck tumbled over, knocking his compatriot out his seat and onto the pavement. Clef was on him in a flash, hauling him up and securing his arms behind his back with an unhealthy cracking of joints. One-eye regained his composure admirably, and stepped out in front of Dmitri. \u201cY\u2019 stupid god damned commie, you god damned near broke my fuckin\u2019 face! What are ya, salty because you lost the fuckin\u2019 war?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was too much\u2014such an insult to his Russian patriotism could not be allowed to stand. With one hand he lifted the man off the ground by his neck and carted him off towards a dead, wiry tree. The cowboy flailed wildly, trying to strike him or push him away, but Strelnikov had a considerable size advantage. He briefly considered hanging the man, but lacking the rope to do so decided to secure him to the tree with one-eye\u2019s belt, Clef doing the same with the other. Two oversized lone star belt buckles shone in the hot southern sun as Clef and Strelnikov stalked away to their truck, leaving them to bake for a while.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho won the war now, jackass?\u201d Clef quipped as he climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. They drove for hours down the Texas highway, finding nothing but dust and clumps of rocks. Dmitri watched idly from the passenger seat, finding the vastness of the state reminding him somewhat of home, if much drier.</p>\n<p>Far behind, the two cowboys were delighted to see a black SUV pull off the road, with uniformed men disembarking and approaching them quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s about bloody time you got here,\u201d one-eye said haughtily.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they take the truck?\u201d Both of them nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Excellent. We\u2019ve got them now.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Stupid fucking American car,\" Clef grimaced. He slammed the hood down on the smoke-emitting engine and kicked impotently at the front bumper of the vehicle. \"Stupid fucking piece of shit. Ford really does stand for Fix or Replace Daily.\"</p>\n<p>\"We should be driving good Russian car. Like Lada. That is good solid vehicle. Not break down like shitty American car,\" Strelnikov offered.</p>\n<p>\"Do you ever fucking shut up about Russia? Ever?\" Clef retorted. \"Seriously, you've got like, a hard-on for the Motherland so big they can see it from orbit. Goddamn.\"</p>\n<p>\"You ever get tired being enormous fucking prick? Seriously, you have stick up ass so big can use it as flagpole!\" Strelnikov snarled.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck you, Dimitri! Fuck you, and FUCK Russia, and FUCK this stupid FUCKING vacation,\" Clef screamed, nearly going into histrionics. \"All I fucking wanted was to spend some fucking time in Brazil lying on the beach, working on my FUCKING tan, and maybe, just maybe, having sex with some South American honey, sex involving lots of cocoa butter and maybe some leather whips, and instead I'm out here in the middle of FUCKING NOWHERE TEXAS, Population YOU AND ME and we'll probably die of fucking heatstroke before too long!\"</p>\n<p>\"And how this is any of my fault!?\" Strelnikov shouted back, slamming his fists on the hood of the broken-down Ford.</p>\n<p>\"I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA!\" Clef screamed.</p>\n<p>That was when the two men heard a car horn honk behind them. They turned to see a cherry-red Camaro convertible with the top down idling by the side of the road. The car gleamed like a jewel.</p>\n<p>So did the three babes riding it.</p>\n<p>The driver was a brunette, her long, curly locks flowing over her bare shoulders, her honeyed skin glowing with sweat from the warm Texas sun. Her red lips were pursed playfully as she lowered her sunglasses and gave the two strangers a slightly amused look. Her friend in the passenger's side seat (a tanned blonde with flawless skin and gorgeous green eyes) leaned over and waved, while the redhead in the back seat popped her gum and winked.</p>\n<p>\"Hey boys,\" the brunette said. \"Seems like you're having a little car trouble. Need a lift?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 yes. Yes, we do,\" Strelnikov said.</p>\n<p>\"Well, it's a tight fit, but squeeze in! We'll give you a ride to town!\" the brunette said. She got up and opened the door of the camaro. Clef and Strelnikov could see that all three of the women were wearing daisy dukes, sandals, and not much else. All of them had bodies that would make supermodels green with envy, their voluptuous figures threatening to free themselves from their straining tops at any moment.</p>\n<p>Clef and Strelnikov gave each other a bemused look, their argument from moments before forgotten. \"This doesn't happen,\" Clef whispered. \"This NEVER happens. No one EVER gets picked up randomly by a hot trio of babes in the middle of nowhere, especially if they're a blonde, brunette, and redhead.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't question it, just smile and get in car,\" Dimitri whispered.</p>\n<p>Clef shook his head as he saw Strelnikov climb into the back seat, sandwiched by the blonde on one side and the redhead on the other, grinning as the two scantily clad women pressed up against him. He turned his eyes to the sky, beseechingly. \"You've gotta be fucking with me,\" he whispered.</p>\n<p>He got in the car anyway.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cHow far away is this strip club you two work at, anyway?\u201d Clef asked above the purr of the Camaro\u2019s engine. The brunette next to him just smiled and shook her head.</p>\n<p>They had driven for hours. Clef and Strelnikov had no idea where they were, but it wasn\u2019t really a concern\u2014they were more than content to allow the girls to fawn over them as much as they pleased. Clef sat in the front seat with the blonde in his lap, one arm around her waist and the other holding a drink. He whispered witty compliments in her ear like a suave Latin lover, making her laugh coyly and teasingly flick him on the nose. She smiled softly and threw her head back to check on Strelnikov and the redhead, her golden mane swishing across Clef\u2019s face as it twirled around.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, what is he doing?\u201d She asked Clef, tapping him on the shoulder. He craned his head to look, hearing a sound that could only be likened to \u201cblblblbblblblblb\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it looks like he\u2019s motorboating her.\u201d She gave him a quizzical look, and Strelnikov looked up from the other woman\u2019s bosom long enough to say in practiced English, \u201cIt is a rapid motion of the mouth across the breasts.\u201d</p>\n<p>She giggled and handed him another drink, which he held forward to Clef and toasted, the girls\u2019 smiles widening. Their heads lolled about and they couldn\u2019t help but notice that the telephone poles were whizzing by like blurs, the road becoming a mishmash of grays and whites from the evenly painted dividing lines. The sky spun like a top and together they fell into the darkness.</p>\n<p>\"Well, they're out,\" the blonde said.</p>\n<p>The other two girls sighed and relaxed. \"I thought they'd never drop,\" the brunette muttered. \"Seriously, how much flunitrazepam did we slip them, anyway?\"</p>\n<p>\"About three times the normal dose,\" the redhead sighed, pushing Strelnikov away and buttoning up her shirt. \"This guy was motorboating me all the way to the end, too.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, we're done now,\" sighed the blonde. \"Now it's time for the boys to do their work.\"</p>\n<p>The red convertible pulled into a side street that didn't appear on any maps. The black SUV reached them shortly after.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Wherever they were, it was freezing. They awoke groggily and were aware of only the blindfolds and the bindings around their hands and feet, the scuffling sounds they made echoing throughout the empty concrete room. A door opened and shut from behind them, and they heard the sound of boots on pavement approaching and circling them. Harsh light assaulted their eyes without warning when the blindfolds were abruptly torn off, revealing a trio of unhappy-looking men standing before them. They wore crisply pressed and immaculately tailored military style uniforms and were backlit by a naked incandescent light bulb.</p>\n<p>It took a moment for their eyes to adjust enough to be able to make out the GOC insignia printed on their breast pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d Strelnikov asked, blinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe data is, shall we say, \u2018redacted\u2019, as your people are so fond of putting it,\u201d responded one of the men.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gotta be fuckin\u2019 with me,\u201d Clef sighed exasperatedly.</p>\n<p>\"No, we are not fucking with you,\" the man in the uniform said. He pulled up a chair and sat across from the two men. A golden eagle insignia on his uniform collar gleamed in the dim light. \"We are through fucking with you. From this point forward, we are being serious.\"</p>\n<p>He pulled out a silver Zippo lighter with the words 'FUCK COMMUNISM' written on the side and lit up a large, black cigar. Clouds of acrid smoke billowed from the stogie, filling the room with dense white vapors. \"Now,\" the colonel said. \"You are going to tell us exactly what you two Foundation personnel were doing heading into a GOC operation in progress. What is your game? What are you trying to accomplish here?\"</p>\n<p>Clef and Strelnikov glanced at each other, then turned back to the colonel. \"What we're trying to accomplish\u2026 how do I put it\u2026\" Clef muttered.</p>\n<p>\"Are trying to relax, get drunk, and wet beaks,\" Strelnikov said.</p>\n<p>\"In no particular order,\" Clef added.</p>\n<p>\"Also am trying to work on tan,\" Dimitri said.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe visit some nice museums or do some wine tasting.\"</p>\n<p>\"Meet nice people.\"</p>\n<p>\"In other words, we're on vacation,\" Clef concluded.</p>\n<p>The colonel pulled a boot knife from the bag next to him and stuck it, point-down, into the table. \"Armed pretty heavily for a bunch of guys on vacation,\" the colonel pointed out, taking out a bunch of knives and small explosives from the bag next to him and laying them out on the table.</p>\n<p>\"Actually, we're not,\" Clef pointed out. \"No guns, for one thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Da, and only one knife. No hatchet. Left SVD at home,\" Dimitri added.</p>\n<p>\"Really, what's a bit of C-4 between friends? Here in Texas, that's almost like owning a car.\"</p>\n<p>\"Detonator is not even primed. Am not stupid, don't want blow up plane.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really. So\u2026 you aren't on a secret mission for the Foundation? You aren't the backup called in by a Foundation operative six days ago in response to escalating KTE activity?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not at all.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did not even want to go to Texas,\" Dimitri insisted. \"Wanted go to Brazil.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really,\" murmured the colonel. He gestured to the screen behind him. The image of a young man with a black eye, wearing a brightly colored hawaiian print shirt, appeared on the screen, flanked by gun-toting soldiers. \"This is from our Rio de Janeiro office. Does this man look familiar?\"</p>\n<p>The guy in the hawaiian shirt raised his head groggily and stared at the screen. His eyes lit up. \"Doctor Clef! Dimitri!\" Agent Yoric laughed. \"Are you here to rescue me?\"</p>\n<p>The two men stared at Yoric for a moment, then glanced at each other, then looked back at the colonel. \"I have never seen or met this man in my entire life,\" Clef lied.</p>\n<p>\"Is total stranger,\" Dimitri said.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 you've got to be fucking kidding me,\" Yoric whimpered.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"\u2026 and what happened after that?\" Dr. Glass asked. The psychiatrist was resting his chin on his hand, gazing at the three men sitting in his office with an expression of spellbound fascination.</p>\n<p>\"Well\u2026\" Clef said. \"We couldn't leave Yoric behind.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 so we break free of captors and gun them all down,\" Dmitri finished.</p>\n<p>\"Then we highjacked a GOC plane\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Boat,\" Dmitri corrected.</p>\n<p>\"Was it a boat?\" Clef wondered. \"I thought it was a plane\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"My report said boat,\" Dmitri explained pointedly.</p>\n<p>Clef blinked once, very slowly, then smiled. \"It was a seaplane.\"</p>\n<p>\"Da,\" Dmitri said, much relieved. \"Seaplane. That explain confusion.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. So after we highjacked the GOC <em>seaplane</em>, we flew down to Rio de Janeiro, found Yoric, and rescued him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" Glass said, very slowly. \"And this is why you guys were late coming back from vacation?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, we couldn't just fly back right away,\" Clef said.</p>\n<p>\"GOC was looking for us. Very dangerous.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't want to go back to their torture chamber,\" Yoric whimpered.</p>\n<p>\"So, we disguised ourselves as tourists and waited for them to give up looking.\"</p>\n<p>\"Disguised\u2026 as tourists,\" Glass repeated.</p>\n<p>\"Um\u2026 yes. As rich corporate executives on vacation\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. And this explains the\u2026\" Glass ran an eye down the page of the document in front of him. \"\u2026 six nights at a luxury 4-star hotel, five thousand-plus dollars in restaurant and liquor bills, and\u2026 good lord, you bought HOW many condoms? And why six bikinis?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 the young ladies forgot theirs,\" Clef said, \"and they didn't want to go into the hot tub naked.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 Dr. Clef. My dear agents. I was not born yesterday. The Foundation Expense Fund is for emergency expenses in the line of duty. It is not to be used to fund a week of debauchery on the taxpayers' dollar, and your ludicrous story is both insulting to my intelligence and\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, as if they had rehearsed this (and perhaps they had), the three men reached into the breast pockets of their hawaiian shirts and pulled out three newspaper clippings and laid them on the desk in front of Glass.</p>\n<p><strong>UNKNOWN HEROES FOIL CHECHEN HIJACKERS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TEXAS MILITIAMEN FOUND GUNNED DOWN IN DESERT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BLOODSHED IN RIO!

The figure sitting in the chair across from him slowly blinked its uncannily colorful eyes (damn it, he could never figure out what color they were supposed to be) and carefully read the pink slip of paper in his hand. \"Your psychological evaluation indicates that it's been years since you last took a break. You need to let off some steam.\"\n\n\n\n\"I did have a break. I took a very nice trip to Italy,\" Clef said levelly.\n\n\n\n\"I went to bar. Was fun. Met new friends,\" Strelnikov insisted.\n\n\n\n\"A covert mission with six MTF operatives to eliminate a target is not a vacation, and nor are the five weeks in the hospital spent recovering from that nasty gut wound either.\" Dr. Glass sighed. \"Look. Just take the damn vacation. I don't care where you go, or what you do, just spend at least one week where you're not worrying about the fate of the world.\"\n\n\n\n\"That would be. . . difficult,\" Clef said, folding the piece of paper into precise thirds. \"Might as well ask me to stop breathing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is stupid,\" said the other man sitting across from the psychologist, as he glared at his own pink slip of paper. \"Is not like Chechens will stop being Chechens because I'm fatigued. War is not nine-to-five job.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then. . . at least make saving the world a secondary priority. Think of it as. . . periodic maintenance. You take your car in for a tune-up every ten thousand miles. This is your time to get a tune-up.\" Dr. Glass sighed.\n\n\n\n\"Can't I get a tune-up in the shop? Perhaps I could spend some time at the training facility instead, or in the field. . .\" Clef muttered.\n\n\n\n\"Can spend time drinking vodka. That is proper Russian vacation.\"\n\n\n\n\"No. No field operations, no training, no paperwork, nothing. Just. . . get some rest. You've certainly earned it. Enjoy your vacations, gentlemen.\"\n\n\n\nThe door closed with a kind of epic finality, leaving two of the most dangerous men in the Foundation standing in the hallway, clutching pink slips like a pair of delinquent teenagers sent to the principal's office. The entire support staff of the Human Resources and Training division sat in their cubicles studiously staring at their monitors. One of them, a young lady wearing a very nice pantsuit, was desperately typing the Lord's Prayer over and over into Notepad. Another was whispering a Buddhist sutra under his breath.\n\n\n\nThe tension was finally broken by a sigh from Clef, who rubbed the back of his neck with the pink slip of paper. \"So,\" he said, \"I hear Brazil is nice this time of year.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe airport bar was crowded, full of weary passengers stopping in to have a bite to eat and a few drinks before allowing themselves to be carted off in the big Airbuses and Boeings. Strelnikov and Clef strolled in quietly and took the only two empty seats at the long bar, nodding curtly to the bartender and those next to them before settling in for the two hour wait. Their attire was ostentatious and drew odd looks from the other patrons: Strelnikov in his olive drab dress uniform with peaked cap, and Clef in a Hawaiian shirt with obscene portrayals of people engaging in coitus printed in flamboyant colors. \n\n\n\nTheir chosen drinks said much about their character. The bartender, hair in a muss from a long day, pointed at Clef and made eye contact, silently inquiring.\n\n\n\n\u201cBombay Sapphire Martini, stirred, not shaken, two ice cubes only, 6:1 gin and vermouth, two olives, one onion, and if you bruise the vermouth god help you,\u201d Clef responded dryly, as if the bartender should have already known. The bartender\u2019s expression went blank for a moment, before he nodded slowly and turned to Strelnikov. \u201cAnd you, sir?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cVodka.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat with?\u201d\n\n\n\nStrelnikov gave him the dirtiest of looks. \u201c...Ice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAny preferred brand?\u201d\n\n\n\nDmitri\u2019s stare hardened and he clenched his fists on the bar. \u201c//Vodka//. With //ice.//\u201d\n\n\n\nThe alcohol was forthcoming and it both lightened their mood and loosened their tongues accordingly as they imbibed. As the first rounds went through them, they developed a lively and appropriate discussion.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou see, Dmitri, a good drink is smooth\u2014you have just a small sip and the flavor and aromas combine and are enough to take your breath away. It\u2019s like the touch of a beautiful woman, something exquisite and rare, something you hold in your hand and show people so they can see what a classy son of a bitch you are.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDrink? Drink is not status or class symbol, Doktor Clef. Drink is a drink. You drink it. And you get drunk. And then you are drink more, until you have drink so much that is make you sober again.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve understood.\u201d\n\n\n\nTheir spirited debate continued, beginning to draw the attention of the other customers. Slowly their heads and chairs swiveled to lock on the two oddly dressed gentlemen as they argued and jabbed at one another\u2019s tastes. As their collection of empty vodka and martini glasses grew and grew, the argument mellowed and became a happy, family oriented story telling extravaganza.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to see his face when I killed him, Dmitri. That\u2019s why I had the snipers hold their fire. See, I came in behind him like this,\u201d accompanied with gesticulation of the hands, \u201cand swiped him across the face with my pistol. Then he stabbed me and some things happened, and blah blah blah, I ended up in a hospital for a few weeks. Good times.\u201d \n\n\n\nStrelnikov nodded approvingly. \u201cIn Chechnya, our supplies always run low. So I was force to hold my fire many time and resort to use of bayonet.\u201d He waggled a finger and pointed at Clef, \u201cMany Chechens get it in the face and neck, Doktor Clef. Many. Much blood.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEver drive over thirty people in a tank?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDoes armored personnel carrier count? What about unarm combat, you snap necks?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe spine is usually easier for me, Dmitri. A lot of people prefer the traditional twisting-head neck snapping action but I usually stick with grabbing them by the hair and shoving a boot into the small of their back as hard as I can. It\u2019s a personal preference really.\u201d Strelnikov couldn\u2019t argue with that.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce, on night mission, we find rebel camp in bombed warehouse. I send two team, yes?\u201d He holds up two fingers. \u201cTwo team, into each entrance, and I climb through window alone, with just knife and pistol. They were sleep, guards sleep, everyone was sleep. We come in and slit all of their throats in the night and leave them for crows.\u201d He coughs. \u201cLater that night I find out there had been a mutual cease fire called,\u201d he concludes with a shrug.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, man, I know. Once, I was trying an experimental chainsaw that we thought was a possible item for containment. There ended up being a D-Class riot and, well, I was on hand with the chainsaw and one thing led to another. Next thing I know, I\u2019m standing on a pile of D-Class bodies holding the saw over my head and screaming in bloodlust, then someone comes in and tells me it was just the annual costume party and half of my research staff is now dead.\u201d A shrug. \u201cTurns out the saw was just a normal saw, too.\u201d Strelnikov nodded sadly, feeling Clef\u2019s disappointment, pausing for a moment and then saying quietly:\n\n\n\n\u201cI was just kid about cease fire, Doktor Clef.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Oh. I wasn\u2019t. It really was a costume party.\u201d\n\n\n\nDmitri sighed and turned back to the bar and asked for another drink, except nobody answered. He craned his head over the bar and found the bartender, pale as a ghost, trembling on the floor with a phone in his hand, poised to dial. Strelnikov shrugged and plucked the bottle himself, pouring a glass and turning back to face Clef. He took a quick look behind him.\n\n\n\nThe bar was completely empty.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"Considering who we work for, you'd think they could afford to give us better seats than coach,\" Clef griped. \"Seriously. Charging us five bucks for a dry ham sandwich and a half can of soda. This is highway robbery.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is better than Aeroflot in 1980s,\" Dimitri pointed out. \"Food recognizable. Cabin actually pressurized. Stewardesses smile at you instead of scream.\" He raised an eyebrow at the attractive young lady coming down the aisle with the beverage cart. \"And are much prettier. Aeroflot stewardesses all fat old bitches with horse face.\"\n\n\n\n\"I dunno, a boiled beet and some horse-leather meat might actually be a step up from this. . . thing. What the hell are these little green flecks, anyway?\" Clef muttered, poking the sandwich with his finger. \"Lizard bits?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe is sperm from 682. Big lizard wet his beak in your sandwich, no?\" Strelnikov quipped, making a \"jerking off\" motion with his left hand.\n\n\n\n\"I wish, it would improve the taste. . . excuse me, miss? Miss?\" Clef said, reaching across Dimitri from his window seat to tap the stewardess on the elbow. \"I'm sorry, miss, but you seem to have messed up my order. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, not a pus and plastic one. From the taste of this, it seems that you've confused the two.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see, sir,\" the stewardess sighed. \"I'm sorry you don't like the taste of your sandwich. If you'd like a refund. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't want a goddamn refund, I want an edible sandwich,\" Clef interrupted. \"Now, I'm sure that somewhere in that cart under the piles of dried-out human ejaculate and styrofoam sponge, you've got something edible, so how about bending that pretty ass over and looking a little harder, sweet cheeks?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhh,\" the stewardess said. She turned to Dr. Clef and grinned, a wide, mirthless smile showing too many teeth. \"So, I see, what you're really trying to say is that //you're// the asshole here!\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe leaned across Dimitri, her voice low and stern, but carrying through the suddenly silent cavern, as she addressed the bemused Clef. \"Listen up, bucko. I don't make the damn food, I just serve it. If you've got a problem, you can write a goddamn letter to the people who do. But wait until we get on the ground. Until then, it's another six hours to S\u00e3o Paulo, and I'll be damned if I have to spend it listening to you bitch the whole way. So either shut up and eat your sandwich or stop complaining about it, or I'll duct tape your mouth shut and tape you to the chair.\" She stood up straight. \"And my name's not sweet cheeks, asshole. It's Lucy.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a moment of stunned silence, broken by a smattering of applause, then the stewardess continued down the aisle, serving sodas and coffees to the other, appreciative passengers. Clef leaned back and smiled. \"I like her,\" he admitted. \"Girl's got spirit.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's nice,\" Dimitri sighed. He unbuckled his seatbelt and stood up slowly.\n\n\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Clef asked. \"The in-flight movie's about to start.\"\n\n\n\n\"To take a shit. . . and pretend I don't know you,\" Dimitri said.\n\n\n\nClef shrugged and leaned his chair back as far as he could, ignoring the angry stare from the fat lady in the seat behind him. He was just drifting to sleep when a loud scuffling sound and scream drew his attention.\n\n\n\n\"DO NOT MOVE!\" screamed the bearded man, who held a knife to the throat of Lucy the flight attendant. There were two other men, holding similar weapons: one held a hand grenade, pin out, over his head. All three were wearing kaffiyehs and camouflage t-shirts. \"This plane now belongs to the Holy Army of the Chechen Independent Republic!\"\n\n\n\n\"Allahu Akbar!\" screamed one of the other men. \"God is great! Long Live Chechnya!\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you have got to be fucking kidding me,\" Clef winced.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe jostling of the aircraft in the turbulent skies made it difficult for Strelnikov to piss. It always struck him as odd; he\u2019d have no qualms about jumping out of an airplane into a combat zone, but something as simple as taking a leak inside of one gave him hell. The complexities and nuances of the human psyche escaped him at the time, and he chided himself for \u201cbeing a pansy.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe finally got control of himself and was about to go when the door was rudely kicked open and someone grabbed him by the shoulder, dragging him into the aisle. He quickly buttoned himself and stumbled along, too surprised to offer effective resistance. The Chechen took a good look at his uniform and noticed the Russian crest on his hat\u2014with a quick decision he began dragging him to the front of the aircraft.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cCaught with your pants down, Dmitri?\u201d Clef muttered as they dragged Strelnikov between the rows of seats, the irony of his witticism wasted. Thinking quickly, he threw his foot out into the aisle just in time to catch the Chechen\u2019s ankle, sending him face first into the carpet and taking Dmitri down with him. The two others immediately rushed forward to try and subdue Clef, one still holding the hand grenade over his head and shouting angrily in a Chechen-Russian dialect. \n\n\n\nStrelnikov immediately recognized it. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey were Chechens. \n\n\n\nThey were on the plane. His plane.\n\n\n\nThere were Chechens on his plane. Three of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2026That is three too many,\u201d he said out loud. Clef gave him an odd look as he immediately began biting the tripped man\u2019s nose, drawing a short knife from the inside of a jackboot and proceeding to punch the man in the kidneys. With the knife. \n\n\n\nClef wasted no time and nearly leapt over the heads of the terrified passengers in front of him, lunging for the approaching men. He connected with the one carrying the knife, knocking him to the floor also. Clef hauled back and slammed the palm of his hand into the man\u2019s face, quickly shattering the bridge of the man\u2019s nose. The man winced and staggered back, clutching his heavily bleeding nose, as Clef casually disarmed him with a complicated aikido wrist lock. He then drove the knife into the man's heart as Strelnikov finished rendering his man into a bloody, dying mess.\n\n\n\nThere was only one left, still holding the hand grenade and seemingly unsure of what to do now that their plan had completely deteriorated. \"Don't move!\" he screamed. \"I have a bomb!\"\n\n\n\nSimultaneously, Clef and Dmitri rotated their heads upward, rising from the bloodied corpses like something out of a cheap horror flick, except instead of a dramatic musical score, there was only the wailing of the outboard turbofans as the pilot increased throttle. \"I don't care,\" Clef said.\n\n\n\nDmitri just smiled. Steel teeth gleamed.\n\n\n\nThe terrorist's eyes darted nervously between the two men, and he took a frightened step backward.\n\n\n\nIt would be his last. Lucy\u2019s foot caught the man in the back of the knee and sent him stumbling forward, right into Strelnikov\u2019s knife. Clef deftly snatched the grenade from the man\u2019s hand, paying careful attention to make sure he kept pressure on the spoon. Dmitri\u2019s bloodied steel teeth glistened underneath the cabin lighting, offering the man a most disquieting last sight of this earth. \n\n\n\nHe withdrew the knife as violently as he had inserted it, a spray of blood splashing across the passengers nearest him, letting the body collapse supine on the floor. The occupants of the cabin stared in shock and awe at the brief, bloody conflict, offering no applause as Clef took his seat, grenade in hand. Strelnikov walked past, heading aft.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have to make piss.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"We have a problem,\" Clef said, when Dimitri came out of the restroom, buttoning up his pants. Compared to the Russian, who was a bloody, gory mess, the stuck-up prick had somehow managed to avoid getting any blood on him at all, despite the violence of the past few minutes.\n\n\n\n\"No problem. Chechens dead now,\" Strelnikov pointed out.\n\n\n\n\"That's the problem. Three dead terrorists on an airplane, a plane full of grateful passengers, media, heroism, a parade, our faces in the paper? Do you see where I'm going with this?\" Clef pointed out.\n\n\n\nStrelnikov considered the implications of the Director's words. \"Inconvenient,\" he murmured. \"Doktor Glass will lecture us muchly about definition of 'relaxation' and 'low profile.'\"\n\n\n\n\"To say the least. Wait here. Then follow my lead when you have a moment.\"\n\n\n\nThe gangly, big-nosed doctor took a deep breath, then squared his shoulders and walked back down the aisle, to where the rather shaken young stewardess was sitting in the front of the plane, nursing a cup of coffee. Strelnikov couldn't hear what he said over the sound of the plane engines, but he could see the way that their body language changed.\n\n\n\nClef said something while standing back near the front row.\n\n\n\nLucy said something back, still holding the coffee cup in both hands. \n\n\n\nClef said something else, leaning forward just a bit. He smiled. \n\n\n\nLucy smiled back. She rolled her eyes and wiped moisture off her cheeks.\n\n\n\nClef nodded and laughed. He leaned against the wall next to her, looking down at her and gesturing.\n\n\n\nLucy began to play with her hair.\n\n\n\nClef stroked his chin.\n\n\n\nLucy began to stroke her face behind the ear.\n\n\n\nClef winked.\n\n\n\nLucy stroked her throat and collarbone.\n\n\n\nClef came walking back down the aisle. He walked past the bathroom and into the galley.\n\n\n\nLucy bit her lower lip, then followed Clef into the galley. There was the sound of a latch being undone, and a door opening.\n\n\n\nDimitri counted to twenty, then poked his head into the galley as well. The ladder leading down to the baggage compartment was open. He slid down and into the darkened baggage compartment.\n\n\n\nThe first thing he saw was Clef easing Lucy's unconscious body onto a cargo compartment. There was lipstick on his collar, and the doctor's previously buttoned-up Hawaiian shirt was opened up a bit. He tossed a ring of keys to Strelnikov. \"See if you can get our bags,\" he said. \"They're probably in one of those locked cargo containers.\"\n\n\n\n\"Doktor,\" Strelnikov said patiently, \"Please just tell me this. What is point of finding bags now?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to leave them behind when we jump.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cI no jump without chute. I have done this once, was not fun. Break many bone.\u201d Strelnikov opened the lockers and riffled around, grabbing the baggage and motioning for Clef to follow. \u201cI have better idea.\u201d They navigated the depths of the aircraft, working their way through access ways and maintenance corridors that usually only the lowliest of wing wipers ever have to crawl through. The aluminum skin of the aircraft vibrated from the air moving around it, and the noise was deafening. Finally, they stopped in the very bottom of aircraft.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wait, now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pilot had changed course, ostensibly heading where the Chechens had instructed him to, but in reality veering towards an abandoned military airstrip. The concrete along the runway was cracked in places, with weeds breaking through and angling skyward. The terminals had long since been bulldozed; all that remained now were a few rusting corrugated hangars and a dilapidated, disused control tower. He steadied his hands on the yoke, knuckles white and eyes alert, still shaken from the events earlier. Though he hadn\u2019t seen the massacre firsthand, Lucy had told him about it in grim detail. Where was she, anyway? He needed a drink, badly.\n\n\n\nThe inboard flaps dropped a few degrees, then a few more, increasing the plane\u2019s lift and drag, flaring the nose slightly and slowing it down. The whine of the engines decreased in intensity, causing the aircraft to slowly descend toward the runway below. Clef and Dmitri felt the shudder of the fuselage as they lost altitude, and heard the telltale hydraulic hisses that indicated the undercarriage was about to drop.\n\n\n\n\u201cHold on! Wait until we slow!\u201d Strelnikov shouted, but it was lost in the noise. Clef gave him a confused expression but knew enough about gravity to warrant already clutching the legs of the gear.\u00a0\u00a0The aircraft slowed, dropping to within a few hundred feet of the ground and flaring more, nearly within ground effect. The hatch covers dropped open and the landing gear unfolded, exposing them to a harsh burst of wind that threatened to tear them away, the ground below flashing by in a terrifying blur. The concrete rose to them with alarming speed as the pilot brought the big passenger liner down\u2014the wheels made contact and screeched in annoyance, reluctant to carry the tremendous weight.\n\n\n\nThe pilot applied brakes and the aircraft decelerated, rolling to a stop at the end of the runway. They leapt from the undercarriage and sprinted across the tarmac to a nearby line of trees, looking back in time to see the ridiculous rubber slides inflate for the other passengers to make a considerably more undignified exit. They knelt in a small thicket of trees, watching to make sure nobody followed them.\n\n\n\nAboard the aircraft, Lucy picked her head up and groaned. That son of a bitch\u2014and to think she almost //liked// him, despite who he worked for. She sighed and rubbed her temples, pulling a cell phone from a pocket of her uniform and dialing a secure line. The phone chirped and queried her for access codes, which she dutifully punched in, surprised that they were correct considering her foggy state of mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cLieutenant Parks, reporting. I have two probable Foundation\u00a0\u00a0assets, track from my location and prepare to deploy a shadowing team immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"I have to admit,\" Clef said. \"Your idea was much better.\"\n\n\n\nThe two men lurked in the treeline for a few minutes, watching the Special Forces soldiers board the plane and get the passengers out through the inflatable slides. A man in a black suit and tie was going from passenger to passenger asking questions: he seemed annoyed at not getting the answers he wanted. Up top, a young man in camouflage gear leaned out the left side doorway and vomited onto the tarmac. Finally, several men wearing medical garb started easing three stretcher-bound bodies down the slide.\n\n\n\n\"You want stay and watch more?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nah, I've seen enough. Let's get going.\"\n\n\n\nThey moved silently through the underbrush, crossing the electrified fence with the aid of some wire cutters and a sleeping bag, and then made their way out into the desert. There was a cracked asphalt two-lane highway under the baking sun, stretching out into the distance.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" Clef said, grinning. \"It's not Brazil, but it's certainly far enough away from work for Glass. Let's go hitching.\"\n\n\n\n\"First we must find out where we are. Is not good if we wind up in Death Valley. Then is no other people for miles.\"\n\n\n\n\"No problem, I'll just check my GPS.\" Clef said. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, turned it back on, and brought up the mapping software. \"FUCK,\" he growled. \"This is bad.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where we are? Bolivia? Death Valley?\"\n\n\n\n\"Worse,\" Clef said grimly. \"Texas.\"\n\n\n\nAs if on cue, the silence was broken by the sound of a battered pickup truck coming around the bend. Two men in white cowboy hats pulled up to the agents, their rusty old Ford emblazoned with a Confederate flag across the back windshield, a pair of shotguns on the roof, and a dead deer across the hood. The strangers rolled down the window as their car ground to a halt by the side of the road. The man in the passenger seat, a grizzled-looking one-eyed cowboy with unruly black hair, spat tobacco juice on Strelnikov's shoes and sneered.\n\n\n\n\"Mind tellin' me what you pair of Mexican Jew lizard faggots are doin' in our neck of the woods?\" he growled.\n\n\n\nClef and Dimitri shared a bemused glance. \"You have got be fucking with me,\" Dimitri muttered.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe blood boiled behind Strelnikov\u2019s eyes. He looked over their attire and felt a wave of nausea nearly overtake him\u2014how could anyone dress like this? He felt a sudden need to adjust his cap in a vain attempt to counteract their atrocious appearance. Clef just laughed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat \u2018n the hell are ya\u2019 lookin\u2019 at, y\u2019stupid or somethin\u2019?\u201d The one-eyed cowboy leaned out the window as the driver turned down the radio, which had previously been blaring Toby Keith at an obnoxious volume. \u201cOh, lemme guess, you\u2019re one a\u2019 them commies, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spat again. \u201cI fought you assholes in \u2018Nam.\u201d The driver nodded. \u201cHe fought y\u2019assholes in \u2018Nam!\u201d Clef\u2019s smile grew to obscene proportions.\n\n\n\nNot being one to let a statement like this go unchallenged, Strelnikov immediately rose to the occasion and jabbed a finger in the man\u2019s face. \u201cYOU KNOW //NOTHING// OF WAR. I FIGHT IN CHECHYNA BOTH TIME AND I MEET //BABIES// ON THE BATTLEFIELD THAT WERE HAVE MORE HONOR THAN YOU, COWARD. MY GRANDFATHER TOOK BERLIN WHILE YOUR ANCESTORS SIT ON THEIR ASS DRINKING SCHNAPPS AND HOPING THAT THEY NOT HAVE TO FIGHT LIKE WE DID. YOUR ENTIRE COUNTRY IS //BABIES//. ALL OF YOU, //BABIES//.\u201d His finger trembled with rage while Clef suppressed a guffaw. The redneck stared at him in confusion.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Wot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0Strelnikov punched him in the mouth.\n\n\n\n\u00a0The redneck tumbled over, knocking his compatriot out his seat and onto the pavement. Clef was on him in a flash, hauling him up and securing his arms behind his back with an unhealthy cracking of joints. One-eye regained his composure admirably, and stepped out in front of Dmitri. \u201cY\u2019 stupid god damned commie, you god damned near broke my fuckin\u2019 face! What are ya, salty because you lost the fuckin\u2019 war?\u201d \n\n\n\nIt was too much\u2014such an insult to his Russian patriotism could not be allowed to stand. With one hand he lifted the man off the ground by his neck and carted him off towards a dead, wiry tree. The cowboy flailed wildly, trying to strike him or push him away, but Strelnikov had a considerable size advantage. He briefly considered hanging the man, but lacking the rope to do so decided to secure him to the tree with one-eye\u2019s belt, Clef doing the same with the other. Two oversized lone star belt buckles shone in the hot southern sun as Clef and Strelnikov stalked away to their truck, leaving them to bake for a while. \n\n\n\n\u201cWho won the war now, jackass?\u201d Clef quipped as he climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. They drove for hours down the Texas highway, finding nothing but dust and clumps of rocks. Dmitri watched idly from the passenger seat, finding the vastness of the state reminding him somewhat of home, if much drier.\n\n\n\nFar behind, the two cowboys were delighted to see a black SUV pull off the road, with uniformed men disembarking and approaching them quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s about bloody time you got here,\u201d one-eye said haughtily.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid they take the truck?\u201d Both of them nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Excellent. We\u2019ve got them now.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"Stupid fucking American car,\" Clef grimaced. He slammed the hood down on the smoke-emitting engine and kicked impotently at the front bumper of the vehicle. \"Stupid fucking piece of shit. Ford really does stand for Fix or Replace Daily.\"\n\n\n\n\"We should be driving good Russian car. Like Lada. That is good solid vehicle. Not break down like shitty American car,\" Strelnikov offered.\n\n\n\n\"Do you ever fucking shut up about Russia? Ever?\" Clef retorted. \"Seriously, you've got like, a hard-on for the Motherland so big they can see it from orbit. Goddamn.\"\n\n\n\n\"You ever get tired being enormous fucking prick? Seriously, you have stick up ass so big can use it as flagpole!\" Strelnikov snarled.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck you, Dimitri! Fuck you, and FUCK Russia, and FUCK this stupid FUCKING vacation,\" Clef screamed, nearly going into histrionics. \"All I fucking wanted was to spend some fucking time in Brazil lying on the beach, working on my FUCKING tan, and maybe, just maybe, having sex with some South American honey, sex involving lots of cocoa butter and maybe some leather whips, and instead I'm out here in the middle of FUCKING NOWHERE TEXAS, Population YOU AND ME and we'll probably die of fucking heatstroke before too long!\"\n\n\n\n\"And how this is any of my fault!?\" Strelnikov shouted back, slamming his fists on the hood of the broken-down Ford.\n\n\n\n\"I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA!\" Clef screamed.\n\n\n\nThat was when the two men heard a car horn honk behind them. They turned to see a cherry-red Camaro convertible with the top down idling by the side of the road. The car gleamed like a jewel. \n\n\n\nSo did the three babes riding it.\n\n\n\nThe driver was a brunette, her long, curly locks flowing over her bare shoulders, her honeyed skin glowing with sweat from the warm Texas sun. Her red lips were pursed playfully as she lowered her sunglasses and gave the two strangers a slightly amused look. Her friend in the passenger's side seat (a tanned blonde with flawless skin and gorgeous green eyes) leaned over and waved, while the redhead in the back seat popped her gum and winked.\n\n\n\n\"Hey boys,\" the brunette said. \"Seems like you're having a little car trouble. Need a lift?\"\n\n\n\n\". . . yes. Yes, we do,\" Strelnikov said.\n\n\n\n\"Well, it's a tight fit, but squeeze in! We'll give you a ride to town!\" the brunette said. She got up and opened the door of the camaro. Clef and Strelnikov could see that all three of the women were wearing daisy dukes, sandals, and not much else. All of them had bodies that would make supermodels green with envy, their voluptuous figures threatening to free themselves from their straining tops at any moment.\n\n\n\nClef and Strelnikov gave each other a bemused look, their argument from moments before forgotten. \"This doesn't happen,\" Clef whispered. \"This NEVER happens. No one EVER gets picked up randomly by a hot trio of babes in the middle of nowhere, especially if they're a blonde, brunette, and redhead.\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't question it, just smile and get in car,\" Dimitri whispered.\n\n\n\nClef shook his head as he saw Strelnikov climb into the back seat, sandwiched by the blonde on one side and the redhead on the other, grinning as the two scantily clad women pressed up against him. He turned his eyes to the sky, beseechingly. \"You've gotta be fucking with me,\" he whispered.\n\n\n\nHe got in the car anyway.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cHow far away is this strip club you two work at, anyway?\u201d Clef asked above the purr of the Camaro\u2019s engine. The brunette next to him just smiled and shook her head.\n\n\n\nThey had driven for hours. Clef and Strelnikov had no idea where they were, but it wasn\u2019t really a concern\u2014they were more than content to allow the girls to fawn over them as much as they pleased. Clef sat in the front seat with the blonde in his lap, one arm around her waist and the other holding a drink. He whispered witty compliments in her ear like a suave Latin lover, making her laugh coyly and teasingly flick him on the nose. She smiled softly and threw her head back to check on Strelnikov and the redhead, her golden mane swishing across Clef\u2019s face as it twirled around.\n\n\n\n\u201cEr, what is he doing?\u201d She asked Clef, tapping him on the shoulder. He craned his head to look, hearing a sound that could only be likened to \u201cblblblbblblblblb\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, it looks like he\u2019s motorboating her.\u201d She gave him a quizzical look, and Strelnikov looked up from the other woman\u2019s bosom long enough to say in practiced English, \u201cIt is a rapid motion of the mouth across the breasts.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe giggled and handed him another drink, which he held forward to Clef and toasted, the girls\u2019 smiles widening. Their heads lolled about and they couldn\u2019t help but notice that the telephone poles were whizzing by like blurs, the road becoming a mishmash of grays and whites from the evenly painted dividing lines. The sky spun like a top and together they fell into the darkness. \n\n\n\n\"Well, they're out,\" the blonde said.\n\n\n\nThe other two girls sighed and relaxed. \"I thought they'd never drop,\" the brunette muttered. \"Seriously, how much flunitrazepam did we slip them, anyway?\"\n\n\n\n\"About three times the normal dose,\" the redhead sighed, pushing Strelnikov away and buttoning up her shirt. \"This guy was motorboating me all the way to the end, too.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, we're done now,\" sighed the blonde. \"Now it's time for the boys to do their work.\"\n\n\n\nThe red convertible pulled into a side street that didn't appear on any maps. The black SUV reached them shortly after.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWherever they were, it was freezing. They awoke groggily and were aware of only the blindfolds and the bindings around their hands and feet, the scuffling sounds they made echoing throughout the empty concrete room. A door opened and shut from behind them, and they heard the sound of boots on pavement approaching and circling them. Harsh light assaulted their eyes without warning when the blindfolds were abruptly torn off, revealing a trio of unhappy-looking men standing before them. They wore crisply pressed and immaculately tailored military style uniforms and were backlit by a naked incandescent light bulb.\n\n\n\n\u00a0It took a moment for their eyes to adjust enough to be able to make out the GOC insignia printed on their breast pockets.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d Strelnikov asked, blinking.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe data is, shall we say, \u2018redacted\u2019, as your people are so fond of putting it,\u201d responded one of the men.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou gotta be fuckin\u2019 with me,\u201d Clef sighed exasperatedly.\n\n\n\n\"No, we are not fucking with you,\" the man in the uniform said. He pulled up a chair and sat across from the two men. A golden eagle insignia on his uniform collar gleamed in the dim light. \"We are through fucking with you. From this point forward, we are being serious.\" \n\n\n\nHe pulled out a silver Zippo lighter with the words 'FUCK COMMUNISM' written on the side and lit up a large, black cigar. Clouds of acrid smoke billowed from the stogie, filling the room with dense white vapors. \"Now,\" the colonel said. \"You are going to tell us exactly what you two Foundation personnel were doing heading into a GOC operation in progress. What is your game? What are you trying to accomplish here?\"\n\n\n\nClef and Strelnikov glanced at each other, then turned back to the colonel. \"What we're trying to accomplish. . . how do I put it. . .\" Clef muttered.\n\n\n\n\"Are trying to relax, get drunk, and wet beaks,\" Strelnikov said.\n\n\n\n\"In no particular order,\" Clef added.\n\n\n\n\"Also am trying to work on tan,\" Dimitri said.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe visit some nice museums or do some wine tasting.\"\n\n\n\n\"Meet nice people.\"\n\n\n\n\"In other words, we're on vacation,\" Clef concluded.\n\n\n\nThe colonel pulled a boot knife from the bag next to him and stuck it, point-down, into the table. \"Armed pretty heavily for a bunch of guys on vacation,\" the colonel pointed out, taking out a bunch of knives and small explosives from the bag next to him and laying them out on the table. \n\n\n\n\"Actually, we're not,\" Clef pointed out. \"No guns, for one thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Da, and only one knife. No hatchet. Left SVD at home,\" Dimitri added.\n\n\n\n\"Really, what's a bit of C-4 between friends? Here in Texas, that's almost like owning a car.\"\n\n\n\n\"Detonator is not even primed. Am not stupid, don't want blow up plane.\"\n\n\n\n\"Really. So. . . you aren't on a secret mission for the Foundation? You aren't the backup called in by a Foundation operative six days ago in response to escalating KTE activity?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did not even want to go to Texas,\" Dimitri insisted. \"Wanted go to Brazil.\"\n\n\n\n\"Really,\" murmured the colonel. He gestured to the screen behind him. The image of a young man with a black eye, wearing a brightly colored hawaiian print shirt, appeared on the screen, flanked by gun-toting soldiers. \"This is from our Rio de Janeiro office. Does this man look familiar?\"\n\n\n\nThe guy in the hawaiian shirt raised his head groggily and stared at the screen. His eyes lit up. \"Doctor Clef! Dimitri!\" Agent Yoric laughed. \"Are you here to rescue me?\"\n\n\n\nThe two men stared at Yoric for a moment, then glanced at each other, then looked back at the colonel. \"I have never seen or met this man in my entire life,\" Clef lied.\n\n\n\n\"Is total stranger,\" Dimitri said.\n\n\n\n\". . . you've got to be fucking kidding me,\" Yoric whimpered.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\". . . and what happened after that?\" Dr. Glass asked. The psychiatrist was resting his chin on his hand, gazing at the three men sitting in his office with an expression of spellbound fascination.\n\n\n\n\"Well. . .\" Clef said. \"We couldn't leave Yoric behind.\"\n\n\n\n\". . . so we break free of captors and gun them all down,\" Dmitri finished.\n\n\n\n\"Then we highjacked a GOC plane. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Boat,\" Dmitri corrected.\n\n\n\n\"Was it a boat?\" Clef wondered. \"I thought it was a plane. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"My report said boat,\" Dmitri explained pointedly.\n\n\n\nClef blinked once, very slowly, then smiled. \"It was a seaplane.\"\n\n\n\n\"Da,\" Dmitri said, much relieved. \"Seaplane. That explain confusion.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes. So after we highjacked the GOC //seaplane//, we flew down to Rio de Janeiro, found Yoric, and rescued him.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see,\" Glass said, very slowly. \"And this is why you guys were late coming back from vacation?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, we couldn't just fly back right away,\" Clef said.\n\n\n\n\"GOC was looking for us.

The Lord spoke \u201cCome\u201d, and I did, and I was afraid and fell to my knees, weeping. I rose my hands, and asked \u201cO, mighty Lord, what has become of thy body? Why have you been undone?\u201d The Lord said unto me \u201cGo, and restore me to glory, and I shall restore you in turn\u201d. The voice of God spoke to my heart, and I wept at both the Glory and the Shame of The Heart of our Lord. Thus I came\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026not afraid of The Lord, for He is as we are, broken and scattered. As we restore the body of God, so we restore ourselves. To join with the Lord is good. As we give honor and worship to the Lord, so does He honor us. To serve the Lord is good. As we guard the Lord from harm, so does He\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026Holy, and do not speak of Him to The Unbeliever. To do so is to profane God. The Unbeliever trembles at the feet of The Lord, as we did in our ignorance, but will rise to shatter when we kneel to restore. To allow\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Blessed is the one who frees the Body of God from bondage, for in so doing we free our spirit from bondage. As He calls to\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026Not be consumed, as the Moth is to the Flame? Without our bodies, how will we serve the Lord?\u201d I spoke unto him, holding to him a facet of the Spirit of God. \u201cThe Lord consumes the Wicked, and brings the Holy to him. To fear The Lord is to show the Wickedness of the heart. To be Wicked under the will of God is to delay his Resurrection. To delay His return is to join the Defilers in his eternal imprisonment.\u201d Daniel then wept and cried out, and tore at his flesh as the Spirit of God entered him, and ate from him his evil. His Blasphemy was too great, and his wickedness too deep, and lo, The Lord did destroy all that he was, for all that he was Wicked. His rotten shell was\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026very Body of The Lord, the home from which he was driven, the hollow shell to which the Broken God must be restored for his birth, as the seed is restored to the womb, and I cried out and wept with joy as I beheld the Glory. I and the Acolytes of the Lord did go forward, and drove out the Wicked who had Imprisoned the Lord, and they did wail and weep at the retribution of God, and poured their blood in vain against the coming of God. We tore down the wall that entombed the Lord, and found his flesh to be as that of a tomb, and called out for his direction and glory. I walked in the body of the Lord, and was struck by his glory and greatness. Great is the Broken God, and greater still will be his Restoration. As we drew to the center of God, we found the remains of Him still soft and untainted, and did rejoice in it. We worshiped in the Body of The Lord, and lo, His Spirit came to us and took from us three of our number and did consume them, and the others were afraid. I spoke unto them: \u201cBe not afraid of the Embrace of God, for He wishes only\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026is not the far off Ghost: The Lord is with Us.

The\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026of the Wicked, of the Unfaithful, of the Jailers of The Lord. To harm them is great, to bring them to the Lord is greater. Do not let trust cloud your fellowship, for the Wicked will hide among us, and harm us. Confess the Wicked to us, and bathe in the glory of\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026loss of The Heart of The Lord, an acolyte was brought before It. He heard not the voice of God, and resisted enlightenment. The Faithful brought him again and again to the Heart, but still he rebelled, and fought the Voice of God. When he did hear the Voice, his rebellion and Wickedness would not allow him to embrace God, but drove him farther still, and lo, he came to injure and harm the Faithful. So it came to pass that he was given unto The Lord, and His Heart did accept him readily. Still he resisted, and did not pass in Glory, but with much wailing and gnashing of teeth, and his blood defiled the ground with his Wickedness. This is the nature of God: To resist Him is death, but to join Him is Life Everlasting. As is The Lord, so shall we be: To resist us is death, but to join will bring Life Everlasting. In this\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026is the Lord! Great is His Power, and wide is His Will! Praise be to all who care for The Lord in His exile, for they do the will of God!

My son is dead!\" I went with her to her home, and found her son lying in bed, and it seemed his deathbed, for no sound came from his lips, nor movement from his breast. As I knelt next to him, I felt The Lord God well up inside me, and saw that his body was not broken, but had become changed. \"Come and give praise!\" I shouted to her, \"For your son has passed from this place of trials, and joined with The Lord!\" Trembling she came, and fell to her knees and praised The Lord with loud voice. Her son rose, and the flesh of his body fell away to show its perfect union with\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026time when he left the People of God, and went forth to the Unbelievers. There he profaned the Name of God, and did try to turn their cruelty against us. Great is the Will of God, and far is His reach, for he did turn even the Unbeliever against him, and he was imprisoned as he wished to imprison The Lord. There he was found, and there he was shown the cost of his betrayal, for the People of God did go forth and take him from there, and did dash his head against the stone, and left his Corrupted and Traitorous shell to rot outside the body of God.</p>\n<p>Lo, behold and tremble, for this is the least terrible fate of the Betrayer.

Here's the script you were wondering about. This thing was a sort of dramatization of a little research disaster that happened in July four years back. It was meant to illustrate to some of our less cautious researchers the value of emotional detachment during the job, or some BS like that. Never really got produced, and no, I don't know why not. It's missing the a bit of narration that was meant to go in before and after the thing played. If I remember correctly, just details about the event. I think that it was something about this being written from live video feed, with creative liberty taken only when necessary. I found what I could about the incident, and it seems to match pretty well. Apparently the SCP was destroyed by the girl afterward, which is one reason they got worked up about it enough to start making this thing\u2026 I guess someone wanted to use it for questioning the dead or something. Since the research was never completed and the thing got burned, there's no official entry in the database on it. The guy's name matches the other stuff I've found, but the girl's name is only here - I guess they didn't want anyone to find out what happened to her. Seeing as she destroyed a potentially useful SCP after making a rather serious mistake in studying it, I can see why they might not want that to appear in a human resources type video. I can keep digging for more, if you'd like, but I can't make any promises.<br/>\n- J.N.</p>\n<p>p.s. - Dinner, Saturday.</p>\n<p>*Click click click tap*<br/>\n*Beep*</p>\n<p>-*-*-*-*-*</p>\n<p>ACT I</p>\n<p>FADE IN<br/>\nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT</p>\n<p>A small room with a medium-sized bed and two chairs. There are two doors, on either side of the room (One leads to a small bathroom, the other to a hallway). Everything is white and sanitary.</p>\n<p>A MAN is sitting on the bed. He is holding tightly on to a book. He is in mid teen years, and is wearing clean white hospital clothes.</p>\n<p>Two researchers are standing in the hall. One is MASON, an early middle-aged man, the other is HOLLY, a woman also in early middle age. Both wear lab coats.</p>\n<p>ANGLE ON HALLWAY.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nWell, Mason, you got the tickets?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nOf course I do, Hol. Vacation in Vienna. Two months. I promised, didn\u2019t I?</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nGod, I\u2019ll be glad to see the back of this place. When do we leave?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nFriday. We just need to finish the interview, see what makes him tick.

Why won\u2019t anyone tell me?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nSir, we just need to ask you a few questions. After that you can go home.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nWhy?</p>\n<p>WIDER ANGLE ON ALL CHARACTERS</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nWe think you may have some knowledge about a recent accident, and we just need to know a few things about you.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nWhat do you mean, accident?</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nSir, just answer the questions. Then, you can go home and just forget about all of this. Now, what\u2019s your name?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nHow can you have me here if you don\u2019t even know my name?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nPlease, sir, this is just protocol. Now, answer the question.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nMy name is Esteban Tetson.</p>\n<p>MASON takes out a notepad and begins writing in it.</p>\n<p>ANGLE ON MAN</p>\n<p>MAN (CONT.)<br/>\nMy parents were migrant workers from Chiapas, Mexico. They changed their last names when they acquired US citizenship. Esteban means crown, and has etymological connections to English names such as Steven and Stephen.</p>\n<p>MASON stops writing, and both HOLLY and MASON look at the MAN.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nSir, where did you receive your education?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nI didn\u2019t. My parents were very poor. I learned English mostly from the other boys my age. I didn't learn to read and write until I was a teenager.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nYou don't seem to be having any difficulties. You don't even have an accent.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nI wouldn't know.</p>\n<p>MASON shrugs, and starts writing again.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nWhy don't you tell us about that book?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nThis is my diary. I've kept it ever since I was a kid.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nI thought you said that you didn't learn to write until you were a teenager.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nI didn't.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nBut then how did you keep a diary?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nYou're wasting my time with this. Please, just let me go home now.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nSir, please just tell us how you kept a diary before you learned how to write.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nWhy won't you believe me?

We finally get an easy subject, and this happens</p>\n<p>HOLLY AND MASON stop walking outside the door.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nWe\u2019re just lucky, Hol. At least we\u2019re not on statue duty.</p>\n<p>HOLLY shudders.</p>\n<p>MASON (CONT.)<br/>\nAt least he died quickly.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nThat really isn\u2019t very comforting.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nNo, I guess not. But we have to figure out how his body affected our lovely little ticket to Vienna. It\u2019s procedure.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nI know, honey. I\u2019m just sick of this. Every day someone\u2019s careless and there\u2019s another body to deal with. It didn\u2019t use to bother me that much, but now\u2026</p>\n<p>HOLLY reaches for MASON\u2019S hand.</p>\n<p>HOLLY (CONT.)<br/>\nNow, every day I think the body\u2019s going to be you.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nI know. We shouldn\u2019t be here anymore.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nNo choice.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nI know.</p>\n<p>THE CELLPHONE BEEPS. MASON hits a button on it.</p>\n<p>MASON (CONT.)<br/>\nHe's awake. Let's go.</p>\n<p>HOLLY AND MASON kiss, then walk to the door.</p>\n<p>ANGLE ON MAN, looking at the door as it opens and HOLLY AND MASON ENTER.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nFinally. Holly, Mason, I'm fine. I have no idea how, but I'm fine. Now can I please go home and get some rest?</p>\n<p>WIDEN ANGLE to show all characters.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nWe've told you before, sir. Once we're done asking you questions, you can go.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nWhat on earth are you talking about?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nWhat do you-</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nMason, how did he know our names?</p>\n<p>HOLLY AND MASON pause.</p>\n<p>ANGLE ON MAN</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nWe've worked together for five years. Now stop joking around.</p>\n<p>MASON takes out his writing pad, and begins scribbling furiously. He does not look up when he talks.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nWhat, if anything, do you know about the men Esteban Tetson and Jon Eois?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nWhat? Why?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nJust answer the question.</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nI've never heard the names before. Now can you please explain what's going on here?</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nWhat about that book you're holding?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nMy diary? I've kept it ever since I was a kid.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nYou bring it to work?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nOf course I do.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nIn spite of the restrictions on personal belongings we may bring on site?</p>\n<p>MAN<br/>\nI don't see the relevance.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nNo, of course not. Holly, restrain him. I want to try something.</p>\n<p>WIDEN ANGLE</p>\n<p>THE MAN acts surprised and confused. He attempts to defend himself, but HOLLY easily overpowers him. MASON forcefully takes the diary from him. THE MAN begins to SCREAM.</p>\n<p>MASON (CONT.)<br/>\nPut him in the bathroom and lock the door.</p>\n<p>CAMERA FOLLOWS as HOLLY drags THE MAN to the bathroom and pushes him in, then shuts the door and presses a button on it.</p>\n<p>MASON (CONT.)<br/>\nHe, or they, displayed an obsession with the book, a fear of separation from it. If I'm right, the effect should end after a bit of time alone.</p>\n<p>CAMERA CUT TO BATHROOM, with the MAN on one side of the screen and a mirror on the other. The mirror shows the reflection of another researcher.</p>\n<p>THE MAN begins to cough, growing steadily louder throughout the conversation. MASON AND HOLLY can be heard talking as if they were in the room.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nHoney, I don't like this. We shouldn't do tests without approval from higher up.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nThat takes too long. I want to leave tomorrow. Hell, I want to leave right now. I don't want to talk to someone who believes they're a dead friend of mine. That's just too much.</p>\n<p>THE MAN begins to pound against the door, still coughing.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nWe can't afford to be careless, not now.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nI'd rather take a risk than keep hearing that thing talk.</p>\n<p>THE MAN GASPS AND COLLAPSES. HOLLY AND MASON notice the absence of noise.</p>\n<p>MASON (CONT.)<br/>\nThere. Let's go check.</p>\n<p>THE DOOR OPENS, HOLLY AND MASON STANDING in it. MASON is holding the diary. HOLLY rushes to THE MAN'S side. She puts her hand on his chest, and her ear to his mouth.</p>\n<p>HOLLY<br/>\nNo heartbeat, no breathing. He's dead.</p>\n<p>MASON looks down at the body.</p>\n<p>MASON<br/>\nWhere am I?</p>\n<p>HOLLY turns toward MASON. The mirror shows an exact copy of JON EOIS standing above his own body, in MASON'S place. He is gripping the diary.</p>\n<p>CAMERA CUT TO BLACK</p>\n<p>END ACT III</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/dear-diary\">Dear Diary</a>\" by Nioki, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Here's the script you were wondering about. This thing was a sort of dramatization of a little research disaster that happened in July four years back. It was meant to illustrate to some of our less cautious researchers the value of emotional detachment during the job, or some BS like that. Never really got produced, and no, I don't know why not. It's missing the a bit of narration that was meant to go in before and after the thing played. If I remember correctly, just details about the event. I think that it was something about this being written from live video feed, with creative liberty taken only when necessary. I found what I could about the incident, and it seems to match pretty well. Apparently the SCP was destroyed by the girl afterward, which is one reason they got worked up about it enough to start making this thing... I guess someone wanted to use it for questioning the dead or something. Since the research was never completed and the thing got burned, there's no official entry in the database on it. The guy's name matches the other stuff I've found, but the girl's name is only here - I guess they didn't want anyone to find out what happened to her. Seeing as she destroyed a potentially useful SCP after making a rather serious mistake in studying it, I can see why they might not want that to appear in a human resources type video. I can keep digging for more, if you'd like, but I can't make any promises.\n\n\u00a0- J.N.\n\n\n\np.s. - Dinner, Saturday.\n\n\n\n*Click click click tap*\n\n*Beep*\n\n\n\n-*-*-*-*-*\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n\n\nFADE IN\n\nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\n\nA small room with a medium-sized bed and two chairs. There are two doors, on either side of the room (One leads to a small bathroom, the other to a hallway). Everything is white and sanitary.\n\n\n\nA MAN is sitting on the bed. He is holding tightly on to a book. He is in mid teen years, and is wearing clean white hospital clothes.\n\n\n\nTwo researchers are standing in the hall. One is MASON, an early middle-aged man, the other is HOLLY, a woman also in early middle age. Both wear lab coats.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nWell, Mason, you got the tickets?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nOf course I do, Hol. Vacation in Vienna. Two months. I promised, didn\u2019t I?\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nGod, I\u2019ll be glad to see the back of this place. When do we leave?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nFriday. We just need to finish the interview, see what makes him tick. And he\u2019s a safe class, so we can take it easy.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had this much go right before, honey.\n\n\n\nMASON and HOLLY grip each other's hands briefly, then open the door to the MAN\u2019s room.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON MAN, looking up.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nPlease, why am I here? Why won\u2019t anyone tell me?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nSir, we just need to ask you a few questions. After that you can go home.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nWIDER ANGLE ON ALL CHARACTERS\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nWe think you may have some knowledge about a recent accident, and we just need to know a few things about you.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nWhat do you mean, accident?\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nSir, just answer the questions. Then, you can go home and just forget about all of this. Now, what\u2019s your name?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nHow can you have me here if you don\u2019t even know my name?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nPlease, sir, this is just protocol. Now, answer the question.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nMy name is Esteban Tetson.\n\n\n\nMASON takes out a notepad and begins writing in it.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON MAN\n\n\n\nMAN (CONT.)\n\nMy parents were migrant workers from Chiapas, Mexico. They changed their last names when they acquired US citizenship. Esteban means crown, and has etymological connections to English names such as Steven and Stephen.\n\n\n\nMASON stops writing, and both HOLLY and MASON look at the MAN.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nSir, where did you receive your education?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nI didn\u2019t. My parents were very poor. I learned English mostly from the other boys my age. I didn't learn to read and write until I was a teenager.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nYou don't seem to be having any difficulties. You don't even have an accent.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nI wouldn't know.\n\n\n\nMASON shrugs, and starts writing again.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nWhy don't you tell us about that book?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nThis is my diary. I've kept it ever since I was a kid.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nI thought you said that you didn't learn to write until you were a teenager.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nI didn't.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nBut then how did you keep a diary?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nYou're wasting my time with this. Please, just let me go home now.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nSir, please just tell us how you kept a diary before you learned how to write.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nWhy won't you believe me? Have you never heard of someone keeping a diary before?\n\n\n\nHOLLY AND MASON share a glance.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nSir, those are all the questions we needed to ask for now. I suggest you get some sleep. We'll be back tomorrow.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nBut...\n\n\n\nANGLE ON HOLLY AND MASON leaving.

HOLLY AND MASON watch it approach.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nMason?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nYeah?\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nWhy'd I have to come here to meet someone?\n\n\n\nTHE GURNEY reaches HOLLY and MASON.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nBecause the universe has a really weird sense of humor.\n\n\n\nTHE MAN SCREAMS from OFF SCREEN. HOLLY AND MASON jump in surprise, and run for the door. The GURNEY WHEELER does not react, and continues to move.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON DOOR. HOLLY OPENS IT, but the view begins to fade as soon as she does.\n\n\n\nFADE OUT\n\n\n\nEND ACT II\n\n\n\n-*-*-*-*-*\n\n\u00a0\n\nACT III\n\n\n\nFADE IN\n\n\n\nRESUME. TWO SHOT HOLLY AND MASON ENTERING THE HALLWAY. MASON is holding a CELL PHONE.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nIt figures, doesn\u2019t it? We finally get an easy subject, and this happens\n\n\n\nHOLLY AND MASON stop walking outside the door.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nWe\u2019re just lucky, Hol. At least we\u2019re not on statue duty.\n\n\n\nHOLLY shudders.\n\n\n\nMASON (CONT.)\n\nAt least he died quickly.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nThat really isn\u2019t very comforting.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nNo, I guess not. But we have to figure out how his body affected our lovely little ticket to Vienna. It\u2019s procedure.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nI know, honey. I\u2019m just sick of this. Every day someone\u2019s careless and there\u2019s another body to deal with. It didn\u2019t use to bother me that much, but now\u2026\n\n\n\nHOLLY reaches for MASON\u2019S hand.\n\n\n\nHOLLY (CONT.)\n\nNow, every day I think the body\u2019s going to be you.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nI know. We shouldn\u2019t be here anymore.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nNo choice.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nI know.\n\n\n\nTHE CELLPHONE BEEPS. MASON hits a button on it.\n\n\n\nMASON (CONT.)\n\nHe's awake. Let's go.\n\n\n\nHOLLY AND MASON kiss, then walk to the door.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON MAN, looking at the door as it opens and HOLLY AND MASON ENTER.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nFinally. Holly, Mason, I'm fine. I have no idea how, but I'm fine. Now can I please go home and get some rest?\n\n\n\nWIDEN ANGLE to show all characters.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nWe've told you before, sir. Once we're done asking you questions, you can go.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nWhat on earth are you talking about?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nWhat do you-\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nMason, how did he know our names?\n\n\n\nHOLLY AND MASON pause.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON MAN\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nWe've worked together for five years. Now stop joking around.\n\n\n\nMASON takes out his writing pad, and begins scribbling furiously. He does not look up when he talks.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nWhat, if anything, do you know about the men Esteban Tetson and Jon Eois?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nWhat? Why?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nJust answer the question.\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nI've never heard the names before. Now can you please explain what's going on here?\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nWhat about that book you're holding?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nMy diary? I've kept it ever since I was a kid.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nYou bring it to work?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nOf course I do.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nIn spite of the restrictions on personal belongings we may bring on site?\n\n\n\nMAN\n\nI don't see the relevance.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nNo, of course not. Holly, restrain him. I want to try something.\n\n\n\nWIDEN ANGLE\n\n\n\nTHE MAN acts surprised and confused. He attempts to defend himself, but HOLLY easily overpowers him. MASON forcefully takes the diary from him. THE MAN begins to SCREAM.\n\n\n\nMASON (CONT.)\n\nPut him in the bathroom and lock the door.\n\n\n\nCAMERA FOLLOWS as HOLLY drags THE MAN to the bathroom and pushes him in, then shuts the door and presses a button on it.\n\n\n\nMASON (CONT.)\n\nHe, or they, displayed an obsession with the book, a fear of separation from it. If I'm right, the effect should end after a bit of time alone.\n\n\n\nCAMERA CUT TO BATHROOM, with the MAN on one side of the screen and a mirror on the other. The mirror shows the reflection of another researcher.\n\n\n\nTHE MAN begins to cough, growing steadily louder throughout the conversation. MASON AND HOLLY can be heard talking as if they were in the room.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nHoney, I don't like this. We shouldn't do tests without approval from higher up.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nThat takes too long. I want to leave tomorrow. Hell, I want to leave right now. I don't want to talk to someone who believes they're a dead friend of mine. That's just too much.\n\n\n\nTHE MAN begins to pound against the door, still coughing.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nWe can't afford to be careless, not now.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nI'd rather take a risk than keep hearing that thing talk.\n\n\n\nTHE MAN GASPS AND COLLAPSES. HOLLY AND MASON notice the absence of noise.\n\n\n\nMASON (CONT.)\n\nThere. Let's go check.\n\n\n\nTHE DOOR OPENS, HOLLY AND MASON STANDING in it. MASON is holding the diary. HOLLY rushes to THE MAN'S side. She puts her hand on his chest, and her ear to his mouth.\n\n\n\nHOLLY\n\nNo heartbeat, no breathing. He's dead.\n\n\n\nMASON looks down at the body.\n\n\n\nMASON\n\nWhere am I?\n\n\n\nHOLLY turns toward MASON. The mirror shows an exact copy of JON EOIS standing above his own body, in MASON'S place. He is gripping the diary.\n\n\n\nCAMERA CUT TO BLACK\n\n\n\nEND ACT III\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Dear Diary - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dear-diary", "year": 2009}, "don-t-call-us-we-ll-find-you": {"created_at": "2009-05-14T20:29:00", "creator": "Heiden", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Heiden", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heiden", "comment": "", "date": "2009-05-14T20:29:00"}, {"author": "Heiden", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heiden", "comment": "", "date": "2009-05-14T21:03:00"}, {"author": "Heiden", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heiden", "comment": "Removed a reference to an SCP that no longer exists in the listings.", "date": "2011-05-29T07:24:00"}, {"author": "Exun Yannah", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/exun-yannah", "comment": "remove an unneeded \"at from first paragraph\"", "date": "2011-05-29T14:59:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Sometimes he hears voices running commentary on his life, sometimes they argue, but that's basically the only variation you hit in his symptoms. I feel bad for the guy, sure - he can barely communicate, suffers from hallucinations of all sorts of messed up stuff, and when he's not doing that, he just sits on his bed and stares into space for hours on end. But, on the plus side, he's basically a textbook case of schizophrenia. I thought he was faking at first, the symptoms 337 exhibits are literally straight out of the DSM-IV.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he isn't responding to treatment. I mean, at all- all the antipsychotics in the book haven't done a damn thing. I switched him to electroconvulsive therapy - still, nothing. We've just had to keep him restrained until we can figure something out, but so far all that's worked are sedatives. I don't think I've had a case that any colleague not working here would believe since I've started.</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</p>\n<p>[ <em>Note</em>: Patient 612 is Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a linguist assigned to studying the symbols produced by <a href=\"/scp-035\">SCP-035</a>.

At that point, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was sent to PCF-22, was she has resided for several months.]</p>\n<p>I know the government's up to some crazy stuff, but this has officially gone beyond the pale. Today was my first day on 612, and I was ready for just about anything. I've seen some nasty stuff in my life, some seriously disturbed people, and so have my colleagues\u2026 which is what initially concerned me about the rumors. Something is <em>wrong</em> here, and I don't know what, and I don't know if I want to know.</p>\n<p>I walked into 612's room - unpadded, and she was unrestrained, which really shocked me at first. With all the rumors flying, I was expecting some kind of feral maniac trying to rip her own face off. Instead, she had a stack of paper, a pen, and a bed. She was completely still, had the sheets on the bed pulled up over her face, and she wouldn't acknowledge me. Gave me time to evaluate the situation, I figured, and I started going through the papers. She's a doctor of linguistics, so I wasn't too surprised when I didn't understand the writing, but it was pretty clearly Latin and Greek\u2026 but some of it I didn't recognize, wedges in patterns. Sections of it were circled with notes written in the margins, same language as whatever was circled. I looked it up a few hours ago, that wedge-writing was cuneiform, Sumerian writing. <em>She has had no education whatsoever in Sumerian culture or languages.</em> I tried to take the papers out of the room, and the guards stopped me, saying that it was their job to handle that. When I protested, they flashed a badge in my face and said something about a foundation, then they gave that meaningful look that basically translates to 'I'm better armed than you are, back off.' I left 612's room after that, went immediately to Dr. Corbin, who's in charge around here (I thought), and got about six words in before he cut me off and told me to let the guards handle it and just worry about 612.</p>\n<p>I didn't press it at the time, even though I probably should have. 612's cell was the same as I left it, stack of papers on the desk, blankets pulled up over her head, no response from 612. I admit my temper wasn't what it ought to have been, I should've probably left well enough alone, but something about 612 just set me off. I walked over and ripped the blankets off of 612, and got quite another surprise. 612 was using the blankets to keep people from seeing as she drew a new set of symbols on her bed in her own blood. I've seen self-mutilation and writing in bodily fluids before, that wasn't the surprising part. What got me was that these were certainly not cuneiform, nor anything from the Greek or Latin alphabets. Also notable was the pattern of self-mutilation that no one had seen fit to mention on any of the reports- these cuts were made with a pattern in mind, and for God's sake, I don't know <em>what</em>. When the guards noticed, they came into the cell, sedated 612, and dragged me out of there. I left work from there and came home, took a nap to clear my mind, and wrote this down\u2026 I don't know if I can go back to work tomorrow. Something is really, really wrong here and I don't know what. Dr. Corbin knows, but he won't tell me. The guards even know, and they won't tell me. Something's got to give, and soon, or I'm out of here.</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</p>\n<p>[ <em>Note</em>: Patient 552, or Guard Matthew \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, was assigned to <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231</a> as an observer for Procedure 110-Montauk, during which he prevented two D-class personnel assigned to the procedure from murdering <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231</a>-7 in the midst of the proscribed \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of Procedure 110-Montauk. <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231</a>-7 requested to be euthanized shortly after Guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 intervened, a request which was summarily denied by Guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. A Class 3 commendation has been placed on Guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's personnel file and as per his request, he was transferred to Site \u2588\u2588-\u2588. Shortly after his transfer, he was offered and refused a Class B Amnestic and memory implantation, after which he suffered a psychological breakdown, necessitating his current status in PCF-22.]</p>\n<p>I can't work in this environment anymore, this has become ludicrous. I was talking to 552 today - the one with the depressive and guilt issues, fairly standard case and he seemed to be responding well to therapy. He has problems I'm not going to be able to help him with unless he opens up more\u2026 this negative self-image he carries around is like a greenhouse for depression, it's just going to keep feeding on itself and growing. The fact that a guard detail is required to accompany anyone interviewing 552 is just hindering his treatment further - it's going to be hard enough to get him to tell <em>me</em> why he hates himself, much less two armed guards standing less than three meters away.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I really think the guards know more than I do about this place, and I don't like it. I <em>swear</em> I caught one of them making a threatening gesture at 552 today when I thought for sure the poor bastard was going to crack and tell me what was wrong. Of course, he clammed up immediately, at which point I terminated the interview and went straight to Corbin. At which point I got the same damn runaround I'm always going to get around here, where of course the guards are here for my own safety, and no, don't be ridiculous, the guards would never interfere with a patient's treatment, and blah blah you're imagining things take a day off. I'm going in tomorrow and giving Corbin a piece of my mind about this whole business, he and I both know something odd is going on, and he needs to level with me about it.</p>\n<p>[ <em>Note</em>: Dr. Johnston is to be evaluated for potential direct employment by the Foundation as a Class 1 on-site staff psychiatrist. He knows enough at this point he could be considered a security risk, and he could still be useful to us.

I feel bad for the guy, sure - he can barely communicate, suffers from hallucinations of all sorts of messed up stuff, and when he's not doing that, he just sits on his bed and stares into space for hours on end. But, on the plus side, he's basically a textbook case of schizophrenia. I thought he was faking at first, the symptoms 337 exhibits are literally straight out of the DSM-IV.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, he isn't responding to treatment. I mean, at all- all the antipsychotics in the book haven't done a damn thing. I switched him to electroconvulsive therapy - still, nothing. We've just had to keep him restrained until we can figure something out, but so far all that's worked are sedatives. I don't think I've had a case that any colleague not working here would believe since I've started.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\n[ //Note//: Patient 612 is Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a linguist assigned to studying the symbols produced by [[[SCP-035]]]. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's mental state degraded continuously over the three and a half weeks she worked on the project, until she was caught fashioning a stylus out of D-13448's ulna shortly after his termination. At that point, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was sent to PCF-22, was she has resided for several months.]\n\n\n\nI know the government's up to some crazy stuff, but this has officially gone beyond the pale. Today was my first day on 612, and I was ready for just about anything. I've seen some nasty stuff in my life, some seriously disturbed people, and so have my colleagues... which is what initially concerned me about the rumors. Something is //wrong// here, and I don't know what, and I don't know if I want to know.\n\n\n\nI walked into 612's room - unpadded, and she was unrestrained, which really shocked me at first. With all the rumors flying, I was expecting some kind of feral maniac trying to rip her own face off. Instead, she had a stack of paper, a pen, and a bed. She was completely still, had the sheets on the bed pulled up over her face, and she wouldn't acknowledge me. Gave me time to evaluate the situation, I figured, and I started going through the papers. She's a doctor of linguistics, so I wasn't too surprised when I didn't understand the writing, but it was pretty clearly Latin and Greek... but some of it I didn't recognize, wedges in patterns. Sections of it were circled with notes written in the margins, same language as whatever was circled. I looked it up a few hours ago, that wedge-writing was cuneiform, Sumerian writing. //She has had no education whatsoever in Sumerian culture or languages.// I tried to take the papers out of the room, and the guards stopped me, saying that it was their job to handle that. When I protested, they flashed a badge in my face and said something about a foundation, then they gave that meaningful look that basically translates to 'I'm better armed than you are, back off.' I left 612's room after that, went immediately to Dr. Corbin, who's in charge around here (I thought), and got about six words in before he cut me off and told me to let the guards handle it and just worry about 612.\n\n\n\nI didn't press it at the time, even though I probably should have. 612's cell was the same as I left it, stack of papers on the desk, blankets pulled up over her head, no response from 612. I admit my temper wasn't what it ought to have been, I should've probably left well enough alone, but something about 612 just set me off. I walked over and ripped the blankets off of 612, and got quite another surprise. 612 was using the blankets to keep people from seeing as she drew a new set of symbols on her bed in her own blood. I've seen self-mutilation and writing in bodily fluids before, that wasn't the surprising part. What got me was that these were certainly not cuneiform, nor anything from the Greek or Latin alphabets. Also notable was the pattern of self-mutilation that no one had seen fit to mention on any of the reports- these cuts were made with a pattern in mind, and for God's sake, I don't know //what//. When the guards noticed, they came into the cell, sedated 612, and dragged me out of there. I left work from there and came home, took a nap to clear my mind, and wrote this down... I don't know if I can go back to work tomorrow. Something is really, really wrong here and I don't know what. Dr. Corbin knows, but he won't tell me. The guards even know, and they won't tell me. Something's got to give, and soon, or I'm out of here.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\n[ //Note//: Patient 552, or Guard Matthew \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, was assigned to [[[SCP-231]]] as an observer for Procedure 110-Montauk, during which he prevented two D-class personnel assigned to the procedure from murdering [[[SCP-231]]]-7 in the midst of the proscribed \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of Procedure 110-Montauk. [[[SCP-231]]]-7 requested to be euthanized shortly after Guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 intervened, a request which was summarily denied by Guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. A Class 3 commendation has been placed on Guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's personnel file and as per his request, he was transferred to Site \u2588\u2588-\u2588. Shortly after his transfer, he was offered and refused a Class B Amnestic and memory implantation, after which he suffered a psychological breakdown, necessitating his current status in PCF-22.]\n\n\n\nI can't work in this environment anymore, this has become ludicrous. I was talking to 552 today - the one with the depressive and guilt issues, fairly standard case and he seemed to be responding well to therapy. He has problems I'm not going to be able to help him with unless he opens up more... this negative self-image he carries around is like a greenhouse for depression, it's just going to keep feeding on itself and growing. The fact that a guard detail is required to accompany anyone interviewing 552 is just hindering his treatment further - it's going to be hard enough to get him to tell //me// why he hates himself, much less two armed guards standing less than three meters away.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I really think the guards know more than I do about this place, and I don't like it. I //swear// I caught one of them making a threatening gesture at 552 today when I thought for sure the poor bastard was going to crack and tell me what was wrong. Of course, he clammed up immediately, at which point I terminated the interview and went straight to Corbin. At which point I got the same damn runaround I'm always going to get around here, where of course the guards are here for my own safety, and no, don't be ridiculous, the guards would never interfere with a patient's treatment, and blah blah you're imagining things take a day off. I'm going in tomorrow and giving Corbin a piece of my mind about this whole business, he and I both know something odd is going on, and he needs to level with me about it.\n\n\n\n[ //Note//: Dr. Johnston is to be evaluated for potential direct employment by the Foundation as a Class 1 on-site staff psychiatrist. He knows enough at this point he could be considered a security risk, and he could still be useful to us. I can't keep brushing him off like I have been without making it blatantly clear that I'm hiding things from him. -Dr. Corbin]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-212", "scp-035", "scp-231", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Don't Call Us, We'll Find You - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/don-t-call-us-we-ll-find-you", "year": 2009}, "dr-cog-and-the-plastic-fantastic": {"created_at": "2009-12-03T04:55:00", "creator": "A Fat Ghost", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "", "date": "2009-12-03T04:55:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "", "date": "2009-12-03T04:57:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "rating module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:28:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 1", "date": "2011-01-02T23:53:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Several factors were taken into account, such as the relative danger involved in sustained containment and cost-benefit of the costly procurement of virgin blood on a regular basis. In conclusion, a unanimous decision to terminate SCP-083 was made amongst the O5, and handed down to Site 19 administrators. After researching the difficulties involved in terminating a regenerating, superhuman, and potential Keter object, the termination was set in motion. The man chosen for the task was an old standby, a man of great experience and expertise in the elimination of humanoid SCP objects of great destructive potential. Known for his clean, almost surgical method, he was quickly approved to carry out the termination.</em></p>\n<p><em>Unfortunately, he was not available.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite urging from peers and subordinates, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Kondraki was chosen to perform the termination. After giving himself the proper clearance and approval to do so through a loophole he had found in relevant regulations, O5 grudgingly accepted his self-appointment. O5-8* assuaged the board\u2019s fears with Dr. Kondraki\u2019s impressive credentials, and claimed that given such an important responsibility, he might finally take his position seriously.</em></p>\n<p><sub>*It should be noted here that O5-8 was a new appointment, and had not been present for the previous disciplinary actions involving the senior doctor.</sub></p>\n<p>Included below are the relevant logs and documentation concerning the \u201cDuke\u201d termination.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>For information involving the collateral damages sustained during the termination, See Document 083-D-Kk.</em> - O5-2</p>\n<p><strong>Containment Log \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588083-DK \u2588-\u2588\u2588\u00ac-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dr. Kondraki enters SCP-083\u2019s containment, carries a folding table and two chairs with him.

So, why don\u2019t you tell me about yourself, Drac?

I figured, either it worked and I got done early enough to catch some lunch, or I\u2019d have to think fast before he killed me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Think fast? That\u2019s it?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kondraki:</strong> Yeah.

I don\u2019t have to explain myself if I get the job done.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Alright, fair enough, but I have to wonder about one more thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kondraki:</strong> Shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Why cat urine?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kondraki:</strong> Well, if I was wrong and it didn\u2019t work, he\u2019d still be the one covered in cat piss.

What's the matter?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bright:</strong> Not only did I bet that asshole five grand that he wouldn't be able to throw cat piss at 083, but he didn't even have the good grace to die during the termination!

Security cameras outside of SCP-083\u2019s containment showed Dr. Kondraki and SCP-083 exiting the containment approximately half an hour later. Forensic examination of the damages incurred within the containment are underway. Regardless, a red alert was issued, and security teams were dispatched to contain SCP-083 and get Dr. Kondraki to safety, including Mobile Strike Force Rho-2 \u201cHawthorne\u2019s Heroes\u201d.

Viewed purely from the vantage point of a termination test carried out against a nearly-invulnerable humanoid SCP object, Dr. Kondraki\u2019s test achieved only a low to medium degree of collateral damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So you feel that Dr. Kondraki\u2019s actions were acceptable?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> He achieved his intended goal. However, the loss of manpower, multiple containment breaches, widespread damage to Site 19, and general lack of planning represent a gross oversight on the part of Dr. Kondraki.</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Demolishing a good chunk of a site is a little more than oversight in planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> \u2026Sir, if I may say, I think we are focusing on the wrong direction.

The multiple containment failures, the evacuation of items, SCP-083 and its attacks on site staff, all these stretched the resources of Site 19 to a dangerously thin level.

Several factors were taken into account, such as the relative danger involved in sustained containment and cost-benefit of the costly procurement of virgin blood on a regular basis. In conclusion, a unanimous decision to terminate SCP-083 was made amongst the O5, and handed down to Site 19 administrators. After researching the difficulties involved in terminating a regenerating, superhuman, and potential Keter object, the termination was set in motion. The man chosen for the task was an old standby, a man of great experience and expertise in the elimination of humanoid SCP objects of great destructive potential. Known for his clean, almost surgical method, he was quickly approved to carry out the termination.//\n\n\n\n//Unfortunately, he was not available.//\n\n\n\n//Despite urging from peers and subordinates, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Kondraki was chosen to perform the termination. After giving himself the proper clearance and approval to do so through a loophole he had found in relevant regulations, O5 grudgingly accepted his self-appointment. O5-8* assuaged the board\u2019s fears with Dr. Kondraki\u2019s impressive credentials, and claimed that given such an important responsibility, he might finally take his position seriously.//\n\n\n\n,,*It should be noted here that O5-8 was a new appointment, and had not been present for the previous disciplinary actions involving the senior doctor.,,\n\n\n\nIncluded below are the relevant logs and documentation concerning the \u201cDuke\u201d termination.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** //For information involving the collateral damages sustained during the termination, See Document 083-D-Kk.// - O5-2\n\n\n\n**Containment Log \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588083-DK\u00a0\u00a0\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u00ac-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**\n\n\n\n> //Dr. Kondraki enters SCP-083\u2019s containment, carries a folding table and two chairs with him. Proceeds to set up all three, as originally planned, taking a seat on one end.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Well, isn\u2019t this a nice little accommodation. They treat you well, Duke, real well for something out of a Bram Stoker novel.\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-083 takes the seat across from him.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** Well, I must be doing something right doctor\u2026you know, come to think of it I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you around Site 19.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Good, you shouldn\u2019t have. Now, let\u2019s get on with this interview already, I\u2019ve got better things to do than chat with a bloodsucker.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** //[laughs]// I\u2019m not calling you on your diet, am I? Besides, I asked for the interview, and as you know I do get what I want.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Sure, sure. Although I remember that you requested a woman, hope you\u2019re not too disappointed, Count. //[Dr. Kondraki proceeds to light a cigarette, and produces a container of a specially treated fluid. In the pre-termination report, Dr. Kondraki did not specify the contents for security reasons.]// \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** I can\u2019t say I\u2019m pleased to accept a brutish specimen of humanity such as yourself, over a lovely morsel of femininity. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just have to make it up with Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 once we\u2019re finished here. \n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Kondraki proceeds to unscrew the top from the container, and sets it to the side. SCP-083 appears to recoil from the smell.//\n\n> \n\n> //Agent Infred stepped forward to frisk Doctor Kondraki. He swiftly liberated a hand gun from Kondraki's person.//\n\n> \n\n> Agent Infred: Sorry sir, this isn't authorized.\n\n>\n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Right, whatever. So, why don\u2019t you tell me about yourself, Drac? Are you the mythical force of darkness that plagues the psyche of humanity, or are you just a spoiled manchild playing vampire?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** [Looks a bit annoyed] I don\u2019t think I like your attitude doctor. Or your lack of respect.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** //[Blows smoke in SCP-083\u2019s direction]// Funny, I don\u2019t recall giving a shit. \n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Kondraki proceeds to grab the container, and splash the liquid onto SCP-083, far before containment teams and backup agents could get into position.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** What\u2026the fuck did you splash me with?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Cat urine and garlic juice, batboy, with a bit of silver nitrate.\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Kondraki flips the collapsible table up into SCP-083, and grabs a firearm from under the table, muttering about 'Always keeping a backup'. He discharges his handgun seven times into SCP-083\u2019s chest and neck, before producing a wooden stake from his lab coat. The bullets were confirmed to be comprised of a silver alloy. None of these actions had been planned or approved.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Cross that off the list of things I\u2019ve always wanted to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Post-Incident Interview DK-083**\n\nInterviewer: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nInterviewee: Dr. Kondraki\n\n\n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:** At what point did you conclude that SCP-083 might be vulnerable to the same weaknesses of a stereotypical vampire, despite no previous evidence?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Honestly, I was guessing. I figured, either it worked and I got done early enough to catch some lunch, or I\u2019d have to think fast before he killed me.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:** Think fast? That\u2019s it?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Yeah. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else, so I decided to play it by ear. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:** You\u2019re saying you made it up as you went along? Isn\u2019t that grossly irresponsible, considering SCP-083\u2019s capabilities?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** He\u2019s dead, ain\u2019t he? I don\u2019t have to explain myself if I get the job done.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:** Alright, fair enough, but I have to wonder about one more thing.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Shoot.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:** Why cat urine?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Well, if I was wrong and it didn\u2019t work, he\u2019d still be the one covered in cat piss. Didn't think he'd take offense like he did, though.\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-963-21**\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** And, after reviewing the logs, do you think Kondraki acted recklessly?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Bright:** (Silence)\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bright?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Bright:** This... This tape is un-doctored?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** That is correct Dr. Bright.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Bright:** (Dr. Bright shows signs of agitation, swearing in several different languages, and throwing equipment about the room.)\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bright! What's the matter?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Bright:** Not only did I bet that asshole five grand that he wouldn't be able to throw cat piss at 083, but he didn't even have the good grace to die during the termination! Do you realize how much I'm going to lose from paying out on that? God damn!\n\n\n\n//At this point in the logs, we are unsure how Dr. Kondraki survived the following moments after the failed termination, due to the destruction of all surveillance equipment beforehand. Security cameras outside of SCP-083\u2019s containment showed Dr. Kondraki and SCP-083 exiting the containment approximately half an hour later. Forensic examination of the damages incurred within the containment are underway. Regardless, a red alert was issued, and security teams were dispatched to contain SCP-083 and get Dr. Kondraki to safety, including Mobile Strike Force Rho-2 \u201cHawthorne\u2019s Heroes\u201d. As hindsight shows, it would have been more economical to have just shot Dr. Kondraki.// - O5-2\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-KPC-13**\n\n> \n\n> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** It really was a pity about ol' eighty-three... I had a couple of things I wanted to do with him. Like stick him in nine-one-four on various settings and see what happened. Or see how exactly how he regenerated from decapitation. Or how he reacted to two-one-seven. Or if he'd be a good organ donor. Or if he was-\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** Uh... sir could you please just answer the question?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** Hm? Oh yes, well Dr. Kondraki seems to get by in these sort of situations. A master of pulling it out of his ass, so to speak.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** So would you label him as reckless then?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** Yes. Without a doubt.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** Uh-huh, so he's a potential liability.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** Oh, I never said that. Granted, he's about as inaccurate as a faulty hand grenade or something of that ilk, the only safe place to be around him is probably inside him or something. But he gets things done, at the expense of everyone and everything around him not sturdy enough to withstand the blast.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Interviewer:** ...\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** What? He does.\n\n\n\n**Security Log C-083-K**\n\n\n\n> Dr. Kondraki exits down hallway R-14 while SCP-083 pursues. Severe damage caused due to blindness inflicted by Dr. Kondraki\u2019s camera (See: [[[scp-515-arc]]]), which caused considerable thrashing until regeneration could set in. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 recovers, and pursues Dr. Kondraki further into the central containment areas. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki, with a small lead, is able to enter non-sentient object containment and makes his way past two armed guards by flashing his ID. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 enters non-sentient containment, kills and drains several nearby researchers. Searches for Dr. Kondraki within the area, resulting in further casualties.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki accesses a safe within containment, removes a circular object and retreats from containment back into Hallway R-17. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 continues to pursue, and appears to take chase. Moments later, a flash of light is seen by a camera down the hall, and a bright, disc-like object impacts SCP-083. SCP-083 loses his leg, and falters.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki stops to observe the damage, as the disc (confirmed to be [[[SCP-388]]]) continues through Site 19 and eventually comes to rest 2 km away from the research facility. Dr. Kondraki approaches SCP-083 with a firearm drawn. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 begins to regenerate, and stand up while bracing against the nearby wall. Dr. Kondraki is seen speaking, before taking off down Hallway Y-8. SCP-083 follows shortly after, hopping on one leg until the other regenerates. Seen screaming curses.\n\n> \n\n> LOG ENDS\n\n\n\n**Audio Log 083-D-K-4**\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Kondraki** \u2013 Well, at least you\u2019ve got a leg to stand on, Count!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083** \u2013 I\u2019m going to kill you slowly when I get my hands on you! You don\u2019t even know what kind of shitstorm you\u2019ve gotten yourself into human, but I\u2019m going to kill you and destroy everything you hold dear!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki** \u2013 What was that? I couldn\u2019t hear you over all that arterial spurting. [He gestures to the missing leg] Hey, you know if this vampire thing doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019d make a great pirate!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083** \u2013 In about 5 seconds my leg is going to regenerate and I\u2019m going to tear you to pieces.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki** \u2013 Break a leg, Drac. [Dr. Kondraki departs]\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083** \u2013 I\u2019ll tear a chunk out of you for every one of those stupid retorts! Every single one!\n\n\n\n//It was at this point, as Dr. Kondraki exited the area with SCP-083 in pursuit, that MTF-R-2 arrived to attempt to restore containment of \u201cDuke\u201d. The termination attempt had been considered a failure by command and the orders were limited to damage control. Unfortunately, the other security teams were still en route, and were never able to assist MTF-R-2. If the order hadn\u2019t gone out to evacuate all Euclid objects from the sector, they might have been able to.// - O5-2\n\n\n\n**Security Log Y-083-K**\n\n\n\n> Dr. Kondraki makes it to a three way intersection before SCP-083 begins to catch up. A forklift moving a large metal box is moving up the incline directly to Dr. Kondraki\u2019s right.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 rounds the corner, but impacts the forklift which had been maneuvered to block the hall. Dr. Kondraki is seen at the door of a central staircase. At this time, they were on the 15th floor of the facility. SCP-083 proceeds to throw the metal box in a fit of frustration, before beginning to move the forklift.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki flees down the staircase. The metal box opens as it impacts the ceiling, and a large, disheveled ball of metal objects is dislodged and begins rolling down the incline.\n\n> \n\n> MTF-R-2 arrives by way of the central staircase to SCP-083\u2019s current location. Dr. Kondraki passes MTF-R-2. \n\n> \n\n> Contact with MTF-R-2 lost.\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-CLEF-01**\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Seriously? No mistakes?\n\n> \n\n> **Clef:** I can't really see that Dr. Kondraki made any mistakes in his termination protocol up to this point, no.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Seriously?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Clef:** None at all. He had a primary kill mechanism, a backup plan, and a tertiary plan as well. The fact that his plan didn't survive first contact with the enemy wasn't his fault. The deaths of MTF-Rho-2 were a sad and unforeseeable consequence of the Euclid-class SCiPs being moved. . .\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** I see. So tell me, Dr. Clef, what if all of this wasn't part of some plan, and he'd been making it up as he went along?\n\n> \n\n> **Clef:** <laughs> In that case, sir, I'd say that Dr. Kondraki was a suicidal fool. But he certainly wouldn't have. . . \n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** . . .\n\n> \n\n> **Clef:** . . . he did?\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** I have here a copy of Dr. Kondraki's termination procedure proposal. Step one is his plan to use cat urine and a pistol loaded with silver bullets. Backup plans two, three, four, And five are listed as, and I quote, 'Wing It,' 'Make Something Up,' 'Cross That Bridge When I Come To It,' and 'Put My Head Between My Knees And Kiss My Ass Goodbye.'\n\n> \n\n> **Clef:** [EXPLETIVE REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Mobile Task Force Rho-2\u2019s Combat Log**\n\n\n\n> **MTF-R-2-1** \u2013 We\u2019re coming up the staircase now, to SCP-083\u2019s last known location.

Although at this point in time, SCP-083 had caused the death of 17 personnel, Dr. Kondraki had been involved in three cases of containment failure. Most of these personnel had been minor employees, making their loss minor in comparison. MTF-R-2 would be found by site security teams at the bottom of the staircase, completely entangled in [[[SCP-162]]], with several already having been crushed to death, or bled out due to numerous lacerations. Containment of SCP-083 was quickly becoming a distant possibility, and Dr. Kondraki had vanished from visual contact. At the same time, another SCP had breached containment on the opposite side of the facility, and the chaos made details scarce. Meanwhile, SCP-083 was on a rampage trying to locate the doctor. Command was in disarray, and a choice would have to be made soon. It wasn\u2019t soon enough.// - O5-2\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-Iceberg-42**\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** And so you're of the opinion Dr. Kondraki handled things recklessly?\n\n> \n\n> **Iceberg:** Oh, yes, definitely.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Would you call him a potential liability?\n\n> \n\n> **Iceberg:** Obviously.

A verbal exchange is observed, before Dr. Kondraki speaks into the hand held object (visuals confirm it to be a megaphone of insignificant make).\n\n> \n\n> Tremors begin to rock the area, and several stress fractures are opened on the wall with the door.\n\n> \n\n> Containment of Keter level threat [[[SCP-682]]] compromised.\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-Dr. Gears-62**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:** Reckless is a relative term.\u00a0\u00a0Viewed purely from the vantage point of a termination test carried out against a nearly-invulnerable humanoid SCP object, Dr. Kondraki\u2019s test achieved only a low to medium degree of collateral damage.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:**\u00a0\u00a0So you feel that Dr. Kondraki\u2019s actions were acceptable?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:**\u00a0\u00a0He achieved his intended goal.\u00a0\u00a0However, the loss of manpower, multiple containment breaches, widespread damage to Site 19, and general lack of planning represent a gross oversight on the part of Dr. Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:**\u00a0\u00a0Demolishing a good chunk of a site is a little more than oversight in planning.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:**\u00a0\u00a0\u2026Sir, if I may say, I think we are focusing on the wrong direction.\u00a0\u00a0We assume that Dr. Kondraki is a \u201cloose cannon\u201d, a person who is reckless and puts zero foresight into anything he does.\u00a0\u00a0However, this is a narrow and dangerous assumption.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:**\u00a0\u00a0\u2026What are you talking about?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:**\u00a0\u00a0The human brain has a tendency to view highly complex and rapid patterns as random events.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that Dr. Kondraki used the termination of SCP-083 as an excuse, and the resulting highly destructive \u201cchase\u201d and containment breaches as a distraction.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:**\u00a0\u00a0So you\u2019re saying\u2026he planned it?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:**\u00a0\u00a0Not in a traditional sense.\u00a0\u00a0To use a mathematical example, he started with the solution, and worked backwards to create the problem.\u00a0\u00a0The multiple containment failures, the evacuation of items, SCP-083 and its attacks on site staff, all these stretched the resources of Site 19 to a dangerously thin level.\u00a0\u00a0This allowed him to achieve what I hypothesize to be his true goal.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:**\u00a0\u00a0\u2026which would be?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:**\u00a0\u00a0To ride SCP-682.\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-CLEF-01**\n\n> \n\n> **Clef:** WAIT, WHAT!?\n\n\n\n> **Audio Log C-682-K**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Well well well, look where we\u2019ve ended up now, Duke. Any guesses as to what\u2019s behind door number one?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** I couldn\u2019t give any less of a damn, because all I know is that I cut off the entrance to this area as I came in. You\u2019re trapped in here, doctor, trapped with me, and I\u2019m going to enjoy every moment of it. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** //[Laughs]// I figure you\u2019d do something like that. I\u2019ll admit that this wasn\u2019t the best place to make a tactical retreat, but I do still have my trump.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** And what\u2019s that, those stupid butterflies? You can\u2019t hide forever, and I will find you.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Oh god I cannot wait to see your face! //[Gestures to the megaphone]// But first, why don\u2019t we invite our friend out from his little room?\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Kondraki begins screaming a series of obscenities into the megaphone. SCP-083 attempts to cover his ears to no effect.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** What are yo-\n\n> \n\n> //[Roars and sounds of buckling metal and cracking concrete fill the air]//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** [Looks behind him] You\u2026.you son of a-!\n\n> \n\n> TRANSMISSION LOST\n\n\n\n//It was at this point that Command for Site 19 made the decision to quarantine all of Sector 3 for floors 7-15, sealing it from top to bottom and effectively sealing everything within the premises. With SCP-682 on the loose, SCP-083 still a threat, and Dr. Kondraki still breathing, it was hoped that the three would end up killing each other. With the survivor being significantly weakened by the preceding brawl, containment teams would move in to restore order.\u00a0\u00a0There were several unforeseen issues with this plan, namely not accounting for SCP-682 (who was contained in the sector on a purely temporary basis), or Dr. Kondraki\u2019s ingenuity. If it had taken such things into consideration, it would be wise to have suggested the use of nuclear weaponry.// -O5-2\n\n\n\n\n\n**Security Log C-682-K**\n\n\n\n> Dr. Kondraki is able to escape the initial charge of SCP-682 as it plows through the room, disappearing once again in a cloud of SCP-408. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 is seen engaging SCP-682, looking severely damaged from the assault but rapid regeneration is already observed helping him recover. SCP-083 is seen attempting to speak to SCP-682. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 pauses for a moment, and \u201cspeaks\u201d for a moment. Without warning, SCP-682 strikes at SCP-083 and tosses him across the room while severing two of his arms and one leg.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 attempts to retreat and regenerate, but isn\u2019t able to make distance between himself and SCP-682. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 devours SCP-083 whole. No activity until a large, rearing motion is made back.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki is seen now on the back of SCP-682, holding two ends of the high-tension cable he had recovered earlier. The rest was fitted into an improvised set of reins. Dr. Kondraki is observed \u201criding\u201d SCP-682, while hollering something and waving his hat with his free hand.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 enters an enraged state, and makes a powerful charge towards the entrance. It easily plows through the obstructions made by SCP-083, and then through the sealing walls. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki and SCP-682 have breached quarantine. Full evacuation protocols now in motion.\n\n\n\n//It was obvious at this point that things had truly escalated out of control. SCP-083 had been presumed neutralized, yes, but at the cost of releasing SCP-682 into Site 19 without proper personnel to enact containment procedures. Much like causing a flood to put out a kitchen fire, Dr. Kondraki\u2019s actions would put the entirety of Site 19 in grave danger. Most of the site\u2019s personnel had already been fully evacuated, while emergency teams attempted to stem the losses and mitigate what damages they could. The entire situation had become an unmanageable mess. Ironically, that\u2019s the exact kind of mess that Dr. Kondraki excels at managing.// - O5-2\n\n\n\n**Security Log C-682-19-K**\n\n\n\n> Dr. Kondraki stays atop SCP-682 for the duration, holding on despite the rapid jerking motions made by SCP-682 during its run. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 begins to adapt as seen in previous observations, having incurred noticeable damage in its attempts to break through various obstacles. Spikes of a bone-like material begin to shoot up from its back, in an attempt to harm or kill Dr. Kondraki.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki incurs several wounds in this manner, able to avoid most of the protrusions. He attempts to make a hard turn by pulling against the cables, and is able to direct SCP-682 from his course.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 continues to charge forward, now directed towards the personnel dormitories. During its dash, SCP-682 breaks through [[[SCP-173]]]\u2019s containment. At this time, both SCP-682 and Dr. Kondraki are observed to keep direct eye contact with SCP-173, despite each continuing their attempts to outmaneuver the other. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki is observed to speak to SCP-682, and a series of growls are recorded matching SCP-682\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 begins to crash its back into walls and ceilings, trying to crush the doctor. The apparent conversation continues. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki appears to laugh, and then make another harsh tug. He redirects SCP-682 once more, to the personnel cafeteria, after checking a device on his wrist. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 crashes through the second quarantine dividers, and arrives in the personnel sector.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki waits until SCP-682 arrives in the cafeteria. Holding onto the cables, he vaults forwards with tremendous force, swinging up and over SCP-682\u2019s head.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 now attempts to bite down on Dr. Kondraki as he scrambles to sit in a lone chair placed at the end of a table. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki vanishes from visual contact as SCP-682 devours him.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-682 continues to cause further structural damage. Begins advancing towards current evacuation zone.\n\n\n\n**Audio Log 682-K**\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** You really hold a grudge, don\u2019t you? \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-682:** You are by far\u2026the most annoying of your...\"species\" I have ever encountered. Killing you will be a favor for your whole reality. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** No need to do me any favors, Godzilla, since you made lunch of the vampire. Why don\u2019t we just let me off and call things square?\n\n> \n\n> //Sounds of crunching concrete and stressed metal//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** I guess that\u2019s not an option. How about you just-[grunt]-take me to my ride, and I\u2019ll get out of your hair?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-682:** Not only the most annoying, but the one most lacking of common sense. The only way this ends is with you dead and rotting faster than you already are.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Fair enough, let\u2019s try that.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-682:** That may be the first thing I've ever heard from one of you repulsive...things that I've agreed with.\n\n> \n\n> //The sound of metal scraping against enamel cancels out any conversation.

Audio logs confirm that the seated employee had won some form of bet previous to the incident. \n\n> \n\n> An explosion occurs elsewhere, causing a tremor. Several personnel falter, and SCP-298 is dropped.\n\n> An odd sound is heard and noticed by several of the men (the sound is now confirmed to be that of displaced air.) The personnel move to the back of the organ as they begin to hear a struggle.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki is spotted, having incurred several injuries. Making a leap, he bounds over SCP-298.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-083 is also spotted, covered in an unknown fluid. He rounds the corner after Dr. Kondraki, but only spots several personnel and the organ. Seen speaking.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki directs the man next to him to begin playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Audio Log C-298-K-083**\n\n\n\n> **SCP-083:** [yelling] Where is he!

I\u2019ll do whatever you want, anything, just stop playing that thing! I can\u2019t\u2026.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** So I was right, you can\u2019t regenerate your blood.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-083:** I\u2026don\u2019t want to die. I shouldn\u2019t have to die, not me!

It forms into a solid gel in the air, appearing as branches of a leafless tree. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki moves from SCP-298\u2019s platform, instructing him to keep playing. He disappears into a room down the hall.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-083\u2019s blood is now completely drained, causing his desiccated corpse to fall prone. His body seems to undergo an extremely rapid decomposition, the corpse being reduced to a hollow skeleton within a minute.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki returns with a glass container, and instructs the player to stop. He begins to collect the gelled blood from the air, placing it into the clear container. After less than a minute, the blood liquefies.\n\n> \n\n> Personnel appear to lack comprehension of the event that has just occurred.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. Kondraki seals the container and approaches the skeleton. Retrieving the skull, he places it under his arm. Dr. Kondraki exits Site 19 via helicopter with little trouble, assumed to be part of the evac team.\n\n> \n\n> Personnel are still somewhat stunned. The klaxons remind them that SCP-682 is still loose within Site 19.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-AR9-59**\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** So you do //not// think that Dr. Kondraki behaved recklessly?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rights:** I didn't say that, but relatively, compared to some of the things he's done...at least this one almost had a plan. Or some facsimile of one.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** You have viewed the entirety of the logs, yes?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rights:** Yep. All of it. A few times, actually, and I had to review my favorite parts.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** And you have no worries about Dr. Kondraki being a liability or a danger?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rights:** Look, the man's a master of the Indy Ploy. And sometimes, actually...all the time, there's collateral damage. But that doesn't change the fact that he, in some bizarre way, knows what he's doing. And hey...if it's saved my ass a few dozen times over, that doesn't hurt.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** So your personal opinion is that he is not a liability?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rights:** Not as much as Edward effing Cullen, there. I mean...I've got just as big a vampire fetish as the next girl who grew up reading Anne Rice, but come on. Plus, throwing cat pee on him! That was beautiful!\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** ...And in your professional opinion, having worked with Dr. Kondraki in the past?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rights:** ...You clearly haven't been to site 17 lately. Professional is...not my forte. Or Kondraki's for that matter. Shame about Site 19, though...at least it went out in a blaze of badassery.\n\n\n\n**Breakroom Surveillance Log S17-\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**\n\n\n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Oh my god, how does he keep making things worse?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** No idea.

The tree had blasted through the safety glass and through the driver's seat, knocking the steering wheel off its column, through the headrest, and into the back seat. A clearly unsurvivable accident.</p>\n<p>Except for the young man in the grey duster sitting on top of the transmission hump, smoking a cigarette. Clearly a dangerous activity given the heavy scent of leaking gasoline in the air.</p>\n<p>The glare of halogen-bright headlights coming down the curve interrupted his reverie, so he hopped down from the mangled wreck, tossing his still-glowing cigarette butt into the passenger-side seat. He climbed up the embankment and stepped into the middle of the road, waving a battered Yankees baseball cap over his head. The Mitsubishi pulled up beside the wreck, and he walked over to the driver's side window, where an obese, balding man with a furrowed brow glared up at him angrily.</p>\n<p>\"You're late,\" the young man said, showing him the time on a Mickey Mouse watch. \"You said you'd be here twenty minutes ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"You said you could take this guy in. What happened?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm guessing a little girl happened,\" the young man said.</p>\n<p>\"How the fuck do you figure?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I don't know. You think maybe the little girl whom you told me could mess around with electronics might have had something to do with the inexplicable failure of my car's transmission system? I thought you told me she could only affect computers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shut up. You're supposed to be the best. My bosses paid a lot of money for you. So far you've given us shit. Get in the car.\"</p>\n<p>The young man walked to the passenger's side without another word, tossed his grey duster in the back seat and climbed in. \"Little girls,\" he muttered. \"It's always little girls. Make a note, if you have a chance to fight a seven-story monster or a kindergartener, take the monster, you'll live longer.\" Behind him, the gas fumes had finally started to ignite, and blue-yellow flames were licking the upholstery of the wrecked Crown Vic. \"I'm going to need a new car, and a six-man support team,\" the young man said. \"In addition\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You're getting jack shit.\" The young man felt cold steel against his temple. He glanced up into the rear view mirror. Walther PPK. 9x17mm. Silver finish. Ivory grips. Stylish gun, must have cost a small fortune. \"This experiment is over. We're switching back to our usual MO, and you're going to hell.\"</p>\n<p>\"I really wouldn't do that if I were you,\" the young man said. His voice was low, and flat, deliberately cool, like a snake in the rushes. \"Not with only a gun. I'd recommend a stake and some holy water.\"</p>\n<p>The fat man laughed. \"Shut up. Aren't you a fucking lousy liar.\"</p>\n<p>\"You shut up. You won't kill me.

The tree had blasted through the safety glass and through the driver's seat, knocking the steering wheel off its column, through the headrest, and into the back seat. A clearly unsurvivable accident.\n\n\n\nExcept for the young man in the grey duster sitting on top of the transmission hump, smoking a cigarette. Clearly a dangerous activity given the heavy scent of leaking gasoline in the air.\n\n\n\nThe glare of halogen-bright headlights coming down the curve interrupted his reverie, so he hopped down from the mangled wreck, tossing his still-glowing cigarette butt into the passenger-side seat. He climbed up the embankment and stepped into the middle of the road, waving a battered Yankees baseball cap over his head. The Mitsubishi pulled up beside the wreck, and he walked over to the driver's side window, where an obese, balding man with a furrowed brow glared up at him angrily.\n\n\n\n\"You're late,\" the young man said, showing him the time on a Mickey Mouse watch. \"You said you'd be here twenty minutes ago.\"\n\n\n\n\"You said you could take this guy in. What happened?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm guessing a little girl happened,\" the young man said. \n\n\n\n\"How the fuck do you figure?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I don't know. You think maybe the little girl whom you told me could mess around with electronics might have had something to do with the inexplicable failure of my car's transmission system? I thought you told me she could only affect computers.\"\n\n\n\n\"Shut up. You're supposed to be the best. My bosses paid a lot of money for you. So far you've given us shit. Get in the car.\"\n\n\n\nThe young man walked to the passenger's side without another word, tossed his grey duster in the back seat and climbed in. \"Little girls,\" he muttered. \"It's always little girls. Make a note, if you have a chance to fight a seven-story monster or a kindergartener, take the monster, you'll live longer.\" Behind him, the gas fumes had finally started to ignite, and blue-yellow flames were licking the upholstery of the wrecked Crown Vic. \"I'm going to need a new car, and a six-man support team,\" the young man said. \"In addition. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"You're getting jack shit.\" The young man felt cold steel against his temple. He glanced up into the rear view mirror. Walther PPK. 9x17mm. Silver finish. Ivory grips. Stylish gun, must have cost a small fortune. \"This experiment is over. We're switching back to our usual MO, and you're going to hell.\"\n\n\n\n\"I really wouldn't do that if I were you,\" the young man said. His voice was low, and flat, deliberately cool, like a snake in the rushes. \"Not with only a gun. I'd recommend a stake and some holy water.\"\n\n\n\nThe fat man laughed. \"Shut up. Aren't you a fucking lousy liar.\"\n\n\n\n\"You shut up. You won't kill me. You paid a lot of money for me, and your bosses won't like it if you waste resources.\" \n\n\n\n\"My bosses don't know about you. This is an independent operation. Perfect deniability. You were dead the moment that you took the contract.

In the lurid scarlet light, the fat man's features appeared harsh, cruel. . . yes, even demonic.\n\n\n\nThe young man smiled, a wide, mirthless smile showing lots of crooked white teeth. \"No support. No resources. No replacement car. I guess that makes sense.\" The young man leaned his head back and sighed, staring up at the roof of the car. \"My mistake. I guess I've gotten soft. But one thing that I haven't forgotten. . .\"\n\n\n\nThere was a gunshot, and a brief flurry of movement, and then the small Mitsubishi leaped forward like a pouncing cat. The tiny car swerved off the side of the road and over the edge of the embankment, where it tumbled end over end down the rocky ravine and crashed, inverted, into a small creek bed at the bottom of the hill.

She is wired to all sorts of machines, beeping and booping, all of them designed to keep her alive. All of them unneeded. He leans over the bed, a pleasant smile on his face. \"You can get up now.\"</p>\n<p>The girl scrunches her eyes tightly together, not looking at him. \"Go 'way! 'M in a coma!\"</p>\n<p>The older gentleman tsks at her words. \"Now, you may have the mundane believing that, but you and I both know better. Come on, lazy bones, get up now!\"</p>\n<p>The girl opens one eyelid halfway, peering at the man. He looks so pleasant and charming, like her grandfather! But there's something about him, something the\u2026 what did he call them, mundanes? wouldn't see. A veiled\u2026 hatred? \"I'm not supposed to leave the bed. The Doctors will get angry.\" Again.</p>\n<p>\"No worries, my dear. I'll see to it they never even notice you're gone.\" He gestures absently with a hand, and the girl feels a tingle in her skin. Sitting up, she notices that there is now another girl in her bed, to whom all the instruments are attached. She eagerly hops out of bed, clapping her hands.</p>\n<p>\"Yey! Thank you, poppy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm, yes. Now, we can't have you going out and about in that dreadful hospital gown, can we?\" He ponders for a moment, trying to decide what would be most appropriate, but even as he thinks, the little girl bobs her head, and is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. \"Well. Someone has more control then we were given to think. Tell me.\" Offering her his hand. \"Do you know what you are?\"</p>\n<p>\"The doctors keep calling me a, uhm, reality bender? It means, I can do anything, right?\" She takes his hand warily.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm, you have grown ready for this. Come, let me show you.\" And the two of them vanish.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They sit together on a bench, watching the world go by. It is a horrible world, where mankind has been reduced to a more primal state. They hug the light, and fear the darkness, for terrible things exist in the darkness. Sitting on the park bench, the old man and the little girl watch as creatures of nightmare stalk the shadows, waiting to find a lone human, and take them.</p>\n<p>\"Where are we?\" She asks, innocently. She knows nothing here can hurt her, knows it in her heart, and so it must be true.</p>\n<p>\"A future.\" He responds flippantly.</p>\n<p>\"Don't you mean, <em>the</em> future?\" She corrects him, in that know it all tone little children have.</p>\n<p>\"No child, I mean <em>a</em> future. This is not necessarily the future that occurs, it is simply the one I choose to show you. It could just as easily be this one.\" And with a wave of his hands, they are sitting in a utopia, the sun shining, the people laughing and smiling, no sick or injured, everything\u2026 perfect.</p>\n<p>The girl studies the people, then looks up at the old man. \"So, Reality Benders can travel to the future?\"</p>\n<p>He winces, shaking his head a little sadly. \"Please! We prefer the term Shapers.\"</p>\n<p>\"But aren't we Reality Benders?\"</p>\n<p>He coughs into his hand. \"Well, you see, it's like the difference between using the word African over the word Negro. While both are correct terminology, one is more polite, and one wasn't given to us by people who aren't us.\"</p>\n<p>She frowns in concentration, then nods slowly. \"I think I get it. But, why Shapers?\"</p>\n<p>He laughs. \"Well, we have to call ourselves something, don't we? And we do Shape things to our whim.\"</p>\n<p>\"But, the future?\"</p>\n<p>\"Like a dog with a bone, you. Very well then. No, we Shapers cannot travel in time, as such. We can view other times, and affect them, to some degree, but we are bound from actually traveling to them.\" He puffs lightly on his pipe as he speaks.</p>\n<p>\"So, you mean, we can make things happen here, but not actually touch things?\" It's hard to keep up sometimes, but then she just imagines herself getting it, and she does.</p>\n<p>\"That's it exactly!\" It would sound like praise, to any one else. But she hears the edge in it.</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, to understand that, you must understand the Game. And to understand the Game, you must play it.\" The old man stands up, offering her his hand.</p>\n<p>\"Come, walk with me to the Great Hall.\"</p>\n<p>The girl stands as well, but refuses his hand. The longer she is with this man, the less she trusts him. He's nice, pleasant, fatherly, always smiling\u2026 but there is something behind his eyes. Something darker that she can feel with her mind, if not her senses. Sometimes, when she isn't looking at him, it almost feels like he is licking his lips. \"Show me the way.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is rather a difficult path, but\u2026 if you insist.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The path is a long one, and filled with many a twist and turn. The girl pauses at one turn, staring into the halls of another Foundation. The walls and people are fuzzy, as if poorly tuned in. She turns to the older man, frowning. \"What's wrong with this one?\"</p>\n<p>He laughs, a jovial sound. \"Ah, this reality is more unlikely than most. See?\" One of the doors blows open, a young boy and an old man with a beard, both holding wands and dressed in robes, strolling through, destroying Foundation agents with simple flicks of their wands. \"This one is near impossible to actually happen, so it comes in rougher.\"</p>\n<p>He starts to walk, sedately, in some realities with a cane, in others with a limp, but in most with a sort of slow amble. It all depends on how you look at him, really. But however he actually walks, the end result is him leaving this plane of existence, and passing into another one. The girl takes one last, long lingering look at the fuzzy reality, as a girl who looks remarkably like her runs to the wand-wielding males, then turns to follow him. Around him, the sound of dice clattering, of cards slapping the table, and of figures being moved from one spot to the next is almost constant. The Great Hall is many things, but quiet, it is not.</p>\n<p>He takes a moment to look around at table after table of Shapers, all involved in their own little games. Here, the fate of worlds is decided, based on some of the smallest of things. On the outskirts, the low-level Shapers influence the fall of a leaf, the flow of water down a window pane. Moving inwards you find the more experienced Shapers, using regular humans like chess pieces, to further their own goals. The final ring contains those Shapers who duel with entire nations. Some of these appear almost frozen in time, as long-term strategies are waited upon.</p>\n<p>And in the middle is his table, alone at the moment. Here, he plays all the games, great and small, but with only one stake. But it's still the most important game there is.</p>\n<p>He turns as the girl finds her way here, his face automatically cheerful and welcoming. She'll never see it coming, when it happens. She'll play him, oh yes, and never know, until he wins. And he will win. He has plenty of trophies to attest to that.</p>\n<p>The trophies line the ceiling of the great hall, humanoid statues, once powerful Shapers, now nothing more than remnants of ideas, bound in time, their powers lost to the old man, used to make him even more powerful. His eyes stop at an empty space, and he whistles a sharp note, narrowing his eyes. \"He's out again, is he? Ah, well, I will have him back.\"</p>\n<p>The girl doesn't notice his words, too intent on studying the people they are passing. Two Asian boys are embroiled in a rather determined game of Go. As she watches, she can see how the pieces are more than just pieces, the natural forces, and people they represent. Something in her tells her how they move, how they fit. She shyly steps up to the boy on the left, and points to a spot on the board. \"You should put a piece there.\"</p>\n<p>\"There? But that wins me nothing,\" he protests.</p>\n<p>\"Just trust me. One man, right there.\" She nods at him. He waffles over the choice, then nods and does so. In a normal game of Go, nothing would be won. But in this game, half of the board changes over to his side with that one piece.</p>\n<p>\"Nicely played,\" the old man acknowledges.</p>\n<p>\"It was just obvious.\" The two pass another table, where a red-haired man in Arabic dress sits next to a man who seems to be surrounded by a halo of flames. Their opponent is\u2026 well, it changes. One minute it is a horrible monster with the head of a pig, the next, it is an old man with a ruby where his heart should be. Their game is one she has never seen before, what appears to be some form of large structure, with each player taking turns moving the various rooms of the structure, and moving pieces inside of it as well. The old man snorts.</p>\n<p>\"Tamlin is playing with himself again. Sad.\" He leads her onwards, to the center table, and gestures her towards the far seat. \"Here is where you and I shall play.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't like chess,\" the girl protests, even as she finds herself sitting. He takes his place across from her, behind the white pieces.</p>\n<p>\"Chess is merely a metaphor. I approve of the symbolism because it is a game for gentlemen, a game with quite a large degree of finesse. Of course, the goal we play towards is something fairly different\u2026 \" He smiles over the board at her. \"A simple bet.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to play.\" She tries to stand, but finds she cannot. The old man's smile widens. The other players in the room are pointedly not looking at her.</p>\n<p>\"You don't have a choice, my dear. You came here with me, you play my game. If you had come here on your own, perhaps you might have had a chance, but as it stands \u2014 Well, a simple bet, as I said.\" He touches his king briefly. For a moment, the piece looks like three different men, three brothers. \"Your goal is to give one of these men, a happy ending.\"</p>\n<p>The girl stares at him, shocked. \"You want me to give them a handjob?\"</p>\n<p>He bursts out laughing, a loud, booming, joyous sound. \"Oh, my dear, you have spent too much time around those despicable and mundane researchers. No my dear, I mean set things up so that their story ends happily. \" He waves off her attempt to comment. \"No, not for the rest of their lives, merely that this chapter of their existence gets a happy ending. You pick up on things quickly, I'm sure you'll figure it out.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to play chess.\" She's pouting now, arms crossed over her chest.</p>\n<p>\"It doesn't matter. If you fail to play, I win, by default, and make their lives miserable.\" He moves his first pawn forward. On the board, it is merely a pawn. But, in the real world, agents of the Foundation are redirected, and a rather callous man is placed in charge of the containment of an SCP with the mind of a child.</p>\n<p>\"I don't play chess!\" She declares emphatically, glaring at the board. A slow smile creeps over her features. \"But I do play Yu-Gi-Oh.\" She stares at the board intently, her face furrowed in concentration. A slow change occurs on her half of the board, until it resembles one half chess, one half children's card game. She looks up at him, from the cards in her hand, and smiles. Quickly, she places a card on the table, the image showing a sand dune. \"I play the hungry sands, in defense mode! And then I cast a past immortality on it\" She drops a card on top of the first one, this one displaying an amulet with a ruby stone in the middle. Sometime, many years ago, a researcher-turned-SCP gets lost in the desert. The SCP is recovered, but only after a month has passed, and his mind is imprinted on the hive mind living there.</p>\n<p>The old man stares at her, and, for once, an emotion other than joviality appears on his face. He is shocked. More than that, for the first time in a long time, he is surprised. The Great Hall has grown silent, every eye upon the game in the middle. \"What are you looking at?\" he asks them, without looking around. The sounds pick up again, as the other Shapers return to their games.</p>\n<p>343 leans forward, the smile once again rising to his face as he gazes at the transformed board. \"I don't know how you did that. But that's what is going to make this interesting.\"</p>\n<p>239 can't help but smile back. \"Game on.\"</p>\n<p>Next: <a href=\"/unfinished-business\">Unfinished Business</a> And yes, it does all fit together.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/games-reality-benders-play\">Games Reality Benders Play</a>\" by AdminBright, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

But there's something about him, something the... what did he call them, mundanes? wouldn't see. A veiled... hatred? \"I'm not supposed to leave the bed. The Doctors will get angry.\" Again.\n\n\n\n\"No worries, my dear. I'll see to it they never even notice you're gone.\" He gestures absently with a hand, and the girl feels a tingle in her skin. Sitting up, she notices that there is now another girl in her bed, to whom all the instruments are attached. She eagerly hops out of bed, clapping her hands.\n\n\n\n\"Yey! Thank you, poppy.\" \n\n\n\n\"Hmm, yes. Now, we can't have you going out and about in that dreadful hospital gown, can we?\" He ponders for a moment, trying to decide what would be most appropriate, but even as he thinks, the little girl bobs her head, and is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. \"Well. Someone has more control then we were given to think. Tell me.\" Offering her his hand. \"Do you know what you are?\"\n\n\n\n\"The doctors keep calling me a, uhm, reality bender? It means, I can do anything, right?\" She takes his hand warily.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm, you have grown ready for this. Come, let me show you.\" And the two of them vanish.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nThey sit together on a bench, watching the world go by. It is a horrible world, where mankind has been reduced to a more primal state. They hug the light, and fear the darkness, for terrible things exist in the darkness. Sitting on the park bench, the old man and the little girl watch as creatures of nightmare stalk the shadows, waiting to find a lone human, and take them.\n\n\n\n\"Where are we?\" She asks, innocently. She knows nothing here can hurt her, knows it in her heart, and so it must be true.\n\n\n\n\"A future.\" He responds flippantly.\n\n\n\n\"Don't you mean, //the// future?\" She corrects him, in that know it all tone little children have.\n\n\n\n\"No child, I mean //a//\u00a0\u00a0future. This is not necessarily the future that occurs, it is simply the one I choose to show you. It could just as easily be this one.\" And with a wave of his hands, they are sitting in a utopia, the sun shining, the people laughing and smiling, no sick or injured, everything... perfect. \n\n\n\nThe girl studies the people, then looks up at the old man. \"So, Reality Benders can travel to the future?\"\n\n\n\nHe winces, shaking his head a little sadly. \"Please! We prefer the term Shapers.\"\n\n\n\n\"But aren't we Reality Benders?\"\n\n\n\nHe coughs into his hand. \"Well, you see, it's like the difference between using the word African over the word Negro. While both are correct terminology, one is more polite, and one wasn't given to us by people who aren't us.\"\n\n\n\nShe frowns in concentration, then nods slowly. \"I think I get it. But, why Shapers?\"\n\n\n\nHe laughs. \"Well, we have to call ourselves something, don't we? And we do Shape things to our whim.\"\n\n\n\n\"But, the future?\"\n\n\n\n\"Like a dog with a bone, you. Very well then. No, we Shapers cannot travel in time, as such. We can view other times, and affect them, to some degree, but we are bound from actually traveling to them.\" He puffs lightly on his pipe as he speaks.\n\n\n\n\"So, you mean, we can make things happen here, but not actually touch things?\" It's hard to keep up sometimes, but then she just imagines herself getting it, and she does.\n\n\n\n\"That's it exactly!\" It would sound like praise, to any one else. But she hears the edge in it.\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, to understand that, you must understand the Game. And to understand the Game, you must play it.\" The old man stands up, offering her his hand.\n\n\n\n\"Come, walk with me to the Great Hall.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl stands as well, but refuses his hand.\u00a0\u00a0The longer she is with this man, the less she trusts him. He's nice, pleasant, fatherly, always smiling... but there is something behind his eyes. Something darker that she can feel with her mind, if not her senses. Sometimes, when she isn't looking at him, it almost feels like he is licking his lips. \"Show me the way.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is rather a difficult path, but... if you insist.\" \n\n\n\n----\n\nThe path is a long one, and filled with many a twist and turn. The girl pauses at one turn, staring into the halls of another Foundation. The walls and people are fuzzy, as if poorly tuned in. She turns to the older man, frowning. \"What's wrong with this one?\"\n\n\n\nHe laughs, a jovial sound. \"Ah, this reality is more unlikely than most. See?\" One of the doors blows open, a young boy and an old man with a beard, both holding wands and dressed in robes, strolling through, destroying Foundation agents with simple flicks of their wands. \"This one is near impossible to actually happen, so it comes in rougher.\"\n\n\n\nHe starts to walk, sedately, in some realities with a cane, in others with a limp, but in most with a sort of slow amble.\u00a0\u00a0It all depends on how you look at him, really. But however he actually walks, the end result is him leaving this plane of existence, and passing into another one. The girl takes one last, long lingering look at the fuzzy reality, as a girl who looks remarkably like her runs to the wand-wielding males, then turns to follow him.\u00a0\u00a0Around him, the sound of dice clattering, of cards slapping the table, and of figures being moved from one spot to the next is almost constant. The Great Hall is many things, but quiet, it is not.\n\n\n\nHe takes a moment to look around at table after table of Shapers, all involved in their own little games.\u00a0\u00a0Here, the fate of worlds is decided, based on some of the smallest of things. On the outskirts, the low-level Shapers influence the fall of a leaf, the flow of water down a\u00a0\u00a0window pane. Moving inwards you find the more experienced Shapers, using regular humans like chess pieces, to further their own goals. The final ring contains those Shapers who duel with entire nations. Some of these appear almost frozen in time, as long-term strategies are waited upon.\n\n\n\nAnd in the middle is his table, alone at the moment. Here, he plays all the games, great and small, but with only one stake. But it's still the most important game there is.\n\n\n\nHe turns as the girl finds her way here, his face automatically cheerful and welcoming. She'll never see it coming, when it happens. She'll play him, oh yes, and never know, until he wins. And he will win. He has plenty of trophies to attest to that.\n\n\n\nThe trophies line the ceiling of the great hall, humanoid statues, once powerful Shapers, now nothing more than remnants of ideas, bound in time, their powers lost to the old man, used to make him even more powerful. His eyes stop at an empty space, and he whistles a sharp note, narrowing his eyes. \"He's out again, is he? Ah, well, I will have him back.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl doesn't notice his words, too intent on studying the people they are passing. Two Asian boys are embroiled in a rather determined game of Go. As she watches, she can see how the pieces are more than just pieces, the natural forces, and people they represent. Something in her tells her how they move, how they fit. She shyly steps up to the boy on the left, and points to a spot on the board. \"You should put a piece there.\"\n\n\n\n\"There? But that wins me nothing,\" he protests.\n\n\n\n\"Just trust me. One man, right there.\" She nods at him. He waffles over the choice, then nods and does so. In a normal game of Go, nothing would be won. But in this game, half of the board changes over to his side with that one piece.\n\n\n\n\"Nicely played,\" the old man acknowledges.\n\n\n\n\"It was just obvious.\" The two pass another table, where a red-haired man in Arabic dress sits next to a man who seems to be surrounded by a halo of flames. Their opponent is... well, it changes. One minute it is a horrible monster with the head of a pig, the next, it is an old man with a ruby where his heart should be. Their game is one she has never seen before, what appears to be some form of large structure, with each player taking turns moving the various rooms of the structure, and moving pieces inside of it as well. The old man snorts.\n\n\n\n\"Tamlin is playing with himself again. Sad.\" He leads her onwards, to the center table, and gestures her towards the far seat. \"Here is where you and I shall play.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't like chess,\" the girl protests, even as she finds herself sitting. He takes his place across from her, behind the white pieces.\n\n\n\n\"Chess is merely a metaphor. I approve of the symbolism because it is a game for gentlemen, a game with quite a large degree of finesse. Of course, the goal we play towards is something fairly different... \" He smiles over the board at her. \"A simple bet.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to play.\" She tries to stand, but finds she cannot. The old man's smile widens. The other players in the room are pointedly not looking at her.\n\n\n\n\"You don't have a choice, my dear. You came here with me, you play my game. If you had come here on your own, perhaps you might have had a chance, but as it stands -- Well, a simple bet, as I said.\" He touches his king briefly. For a moment, the piece looks like three different men, three brothers. \"Your goal is to give one of these men, a happy ending.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl stares at him, shocked. \"You want me to give them a handjob?\"\n\n\n\nHe bursts out laughing, a loud, booming, joyous sound. \"Oh, my dear, you have spent too much time around those despicable and mundane researchers. No my dear, I mean set things up so that their story ends happily. \" He waves off her attempt to comment. \"No, not for the rest of their lives, merely that this chapter of their existence gets a happy ending. You pick up on things quickly, I'm sure you'll figure it out.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to play chess.\" She's pouting now, arms crossed over her chest.\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter. If you fail to play, I win, by default, and make their lives miserable.\" He moves his first pawn forward. On the board, it is merely a pawn. But, in the real world, agents of the Foundation are redirected, and a rather callous man is placed in charge of the containment of an SCP with the mind of a child.\n\n\n\n\"I don't play chess!\" She declares emphatically, glaring at the board. A slow smile creeps over her features. \"But I do play Yu-Gi-Oh.\" She stares at the board intently, her face furrowed in concentration. A slow change occurs on her half of the board, until it resembles one half chess, one half children's card game. She looks up at him, from the cards in her hand, and smiles. Quickly, she places a card on the table, the image showing a sand dune. \"I play the hungry sands, in defense mode! And then I cast a past immortality on it\" She drops a card on top of the first one, this one displaying an amulet with a ruby stone in the middle. Sometime, many years ago, a researcher-turned-SCP gets lost in the desert. The SCP is recovered, but only after a month has passed, and his mind is imprinted on the hive mind living there.\n\n\n\nThe old man stares at her, and, for once, an emotion other than joviality appears on his face. He is shocked. More than that, for the first time in a long time, he is surprised. The Great Hall has grown silent, every eye upon the game in the middle. \"What are you looking at?\" he asks them, without looking around. The sounds pick up again, as the other Shapers return to their games.\n\n\n\n343 leans forward, the smile once again rising to his face as he gazes at the transformed board. \"I don't know how you did that. But that's what is going to make this interesting.\"\n\n\n\n239 can't help but smile back. \"Game on.\"\n\n\n\nNext: [[[unfinished-business |Unfinished Business]]] And yes, it does all fit together.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["unfinished-business", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "adventure", "fantasy", "otherworldly", "sigurros", "tale"], "title": "Games Reality Benders Play - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/games-reality-benders-play", "year": 2009}, "iceberg-puts-135-on-ice": {"created_at": "2009-03-24T23:19:00", "creator": "Iceberg 7", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Iceberg 7", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iceberg-7", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-24T23:19:00"}, {"author": "Iceberg 7", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iceberg-7", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-24T23:20:00"}, {"author": "Iceberg 7", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iceberg-7", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-24T23:21:00"}, {"author": "Iceberg 7", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iceberg-7", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-25T00:00:00"}, {"author": "snorlison", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snorlison", "comment": "Adding rating module", "date": "2009-03-25T00:26:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Apparently because not only has the job been given to Clef, and he has accepted, but there\u2019s something about a slight \u201cissue\u201d I caused.\n\nOr several.\n\nLook, I did not know it still had fuel in it. \n\nThat one wasn\u2019t even my fault.\n\nThis one? I regret nothing.\n\nNow, everyone thought this one was funny.\n\nAnd those D-class had it fucking coming.\n\nIt seems I must take matters into my own hands. I don\u2019t have much time, but in my spare time I devised a method to destroy it. I need simply to get what I need and prepare the room. It\u2019s so simple and cheap, not to mention with so little destruction to anything else, they\u2019ll have to be impressed! Big leagues, here I come! Now, it\u2019ll take an all-nighter, so I better start. Clef could get around to this anytime.// \n\n-----\n\n\n\nAt \u2588\u2588\u2588 hours SCP-135 was discovered missing.\n\nAt \u2588\u2588\u2588 hours its remains were found.\n\n\n\nVideo record of room \u2588\u2588 during \u2588\u2588\u2588 to \u2588\u2588\u2588 hours.\n\n\n\n//The room is completely empty, and seemingly has no special features beyond its metal walls. Dr. Iceberg enters the room, wearing a heavy coat, of the style used by agents working in low temperature environments or with SCPs capable of influencing temperature, a bag and an oxygen tank. Behind him in is a man later confirmed as D-\u2588\u2588-2348.

Upgrade on the technology NASA based their space suits on.\n\n>\n\n> [At this point, Dr. Iceberg hooked himself up to the oxygen tank and pulled on the hood of the suit up. Several seconds later, a common handgun is thrown into the room. Object lands near D-\u2588\u2588-2348\u2019s feet, and soon transforms into a copy of the man.]\n\n>\n\n> D-class: What th-\n\n>\n\n> Dr. Iceberg: Come on, Haven\u2019t seen something stranger? You\u2019ve been here a month ain\u2019t ya?\n\n>\n\n> D-class: Yeah, well-\n\n>\n\n> Dr. Iceberg: Eh, doesn\u2019t matter. Just stay quiet and you\u2019ll be free to go in no time. Hm\u2026 push it back a couple feet. So, 135, you able to talk?\n\n>\n\n> [3 minutes of silence, with 135 simply copying D-\u2588\u2588-2348]\n\n>\n\n> Dr. Iceberg: No last words then? Ah, well. Good bye you, hello promotion.\n\n>\n\n> [Dr. Iceberg holds up and presses a bright blue button, at which point a small ball of ice shoots from the ceiling onto 135\u2019s \u201chead\u201d, and soon begins turning into a gas]\n\n>\n\n> D-class: And that is?\n\n>\n\n> 135: [Unintelligible language]\n\n>\n\n> Dr. Iceberg: A solid nitrogen snowball.\n\n\n\n//Multiple holes open up above, below, and to either side of 135 and D-\u2588\u2588-2348, pelting both with large amounts of solid and liquid nitrogen. After \u2588 minutes 57 seconds, this ceases. Dr. Iceberg turns and opens his bag, pulling out a \u201csawn-off\u201d shotgun.//\n\n\n\n> Dr. Iceberg: Man, have I ever wanted to do this.\n\n\n\n[Dr. Iceberg aims the gun at the frozen figures, spinning the gun on its trigger before firing both loaded shots, shattering both. After checking the pieces, he walks over to the door, and attempts to open it. After initial failure, he is noted to shout.]\n\n\n\n> Dr. Iceberg: Oh damnit! Door froze\u2026.. Help! Hey, someone out there! Come on, I just need someone to open the door!\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-iceberg", "tale"], "title": "Iceberg puts 135 on ice - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/iceberg-puts-135-on-ice", "year": 2009}, "incident-report-i-028-f": {"created_at": "2009-09-06T11:09:00", "creator": "wanabeswordsman", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "wanabeswordsman", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/wanabeswordsman", "comment": "", "date": "2009-09-06T11:09:00"}, {"author": "wanabeswordsman", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/wanabeswordsman", "comment": "Patching up things based on suggestions.

We could talk between the groups, but not with anyone outside of the storm, almost as if they had dropped off of the face of the planet. Anyway, Smith's group kept moving for about four and a half hours, but they said they saw absolutely no other people or the facility that was set up nearby. They also said there was absolutely no change in the terrain, as if the tundra never ended.

I was on break in the little shelter we had set up when I heard yelling from outside. I went outside and saw three of the researchers down in the snow, bleeding pretty badly.

The whole place was a madhouse with people running around, while <em>things</em> were killing people left and right.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sylvius:</strong> What did they look like?</p>\n<p><strong>Thompson:</strong> I have no clue. Like I said before, you couldn't see anything in the snow and the wind. All I could tell is that whatever they were, they weren't human.

These things kept jumping in and out of the snow, and we couldn't see them for more than a split second, let alone hurt them. They were obviously experts and fighting with those conditions. We had no hope. So I made a break for the cabin. The moment I slammed the door shut behind me, this huge fucking knife stabs right through the door. If I was half a second slower, it would have gone straight through my head. I could hear them out there, growling and screaming at me, but the walls were too thick for them to get through. What they did do was break the three inch thick bullet-proof windows the shelter had, and left me there to freeze to death. I spent five and a half hours huddled in the corner, covered in blankets and hoping the storm would end early.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sylvius:</strong> Interesting.

Tell me, Thompson, what exactly were you doing at the site?\n\n\n\n**Thompson:** Well, I was helping all of the researchers make it through the storm. Studying something during a blizzard in Greenland isn't exactly the safest thing in the world.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Sylvius:** Indeed. So, the report says that SCP-C activated at 1300 hours. Could you tell me what happened then?\n\n\n\n**Thompson:** Well, that's when the thing started to spin. That's also when things really became nasty.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Sylvius:** How so?\n\n\n\n**Thompson:** Well, the wind shot up 'til it was hard to stand, it was blowing so hard. It was snowing worse than before, and it was colder than hell, let me tell you. The visibility just started out bad enough, and it got to the point you had trouble seeing your hand in front of your face. And those were just the issues with the weather.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Sylvius:** There were other problems?\n\n\n\n**Thompson:** Yep. First was the sun.

Hana had been invited to the ocean god's palace. She went there in a banana-leaf canoe, drifting through an orange ocean, the sea melting into the sunset, without beginning or end. When she reached the horizon, the canoe took her down, down into the realm of the ocean god. Big ocean animals stand guard outside the palace, and they let her in the diamond-studded coral gate. As she drifted in, through halls made from granite, painted with red ochre, palace servants and guards look on. They were wearing vivid seaweed clothes, with indigo lining and bangles, unlike her tribesmen, which wore linen sarongs and simple accessories. And then, she was led to the throne room, to meet the ocean god. The ocean god sits on his throne made from coral, pearl, and insets of gold doubloons, majestic and towering. Behind the throne was the ocean god's guardian creature, massive and powerful, yet calming and soft at the same time. The ocean god rose and spoke, \"Little girl, I have waited long for you.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Hana's village was in an uproar. The local shaman had said a week ago that something big would happen, but nobody had expected it to be this. The shaman's house was crowded, over something that happened last night. Hana had been questioned by the shaman all morning, over the dream she had, a rare pearl of the night. The shaman, wearing her sacred forest-fowl feather garb, went out of her house and exclaimed to the crowd.</p>\n<p>\"Hana had been chosen by the ocean god! Hana had been chosen by the ocean god!\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Menehana Mauaki's parents were worried. They couldn't bear the thought of sending their only child to the open sea. But, the ocean god's will must be fulfilled, or their village will suffer. The shaman had already pointed out that this dream had occurred rarely in the past; few had dreams about the orange sea, and even fewer had the chance to see the ocean god himself. But almost nobody had been directly invited to the ocean god's palace. Her mother was worried about what could be so important about her daughter, to be chosen by the ocean god. True, she learned to swim earlier than the other girls, and learned how to row canoes earlier than the boys, but she had not thought it to be special. \"Mother, why are you so worried?\" Hana asked. \"Oh, dear child, I am afraid.\" \"Afraid of what, mother?\" \"I am afraid that I will never see you again. I am sure your father thinks the same, even though he is now catching fish in the ocean.\" \"Don't worry mother! I will ask the ocean god about this.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>That night, again Hana rowed the banana-leaf canoe through the orange ocean, into the gates of the ocean god's palace, through the hallways and the corridors. At last, she reached the throne-room, and there, still sitting in his throne, and still as majestic as the last time, the ocean god. \"Child, have you considered my offer? There is not much time left.\" \"I would do it, but I do need something, o ocean god.\" \"Then speak. I would grant that which is in my power.\" \"My parents were afraid that they will never see me again. I am concerned about them.\" \"Let go of that concern, child, and give them this.\" The ocean god stroke his hands, and at once the creature behind the throne produced a pair of something. Something made from limestone, with red ochre lines. \"You will know how to use it. Give one to your parents, and keep one to yourself. Save your future worries to the journey ahead, child.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>And that morning, Hana woke up with the two objects the ocean god gave her. The village was again in an uproar. The village shaman ran to Hana's house as soon as the story of the recent dream reached her ears. \"You are truly blessed, child. From what the ancestor spirits tell me, these are a manifestation of kindred ocean spirits. They will enable you to connect with faraway people, even through the spirit world. Only the first ancestor had seen something like this! I am proud of you, child of the ocean.\" The shaman trembled with joy. \"The Ocean God said I will be able to know how to use it.\" \"Yes, child, you will know how to use it, the Ocean God had said so.\" Hana then gave one of the objects to her mother. \"Mother, this is for you, when I reach the Ocean God's palace, I will try to contact you.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Six days before Hana departed, some shamans from the neighboring islands came to the village. \"We wish to give her gifts, for she will depart from our world into the realm of the Ocean God.\" The shamans then brought a large cloth bundle, intricately sewn with divine patterns, and opened it. There were rare magic stones, the likes of which only exist in the stomachs of giant centipedes which appear only every hundred years, colorful feathers of a bird said to be able to disappear into the forest, various herbs stuffed in a hollowed-out branch said to be able to cure any disease, and other magical aids and amulets. \"These are to remind you of the land, child. If the Ocean God wills these to be his memento, do not worry. Our prayers and blessings will always be carried with you.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The day comes when Hana had to leave the island to the Ocean God's territory. The whole village went to the beach with her. The village chief, shaman, and aides were there. Hana's parents were there. The yam diggers, the fishermen, the taro harvesters, the cloth maker, the ironworker, and the rest of the village was there. Some people from the other islands also came to witness the event, even from islands three or four days away. Everyone watched Hana, the child who is summoned by the Ocean God, board her canoe. The shamans' gift is on board the canoe, as well as the object the Ocean God gave her. The sky was turning from a dark blue to yellow, and she set off just when the yellow is beginning to turn orange. Everybody was overwhelmed by cries. The spectators wept as she set off into the orange sea, just like in her dream. Nobody is sure when she will reach the Ocean God's palace, and the divine object was passed from generation to generation.

I see it every day. Or just about, since sometimes work keeps me on base for days on end. Smooth polished steel. You can see your reflection in it, with the bright white glow of the single light above me. In front of me, the door and the two buttons. Up. Down. This one only leads to two spots. To my left, a side of the elevator. To my right, Doctor MacCarrick.</p>\n<p>He was one of the new guys, but somehow, he\u2019d just gotten a research assistantship working with <a href=\"/scp-035\">Oh-Three-Five</a>. A nasty little bugger, from the file I read. I had fifty bucks saying he didn't last the week. Sort of sick, I know, but we bet on odd things down here.</p>\n<p>I give my cheeks a soft slap to get some color in them and wake myself up, then notice MacCarrick staring at me in the reflection in the metal.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Yes, MacCarrick?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing, Dr. Iceberg.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just Ice,\" I said. I kept hoping it would catch on, but it never did. He didn't get a chance to respond before the elevator door opens, and we were herded out by the security staff on hand. I was motioned out into a short hall, nodding briefly to MacCarrick as he went in the opposite direction. I regretted it, but it was already too late.</p>\n<p>The trip down seemed longer than usual, but it might have just been the company. Don't get close to people you've got money on. Never ends well.</p>\n<p>We already passed clearance up top side, so a lot of the hustle and bustle down here was just for show. In spite of that, I knew full well that the security cameras were hidden, watching, and checking us. Facial structure scans, retinal analysis, or anything that seemed off. One thing wrong, and a security team would be in the room in seconds to deal with things. I've seen it happen. Not to me, thankfully, but still. They're efficient. Very, very efficient. And the Insurgency had yet to master plastic surgery, it seemed.</p>\n<p>As I walked forward, I eyed the rather nice reception desk. I wasn't sure who it was actually there for, since we didn't take visitors, but I assumed that all sites had one. Tradition, maybe? Or a leftover from another time. Sitting behind it, typing away at her keyboard, was Break.</p>\n<p>Her codename never made sense to me. I just don\u2019t see it. Breaking intruders upon the rocks? Breaking fingers? I dunno. But then, you have other people whose callsigns didn't make sense either. Djoric? What was up with that? Or Bright? Whatever. Not like it mattered. What <em>did</em> matter, though, was\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Hello there, Break.\" I put on my charming smile. Set my briefcase down. Lean onto her desk.</p>\n<p>She sighs before responding, eyes not straying from her computer. \"Hello, Dr. Iceberg.\"</p>\n<p>\"And how are you today, lovely?\"</p>\n<p>\"Good. Must you do this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do what, Breaky?\" I use my pet name for her. She loves that.</p>\n<p>\"Don\u2019t call me that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, come on. I know you love it.\" She loved it. \"I was wondering if you might be doing anything this week. Like, say, Friday?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really, now,\" I started. \"Then maybe we cou\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she said. \"I was answering your next question first. No, I'm not going out with you. I'm going to be washing my hair from now until eternity, Berg.\"</p>\n<p>Ugh. I hated it when she called me Berg.</p>\n<p>She turned her face from the screen at last, looking up at me with a blank expression that I knew belied her true affections.</p>\n<p>\"Go to work.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, okay, fine, fine\u2026 Maybe next week, then.\" My smiled slipped from charming to nervous, and I picked up my suitcase and headed down the administrative hallway toward the east wing.</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure if she knew she was in ear shot when I heard her mumbled \"Not likely.\" But I knew this all too well. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if I may be as bad with women as Clef. Then I just tell myself that even I\u2019m not that bad. I hope. I wonder if maybe the issue lay with her, but I decided that she'd warm up to me sooner or later.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>My office was placed fairly deep in the bedrock. Well, less that and more they gave me one back here. Considering how much time I'm stuck back here from week to week, it was no wonder I thought of it as home more so than the apartment at the nearby living facilities. The nice thing is that I'm still in walking distance to the break room, and since it's Monday, a break seems like a good way to get things started.</p>\n<p>I head out down the shockingly clean hallways. I'm always surprised by how nicely kept they are, especially since I never see a cleaning crew. They must be here at odd hours. Maybe a secret fleet of Roombas.</p>\n<p>I pass by researchers, of course. There's a ton of us down here. Some, I know; others, I don't. The lucky ones have been here for a while. The unlucky ones? They're fifty dollars. Yeah, yeah. I'm sick. But the guy who runs the betting is the same guy who comes up with the cover stories for their families. Hah! He pockets ten percent, then tells them how a crane fell or a beam collapsed or something. They never hear about how someone was dissolved or unexisted or some shit. Its hard, though, coming up with excuses when there's no body. You gotta respect the man.</p>\n<p>I head down the corridor past the Level One and Two offices. Shiny nameplates hanging on the doors with nice, generic names. The lucky kids who only know about the Safes or maybe a Euclid. Must be nice. Past that, I take a left past the minimum security wing. Some safe class skips. Dozens of guards, but they all know me. And they know if I made it in, that I'm cleared. No one pays me attention except the new guys, who stiffen when I walk by. They'll get over that, eventually. Or maybe they won't. The ones that don't live the longest.</p>\n<p>And\u2026 break room. Finally. I pick up the scent of muffins, then the sound of her voice\u2014in that order. She might have brought the muffins for everyone, if I was lucky, but chances were\u2026</p>\n<p>I rounded the corner, and there she sat. Agatha Rights. Doctor Agatha Rights, I had to remember. Five foot four, built to adore, knockout and snore. Damn. And she was eating the last muffin from a plate. Damnit. So, no treat. Maybe I can get something else.</p>\n<p>\"Well, well, well. Hello, Rights.\" Charming smile again. Let's roll.</p>\n<p>She turns around and smiles. A happy grin, as usual. An oddity down here. Somehow, she managed to avoid the really horrible stuff. Likely to keep from causing a problem. I mean, not that\u2019s she\u2019s terrible at things, she\u2019s just\u2026 motherly with the staff.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Berg! Want a muffin?\" I hated how fast that one seemed to be spreading.</p>\n<p>\"That isn't the last one?\"</p>\n<p>She looked at the muffin. Then the plate. Then me.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Maybe.\"</p>\n<p>\"No thanks. But make some cookies, and you know I'll take some.\" I smiled a bit more.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, fine.\" She placed the empty tray on the counter. She'd bring them in tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\"So\u2026 got any terrible paperwork buildup you need taken care of?\" Might be nice to help her work through things. Give me a few nice hours before I had to drudge through my own.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, not right now, sweetie. I can handle some things. Besides, the administration has threatened to reassign me to <a href=\"/scp-130\">one-thirty</a> if they don't actually see me write a report on my own, for once. Puts a small damper on my plans.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, well. Too bad. Well, you know where my office is if you change your mind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, trust me, I do\u2026\" She smiled. \"And just out of curiosity, if I make cookies, what kind do you want?\"</p>\n<p>Score.</p>\n<p>\"Double chocolate chip. It's my favorite.\"</p>\n<p>She grinned. \"Good, mine too.\"</p>\n<p>\"See you later, sweetie pie.\"</p>\n<p>She waved goodbye, and I headed to the coffee pot. I\u2019d hate to see her go, but I\u2019m still not entirely sure why she\u2019s still a researcher here. I guess because people like her, or she would have been terminated a while ago. Maybe they keep a few people with tender hearts around to keep the rest of us sane. Maybe.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a short walk back to my office, and I spend most of it drinking my coffee from a styrofoam cup. I got out my keycard, then noticed the nameplate on the door. Someone had covered up the 'Ice' in my name. I sighed, trying to wipe it off with my sleeve, but it didn't budge. I'd have to submit a work request, and when it wasn't vital\u2026 They'd get to it 'sooner or later.'</p>\n<p>There was a large stack of files next to the door. Another round of paperwork to slough through. Everyday. Well, at least it was relatively safe down here. Unless my inbox had become anomalous.</p>\n<p>I sat down at my computer, shaking the mouse to wake it up, then checking my email. Only two alerts, one last night, and one\u2026 Hell, fifteen minutes ago? I checked it, and felt a sudden creeping sensation lurching up my neck when I saw the number. 035. And the list of deceased included two Class-D's and\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Yes!\"</p>\n<p>The rush of elation at reading MacCarrick's name was immediately dampened by a sudden twisting in my gut. Fuck. The nod had been too much, I guessed\u2026 I sighed, closing my eyes for a moment, then turned and grabbed the top file off the stack, opening it and proceeding to enter the data.</p>\n<p>Maybe Rights would bring the cookies tomorrow.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/life-s-cold\">Life's Cold</a>\" by TroyL and Iceberg 7, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Someone had covered up the 'Ice' in my name. I sighed, trying to wipe it off with my sleeve, but it didn't budge. I'd have to submit a work request, and when it wasn't vital... They'd get to it 'sooner or later.'\n\n\n\nThere was a large stack of files next to the door. Another round of paperwork to slough through. Everyday. Well, at least it was relatively safe down here. Unless my inbox had become anomalous.\n\n\n\nI sat down at my computer, shaking the mouse to wake it up, then checking my email. Only two alerts, one last night, and one... Hell, fifteen minutes ago? I checked it, and felt a sudden creeping sensation lurching up my neck when I saw the number. 035. And the list of deceased included two Class-D's and...\n\n\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\n\nThe rush of elation at reading MacCarrick's name was immediately dampened by a sudden twisting in my gut. Fuck. The nod had been too much, I guessed... I sighed, closing my eyes for a moment, then turned and grabbed the top file off the stack, opening it and proceeding to enter the data.\n\n\n\nMaybe Rights would bring the cookies tomorrow.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=TroyL and Iceberg 7]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-035", "scp-130", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-iceberg", "doctor-rights", "possessive-mask", "rewrite", "tale"], "title": "Life's Cold - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/life-s-cold", "year": 2009}, "log-of-anomalous-items": {"created_at": "2009-06-04T05:15:00", "creator": "Sophia Light", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T05:20:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T05:21:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T08:31:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T08:33:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T15:51:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "Yoric can have his parrot.", "date": "2009-06-04T18:45:00"}, {"author": "Mulciber", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mulciber", "comment": "Nice Shot Magnum, Finicky Hanger, Cheater's Tetherball added.", "date": "2009-06-07T20:17:00"}, {"author": "snorlison", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snorlison", "comment": "Exceedingly small contribution", "date": "2009-06-08T01:40:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-09T16:25:00"}, {"author": "Whitewings", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whitewings", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-18T22:06:00"}, {"author": "Whitewings", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whitewings", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-19T06:31:00"}, {"author": "carriontrooper", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/carriontrooper", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-10T05:08:00"}, {"author": "carriontrooper", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/carriontrooper", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-10T05:12:00"}, {"author": "snorlison", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snorlison", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-18T04:04:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Added the metronome", "date": "2009-07-24T17:45:00"}, {"author": "logansorenssen", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/logansorenssen", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-24T20:47:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "Minor formatting, added the Slow-Motion Squirrel.", "date": "2009-07-25T18:27:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "shaken, not shook.", "date": "2009-07-25T22:33:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Toned down the metronome", "date": "2009-07-26T01:22:00"}, {"author": "logansorenssen", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/logansorenssen", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-27T12:54:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "Added myself a rating module.", "date": "2009-07-28T20:05:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Added bagpipe and karaoke machine.", "date": "2009-08-23T02:46:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "General clean-up: standardized puctuation and capitalization, fixed some typoes, changed a couple of words.", "date": "2009-08-23T02:54:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Birds with teeth!", "date": "2009-08-23T18:10:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Just regular carnivorous ostriches instead of giant ones.

The last thing I remember was the break-in, that little guy turning around as they ran, the gunshot\u2026 and Angie gasping, clutching her stomach, and collapsing in a pool of her own blood.</p>\n<p>ANGIE! Where is my wife?! There, standing where I was when she got shot, she looks as shocked as I am. She rushes over to me, not even paying attention to the furniture in her way.

But I was just\u2026 oh God, Angie's on the floor bleeding, like she was before. I've got to help her, I try to get over to her, to help her, stop the bleeding, something, ANYTHING.

First she's dying, then I'm the one dying, then her, then me again - and nothing else is changing at all! Angie runs over to me, bumps the table, knocks over that old lamp\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>Switched again? How? It doesn't matter - I have to help Angie. I rush over, knocking over a table on the way\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I'm the one dying again, but Angie doesn't look like she's any happier. She looks so confused, so scared. She looks at me, at her stomach, at the lamp. Wait a minute - why is that lamp in one piece? I remember now, when that little slimebag shot Angie in the first place, I ran over to help her, but I knocked that lamp over on the way. I didn't see what happened to it, but I heard it break.</p>\n<p>She picks the lamp up off the table, barely able to hold it her hands are shaking so badly. She lifts it up above her head, throws it down\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>Standing and healthy again. I look out the door, see the two thugs running, not ten feet from where they were when they shot Angie. The lamp's back, too - does it rewind time or something? What the Hell is going on? How does some random oil lamp I bought in a store as a decoration somehow rewind time, and how do Angie and I keep getting switched?</p>\n<p>No time to think about stuff like that. I know how little time Angie has: I could feel it when I was the one on the floor. There's no way an ambulance could get here in time, even if somebody else called them the instant they heard the shot. The only way to save her now is for me to be the one that dies. I grab the lamp and hurl it to the floor\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>It worked - I'm back on the floor. I see Angie reaching for the lamp, try to tell her that it's all right, tell her to let me go, but it's too late. The lamp falls\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I grab the lamp, look down at my poor Angie, and tell her I'll save her\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>We've been married almost twenty years - known each other twice that. Childhood friends, highschool sweethearts, always together. Everybody pretty much knew we'd end up married. I've sworn to myself ever since I was a kid: I'd always protect her, no matter what, even if it cost me my life\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>So why won't she let me?</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I wonder if this thing ever runs out of juice? If it does, I hope it's while I'm the one down\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>At this point, I'm pretty sure that if whoever's down dies before the lamp breaks, it won't switch us again. I just need to keep it in one piece long enough that I die before Angie can take my place\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I grab the chimney, and wait. Watching her suffer like this, watching the life drain out of her without doing anything to stop it, it feels like my heart and soul are being ripped apart, but I have to wait as long as I can. If I delay the switch, it should put me closer to dying when we switch, and maybe Angie won't have time to switch back\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>DAMN. All the way back to when the lamp broke the first time. Delaying isn't going to work\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I apologise to Angie for letting her suffer so long last time, and beg her to just let me die, let me save her\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>Angie begs me to let her die, let her save me\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I think I may actually be starting to get used to the pain - the physical part, at least. They say a person can get used to anything, but nothing dulls the horror of helplessly watching the woman I love dying slowly on the floor. I HAVE to save her\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>By the rest of the world's reckoning, it was only a few minutes ago that we were cleaning up after dinner. Then those two thugs, bold as brass, just kicked in the front door. The big guy started grabbing whatever he could, while the little one ran room to room. He was probably looking for us, since he stopped when he found us hiding in the kitchen, pointed that gun at us, and ordered us into the living room\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>We watched as they tore apart our home, grabbing whatever caught their fancy, and smashing a lot of what didn't. While the big guy was all business, the short one kept coming back to threaten us. The little rat giggled every time he made us flinch by jabbing us with his gun. That sick fuck must get off on hurting people - I saw the look on his face when he turned, gun in hand\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>Maybe if I could kill myself somehow before Angie could smash the chimney again, I could break the cycle on the right side. The problem is I only get a couple of seconds\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>Nope, that didn't work, either. Can't convince Angie to just let me die - she's obviously as set on saving me as I am on saving her. I'll find some way to kill myself in time\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>How many times have we gone back and forth? I haven't exactly been counting, but it must be hundreds. Or thousands\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>I don't remember my name. I don't remember who I am, where I grew up, or much of anything else that happened more than a minute ago by the rest of the world's time. We've been going back and forth for pretty much as far back as I can recall - years, at least. All I really remember clearly is that I can't let her die\u2026</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH</p>\n<p>*shatter*<br/>\nFLASH<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/loop\">Loop</a>\" by Leicontis, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

She\u2019s an SCP now.\u201d Gears coldly reminded him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the mother?\u201d Williams asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Wells will be given a rigorous amnestic treatment and then be transferred to another facility.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, it\u2019ll be as if Jill never existed, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Foundation has no place for sentimentality, Agent Williams. I\u2019m not quite sure why you\u2019re expressing so much concern over two individuals you have never met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure explaining the reasons would make your head explode.\u201d Williams shook his head and walked away.</p>\n<p>Gears, however, opted to stay in the monitoring room and stared at the security screens for what seemed to be a very long time. If the man was thinking of anything, none of the personnel present could even begin to guess what it was. They merely tried to pretend he wasn\u2019t there and continued with their duties. There, sitting in the middle of the newly reconstructed containment cell sat Dr. Wells, or at least something that resembled her, watching over Jill as she slept.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the sound recording equipment inside the cell began to pick up something odd and faint. The sound engineer on duty was about to disregard it as random interference, but thought sounded vaguely familiar, like a lullaby.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/lullaby\">Lullaby</a>\" by SpoonOfEvil, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I am above that sort of pettiness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got absolutely no evidence to back this up, but maybe, just maybe, SCP-204-1 realized that it and Dr. Wells weren\u2019t so different?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s implying that SCP-204-1 possesses a level of intelligence that is completely unheard of based on our research of it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know I know, but it\u2019s just a gut feeling.\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\u201cI find this turn of events highly unusual,\u201d Gears said.\n\n\n\nIt had been four days since the SCP-204 containment breach. Containment Protocol 204 had been put into effect immediately after and it had finally paid off, but with results that nobody had quite anticipated.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf all the people, it had to choose Jill.\u201d Williams shook his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeed I remind you, that Jill is merely a name on a piece of paper that no longer exists. She\u2019s an SCP now.\u201d Gears coldly reminded him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the mother?\u201d Williams asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Wells will be given a rigorous amnestic treatment and then be transferred to another facility.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019ll be as if Jill never existed, then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Foundation has no place for sentimentality, Agent Williams. I\u2019m not quite sure why you\u2019re expressing so much concern over two individuals you have never met.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure explaining the reasons would make your head explode.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Williams shook his head and walked away. \n\n\n\nGears, however, opted to stay in the monitoring room and stared at the security screens for what seemed to be a very long time. If the man was thinking of anything, none of the personnel present could even begin to guess what it was. They merely tried to pretend he wasn\u2019t there and continued with their duties. There, sitting in the middle of the newly reconstructed containment cell sat Dr. Wells, or at least something that resembled her, watching over Jill as she slept.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the sound recording equipment inside the cell began to pick up something odd and faint. The sound engineer on duty was about to disregard it as random interference, but thought sounded vaguely familiar, like a lullaby.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-gears", "tale"], "title": "Lullaby - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lullaby", "year": 2009}, "memories-from-a-past-life": {"created_at": "2009-07-30T05:40:00", "creator": "Waxx", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Waxx", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/waxx", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-30T05:40:00"}, {"author": "Waxx", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/waxx", "comment": "", "date": "2009-08-11T06:25:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "touchup", "date": "2010-12-25T13:20:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

They drove slowly in their rental car, taking time to drink in the environment and just to enjoy one another\u2019s company. The vacation had been Dmitri\u2019s idea\u2014he needed it\u2014but he was glad to have the others along. A vacation alone was the last thing he wanted right now. It was good to be home, and he enjoyed acting as tour guide for his friends. Few people understood the beauty of the Russian countryside; the steppe is as deep a part of their collective soul as borscht or vodka.</p>\n<p>He had taken them to his birthplace, Moscow, first. They had seen the rainbow spires of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral, the towering red brick of the Kremlin walls, Lenin\u2019s mausoleum, the terrifying fa\u00e7ade of No. 2 Dzerzhinisky Square and the crumbling remains of Stalin\u2019s pride\u2014the White Sea Canal. They strolled along its banks and viewed the oily, filthy water with disdain, recognizing it as the slave labor project that it was. They saw the tiny plaque and paid homage to the dead, marveling at the fruits of their labor and clucking their tongues at its current state of disrepair, noting that not a single vessel had traversed it during their time there. Strelnikov sighed to himself and viewed it with longing. They did not, could not, understand its true meaning.</p>\n<p>He continued driving, allowing them the pleasant respite of the car seats and the soothing sound of gravel under the tires. The road stretched in both directions for miles, small side roads shooting off and leading their travelers across the expanse that was modern-day Russia. He smiled inwardly, a knowing smile that he saved for special occasions such as this. He\u2019d told them that he wanted to go home for a few days, and now he truly was\u2014this was their last stop. The car pulled onto a winding side road and slowed to a stop, a large Russian summer house in the traditional style looming ahead of them. The others perked up and looked around in surprise as he stepped out of the car.</p>\n<p>It had belonged to her mother once, she herself purchasing it just after the collapse in 1992 when you could buy property for as cheap as a piece of Japanese electronics. They had fixed it up and spent their summers here, away from the confines and the madness of Moscow proper. He gazed up at it, hands at his sides. The paint was faded to grayness and large portions of it had been peeled and stripped away by the harsh winter elements. The eaves sagged with decay, and the porch swing sat molding, its rusting chains folded underneath it. He heard the car doors close behind him as they exited and stood behind him; he paid them no attention, just stepped onto the porch. It groaned from the pressure, the wood joints no longer sturdy.</p>\n<p>Strelnikov tried peering through the front door, but it was covered with a sheet of plywood. He tried the door\u2014locked. It took him a few moments to remember the key stashed away in one of the porch beams; he pried the panel apart with his knife and reached in, ignoring the cobwebs and retrieving the tarnished brass key. It fit the lock perfectly, and he swung the door open and stepped in, the others following suit. He remembered coming here for the first time, seeing the furniture covered in plastic to keep the dust off, remembered the musty smell, remembered her sweeping the dirt through this very door and into the hazy summer air. There was no furniture now, only years of untended dust and dirt.</p>\n<p>Stepping further through the hall, he saw the kitchen\u2014its strawberry-printed trim lining the ceiling had faded into unrecognizable shades of white, the only appliance left was the stove where together they had once cooked breakfast. He looked away quickly, casting a nervous and embarrassed glance to his friends.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Was my summer home,\u201d he said sheepishly. They nodded and gave him supportive smiles, watching carefully and waiting in the hallway, choosing not to follow as Dmitri walked up the stairs. The wooden planks sighed with each step, bowing dangerously as he climbed and only reluctantly supporting his weight. The upstairs was much the same, save for one room\u2014their bedroom.</p>\n<p>It was empty but for a small table with a blue tin box resting atop it. This, too, required his knife to open, but after some fussing he pried it apart and looked inside. His eyes fell upon the note first, and with trembling hands he unfolded it, scanning it in silence.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cMy dearest Dmitri,\u201d</em> it began, written in her elegant, wavy Cyrillic handwriting.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt has been almost two years since I received word of your death. I have waited as long as I can. The other girls tell me to have hope, but I know it is misguided and foolish of me to have even the faintest belief that you will ever return to me. It is so hard without you\u2014sometimes I swear I hear your voice being carried in the breeze, and for the briefest moments it is like you are near to me again. I have waited, Dmitri. But I can wait no longer.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cMaybe the telegram really was a mistake, and you will return here someday to see me. I am leaving you this letter and these small remembrances in the hopes that maybe it will help you to understand and move on, as I have.

I always loved you, and I always will.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI hope you can understand.\u201d</em> She signed it, as beautiful as ever, Eva Katarinovna Strelnikova. It would have been her name had he ever come home to her.</p>\n<p>The memories flooded back at once, taking his breath away and making him weak in the knees as soon as he saw the photographs underneath. He put them down, realizing he didn\u2019t need them; he saw them every night in his sleep.</p>\n<p>He saw her standing in the kitchen, the way the sun shone on her hair and illuminated her face like the angel she had been to him when she would cook, wearing her strawberry-patterned apron that matched the d\u00e9cor of the room so well. Worse yet, he saw the look on her face when he told her he was leaving, saw the anguish and the worry, and the glimmer of hope in her eyes when he kissed her and promised that he\u2019d be back for her in one piece.</p>\n<p>He felt her in his arms when they sat together on the banks of the White Sea Canal, the way she sprawled across his body and slept with her ear to his chest, listening to him breathe and being soothed by the beat of his heart as they watched the ships drift by lazily. He remembered the soft touch of her skin and the way it glowed in the moonlight when they slept together, the way her hands would curl and lock around his own. He felt her strength and her weakness at the same time as he held her once again, telling her it would be a short war and that he was only there to keep the peace, knowing it was a lie and knowing that she was all too aware.</p>\n<p>He heard the soft coo of her voice as they planned their future, talking of how they would sit on the veranda and watch the sun set across the fields, just as it had done today. He remembered her dry laugh when he\u2019d make a terrible joke or do something stupid, and the smile that always accompanied it. In a flash, she was with him now, standing before him, if only in the depths of his own mind. He realized then that she had always been there.</p>\n<p>She had been with him during the shelling, when the Chechens flung their rockets at him and when they trained their ancient weapons against him. She had been next to him when he was shot, held his hand in the field hospital and stroked his hair tenderly. She\u2019d been with him up until the Foundation recruited him and took him away from her forever, their liaisons sending word to the Russian Military that he\u2019d been killed in action near Grozny, leaving her nothing but a telegram and an engagement ring.</p>\n<p>That was nine years ago.</p>\n<p>He held up the stack of photographs, feeling something move underneath. It glinted hauntingly at him, and he recognized the gold band he had given her when he asked her to be his bride two weeks before leaving for the second Chechen war. He saw it, and at that moment he knew it was over\u2014there was nothing left for him here. He tucked the box under his arm and returned downstairs in silence, his fellow travelers eyeing him with curiosity and silently offering him their support. He knew it to be sincere.</p>\n<p>They exited together and returned to their rented cottage to sample the stores of vodka. His three compatriots got drunk and spent the night partying in the upstairs bedroom.</p>\n<p>He slept alone.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/memories-from-a-past-life\">Memories From A Past Life</a>\" by Waxx, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Thus it was that I was tricked.</p>\n<p>\"Some months ago, I was wandering the desert night, as my folk are wont to do, when I heard a voice on the wind, calling my name. I followed it for many leagues, on foot and in the air - for Allah the most Generous has gifted my people with wings, and we are able fliers - but could find it nowhere. I was confounded, but the voice offered guidance, and told me to dive beneath the sands. I obeyed, plunging downward through sand and stone alike. Suddenly all grew dark and cold, and I found myself in a human dwelling not far from here.</p>\n<p>\"And I saw the source of the voice, who wore the shape of a beautiful woman. She had summoned me from afar, drawing me to her bedchamber with secret sigils and diagrams, with which she then entrapped me in a bottle, the same bottle you have found, O my savior. At first I thought that she had summoned me to be her husband, for as you may know it is not forbidden for our peoples to intermarry. Such was not to be my fortune, for although she was lovely in appearance, she was an evil woman of much malign intent, and desired only my power, to assist her in wicked deeds. My good heart compelled me to refuse, and she grew very angry.</p>\n<p>\"She resorted to threats, but we of the Ifrit are clever folk, and so at each turn I reminded her that to harm me she would be forced to open the bottle, and in so doing, set me free. Her temper raged like a storm, but after many nights she grew quieter and more calm. And here I hoped, in my foolishness, that she would finally release me. Indeed she wished to be rid of me, but alas, so too did she wish to make me suffer. She cast me into the lake, telling me as she did so that the bottle would be trapped in the ice, and would eventually shatter, and that I would die in the cold waters. And she abandoned me to my fate.</p>\n<p>\"May Allah preserve her, for it is Allah, the Preserver, who has saved me. As my captor predicted, this bottle was trapped beneath the ice of the lake. And yet, as I floated and prayed in that abyss of frozen fear, I saw the stirrings of great fishes below me. And as the fishes swam and cavorted throughout the long winter, the ice did not entrap me further, and when spring came, I remained alive. And yet, I had grown weak from my months of solitude and starvation. When this vessel washed up on the shore, I had but a spark of my fire left, for the winter in your lands is cold indeed. I could do no more than assume this form, as a final act of desperation. As paper I will not die, but neither have I the strength to return to my true form, for now the fire has left me.</p>\n<p>\"Thus I pray you, return to me my essence. Any source of flame will serve; I know your people are most ingenious and have devised many marvels for this purpose since the days of flint and steel. Simply set this paper alight, and I will be free. You will not see the joy of my liberation, for as I have said, my people are not easily seen by human eyes. Nor does the human form appear clearly to us, truly. But I will shower upon you such blessings as are mine to give, O my savior.</p>\n<p>\"If you wish to know the full scope of my generosity, write your full name upon the reverse side of this paper, prior to burning. I will return exactly one year thence, having recovered my strength, to grant your heart's desire and to hound your enemies. In the name of God, the Compassionate, the All-Merciful, it shall be so.\"</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/message-in-a-bottle\">Message In A Bottle</a>\" by HK-016, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I have no idea how long I've been asleep. It doesn't really matter.\n<p>Rising, I grab a towel from the pile on the floor, wrapping it around my body with an odd sense of gratitude, and move down the short hallway to my tiny bedroom. Looking around the clothes strewn about the floor, I find a T-shirt and pants I like (or maybe just choose them at random, I'm not really sure anymore\u2026) and shrug them on, tug, zip, button, adjust for comfort. Ha, comfort. Ignoring the insistent tapping from the other side of the cardboard and duct-tape covered window (where my gaze lingers for a moment, but only a moment. I think.) I head into the kitchen for breakfast (soggy cereal with milk grown slightly warm from the broken refrigerator) and a demotivated perusal of the help wanted section of last weeks old newspaper. I used to get the newspaper every morning, searching diligently for a job, a task, anything to get me moving forward and upward, out of this shitty fourteenth floor loft in a slumhouse on the south side of a city that hasn't been worth living in by all accounts since the seventies, but it doesn't really feel worth it anymore. With a sigh, I dump the remaining cereal and set the bowl on the stack of unwashed dishes in the sink. I need to get out of here.</p>\n<p>Back down the hall and into my room to grab a jacket (it's freezing in here), and my eyes lock on that sheet of cardboard taped over the window. From behind it, softly, tap, tap, tap. She's still out there. She always is, as soon as it gets dark, until the sun rises, knocking gently on the window, fourteen stories up, hair blowing in the night time breeze, beckoning me to open the window, to let her in. <em>I can change your life</em>, she seems to say, <em>if you'll let me</em>. Shuddering, I look away.</p>\n<p>Nate (God I miss that kid) used to tell me that I was depressed, that I was seeing things, that I should get help. Used to, till one day she came knocking on his window too. He called me then, breathless, apologizing for not believing me. He sounded strange on the phone\u2026 eager. I never heard from him again. I wonder if he's better off.</p>\n<p>When I first came here, it felt like life was amazing, like the world was one big opportunity stretching itself wide in front of me and just waiting for me to take that first step. I'd chosen this apartment, with its window view of the entire, sprawling, electric starscape of the city lit up at night like God's own fallen Christmas tree, just so I could look out and revel in that feeling, in that high. That feeling got me through the first few months.</p>\n<p>Gradually, though, the joy faded, and I was left with so many needs, and so many troubles, and never enough money, and so much <em>time</em> to think about it all, and I slipped into the bleak depression I've been in up till now. Then one day, she came.</p>\n<p>Back then, I'd been able to sleep at night, <em>every</em> night, regularly, instead of falling into fitful patches of restless slumber at disjointed times, and I'd been asleep when she first showed up. I was awoken by a soft, almost polite knocking, so soft that at first I got up and went to the door, looking out into the silent hallway. When I went to return to bed, I saw her. Standing on nothing, fourteen floors up, her dress blowing in the wind, one hand knocking on the glass like a door, the other waving as I saw her, beckoning, a friendly gesture. I've read stories in my lifetime of creatures and spirits that knock on windows at night, of vampires who can only enter a home if the owner answers the door. I knew (or thought I knew) the risks. I went out into the living room and tossed and turned on the couch, hoping she'd be gone by morning.</p>\n<p>And she was, but she was back the next night, and the night after that, and the night after that, knocking, calling silently to me, promising wordlessly that she could change my life, make it better. Eventually, I covered the window, trying to ignore her, hoping normalcy would return, but no. It never did. It never will.</p>\n<p>So here I am, looking down, looking away, looking <em>anywhere</em> but at that window, shaking with desperate desire to look out, to open it, to let her in, and knowing with every fiber of my being how desperately wrong it would be. I've held out this long, but as I sink deeper into myself, I know that soon, soon, I'll walk to that window, and with shaking hands I'll tear down the barrier, and I'll reach for the latch\u2026</p>\n<p>Fuck that. Tomorrow, I'm buying a gun. No one will miss me anyway.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/opportunity-knocks\">Opportunity Knocks</a>\" by tunedtoadeadchannel, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It never will.\n\n\n\nSo here I am, looking down, looking away, looking //anywhere// but at that window, shaking with desperate desire to look out, to open it, to let her in, and knowing with every fiber of my being how desperately wrong it would be. I've held out this long, but as I sink deeper into myself, I know that soon, soon, I'll walk to that window, and with shaking hands I'll tear down the barrier, and I'll reach for the latch...\n\n\n\nFuck that. Tomorrow, I'm buying a gun. No one will miss me anyway.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "gbc09", "tale"], "title": "Opportunity Knocks - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/opportunity-knocks", "year": 2009}, "patterns": {"created_at": "2009-08-17T21:31:00", "creator": "Aelanna", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added... something...", "date": "2009-08-17T21:31:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added... color...", "date": "2009-08-17T21:32:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Last edit, I promise.", "date": "2009-08-17T21:35:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added rating module.", "date": "2009-08-18T05:58:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

It wasn't a large bank, it wasn't a small bank, just a bank. The neighborhood was small, and most importantly, didn't ask many questions. Such as why people commonly came through and cashed in at that bank, despite the fact none of them lived in the town. But, then, they worked for Soap from Corpses Products, Inc. It was best not to worry too much about any nutters who worked at that kind of job.</p>\n<p>Two cars pulled up, right in front of the bank. An old VW bus with a faded red paintjob, and a nearly as old blue Ford Mustang. Neither had particular identifying marks, which is just how their owners liked it. Anyone who took the time to check their license plates would come up with names of men who didn't exist, several states over. The car doors opened, and out came five men. If their clothing didn't give away what they were up to, their guns did. 9mm handguns and pump action shotguns, and at least one had something automatic.

It wasn't a large bank, it wasn't a small bank, just a bank. The neighborhood was small, and most importantly, didn't ask many questions. Such as why people commonly came through and cashed in at that bank, despite the fact none of them lived in the town. But, then, they worked for Soap from Corpses Products, Inc. It was best not to worry too much about any nutters who worked at that kind of job. \n\n\n\nTwo cars pulled up, right in front of the bank. An old VW bus with a faded red paintjob, and a nearly as old blue Ford Mustang. Neither had particular identifying marks, which is just how their owners liked it. Anyone who took the time to check their license plates would come up with names of men who didn't exist, several states over. The car doors opened, and out came five men. If their clothing didn't give away what they were up to, their guns did. 9mm handguns and pump action shotguns, and at least one had something automatic. This bank was a little small for their usual tastes, but they could always use easy money. They pushed open the bank doors, guns held up. \n\n\n\n\"Everybody down, now!\"\n\n\n\nMost did as they were told, men, women, even the pair of security guards. Notable, however, was the group clustered near one of the tellers. The rest of the town knew them as simply employees of Soap from Corpses Products, Inc. A motley crew that certainly didn't look like soap makers, all of them looking a little tired, or distracted, or like they were in a hurry. One in a lab coat stared at the bank robbers for a second, before speaking.\n\n\n\n\"Are you fucking kidding me? On payday?\"\n\n\n\nThere was a beat of silence, somewhere between tense and awkward, and the men holding weapons reacted first.\n\n\n\n\"Are you deaf or something? Stupid? Get down!\"\n\n\n\nThe group in lab coats stayed standing, looking from one to another before one of them -- a short, stout woman with long, dark hair pulled back into a ponytail -- snorted loudly, bringing a hand to her mouth in a desperate attempt to stifle her choked-back, muffled laughter. The men frowned under their ski masks and narrowed their eyes, while another man in a lab coat sighed heavily, bringing his palm up to meet his face.\n\n\n\n\"Rights, stop it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm trying.\"\n\n\n\n\"Look, gentlemen, this is patently ridiculous.\" The large tattooed black man looked rather out of place, especially with the golden bling around his neck. \"Do you in fact intend to rob this establishment in such a manner?

I think you've made the poor robber confused!\",\u00a0\u00a0the woman snipped again.\n\n\n\nOne of the gunmen -- the shortest of the bunch -- snagged the necklace from the floor\u00a0\u00a0and slipped it on over his head. Hey, loot was loot, after all. He never even noticed being replaced in his own head. He did however, subtly shift the gun in a new direction, and give a wink and a thumb's-up to the rest of the group. \n\n\n\n\"Do you think this is some kind of game?\" the long-haired man continued. The shortest robber ever-so-slowly began to redirect his aim. Originally aimed at the woman, it now pointed at the man with the shaved head. \"Is this some kind of joke to you?\" The short man's gun moved a bit more towards the man in the ball cap. \"Do you think that this gun is a fake?\" One last tiny shift had the barrel pointed squarely at the long-haired gunman's back. At the same time, the long-haired gunman pointed his shotgun at the still-giggling Rights.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-bright", "tale"], "title": "Payday - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/payday", "year": 2009}, "perfection": {"created_at": "2009-02-10T17:48:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-10T17:48:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T19:05:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-12T20:22:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-12T21:36:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-28T17:17:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-07-28T18:05:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-09-30T15:15:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-09-30T15:54:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-09-30T16:03:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-01T02:54:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Do I hear more?\u201d<br/>\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cSold, to Mr. McCredie. Thank you so much sir. This next lot\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The bald man who had just spent an absurd amount of money on a small, somewhat tacky yin-yang medallion rose from his seat and exited the small, lavishly decorated auction room, entering a separate room filled with thick leather chairs, a small but well stocked bar, several men and women in very expensive dress, and a sizeable Christmas tree. The smell of smoke was very noticeable, but not unpleasant as the bald man lit a cigarette to add to the general haze. A short, stocky man in a non-descript black suit walked up, bowing slightly before speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, I take it that you acquired the\u2026um\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d the bald man said, waving his hand in a dismissive gesture. \u201cMarten, bring the car up for me, and have a valet just load the medallion into the trunk; I don\u2019t want to wait for that \u2018secured shipping\u2019 nonsense for weeks. We\u2019ll be going to the airstrip in a bit; I\u2019d like to be at the Paris club by this evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten bowed slightly again \u201cYes, Mr. McCredie. If I may, your recent acquisition may attract unwanted attention. I can have it routed through a service in Bhutan that is excellent in dealing with these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. McCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, waving his hand again as he started to eye a bottle of aged scotch behind the bar. \u201cOf course, do whatever is necessary, but I want that necklace in Paris by this weekend. Also, have Arthur and Grant ready in Paris when I get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten followed Mr. McCredie as he strode up to the bar, acquiring a very good and very expensive glass of scotch with a few gestures to the bartender. Marten bowed and spoke again as Mr. McCredie took his first slow sip. \u201cWill Mrs. McCredie be joining you on this evening\u2019s flight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. McCredie\u2019s face twisted with a sour expression as he put down his drink. \u201cNo, no\u2026she\u2019s still pouting in her new apartment over my having to work on her birthday\u2026but we\u2019ll soon see to that, won\u2019t we!\u201d He laughed, taking another sip. \u201cSend for her tomorrow morning. If she makes a fuss, say\u2026I don\u2019t know, something romantic or some such. She\u2019s young, and still loves to think of herself as a princess\u2026oh, say that she\u2019ll get to meet royalty, that should shut her up and get her packing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten moved slightly closer, lowering his voice. \u201cAnd the\u2026special considerations you asked for have been attended to as well. A local funeral home has offered its services and crematorium for modest compensation as soon as we are in need.\u201d</p>\n<p>McCredie scowled at Marten, waving him away as he turned back to his scotch. \u201cReally, is it necessary to inform me of every little step? Go; make things ready, I\u2019ll be leaving here in the hour. Really, I don\u2019t know why I still bother with these Christmas get-togethers, they always end on some sour note\u2026are you still here? I said go!\u201d Marten bowed and quickly walked off, leaving McCredie to his scotch and a drab conversation with a member of the English parliament.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>June McCredie came off the jet in bluster of expensive silk, blond hair, and whining. \u201cThis isn\u2019t another one of his stupid little business meetings, is it? I swear, if he drags me all around town to meet a bunch of old, stupid men in suits, I\u2019m going to scream. With all the meetings and social stuff he does, you\u2019d think he\u2019d find time to go to one or two real parties! You know, music and dancing and fancy drinks and all that stuff\u2026not gagging on smoke having to listen to fat old guys talk about pricing strategies and having to act interested.\u201d She hurried off the tarmac and into the reception area of the McCredie\u2019s private airstrip, as Marten directed the unloading of her considerable baggage from the jet.</p>\n<p>Later, as her car ambled its way down the busy Paris streets, she continued her monologue, directing it at the back of Marten\u2019s head as he drove. \u201cReally, this is it. I don\u2019t need him, if he\u2019s not going to put some time into our relationship, I don\u2019t know how this is going to work. We\u2019ve been married a year, and we\u2019ve only gone on three vacations, just the two of us. Now all he wants to do is stay at that club of his all day and smoke and drink.\u201d She ended in a huff, crossing her arms and pouting out the window.</p>\n<p>Marten smiled, looking in the rear-view mirror. \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sure you appreciate his position. Your husband is a powerful man, and needs to keep up appearances to maintain his position.\u201d</p>\n<p>June huffed again, burying herself more into the leather seats and watching Paris roll by. At a stop, she piped up again, still looking out the window. \u201cMarten\u2026is\u2026is John in trouble? I mean\u2026with the government or anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten stiffened a little at the wheel, his smile unfazed. \u201cNo ma\u2019am, Mr. McCredie has a quite friendly relationship with parliament, as far as I am aware.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed, \u201cI was worried\u2026some men came by, asking about him. They said it was about some delivery to India or something\u2026it sounded like he was in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten smiled and shook his head, ignoring the sweat starting to form on his palms. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s some kind of mix-up, nothing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded, resting her chin on the edge of the door, looking out the window. \u201cI\u2019m sure\u2026they said something about a foundation or something when they were in the hall\u2026probably just some charity looking for a handout.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten nodded, quietly wiping away a bead of sweat on his forehead as they started forward again. \u201cYes, that must be it, very good ma\u2019am\u2026\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>After dropping June off at a suitably ostentatious hotel to \u201cfreshen up\u201d for the evening, Marten worked his way down a network of side streets to the Pairs chapter clubhouse of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd, buried in a mass of hotels and boutiques. After parking in the private underground lot, Marten walked to the elevator, punching in the code for Mr. McCredie\u2019s private room. Almost as soon as the doors opened, he was roughly grabbed and hurled inside by Arthur and Grant, landing in a heap. Lifting his head, he took in the room for a moment, decorated in late Victorian style, except for the oddly out of place steel door on the far wall. Mr. McCredie sat in a huge leather chair, smoking and looking down at Marten with mild amusement. Arthur wrapped a huge hand into Marten\u2019s collar, lifting him back to his feet as Grant took position next to McCredie\u2019s chair.</p>\n<p>McCredie spoke, smoke drifting from his mouth. \u201cFoundation agents were at my home yesterday. Care to explain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten swallowed hard, sweating under McCredie\u2019s lazy but piercing gaze. \u201cTh\u2026they know nothing, sir. If they knew it was you, they would have already raided the club. They are not the police or government; they don\u2019t have to justify anything to anyone. Shooting in the dark is all they can do now.\u201d His voice carried much more confidence then he felt, and he was sharply aware of the gun-shaped lump in Arthur\u2019s jacket pressing into his spine.</p>\n<p>McCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, thinking, before waving his hand, causing Arthur to drop him again. \u201cHonestly,\u201d McCredie said, \u201cI believe you. However, we can\u2019t have these things happening again, understand? I pay you bloody well enough; I expect things to be taken care of in the proper fashion. Speaking of which, did you manage to get my darling wife to the hotel in one piece?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten nodded, adjusting his suit. \u201cYes, she should be here by this evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d spoke McCredie, rubbing his hands together. \u201cWe should have this all wrapped up by dinner. Grant, you and Arthur make sure everything is ready for June, will you?\u201d Both huge men nodded, moving back and opening the heavy steel door, given Marten a view of the bare tiled walls and stained concrete floor drain beyond before the door swung shut again. McCredie rose, stubbing out his cigarette out and grinning \u201cWell, let\u2019s give her an hour, and then we\u2019ll get this mess over and done with!\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cUgh\u2026why do these places always smell like smoke and old people? Why can\u2019t we ever meet at some club or something? God, I really think he goes out of his way to bug me sometimes\u2026\u201d June flipped her hair back in disgust, looking around at the sitting room, her black dress shining with small interwoven crystals. \u201cWhy did he want me here even? Aren\u2019t we supposed to be going out for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten nodded, smiling. \u201cYes ma\u2019am, and he will be along shortly. In the meantime, he wished for me to give you a small gift on his behalf.\u201d Her eyes immediately lit up, a grin spreading over her face as she squealed happily.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Where is it? Oooh, I love presents\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Marten gestured to the steel door, and she hurried over, pulling it open with some effort. \u201cUgh\u2026what a heavy door\u2026ooh, is that it? It\u2019s\u2026just a yin-yang with a little chain. How is that\u2026what is this place? Arthur? What are you doing\u2026let\u2026let ME GO!\u201d The start of her scream was cut off sharply as Marten gently closed the door.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>McCredie reclined in his chair, chuckling slightly as he looked to the small speaker planted on the coffee table before him. \u201cYou\u2019re a loon, Harper, you know that don\u2019t you? It takes real dedication to keep playing a game you\u2019re bad at.\u201d A short burst of laughter from the speaker quickly devolved in to a coughing fit, before the voice gave a gasp and replied. \u201cMcCredie, you\u2019re not any better then me at the cards, you just cheat better then anyone else at the table. Besides, don\u2019t you still owe me two from that Easter game?\u201d</p>\n<p>McCredie scoffed, waving his hand at the speaker as if it could see, his head turning slightly as Marten quietly opened the steel door and strode over to him, the sound of a muffled sob quickly squelched as the door re-closed. Marten leaned down, whispering \u201cSadness, sir\u201d quietly in to McCredie\u2019s ear, causing the bald man to shake his head, face pinched as if he\u2019d bitten something sour \u201cOh, lord, no, not at all\u2026that\u2019s a good chap.\u201d McCredie shook his head twice and Marten slipped back behind the steel door, the short, soft thud that came several seconds later muffled by Harper asking about McCredie\u2019s plans for the following evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to take the wife out for walkies? You\u2019ve kept her so tight under wraps people are beginning to talk old man. Or perhaps there\u2019s another reason for your social hermitage? Young blood for old bones?\u201d Harper ended with another gale of laughter and coughing, McCredie sighing and placing his hand over his face, even as he sported a slight grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how it can be Harper. Just getting her presentable before I go trotting about and making a fool of myself.\u201d He missed Harper\u2019s reply as Marten slid silently up to him again. \u201cJealousy, sir.\u201d McCredie thought for a moment, before shaking his head again. \u201cNo, no\u2026a little green can liven up a woman, but more trouble then it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p>\n<p>McCredie turned back, chatting with Harper about tomorrow night\u2019s gala, occasionally broken by Marten stepping out to whisper in to McCredie\u2019s ear, or a louder then normal sound from behind the door. As Harper droned on about his new system for poker, there was a sudden, sharp knock on the steel door, followed by several other, soft thumps. McCredie twisted in his chair, Harper\u2019s disembodied voice all but forgotten as the steel door handle suddenly wrenched open, and a bloody, shrieking banshee lunged from behind it.</p>\n<p>McCredie shouted, and attempted to run from the room, hide behind his chair, and strike at the screaming wrath before him, which caused him to succeed only in sending him tripping in to a heap on the floor. The lank, howling form before him ripped the chair aside, bloody blond hair sending a spray of crimson droplets across the room, her yawning mouth drooling a stream of blood and saliva. Lashing out with hands twisted in to talons, she gouged and ripped her way closer to McCredie, who was quickly backing away along the floor, eyes locked on the twitching, screaming horror.</p>\n<p>She leapt, and landed at his feet, blood splattering on his face and hands, McCredie giving a cry of revulsion and horror as her arms pulled back to lash and rip against his face. Before the mutilating blow was struck, however, there was a loud, solid thud, much like dropping a melon from a small height. The bloody, screaming thing went silent, her arms frozen a moment, before seeming to drift to her head as if she were under water. Locked in that pose for what seemed a eternity, she suddenly pitched to the side as a sizable block of dark wood connected with her temple, sending her sprawling to the side, her temple visibly dented as blood began to drool over her silent, still face.</p>\n<p>Marten stood, panting, behind where the woman had stood, blinking as he looked at a broken chair leg in his hand as if it had somehow magically appeared there. A large man was lumbering his way from the room behind the steel door, hand over his face, which was leaking a great deal of blood. Another man\u2019s feet were just visible through the doorway. They did not appear to be moving. McCredie rose, trembling, and looked between the far room, and the broken, bleeding thing on the floor, mouth working soundlessly.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was several seconds before he was able to speak, and when he did, it sounded nothing like him. Gone was the bluster, the pompous flash, leaving the hollow, rattling husk of a whisper, emanating from a man who had just seen death, and knew that it missed him dearly. \u201cW-what\u2026what was\u2026\u201d he trailed off, unable to muster the strength to continue, eyes wide with shock. Marten placed the chair leg down on the table, gently, before adjusting his shirt sleeve. \u201cAnger, sir. We were\u2026not expecting the ferocity. Arthur may have lost a eye. I think Grant is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>McCredie nodded, not hearing a word, looking at the twisted, broken body on the floor. He rubbed his face, and looked in renewed horror as his hands came away bloody from the splatter she had sprayed. \u201cOh\u2026oh god\u2026I\u2026need to go. I need to change, I\u2026I\u2026\u201d he trailed off again, sputtering and going silent as he slowly started to back away from the bloody scene before him. Marten nodded as Arthur stumbled in to a chair, groaning as he continued to hold his face. \u201cOf course sir. The car will be waiting for you, I will attend to things here sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>McCredie mumbled a \u201cquite right\u2026very good\u2026\u201d as he stumbled like a sleep walker to the door, glancing back only once, before rushing out the door and down to the car. Marten had been pulling the gun from Arthur\u2019s free hand as the man moaned, blood dripping between his fingers and down his chest. However, it wasn\u2019t that which sent him sprinting to the safety of his car, nor even the broken wrath on the floor. It had been the sight of June, taking two hesitant steps from the small room behind the steel door. June, arms lifeless at her sides, shivering slightly and unheeding of her torn dress or bloody feet. June, who\u2019s eyes had found his for a split second, and shown him a deep tunnel in to a being who\u2019s entire existence had shrunk to a heart beat and expanding lungs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Much later, Marten called McCredie, to inform him the re-integration had proceeded without incident, and the events of the afternoon had been erased. McCredie replaced the receiver without speaking, mentally screaming that they had bloody well not been erased. Walking to the drawing room, he pulled a large bottle of whiskey and a glass from the bar, before tossing the glass aside with a dull thud and drinking deeply from the bottle. To his credit, he did not finish the bottle, but that was only because of his falling through the floor of wakefulness like a millstone through plywood. There, he slept the sleep of the numbed and horrified, the whiskey clouding and dulling the clawing, shrieking horrors that would swirl on the edges of his awareness for a long time to come.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell old man, why didn't you tell me? She's a vision, no wonder you've been dabbling with hermitage! I doubt I'd have the strength to rejoin society, with that strutting about the house!\u201d Harper clapped McCredie on the back, hunching over with another laughing bout of coughs. McCredie twisted away slightly, still somewhat tired from the night before and not in the best humor. He turned to face the direction of Harper\u2019s comment, wincing slightly at Harper\u2019s loud, rattling cough.</p>\n<p>June McCredie stood on the far side of the ballroom, a vision in a simple black dress, her laughter bubbling around the room and drawing admirers like moths to flame. Mr. McCredie had been getting comments all night on his \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d, and those who had previously met her begged to know what had caused the sudden, dramatic shift. Gone was the spoiled little rich girl, to be replaced by a charming, funny (and even a touch flirtatious) high society girl. So what if she laughs a little too long, and appears to be about as deep as a soap dish, his fellows said, too much depth can lead to complications.</p>\n<p>McCredie could only offer a cheap smile and shrug his shoulders, as he did now with Harper. The coughing man straightened up with a small amount of difficulty, and clapped him again on the back. \u201cFine, you old tom, you keep your secret. I\u2019m off to the green room for a round and a game, I think I\u2019ve been around you enough for the good luck to rub off!\u201d chuckling slightly, Harper limped off, snatching a drink from a passing tray, and leaving McCredie alone for the first time that evening.</p>\n<p>He stood, watching his new wife framed with a ring of admirers, and shivered. Where the others saw the bubbling, fawning beauty, all he could see was a shrieking, bloody horror, screaming and snapping for his flesh. He shuddered, and looked away, catching the eye of Laura DeFoe, who was leaning against the bar. She nodded to him, then smiled, looking away and shaking her head, before turning back and raising her glass, her smile much more coy. McCredie broke in to the first genuine smile of the day, and tipped a imaginary hat to her. A bit older then his normal fair, she was never the less a very handsome woman\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, I was just talking to your friends, and they wanted to go out for a party tomorrow, just a small group. It sounds like such fun, but I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything without you darling!\u201d June gushed, grabbing McCredie\u2019s arm and nuzzling it slightly with her cheek, breaking his revere. He reflexively flinched away, before relaxing a bit, still eyeing her with a degree of suspicion. \u201cJune, I\u2019m rather tired, why don\u2019t you go back to the car, Marten will take you home. I\u2019ll be along presently.\u201d</p>\n<p>June looked up, her smile never flickering, but her eyes were glassy, and her movements seemed ever so slightly jerky. \u201cWhatever you say my love, I\u2019ll go right away! I\u2019ll be waiting for you when you get home.\u201d Her voice was a lilting tease, and she gave him a gentle poke with her finger before moving away, her dress swishing as she strode across the room. McCredie turned back to the bar, hoping DeFoe had not seen, and was pleased to see her engrossed in conversation with Harper, the old man doubled over in another fit. McCredie straightened his tie a bit and started over to the bar, feeling the thrill of the safari as DeFoe started to turn back to him.</p>\n<p>His advance was halted just feet short of his goal by another associate, who took his hand and shook it vigorously, heaping him with congratulations. He bore it in good humor, as DeFoe was now watching, and he extracted his hand with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, I mean, just radiant. I\u2019m stunned, she\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s\u2026\u201d the young man fumbled, and McCredie turned to face DeFoe directly, her smile a promise and a invitation. He took a glass from the bar and raised it to her, his broken wife and the stuttering young man forgotten even has he finished the fumbling sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/perfection\">Perfection</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I don\u2019t want to wait for that \u2018secured shipping\u2019 nonsense for weeks.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll be going to the airstrip in a bit; I\u2019d like to be at the Paris club by this evening.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten bowed slightly again \u201cYes, Mr. McCredie.\u00a0\u00a0If I may, your recent acquisition may attract unwanted attention.\u00a0\u00a0I can have it routed through a service in Bhutan that is excellent in dealing with these matters.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. McCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, waving his hand again as he started to eye a bottle of aged scotch behind the bar.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course, do whatever is necessary, but I want that necklace in Paris by this weekend.\u00a0\u00a0Also, have Arthur and Grant ready in Paris when I get there.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten followed Mr. McCredie as he strode up to the bar, acquiring a very good and very expensive glass of scotch with a few gestures to the bartender.\u00a0\u00a0Marten bowed and spoke again as Mr. McCredie took his first slow sip.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWill Mrs. McCredie be joining you on this evening\u2019s flight?\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. McCredie\u2019s face twisted with a sour expression as he put down his drink.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no\u2026she\u2019s still pouting in her new apartment over my having to work on her birthday\u2026but we\u2019ll soon see to that, won\u2019t we!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He laughed, taking another sip.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSend for her tomorrow morning.\u00a0\u00a0If she makes a fuss, say\u2026I don\u2019t know, something romantic or some such.\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019s young, and still loves to think of herself as a princess\u2026oh, say that she\u2019ll get to meet royalty, that should shut her up and get her packing.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten moved slightly closer, lowering his voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd the\u2026special considerations you asked for have been attended to as well.\u00a0\u00a0A local funeral home has offered its services and crematorium for modest compensation as soon as we are in need.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcCredie scowled at Marten, waving him away as he turned back to his scotch.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally, is it necessary to inform me of every little step?\u00a0\u00a0Go; make things ready, I\u2019ll be leaving here in the hour.\u00a0\u00a0Really, I don\u2019t know why I still bother with these Christmas get-togethers, they always end on some sour note\u2026are you still here?\u00a0\u00a0I said go!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Marten bowed and quickly walked off, leaving McCredie to his scotch and a drab conversation with a member of the English parliament.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nJune McCredie came off the jet in bluster of expensive silk, blond hair, and whining.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t another one of his stupid little business meetings, is it?\u00a0\u00a0I swear, if he drags me all around town to meet a bunch of old, stupid men in suits, I\u2019m going to scream.\u00a0\u00a0With all the meetings and social stuff he does, you\u2019d think he\u2019d find time to go to one or two real parties!\u00a0\u00a0You know, music and dancing and fancy drinks and all that stuff\u2026not gagging on smoke having to listen to fat old guys talk about pricing strategies and having to act interested.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0She hurried off the tarmac and into the reception area of the McCredie\u2019s private airstrip, as Marten directed the unloading of her considerable baggage from the jet.\n\n\n\nLater, as her car ambled its way down the busy Paris streets, she continued her monologue, directing it at the back of Marten\u2019s head as he drove.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally, this is it.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t need him, if he\u2019s not going to put some time into our relationship, I don\u2019t know how this is going to work.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve been married a year, and we\u2019ve only gone on three vacations, just the two of us.\u00a0\u00a0Now all he wants to do is stay at that club of his all day and smoke and drink.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0She ended in a huff, crossing her arms and pouting out the window.\n\n\n\nMarten smiled, looking in the rear-view mirror.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sure you appreciate his position.\u00a0\u00a0Your husband is a powerful man, and needs to keep up appearances to maintain his position.\u201d\n\n\n\nJune huffed again, burying herself more into the leather seats and watching Paris roll by. At a stop, she piped up again, still looking out the window.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMarten\u2026is\u2026is John in trouble?\u00a0\u00a0I mean\u2026with the government or anything?\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten stiffened a little at the wheel, his smile unfazed.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo ma\u2019am, Mr. McCredie has a quite friendly relationship with parliament, as far as I am aware.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed, \u201cI was worried\u2026some men came by, asking about him.\u00a0\u00a0They said it was about some delivery to India or something\u2026it sounded like he was in trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten smiled and shook his head, ignoring the sweat starting to form on his palms.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s some kind of mix-up, nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe nodded, resting her chin on the edge of the door, looking out the window.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure\u2026they said something about a foundation or something when they were in the hall\u2026probably just some charity looking for a handout.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten nodded, quietly wiping away a bead of sweat on his forehead as they started forward again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes, that must be it, very good ma\u2019am...\u201d\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAfter dropping June off at a suitably ostentatious hotel to \u201cfreshen up\u201d for the evening, Marten worked his way down a network of side streets to the Pairs chapter clubhouse of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd, buried in a mass of hotels and boutiques.\u00a0\u00a0After parking in the private underground lot, Marten walked to the elevator, punching in the code for Mr. McCredie\u2019s private room.\u00a0\u00a0Almost as soon as the doors opened, he was roughly grabbed and hurled inside by Arthur and Grant, landing in a heap.\u00a0\u00a0Lifting his head, he took in the room for a moment, decorated in late Victorian style, except for the oddly out of place steel door on the far wall.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. McCredie sat in a huge leather chair, smoking and looking down at Marten with mild amusement.\u00a0\u00a0Arthur wrapped a huge hand into Marten\u2019s collar, lifting him back to his feet as Grant took position next to McCredie\u2019s chair.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nMcCredie spoke, smoke drifting from his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFoundation agents were at my home yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Care to explain?\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten swallowed hard, sweating under McCredie\u2019s lazy but piercing gaze.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTh\u2026they know nothing, sir.\u00a0\u00a0If they knew it was you, they would have already raided the club.\u00a0\u00a0They are not the police or government; they don\u2019t have to justify anything to anyone.\u00a0\u00a0Shooting in the dark is all they can do now.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0His voice carried much more confidence then he felt, and he was sharply aware of the gun-shaped lump in Arthur\u2019s jacket pressing into his spine.\n\n\n\nMcCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, thinking, before waving his hand, causing Arthur to drop him again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHonestly,\u201d McCredie said, \u201cI believe you.\u00a0\u00a0However, we can\u2019t have these things happening again, understand?\u00a0\u00a0I pay you bloody well enough; I expect things to be taken care of in the proper fashion.\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of which, did you manage to get my darling wife to the hotel in one piece?\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten nodded, adjusting his suit.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes, she should be here by this evening.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d spoke McCredie, rubbing his hands together. \u201cWe should have this all wrapped up by dinner.\u00a0\u00a0Grant, you and Arthur make sure everything is ready for June, will you?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Both huge men nodded, moving back and opening the heavy steel door, given Marten a view of the bare tiled walls and stained concrete floor drain beyond before the door swung shut again.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie rose, stubbing out his cigarette out and grinning \u201cWell, let\u2019s give her an hour, and then we\u2019ll get this mess over and done with!\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\u201cUgh\u2026why do these places always smell like smoke and old people?\u00a0\u00a0Why can\u2019t we ever meet at some club or something?\u00a0\u00a0God, I really think he goes out of his way to bug me sometimes\u2026\u201d\u00a0\u00a0June flipped her hair back in disgust, looking around at the sitting room, her black dress shining with small interwoven crystals.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy did he want me here even?\u00a0\u00a0Aren\u2019t we supposed to be going out for dinner?\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten nodded, smiling.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes ma\u2019am, and he will be along shortly.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, he wished for me to give you a small gift on his behalf.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Her eyes immediately lit up, a grin spreading over her face as she squealed happily.\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u00a0\u00a0Where is it?\u00a0\u00a0Oooh, I love presents\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nMarten gestured to the steel door, and she hurried over, pulling it open with some effort.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUgh\u2026what a heavy door\u2026ooh, is that it?\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s\u2026just a yin-yang with a little chain.\u00a0\u00a0How is that\u2026what is this place?\u00a0\u00a0Arthur?\u00a0\u00a0What are you doing\u2026let\u2026let ME GO!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The start of her scream was cut off sharply as Marten gently closed the door.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nMcCredie reclined in his chair, chuckling slightly as he looked to the small speaker planted on the coffee table before him.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a loon, Harper, you know that don\u2019t you?\u00a0\u00a0It takes real dedication to keep playing a game you\u2019re bad at.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0A short burst of laughter from the speaker quickly devolved in to a coughing fit, before the voice gave a gasp and replied.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMcCredie, you\u2019re not any better then me at the cards, you just cheat better then anyone else at the table.\u00a0\u00a0Besides, don\u2019t you still owe me two from that Easter game?\u201d\n\n\n\nMcCredie scoffed, waving his hand at the speaker as if it could see, his head turning slightly as Marten quietly opened the steel door and strode over to him, the sound of a muffled sob quickly squelched as the door re-closed.\u00a0\u00a0Marten leaned down, whispering \u201cSadness, sir\u201d quietly in to McCredie\u2019s ear, causing the bald man to shake his head, face pinched as if he\u2019d bitten something sour \u201cOh, lord, no, not at all\u2026that\u2019s a good chap.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0McCredie shook his head twice and Marten slipped back behind the steel door, the short, soft thud that came several seconds later muffled by Harper asking about McCredie\u2019s plans for the following evening.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoing to take the wife out for walkies?\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve kept her so tight under wraps people are beginning to talk old man.\u00a0\u00a0Or perhaps there\u2019s another reason for your social hermitage?\u00a0\u00a0Young blood for old bones?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Harper ended with another gale of laughter and coughing, McCredie sighing and placing his hand over his face, even as he sported a slight grin.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know how it can be Harper.\u00a0\u00a0Just getting her presentable before I go trotting about and making a fool of myself.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He missed Harper\u2019s reply as Marten slid silently up to him again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJealousy, sir.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0McCredie thought for a moment, before shaking his head again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no\u2026a little green can liven up a woman, but more trouble then it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcCredie turned back, chatting with Harper about tomorrow night\u2019s gala, occasionally broken by Marten stepping out to whisper in to McCredie\u2019s ear, or a louder then normal sound from behind the door.\u00a0\u00a0As Harper droned on about his new system for poker, there was a sudden, sharp knock on the steel door, followed by several other, soft thumps.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie twisted in his chair, Harper\u2019s disembodied voice all but forgotten as the steel door handle suddenly wrenched open, and a bloody, shrieking banshee lunged from behind it.\n\n\n\nMcCredie shouted, and attempted to run from the room, hide behind his chair, and strike at the screaming wrath before him, which caused him to succeed only in sending him tripping in to a heap on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0The lank, howling form before him ripped the chair aside, bloody blond hair sending a spray of crimson droplets across the room, her yawning mouth drooling a stream of blood and saliva.\u00a0\u00a0Lashing out with hands twisted in to talons, she gouged and ripped her way closer to McCredie, who was quickly backing away along the floor, eyes locked on the twitching, screaming horror.\n\n\n\nShe leapt, and landed at his feet, blood splattering on his face and hands, McCredie giving a cry of revulsion and horror as her arms pulled back to lash and rip against his face.\u00a0\u00a0Before the mutilating blow was struck, however, there was a loud, solid thud, much like dropping a melon from a small height.\u00a0\u00a0The bloody, screaming thing went silent, her arms frozen a moment, before seeming to drift to her head as if she were under water.\u00a0\u00a0Locked in that pose for what seemed a eternity, she suddenly pitched to the side as a sizable block of dark wood connected with her temple, sending her sprawling to the side, her temple visibly dented as blood began to drool over her silent, still face.\n\n\n\nMarten stood, panting, behind where the woman had stood, blinking as he looked at a broken chair leg in his hand as if it had somehow magically appeared there.\u00a0\u00a0A large man was lumbering his way from the room behind the steel door, hand over his face, which was leaking a great deal of blood.\u00a0\u00a0Another man\u2019s feet were just visible through the doorway.\u00a0\u00a0They did not appear to be moving.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie rose, trembling, and looked between the far room, and the broken, bleeding thing on the floor, mouth working soundlessly.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nIt was several seconds before he was able to speak, and when he did, it sounded nothing like him.\u00a0\u00a0Gone was the bluster, the pompous flash, leaving the hollow, rattling husk of a whisper, emanating from a man who had just seen death, and knew that it missed him dearly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cW-what\u2026what was\u2026\u201d he trailed off, unable to muster the strength to continue, eyes wide with shock.\u00a0\u00a0Marten placed the chair leg down on the table, gently, before adjusting his shirt sleeve.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnger, sir.\u00a0\u00a0We were\u2026not expecting the ferocity.\u00a0\u00a0Arthur may have lost a eye.\u00a0\u00a0I think Grant is dead.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcCredie nodded, not hearing a word, looking at the twisted, broken body on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0He rubbed his face, and looked in renewed horror as his hands came away bloody from the splatter she had sprayed.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh\u2026oh god\u2026I\u2026need to go.\u00a0\u00a0I need to change, I\u2026I\u2026\u201d he trailed off again, sputtering and going silent as he slowly started to back away from the bloody scene before him.\u00a0\u00a0Marten nodded as Arthur stumbled in to a chair, groaning as he continued to hold his face.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course sir.\u00a0\u00a0The car will be waiting for you, I will attend to things here sir.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcCredie mumbled a \u201cquite right\u2026very good\u2026\u201d as he stumbled like a sleep walker to the door, glancing back only once, before rushing out the door and down to the car.\u00a0\u00a0Marten had been pulling the gun from Arthur\u2019s free hand as the man moaned, blood dripping between his fingers and down his chest.\u00a0\u00a0However, it wasn\u2019t that which sent him sprinting to the safety of his car, nor even the broken wrath on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0It had been the sight of June, taking two hesitant steps from the small room behind the steel door.\u00a0\u00a0June, arms lifeless at her sides, shivering slightly and unheeding of her torn dress or bloody feet.\u00a0\u00a0June, who\u2019s eyes had found his for a split second, and shown him a deep tunnel in to a being who\u2019s entire existence had shrunk to a heart beat and expanding lungs.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nMuch later, Marten called McCredie, to inform him the re-integration had proceeded without incident, and the events of the afternoon had been erased.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie replaced the receiver without speaking, mentally screaming that they had bloody well not been erased.\u00a0\u00a0Walking to the drawing room, he pulled a large bottle of whiskey and a glass from the bar, before tossing the glass aside with a dull thud and drinking deeply from the bottle.\u00a0\u00a0To his credit, he did not finish the bottle, but that was only because of his falling through the floor of wakefulness like a millstone through plywood.\u00a0\u00a0There, he slept the sleep of the numbed and horrified, the whiskey clouding and dulling the clawing, shrieking horrors that would swirl on the edges of his awareness for a long time to come.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell old man, why didn't you tell me?\u00a0\u00a0She's a vision, no wonder you've been dabbling with hermitage!\u00a0\u00a0I doubt I'd have the strength to rejoin society, with that strutting about the house!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Harper clapped McCredie on the back, hunching over with another laughing bout of coughs.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie twisted away slightly, still somewhat tired from the night before and not in the best humor.\u00a0\u00a0He turned to face the direction of Harper\u2019s comment, wincing slightly at Harper\u2019s loud, rattling cough.\n\n\n\nJune McCredie stood on the far side of the ballroom, a vision in a simple black dress, her laughter bubbling around the room and drawing admirers like moths to flame.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. McCredie had been getting comments all night on his \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d, and those who had previously met her begged to know what had caused the sudden, dramatic shift.\u00a0\u00a0Gone was the spoiled little rich girl, to be replaced by a charming, funny (and even a touch flirtatious) high society girl.\u00a0\u00a0So what if she laughs a little too long, and appears to be about as deep as a soap dish, his fellows said, too much depth can lead to complications.\n\n\n\nMcCredie could only offer a cheap smile and shrug his shoulders, as he did now with Harper.\u00a0\u00a0The coughing man straightened up with a small amount of difficulty, and clapped him again on the back.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFine, you old tom, you keep your secret.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m off to the green room for a round and a game, I think I\u2019ve been around you enough for the good luck to rub off!\u201d chuckling slightly, Harper limped off, snatching a drink from a passing tray, and leaving McCredie alone for the first time that evening.\n\n\n\nHe stood, watching his new wife framed with a ring of admirers, and shivered.\u00a0\u00a0Where the others saw the bubbling, fawning beauty, all he could see was a shrieking, bloody horror, screaming and snapping for his flesh.\u00a0\u00a0He shuddered, and looked away, catching the eye of Laura DeFoe, who was leaning against the bar.\u00a0\u00a0She nodded to him, then smiled, looking away and shaking her head, before turning back and raising her glass, her smile much more coy.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie broke in to the first genuine smile of the day, and tipped a imaginary hat to her.\u00a0\u00a0A bit older then his normal fair, she was never the less a very handsome woman\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cHoney, I was just talking to your friends, and they wanted to go out for a party tomorrow, just a small group.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like such fun, but I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything without you darling!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0June gushed, grabbing McCredie\u2019s arm and nuzzling it slightly with her cheek, breaking his revere.\u00a0\u00a0He reflexively flinched away, before relaxing a bit, still eyeing her with a degree of suspicion.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJune, I\u2019m rather tired, why don\u2019t you go back to the car, Marten will take you home.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll be along presently.\u201d\n\n\n\nJune looked up, her smile never flickering, but her eyes were glassy, and her movements seemed ever so slightly jerky.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhatever you say my love, I\u2019ll go right away!\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll be waiting for you when you get home.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Her voice was a lilting tease, and she gave him a gentle poke with her finger before moving away, her dress swishing as she strode across the room.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie turned back to the bar, hoping DeFoe had not seen, and was pleased to see her engrossed in conversation with Harper, the old man doubled over in another fit.\u00a0\u00a0McCredie straightened his tie a bit and started over to the bar, feeling the thrill of the safari as DeFoe started to turn back to him.\n\n\n\nHis advance was halted just feet short of his goal by another associate, who took his hand and shook it vigorously, heaping him with congratulations.\u00a0\u00a0He bore it in good humor, as DeFoe was now watching, and he extracted his hand with a smile.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, I mean, just radiant.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m stunned, she\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s\u2026\u201d the young man fumbled, and McCredie turned to face DeFoe directly, her smile a promise and a invitation.\u00a0\u00a0He took a glass from the bar and raised it to her, his broken wife and the stuttering young man forgotten even has he finished the fumbling sentence.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a

Doc Rhodes was pretty pissed off, said I'm the worst secretary he's ever seen. That old man's told me that every day for three years now. When's he gonna lighten up? At least the work is easy.</p>\n<p>He's been studying a bunch of papers and stuff from one of his patients' home. A guy called Raul Sounder, went crazy and killed a bunch of people. Said he was on some kind of 'quest for meaning', whatever that is. He had this weird obsession with the number eighteen. Rhodes called it the worst case of something called 'Pareidolia' he'd ever seen. Helluvva word, pareidolia. Anyway, I should go to sleep. That damn crow kept me awake all night\u2026 I really wish I could live in places where the birds don't cry all night and keep me up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>I've never understood why people start off entries like this with 'dear diary'. It seems so stupid to pretend I'm doing anything other than writing in a notebook.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it was a fairly good day today, light workload, just a few patients. Doctor Rhodes had me file a whole bunch of the Sounders stuff away, though, so it wasn't exactly a break. It's the oddest thing, those papers had this\u2026 <em>stuff</em> on them, not like dust exactly, but some kinda powder, like they'd been stored in a room full of the stuff. It gives the pages an odd texture, makes them feel strange. I got a pretty nasty papercut on one, too. It's swollen, looks infected.</p>\n<p>At any rate, time for sleep. That fucking crow had better not wake me up again. I wish I could live in places where the birds don't cry at all hours of the night\u2026 Huh, I said that last night, too. 'places where the birds don't cry'. Kinda poetic. I like it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>So, today was boring.</p>\n<p>Rhodes was acting kinda strange, though. He kept babbling about the red light at the intersection around the corner from the building changing faster than the others. He would walk over and stick his head out the window to try and catch it changing. Ah, well, old guys like him are bound to develop a few eccentricities eventually, right? Go figure.</p>\n<p>Oh! Also, I told one of the patients, an english teacher, about how I'd come up with that fun phrase 'Places where the birds don't cry'. She said she thought it would make a good title for a book or short story or something. I was kinda hoping for a better reaction. It <em>is</em> really poetic. places where the birds don't cry. Ha, a novel by Susan James.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I need to go to bed soon. I kinda hope the crow outside is loud tonight, so I can complain about not sleeping in places where the birds don't cry.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Doctor Rhodes is dead.</p>\n<p>That traffic light he was freaking out over? He went out sometime late last night and hung himself from it. The police have been questioning me all day, 'what did he act like?' 'Did he seem all right?'. I told them he'd been talking about that light being off and it really bothered him, and they hmmd a bit and wrote it down, and that damn crow kept making noise the whole time. I told one of the cops about how unlucky he was to have to sleep in places where the birds don't cry, and he looked at me like I'd said something really strange. Some people, huh?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm proud of my new pet phrase. places where the birds don't cry. places where the birds don't cry. places where the <em>birds</em> don't <em>cry</em>. Hey, if you say it like that, it sounds kinda important, doesn't it?</p>\n<p>Anyway, time for bed. I'm so glad I don't have to live in places where the birds don't cry.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>I really need to get a job, but I don't want to leave the apartment. The crow outside is so comforting\u2026 I'm almost scared to go to places where the birds don't cry\u2026 Dunno what I'll do come winter. Fly south, I suppose.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nPlaces where the birds don't cry.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nThe crow never made a noise last night.

I really should start setting an alarm or something. Doc Rhodes was pretty pissed off, said I'm the worst secretary he's ever seen. That old man's told me that every day for three years now. When's he gonna lighten up? At least the work is easy.\n\n> \n\n> He's been studying a bunch of papers and stuff from one of his patients' home. A guy called Raul Sounder, went crazy and killed a bunch of people. Said he was on some kind of 'quest for meaning', whatever that is. He had this weird obsession with the number eighteen. Rhodes called it the worst case of something called 'Pareidolia' he'd ever seen. Helluvva word, pareidolia. Anyway, I should go to sleep. That damn crow kept me awake all night... I really wish I could live in places where the birds don't cry all night and keep me up.\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> \n\n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \n\n> \n\n> I've never understood why people start off entries like this with 'dear diary'. It seems so stupid to pretend I'm doing anything other than writing in a notebook. \n\n> \n\n> Anyway, it was a fairly good day today, light workload, just a few patients. Doctor Rhodes had me file a whole bunch of the Sounders stuff away, though, so it wasn't exactly a break. It's the oddest thing, those papers had this... //stuff// on them, not like dust exactly, but some kinda powder, like they'd been stored in a room full of the stuff. It gives the pages an odd texture, makes them feel strange. I got a pretty nasty papercut on one, too. It's swollen, looks infected.\n\n> \n\n> At any rate, time for sleep. That fucking crow had better not wake me up again. I wish I could live in places where the birds don't cry at all hours of the night... Huh, I said that last night, too. 'places where the birds don't cry'. Kinda poetic. I like it.\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> So, today was boring. \n\n> \n\n> Rhodes was acting kinda strange, though. He kept babbling about the red light at the intersection around the corner from the building changing faster than the others. He would walk over and stick his head out the window to try and catch it changing. Ah, well, old guys like him are bound to develop a few eccentricities eventually, right? Go figure.\n\n> \n\n> Oh! Also, I told one of the patients, an english teacher, about how I'd come up with that fun phrase 'Places where the birds don't cry'. She said she thought it would make a good title for a book or short story or something. I was kinda hoping for a better reaction. It //is// really poetic. places where the birds don't cry. Ha, a novel by Susan James. \n\n> \n\n> Anyway, I need to go to bed soon. I kinda hope the crow outside is loud tonight, so I can complain about not sleeping in places where the birds don't cry.\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> \n\n> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> Doctor Rhodes is dead.\n\n> \n\n> That traffic light he was freaking out over? He went out sometime late last night and hung himself from it. The police have been questioning me all day, 'what did he act like?' 'Did he seem all right?'. I told them he'd been talking about that light being off and it really bothered him, and they hmmd a bit and wrote it down, and that damn crow kept making noise the whole time. I told one of the cops about how unlucky he was to have to sleep in places where the birds don't cry, and he looked at me like I'd\u00a0\u00a0said something really strange. Some people, huh?\n\n> \n\n> Anyway, I'm proud of my new pet phrase. places where the birds don't cry. places where the birds don't cry. places where the //birds// don't //cry//. Hey, if you say it like that, it sounds kinda important, doesn't it?\n\n> \n\n> Anyway, time for bed. I'm so glad I don't have to live in places where the birds don't cry.\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> \n\n> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> I really need to get a job, but I don't want to leave the apartment. The crow outside is so comforting... I'm almost scared to go to places where the birds don't cry...

I attempted to recoil, to fall back to the nothing that I had come from, but found myself frozen, my body not my own, only able to watch and look in horror at the world I now found myself in.</p>\n<p>Cracked bricks and blocks formed an endless road before me, while behind laid only a flat mass of black more dark and empty then the place I had already come from. Stones and clumps of masonry floated here and there, as if frozen after being flung free by some massive explosion. Yawning tubes dotted this narrow, cyclopean highway, and the road had even crumbled away in sections, to reveal gaping maws of oblivion.</p>\n<p>It was not this alien landscape that filled with me horror. While it gnawed and gnashed at the edges of my strength of mind, it was the subtle\u2026 awareness of the place that cause me to recoil in my frozen body. Everywhere, half-perceived faces leered from the bricks, the ground, the clouds. Everywhere eyes, dull but gleaming with a mocking, predatory awareness, seemed to watch, their vapid emptiness vanishing when perceived too closely.</p>\n<p>Faced with the blank nothing behind me, or the unknown horror before, I forced my unresponsive limbs forward, each step a jerky ordeal. I kept my eyes locked ahead, seeing only the next step, the next stone, never looking at the impossible islands of floating, decayed brick that drifted over me, nor at the mocking faces laughing at my plight from every crevice.</p>\n<p>Merely steps in to my journey, I froze, nearly recoiling back to beat at the blank nothing-wall behind me rather than take another step. Where before had been naught but the crumbling road, there was now another traveler. It shambled forward, slouching low under its own rotten weight, pulpy black lumps of feet slowly dragging it along the road. Two staring, blank eyes floated in the bloated, fungoid mass of its body, fixed on me with the unseeing focus of a mind as alien to mine as a deep-sea worm.</p>\n<p>I stood, frozen and uncomprehending as it slowly strode forward, its wheezing body barely bigger then that of a child. Its glaring eyes were fixed on me, the pulpy thing slowly drawing closer. I could not move. To retreat would result only in eventual capture by the thing, but to advance would mean crossing it, and the thought of touching that\u2026 thing\u2026</p>\n<p>The decision was made for me, for as the thing drew close, I was galvanized in to action. By horror or rage, I leapt forward, screaming nonsense, and struck at that bloated body. I kicked and stomped at it, crushing the flabby and far too soft flesh under me, sobbing in horror as I felt the flesh touch me, then melt away, rotting to nothingness in seconds, but leaving such an unclean memory in me that I knew I would feel that dull, soggy weight against me long after even the sweet, cold embrace of the beyond.</p>\n<p>After that, I ran. I ran and cursed whatever black fate had brought me here, and obliterated my memory, my life, and left only the road, the eternal road. I would have cried, have balled up and thrown myself down one of the endless pits that had broken open the road, but I was compelled to continue, legs continuing in a jerky rhythm that propelled me over the crumbling brick, leaping across the pits even as I secretly wished to fall in to their depths and obliterate the road, the faces, and myself.</p>\n<p>As I ran and jumped, I came to one of the thick, twisted tubes that dotted the claustrophobic landscape. I thought to look in for a moment, curiosity fighting to overcome my almost manic desire to be free of this place, but upon hearing a strange shuffling and gurgling, coupled with a deep, bass pulse from the bowels of the black pipe, I decide against it and squeezed around. As soon as I was past, there was a sudden rush of air behind me, followed by a sharp, oddly muffled snap, as if two iron bars wrapped in cotton had been thrown together behind me. I did not turn, merely using this to further galvanize my stuttering walk, ignoring the continued snapping and rustling as it faded behind me.</p>\n<p>Far ahead, I saw a long, glossy stair, leading up, and beyond it what looked like a squat dwelling made of the same crumbling brick as the road. While I feared what may lie inside, the idea of someone else, some other person with which to share this horrible place with filled me with the first hope I had felt in hours. I ran, eyes fixed on that stair, and soared across the final gap. It was mid-way across the abyss when I saw the thing waiting on the other side.</p>\n<p>It was a twisted parody of some kind of reptile. Its elongated face was filled with a dim sort of menace, and his mouth yawned in anticipation of my reaching the other side, the jagged edges glinting as it made a choking squeal. Its body balanced on two squat, shapeless legs, a shell of hard, cracked flesh encasing the bulbous torso. Two stunted limbs projected through the flaking shell, coated in fibrous growths, and slowly shifted in a sick mockery of wings.</p>\n<p>I screamed and twisted, trying in vain to return to the far edge, but it was too late, and my struggles were enough to bring me short, slamming in to the hard wall of the pit, the thing above me shrieking in frustration as I fell. Down, and down, spinning in to the endless blackness, I felt the dark enclose around me. However, seconds before the emptiness could provide me its final solace, I suddenly remembered.</p>\n<p>Endless roads, lakes of fire, crumbling tombs filled with the rotting, shambling bones of beasts, hazy forms of glowing slickly light following in the dark, floating networks of ancient wood drifting in a hot sky, it all came back to me in a flood, the remembrance of where I had been, what I had done, and knowing that it would continue.</p>\n<p>I do not know how long I have done this, nor what I have done to earn this.</p>\n<p>Only that I must walk the road.</p>\n<p>Forever.</p>\n<div style=\"background: black; color: white; font-family: pxplus_ibm_vga8regular, monospace; text-shadow: 1px 1px teal, 1px -1px teal, -1px 1px teal, -1px -1px teal; font-size: 2em; padding: 1em;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tr>\n<td>MARIO</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>WORLD</td>\n<td>TIME</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>000000</td>\n<td>\ud83d\udcc0X00</td>\n<td>1 - 1</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGAME OVER<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/play\">Play</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

thing slowly drawing closer.\u00a0\u00a0I could not move.\u00a0\u00a0To retreat would result only in eventual capture by the thing, but to advance would mean crossing it, and the thought of touching that\u2026 thing\u2026\n\n\n\nThe decision was made for me, for as the thing drew close, I was galvanized in to action.\u00a0\u00a0By horror or rage, I leapt forward, screaming nonsense, and struck at that bloated body.\u00a0\u00a0I kicked and stomped at it, crushing the flabby and far too soft flesh under me, sobbing in horror as I felt the flesh touch me, then melt away, rotting to nothingness in seconds, but leaving such an unclean memory in me that I knew I would feel that dull, soggy weight against me long after even the sweet, cold embrace of the beyond.\n\n\n\nAfter that, I ran.\u00a0\u00a0I ran and cursed whatever black fate had brought me here, and obliterated my memory, my life, and left only the road, the eternal road.\u00a0\u00a0I would have cried, have balled up and thrown myself down one of the endless pits that had broken open the road, but I was compelled to continue, legs continuing in a jerky rhythm that propelled me over the crumbling brick, leaping across the pits even as I secretly wished to fall in to their depths and obliterate the road, the faces, and myself.\n\n\n\nAs I ran and jumped, I came to one of the thick, twisted tubes that dotted the claustrophobic landscape.\u00a0\u00a0I thought to look in for a moment, curiosity fighting to overcome my almost manic desire to be free of this place, but upon hearing a strange shuffling and gurgling, coupled with a deep, bass pulse from the bowels of the black pipe, I decide against it and squeezed around.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I was past, there was a sudden rush of air behind me, followed by a sharp, oddly muffled snap, as if two iron bars wrapped in cotton had been thrown together behind me.\u00a0\u00a0I did not turn, merely using this to further galvanize my stuttering walk, ignoring the continued snapping and rustling as it faded behind me.\n\n\n\nFar ahead, I saw a long, glossy stair, leading up, and beyond it what looked like a squat dwelling made of the same crumbling brick as the road.\u00a0\u00a0While I feared what may lie inside, the idea of someone else, some other person with which to share this horrible place with filled me with the first hope I had felt in hours.\u00a0\u00a0I ran, eyes fixed on that stair, and soared across the final gap.\u00a0\u00a0It was mid-way across the abyss when I saw the thing waiting on the other side.\n\n\n\nIt was a twisted parody of some kind of reptile.\u00a0\u00a0Its elongated face was filled with a dim sort of menace, and his mouth yawned in anticipation of my reaching the other side, the jagged edges glinting as it made a choking squeal.\u00a0\u00a0Its body balanced on two squat, shapeless legs, a shell of hard, cracked flesh encasing the bulbous torso.\u00a0\u00a0Two stunted limbs projected through the flaking shell, coated in fibrous growths, and slowly shifted in a sick mockery of wings.\n\n\n\nI screamed and twisted, trying in vain to return to the far edge, but it was too late, and my struggles were enough to bring me short, slamming in to the hard wall of the pit, the thing above me shrieking in frustration as I fell.\u00a0\u00a0Down, and down, spinning in to the endless blackness, I felt the dark enclose around me.\u00a0\u00a0However, seconds before the emptiness could provide me its final solace, I suddenly remembered.\n\n\n\nEndless roads, lakes of fire, crumbling tombs filled with the rotting, shambling bones of beasts, hazy forms of glowing slickly light following in the dark, floating networks of ancient wood drifting in a hot sky, it all came back to me in a flood, the remembrance of where I had been, what I had done, and knowing that it would continue.\n\n\n\nI do not know how long I have done this, nor what I have done to earn this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nOnly that I must walk the road.\n\n\n\nForever.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: black; color: white; font-family: pxplus_ibm_vga8regular, monospace; text-shadow: 1px 1px teal, 1px -1px teal, -1px 1px teal, -1px

The trip took forever, I\u2019d have to guess about six hours, but I couldn\u2019t see, and I fell asleep a few times, so I guess it really could be anything. Four other people on the transport as well, two other men and two women. At least I think so, one of the guys never really talked, but I think it\u2019s a he. Still sore from getting jabbed by a guard, I fell and he really stabbed me with his gun muzzle. Anyway, we\u2019re here now. I assume \u201cwe\u201d are, at least. I\u2019m in my own little room, I\u2019m just assuming everyone else is as well. It\u2019s better than the barracks, and a ton better then the cell. Still, it has that feel, where you know nobody really stays here for long, like the vibe you get off a shitty hotel room.</p>\n<p>This is not my diary, at least not the \u201cofficial\u201d one I\u2019m supposed to keep. I\u2019m actually under my cot, writing this and then stuffing it in to the hollow leg of the bed frame. I\u2019m sure they can see me, but it makes me feel better to have a secret. I haven\u2019t had any in a long time, and it makes me feel less like a toy. Security is so tight here, I\u2019ve never seen so many guns and helmets. They even have this special suit for the five of us, and some of the doctors and stuff. There\u2019s this really weird atmosphere here, really\u2026bleak.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>2-</p>\n<p>Nothing today. Food comes in through a slot in the door. Not bad, really, seems like it has something in it, has kind of a weird iron taste to it. I don\u2019t really get what is going on. Leave it to the government to keep you guessing, even when you really don\u2019t care any more. It\u2019s odd, the walls seem pretty thick, but the one the door is in seems thinner. I can hear some banging around some times, and crying. lots of crying. I listened at the door a while, seeing if I could guess who it was. It was those one sobs\u2026you know the crying a kid makes, when they know they are hurt and don\u2019t understand why? just that empty, hopeless weeping. I wanted to go and pet that kid, let them know it\u2019s ok, that I\u2026yeah.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I heard some other stuff, just kind of muffled bumping, then the crying suddenly changed to this\u2026gurgling noise, sounded like they were choking, or\u2026I don\u2019t know. I stopped, and started just walking around my room. I went to listen again after a bit, and it was silent.</p>\n<p>Thought about Kate today, which I haven\u2019t done in awhile. I wonder if they allow visiting hours here. If they do, I think I\u2019m going to call her. She might want to visit me now, or even forgive me. I miss her, oddly enough. I still have the scar on my cheek from where she cut me, but I do miss her, in a way.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>3-</p>\n<p>I am not sure where I am, but it is not a jail. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s any part of the government either. My door opened today. I mean, just suddenly slid open. There was a little hall, and another doorway at the other end. A voice suddenly came from somewhere, and told me to go to the end of the hall. I walked out, the walls felt like some kind of tile, smooth and grey. I heard other people, faintly, and that crying was a lot louder. Finally, I came out the doorway at the end, and there was a guy in this storm trooper-looking outfit, all black with this smooth black helmet, and he shoved me in to this open room. There were two other armored guys, and pretty soon the other four people from the transport came in from other halls, all wearing the same jumpsuit things as me. There was this big, steel door at the other end of the room, and the crying seemed to be coming from behind it.</p>\n<p>The three armored guys told us to listen to their commands at all times, and that if we didn\u2019t, we\u2019d be shot immediately. One of the women from the transport started to cry too, and I tried to go back down the hall, but they grabbed me and pulled me back. One opened the door, and the crying got really loud. They told me that we all had to do what they told us, or we would be shot. He had a gun to my head, I could feel the metal, it was very cold. He said he would kill me.</p>\n<p>It was a hospital room behind the door, kinda. Lots of medical stuff, but other things, too. I mean, it was not hospital stuff, like belts and balls, straps. There was a big gurney bed in the middle of the room, with all these tubes and stuff, and machines\u2026</p>\n<p>She was on it. I don\u2019t know how old she is, I could barely see her face over her\u2026I don\u2019t even know if it was her belly. I think it is, but it was so\u2026bulbous, and swollen and the skin seemed like it was too thin. But she was so\u2026pretty, and smooth, but she kept crying, and saying to take it out, that it hurt, that we need to take it out. I started getting scared, but the guards pushed me and the others closer, and they started telling us what we had to do.</p>\n<p>The woman who had started crying freaked out, and one of the guard hit her with the butt of his rifle. I was so scared. They said we had to, that we had to do this. I felt a shotgun in my back, I could hear him pump the slide. I had to. I didn\u2019t have any choice, not any of us. She noticed us, and started screaming, but one of the guys put a hand over her mouth, hard. I touched her. She felt like she had a fever, but she was so smooth and soft. I tried to ignore the others, and that big\u2026thing on her, and just see her hand, her little hand, and kiss it, show her I cared\u2026</p>\n<p>She screamed a lot. I didn\u2019t get excited, even when the quiet guy from the transport did\u2026things with her. I didn\u2019t. Afterward, one of the guards made us all leave while they wiped her down, and we went back to our cells. Nobody really talked or looked at each other. She has such soft hands.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>4-</p>\n<p>I woke up screaming on the floor. I don\u2019t remember what I dreamed. I have sores on my face and hands, and other places. They\u2019re red and really tender. I got scared, and the voice came on, told me that it was normal to get the sores, that I would be fine. They look nasty, kind of soft and pulsing a little, but they don\u2019t really hurt. They actually\u2026I don\u2019t know how to describe it. It\u2019s like a sore tooth, it hurts, but then when you push it, it changes and has this \u201csweet\u201d to it.</p>\n<p>The door opened today, and I went down the hall, with the others. They seemed more focused today in the room, and we all have the same sores. One of the women was breathing heavy. The guards opened the door, and I went in with the others. I took off the top of my jumpsuit because my sores started to hurt. Just the top, nothing more, because she was crying again, but I told her that it was ok, that I would take care of her. I asked a guard what her name was, and he told me to never ask again or he\u2019d shoot me. Her skin was feeling so soft, and she was so hot and welcoming. The others took the things the guards gave them, but I didn\u2019t want to, and they said ok.</p>\n<p>I whispered to her skin, and told her how much I cared, how I didn\u2019t mind about her stomach, I even kissed it to show her, just once, and so quick it was like it never happened, really. The skin was so tight and hot, it almost burned, but it was also kinda springy, and she moaned when I did it, I think she appreciated me doing it, to show her I wasn\u2019t like those others. One of the guys hit her sort of hard on the mouth, and she started moaning louder, but it wasn\u2019t like the one she did for me, so I told him to stop. He shouted at me, and I curled up to her skin and told her not to worry while I felt her soft palm, and he tried to hit me and the guards pointed their guns at him. He went away, and I kept telling her I would make it better, and her little hands were so soft. The sores didn\u2019t feel so bad.</p>\n<p>They made us go away again while they cleaned her, and we went. one of the women suddenly stopped in the other room, and threw up all over. I went down the hall, because it smelled very bad, and there were squirming things in it and she started crying again. The guards took her back to her room because she didn\u2019t want to walk, and I could hear the girl on the bed moaning and screaming about something moving, and that it hurt so much. I tried to go back, but they made me leave too.</p>\n<p>I listened to her cry again, but it sounded softer. I think I am helping her. I felt good when I listened. I took off my jumpsuit, because the sores had gotten a little bigger, and the suit felt dirty. They look like kisses. I dreamed of her softness, of making her smile up at me.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>5-</p>\n<p>The marks are softer, and looking more pink. They feel more numb now, and they have some slick stuff on top. It tastes odd, but sweet and salty. I rubbed them a little and I felt that \u201csweet\u201d thing more. They have little blue veins around them. My skin feels soft, I like it, so I didn\u2019t put on my jumpsuit today. I didn\u2019t get any food out of the door today. I drank a lot of water, and rubbed some on my skin. When the water touches the sores, they pulse. The door opened, and I went down the hall. the walls felt funny, kinda rough on my skin. I got to the room and remembered I didn\u2019t have anything on, so I thought about going back to the room, but a couple of the others didn\u2019t have anything, so I thought it would be ok. The woman who threw up looked like she was half asleep, and her hair was nasty, so I didn\u2019t go near her. The others seem to have the same marks like me, but they complained about them, and the guards told them to shut up and opened the door.</p>\n<p>I covered myself with my hands so I wouldn\u2019t scare her, even though she is naked too, but I am a good person and don\u2019t want to make her feel confused or scared ever. I know I do that some times, and I didn\u2019t want to do that to her and the guards laughed at me. The others started to do things to her, but I didn\u2019t see them, I just saw her cute little lips, and I saw they where chapped, so I tried to find water to give her. They didn\u2019t have any, so it told her in her ear that I would find a way, and I felt her press her cheek against mine and I knew she was ok with it, so I licked my fingers and rubbed them on her lips, and then she opened her mouth and they went in, and her tongue was so soft and cool and she made me blush because I could tell how she really felt, even as she cried about the others, and I took my fingers back and put them in my mouth to clean them. Her hand was so warm.</p>\n<p>She started to scream and pull at the bed, and her belly started to shake, so I petted it and told her it would be ok, and I felt the skin move and gurgle, and I tried to kiss it to make it better, but she kept screaming and screaming. I was scared I did something, so I held her mouth and put my hand over it and told her I was sorry, I would never touch like that again ever, but she kept screaming and I was scared she would get me in trouble, so I tried to make her be quiet but the guards told me to stop and I just tried to block it out.</p>\n<p>One of the women started to scream too, and said she was stuck, and she started to thrash around and hit the girl\u2019s belly and that made her scream louder, and they both wouldn\u2019t stop screaming about the pain, and wanting it out, and her hand coming off, and I curled up under her bed and tried to make it go away, and then I heard some kind of wet noise and the woman screamed louder and then I think there was blood and she fell and then I went in to the dark.</p>\n<p>I woke up in my room. I think I had a bad dream while I was with Kate. She is Kate, I think, even if she isn\u2019t looking the same. Kate always loved me.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>6-</p>\n<p>I did not get any food, but I am ok. More water, lots of water, all over and in. I feel nice and warm, and my skin is soft and smooth. When I pull it, it stays up for a while. I made little peaks on my chest and laughed. Maybe I will show Kate my new trick. I am so glad they let me see her again. The little marks are red now, and they push in really far. the stuff inside is very sweet, I like it.</p>\n<p>The floor hurts now, it feels too hard, so I try to stay on the bed, but that is too rough. I miss Kate\u2019s skin, and she misses me too. I can hear her crying because I am away, and I try to cry but all that comes out is this milk, but I do anyway. She misses me so much, I can tell, and the others can be so mean to her, but I will help her, I can keep her safe, and she knows.<br/>\nThe door opened, and I tried to tiptoe down the hall because the floor is so hard. The woman from my dream was gone, and one of the men, so it was only three people. The other woman looks ugly, she has bags around her eyes and cheeks, and she seems mean and glares at me, so I keep away from her, and the man is quiet too, but I think he is blind because his eyes are funny. Kate was crying for me when the door opened, so I ran to her and her skin felt so good on mine I forgot about my feet and the blood on the floor and I kissed her on the lips because I was so excited, but I pulled back because I didn\u2019t want to scare her.</p>\n<p>She was ok, and she moaned and leaned up so I kissed her again and again, and she said to stop and that she was scared, but she meant the other people because I am so gentle, and I told them to stop scaring her, but the guards told me to shut up. I touched her belly and it pulled at my hand as I told her not to be scared and kissed her ear. She touched me and I leaned against her, and the marks moved as she cried and I told her I loved her, and she wasn\u2019t able to say it back because the people were making her moan and cry, but I know she feels it too. I love Kate, and I said I was sorry about before, when I made her cry, and made her mother get so mad at me, but it was ok and her skin made me hurt less and she felt so good.</p>\n<p>The other man told me to fuck off because it was his turn, and I told him not to say that around her, and she tried to crawl away from him and he touched her where he is not allowed, so I hit him really hard. My hand felt funny and didn\u2019t look right any more, but I was able to jump over and grab him and show Kate that I would not let him do that. I made his air stop and he tried to hurt me, but I wouldn\u2019t let him and I kept squeezing, and then he stopped and the guards made me let go, which was fine because Kate loves me and I kissed the places he touched to make them better.</p>\n<p>She started to scream again, and her belly moved a lot and she said she wanted it out, and I told her to calm down, that I would make it better, but she didn\u2019t listen and I had to hit her to make her stop, but it was ok because I kissed it better and she loves me. I love Kate. The guards made me leave her, and I tried to make them stop, but they were too strong and made me go. My marks are open now, and they like to pull at my fingers how Kate\u2019s mouth did. I like to think they are her, and I close my eyes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>7-</p>\n<p>I am so smooth, and I was able to take off some skin today, and it was nice and pink underneath and that is ok, because I don\u2019t want my skin, I want Kate\u2019s skin, I want her soft hands and face. The others are gone, and I was with Kate alone and I told her all the things I needed to, and we were together and her belly pulled at me and I stuck, and when I came away I left my skin like a gift, and now I am soft like her, and my teeth feel so soft and springy when I bite her.</p>\n<p>She loves whenever I touch her, and she barely screams, and when she does I help her stop but the guards make me stop and I scream at them too. I hate them but I love Kate.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>8-</p>\n<p>She wants me to be there, that is why it is so big, so I can stay there. she tried to put me there, but I was scared but I am not now and I love her forever. she is so hot inside, I will be safe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt>Documents recovered in Holding Cell 3 of the SCP-231 containment area.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n1-\n\n\n\nTransferred from the barracks, finally.\u00a0\u00a0The trip took forever, I\u2019d have to guess about six hours, but I couldn\u2019t see, and I fell asleep a few times, so I guess it really could be anything.\u00a0\u00a0Four other people on the transport as well, two other men and two women.\u00a0\u00a0At least I think so, one of the guys never really talked, but I think it\u2019s a he.\u00a0\u00a0Still sore from getting jabbed by a guard, I fell and he really stabbed me with his gun muzzle.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, we\u2019re here now.\u00a0\u00a0I assume \u201cwe\u201d are, at least.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m in my own little room, I\u2019m just assuming everyone else is as well.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s better than the barracks, and a ton better then the cell.\u00a0\u00a0Still, it has that feel, where you know nobody really stays here for long, like the vibe you get off a shitty hotel room.\n\n\n\nThis is not my diary, at least not the \u201cofficial\u201d one I\u2019m supposed to keep.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m actually under my cot, writing this and then stuffing it in to the hollow leg of the bed frame.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m sure they can see me, but it makes me feel better to have a secret.\u00a0\u00a0I haven\u2019t had any in a long time, and it makes me feel less like a toy.\u00a0\u00a0Security is so tight here, I\u2019ve never seen so many guns and helmets.\u00a0\u00a0They even have this special suit for the five of us, and some of the doctors and stuff.\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s this really weird atmosphere here, really\u2026bleak.\n\n\n\n------\n\n2-\n\n\n\nNothing today.\u00a0\u00a0Food comes in through a slot in the door.\u00a0\u00a0Not bad, really, seems like it has something in it, has kind of a weird iron taste to it.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t really get what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Leave it to the government to keep you guessing, even when you really don\u2019t care any more.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s odd, the walls seem pretty thick, but the one the door is in seems thinner.\u00a0\u00a0I can hear some banging around some times, and crying.\u00a0\u00a0lots of crying.\u00a0\u00a0I listened at the door a while, seeing if I could guess who it was.\u00a0\u00a0It was those one sobs\u2026you know the crying a kid makes, when they know they are hurt and don\u2019t understand why?\u00a0\u00a0just that empty, hopeless weeping.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to go and pet that kid, let them know it\u2019s ok, that I\u2026yeah.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I heard some other stuff, just kind of muffled bumping, then the crying suddenly changed to this\u2026gurgling noise, sounded like they were choking, or\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped, and started just walking around my room.\u00a0\u00a0I went to listen again after a bit, and it was silent.\n\n\n\nThought about Kate today, which I haven\u2019t done in awhile.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if they allow visiting hours here.\u00a0\u00a0If they do, I think I\u2019m going to call her.\u00a0\u00a0She might want to visit me now, or even forgive me.\u00a0\u00a0I miss her, oddly enough.\u00a0\u00a0I still have the scar on my cheek from where she cut me, but I do miss her, in a way.\n\n\n\n------\n\n3-\n\n\n\nI am not sure where I am, but it is not a jail.\u00a0\u00a0I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s any part of the government either.\u00a0\u00a0My door opened today.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, just suddenly slid open.\u00a0\u00a0There was a little hall, and another doorway at the other end.\u00a0\u00a0A voice suddenly came from somewhere, and told me to go to the end of the hall.\u00a0\u00a0I walked out, the walls felt like some kind of tile, smooth and grey.\u00a0\u00a0I heard other people, faintly, and that crying was a lot louder.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I came out the doorway at the end, and there was a guy in this storm trooper-looking outfit, all black with this smooth black helmet, and he shoved me in to this open room.\u00a0\u00a0There were two other armored guys, and pretty soon the other four people from the transport came in from other halls, all wearing the same jumpsuit things as me.\u00a0\u00a0There was this big, steel door at the other end of the room, and the crying seemed to be coming from behind it.\n\n\n\nThe three armored guys told us to listen to their commands at all times, and that if we didn\u2019t, we\u2019d be shot immediately.\u00a0\u00a0One of the women from the transport started to cry too, and I tried to go back down the hall, but they grabbed me and pulled me back.\u00a0\u00a0One opened the door, and the crying got really loud.\u00a0\u00a0They told me that we all had to do what they told us, or we would be shot.\u00a0\u00a0He had a gun to my head, I could feel the metal, it was very cold.\u00a0\u00a0He said he would kill me.\n\n\n\nIt was a hospital room behind the door, kinda.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of medical stuff, but other things, too.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, it was not hospital stuff, like belts and balls, straps.\u00a0\u00a0There was a big gurney bed in the middle of the room, with all these tubes and stuff, and machines\u2026\n\n\n\nShe was on it.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t know how old she is, I could barely see her face over her\u2026I don\u2019t even know if it was her belly.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is, but it was so\u2026bulbous, and swollen and the skin seemed like it was too thin.\u00a0\u00a0But she was so\u2026pretty, and smooth, but she kept crying, and saying to take it out, that it hurt, that we need to take it out.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting scared, but the guards pushed me and the others closer, and they started telling us what we had to do.\n\n\n\nThe woman who had started crying freaked out, and one of the guard hit her with the butt of his rifle.\u00a0\u00a0I was so scared.\u00a0\u00a0They said we had to, that we had to do this.\u00a0\u00a0I felt a shotgun in my back, I could hear him pump the slide.\u00a0\u00a0I had to.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t have any choice, not any of us.\u00a0\u00a0She noticed us, and started screaming, but one of the guys put a hand over her mouth, hard.\u00a0\u00a0I touched her.\u00a0\u00a0She felt like she had a fever, but she was so smooth and soft.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to ignore the others, and that big\u2026thing on her, and just see her hand, her little hand, and kiss it, show her I cared\u2026\n\n\n\nShe screamed a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t get excited, even when the quiet guy from the transport did\u2026things with her.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0Afterward, one of the guards made us all leave while they wiped her down, and we went back to our cells.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody really talked or looked at each other.\u00a0\u00a0She has such soft hands.\n\n\n\n------\n\n4-\n\n\n\nI woke up screaming on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t remember what I dreamed.\u00a0\u00a0I have sores on my face and hands, and other places.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re red and really tender.\u00a0\u00a0I got scared, and the voice came on, told me that it was normal to get the sores, that I would be fine.\u00a0\u00a0They look nasty, kind of soft and pulsing a little, but they don\u2019t really hurt.\u00a0\u00a0They actually\u2026I don\u2019t know how to describe it.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s like a sore tooth, it hurts, but then when you push it, it changes and has this \u201csweet\u201d to it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe door opened today, and I went down the hall, with the others.\u00a0\u00a0They seemed more focused today in the room, and we all have the same sores.\u00a0\u00a0One of the women was breathing heavy.\u00a0\u00a0The guards opened the door, and I went in with the others.\u00a0\u00a0I took off the top of my jumpsuit because my sores started to hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Just the top, nothing more, because she was crying again, but I told her that it was ok, that I would take care of her.\u00a0\u00a0I asked a guard what her name was, and he told me to never ask again or he\u2019d shoot me.\u00a0\u00a0Her skin was feeling so soft, and she was so hot and welcoming.\u00a0\u00a0The others took the things the guards gave them, but I didn\u2019t want to, and they said ok. \n\n\n\n\u00a0I whispered to her skin, and told her how much I cared, how I didn\u2019t mind about her stomach, I even kissed it to show her, just once, and so quick it was like it never happened, really.\u00a0\u00a0The skin was so tight and hot, it almost burned, but it was also kinda springy, and she moaned when I did it, I think she appreciated me doing it, to show her I wasn\u2019t like those others.\u00a0\u00a0One of the guys hit her sort of hard on the mouth, and she started moaning louder, but it wasn\u2019t like the one she did for me, so I told him to stop.\u00a0\u00a0He shouted at me, and I curled up to her skin and told her not to worry while I felt her soft palm, and he tried to hit me and the guards pointed their guns at him.\u00a0\u00a0He went away, and I kept telling her I would make it better, and her little hands were so soft.\u00a0\u00a0The sores didn\u2019t feel so bad.\n\n\n\nThey made us go away again while they cleaned her, and we went.\u00a0\u00a0one of the women suddenly stopped in the other room, and threw up all over.\u00a0\u00a0I went down the hall, because it smelled very bad, and there were squirming things in it and she started crying again.\u00a0\u00a0The guards took her back to her room because she didn\u2019t want to walk, and I could hear the girl on the bed moaning and screaming about something moving, and that it hurt so much.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to go back, but they made me leave too.\n\n\n\nI listened to her cry again, but it sounded softer.\u00a0\u00a0I think I am helping her.\u00a0\u00a0I felt good when I listened.\u00a0\u00a0I took off my jumpsuit, because the sores had gotten a little bigger, and the suit felt dirty.\u00a0\u00a0They look like kisses.\u00a0\u00a0I dreamed of her softness, of making her smile up at me.\n\n\n\n------\n\n5-\n\n\n\nThe marks are softer, and looking more pink.\u00a0\u00a0They feel more numb now, and they have some slick stuff on top.\u00a0\u00a0It tastes odd, but sweet and salty.\u00a0\u00a0I rubbed them a little and I felt that \u201csweet\u201d thing more.\u00a0\u00a0They have little blue veins around them.\u00a0\u00a0My skin feels soft, I like it, so I didn\u2019t put on my jumpsuit today.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t get any food out of the door today.\u00a0\u00a0I drank a lot of water, and rubbed some on my skin.\u00a0\u00a0When the water touches the sores, they pulse.\u00a0\u00a0The door opened, and I went down the hall.\u00a0\u00a0the walls felt funny, kinda rough on my skin.\u00a0\u00a0I got to the room and remembered I didn\u2019t have anything on, so I thought about going back to the room, but a couple of the others didn\u2019t have anything, so I thought it would be ok.\u00a0\u00a0The woman who threw up looked like she was half asleep, and her hair was nasty, so I didn\u2019t go near her.\u00a0\u00a0The others seem to have the same marks like me, but they complained about them, and the guards told them to shut up and opened the door.\n\n\n\nI covered myself with my hands so I wouldn\u2019t scare her, even though she is naked too, but I am a good person and don\u2019t want to make her feel confused or scared ever.\u00a0\u00a0I know I do that some times, and I didn\u2019t want to do that to her and the guards laughed at me.\u00a0\u00a0The others started to do things to her, but I didn\u2019t see them, I just saw her cute little lips, and I saw they where chapped, so I tried to find water to give her.\u00a0\u00a0They didn\u2019t have any, so it told her in her ear that I would find a way, and I felt her press her cheek against mine and I knew she was ok with it, so I licked my fingers and rubbed them on her lips, and then she opened her mouth and they went in, and her tongue was so soft and cool and she made me blush because I could tell how she really felt, even as she cried about the others, and I took my fingers back and put them in my mouth to clean them.\u00a0\u00a0Her hand was so warm.\n\n\n\nShe started to scream and pull at the bed, and her belly started to shake, so I petted it and told her it would be ok, and I felt the skin move and gurgle, and I tried to kiss it to make it better, but she kept screaming and screaming.\u00a0\u00a0I was scared I did something, so I held her mouth and put my hand over it and told her I was sorry, I would never touch like that again ever, but she kept screaming and I was scared she would get me in trouble, so I tried to make her be quiet but the guards told me to stop and I just tried to block it out.\n\n\n\nOne of the women started to scream too, and said she was stuck, and she started to thrash around and hit the girl\u2019s belly and that made her scream louder, and they both wouldn\u2019t stop screaming about the pain, and wanting it out, and her hand coming off, and I curled up under her bed and tried to make it go away, and then I heard some kind of wet noise and the woman screamed louder and then I think there was blood and she fell and then I went in to the dark.\n\n\n\nI woke up in my room.\u00a0\u00a0I think I had a bad dream while I was with Kate.\u00a0\u00a0She is Kate, I think, even if she isn\u2019t looking the same.\u00a0\u00a0Kate always loved me.\n\n\n\n------\n\n6-\n\n\n\nI did not get any food, but I am ok.\u00a0\u00a0More water, lots of water, all over and in.\u00a0\u00a0I feel nice and warm, and my skin is soft and smooth.\u00a0\u00a0When I pull it, it stays up for a while.\u00a0\u00a0I made little peaks on my chest and laughed.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I will show Kate my new trick.\u00a0\u00a0I am so glad they let me see her again.\u00a0\u00a0The little marks are red now, and they push in really far.\u00a0\u00a0the stuff inside is very sweet, I like it.\n\n\n\nThe floor hurts now, it feels too hard, so I try to stay on the bed, but that is too rough.\u00a0\u00a0I miss Kate\u2019s skin, and she misses me too.\u00a0\u00a0I can hear her crying because I am away, and I try to cry but all that comes out is this milk, but I do anyway.\u00a0\u00a0She misses me so much, I can tell, and the others can be so mean to her, but I will help her, I can keep her safe, and she knows.\n\nThe door opened, and I tried to tiptoe down the hall because the floor is so hard.\u00a0\u00a0The woman from my dream was gone, and one of the men, so it was only three people.\u00a0\u00a0The other woman looks ugly, she has bags around her eyes and cheeks, and she seems mean and glares at me, so I keep away from her, and the man is quiet too, but I think he is blind because his eyes are funny.\u00a0\u00a0Kate was crying for me when the door opened, so I ran to her and her skin felt so good on mine I forgot about my feet and the blood on the floor and I kissed her on the lips because I was so excited, but I pulled back because I didn\u2019t want to scare her.\n\n\n\nShe was ok, and she moaned and leaned up so I kissed her again and again, and she said to stop and that she was scared, but she meant the other people because I am so gentle, and I told them to stop scaring her, but the guards told me to shut up.\u00a0\u00a0I touched her belly and it pulled at my hand as I told her not to be scared and kissed her ear.\u00a0\u00a0She touched me and I leaned against her, and the marks moved as she cried and I told her I loved her, and she wasn\u2019t able to say it back because the people were making her moan and cry, but I know she feels it too.\u00a0\u00a0I love Kate, and I said I was sorry about before, when I made her cry, and made her mother get so mad at me, but it was ok and her skin made me hurt less and she felt so good.\n\n\n\nThe other man told me to fuck off because it was his turn, and I told him not to say that around her, and she tried to crawl away from him and he touched her where he is not allowed, so I hit him really hard.\u00a0\u00a0My hand felt funny and didn\u2019t look right any more, but I was able to jump over and grab him and show Kate that I would not let him do that.\u00a0\u00a0I made his air stop and he tried to hurt me, but I wouldn\u2019t let him and I kept squeezing, and then he stopped and the guards made me let go, which was fine because Kate loves me and I kissed the places he touched to make them better.\n\n\n\nShe started to scream again, and her belly moved a lot and she said she wanted it out, and I told her to calm down, that I would make it better, but she didn\u2019t listen and I had to hit her to make her stop, but it was ok because I kissed it better and she loves me.\u00a0\u00a0I love Kate.\u00a0\u00a0The guards made me leave her, and I tried to make them stop, but they were too strong and made me go.\u00a0\u00a0My marks are open now, and they like to pull at my fingers how Kate\u2019s mouth did.\u00a0\u00a0I like to think they are her, and I close my eyes.\n\n\n\n------\n\n7-\n\n\n\nI am so smooth, and I was able to take off some skin today, and it was nice and pink underneath and that is ok, because I don\u2019t want my skin, I want Kate\u2019s skin, I want her soft hands and face.\u00a0\u00a0The others are gone, and I was with Kate alone and I told her all the things I needed to, and we were together and her belly pulled at me and I stuck, and when I came away I left my skin like a gift, and now I am soft like her, and my teeth feel so soft and springy when I bite her.\n\n\n\nShe loves whenever I touch her, and she barely screams, and when she does I help her stop but the guards make me stop and I scream at them too.\u00a0\u00a0I hate them but I love Kate.\n\n\n\n------\n\n8-\n\n\n\nShe wants me to be there, that is why it is so big, so I can stay there.\u00a0\u00a0she tried to put me there, but I was scared but I am not now and I love her forever.\u00a0\u00a0she is so hot inside, I will be safe.\n\n\n\n> {{Documents recovered in Holding Cell 3 of the SCP-231 containment area.\u00a0\u00a0No correlation to the above events have

Though the Foundation never slept, most of its workers did. The majority of the site staff was either back at their homes, or in on-site housing facilities. Of course, there was still a night shift, but it was a skeleton crew compared to the regular day shift. It was just security and custodial staff, with the odd researcher or two who ended up on a doctor\u2019s bad side. The cafeteria itself was run by a single galley chef, whose only job at this hour was to cater to anybody craving a midnight snack.</p>\n<p>However, tonight was different. In the far corner of the room sat four individuals, laughing (well, three of them, anyway) and drinking. Yes, alcohol was strictly prohibited on-site for a variety of reasons. However, it was a rule that was widely ignored for a variety of reasons. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if there was anybody around to call them out on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, Dr. Ryan.\u201d Agent Williams smiled as he took a sip of cheap beer. The young agent was leaning back in his chair as if he didn't have a care in the world. \u201cAs of two minutes ago, you are officially no longer in the employ of the Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Dr. Adrian Ryan yawned. Already pushing sixty, Dr. Ryan was in no condition to stay up late, much less keep up with the everyday demands of Foundation employment. \u201cAfter having to deal with XK end-of-the-world scenarios every other day, it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s officially somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd as per standard operating procedure, you\u2019ll have to submit to one last search in order to ensure you\u2019re not bringing any of your research or any materials that can be traced back to the Foundation,\u201d Agent Richards said in a business-like manner, the harsh stare of her purple eyes contrasting sharply with her pale white skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, there you go, spoiling the mood again.\u201d MTF Sergeant Ronald Paccone laughed. He was a grizzled old veteran with unshaven stubble on his chin and hair that was already beginning to grey. \u201cGive the guy a break, he\u2019s finally moving on in life.\u201d</p>\n<p>As with everything in existence, all good things had to come to an end. For Dr. Ryan, after thirty years of groundbreaking research, averting the apocalypse, and witnessing things no human can truly comprehend, he was finally going to leave it all behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m curious.\u201d Williams leaned forward in his seat. \u201cWhat exactly are you planning to do now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I'll probably go into teaching.\u201d Ryan grinned. \u201cWith the references and job history the Foundation set me up with, I\u2019m already getting quite a few offers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Williams nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that I think about it, what are you three planning to do?\u201d Ryan asked curiously. \u201cI know of several colleagues who are in teaching and research positions now, but I never heard of any Agents or MTF operatives retiring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Paccone\u2019s smile instantly wore away. Williams' remained, but it was obvious that it had lost its warmth and friendliness. Richards, however, kept her usual stoic and cold demeanor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d Ryan was confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell Doctor, it\u2019s an issue that those in our circles never quite want to talk about.\u201d Williams sighed. \u201cEspecially people like us. Do you have any family?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, yes. My wife, three kids, and I have grandchildren on the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019re going to spend your newfound free time with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ryan said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, there\u2019s the difference that lies between you and us,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cYou have the luxury of having a life outside of the Foundation, something to go back to when you decide to call it quits. However, we\u2019re not quite so fortunate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, let me explain.\u201d Williams took one last swig from his cup. \u201cFirst off, there are the doctors, the researchers, and the support staff. People like you. You\u2019re the kind of people the Foundation will try and recruit, because it needs you. Now, 90% of you will accept out of a variety of reasons. Maybe for the money, maybe because of a genuine interest in what you study, or maybe for the chance to make that one discovery that will redefine the concept of human existence. Either way, you have choices, options. Most of the time, you\u2019re already settled, have a family, and have a regular job at some university or research firm. Sure, some doctors are required to cut ties with their families, but they\u2019re more the exception than the rule. Most of these guys work their eight hour shifts and then head straight home. They go to church on Sundays, walk their dogs, and curse at the morning commute. In other words, they have lives outside the Foundation.</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, some Agents and MTFs like us are in the Foundation because honestly, we have no other alternative. Do you know why we\u2019re called \u2018lifers\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause no matter how you put it, we\u2019re stuck in the Foundation.\u201d Williams glanced at Richards and Paccone. \u201cWe don\u2019t have families, or rather, we don\u2019t care about them or are forced to leave them behind. Agent Richards here, before she was recruited, lost her whole family after a nasty little run in with a certain SCP.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a brief second, Agent Richards looked away and Ryan thought that he could see a hint of sadness and pain in her expression. However, the moment passed as quickly as it appeared.</p>\n<p>\"Sergeant Paccone here joined up in the days where it was SOP to fake the deaths of MTF recruits, for secrecy reasons. Well, we don't do that nearly as often these days for obvious reasons. He had to leave behind wife and kid, who even now think he's buried in Arlington with a silver star and the posthumous rank of Major. Remember that crazy Russian guy?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think he was Ukrainian\u2026 or Chechen,\" Paccone said glumly.</p>\n<p>\"Whatever. Either way, he was a goddamn ticking time bomb. It's not a good idea to recruit a guy with so much personal baggage and cut off the remaining contact he has with the outside. It's just not good business.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good to know you think I'm going to snap and kill everybody in the room at any time,\" Paccone joked.</p>\n<p>\"Ah no, that's probably something Richards would do,\" Williams deadpanned, earning a glare from Richards.</p>\n<p>\"Just because I actually take my job seriously and understand the stakes of failure doesn't make me mentally unstable,\" Richards coolly replied.</p>\n<p>\"Oh?\" Williams continued, \u201cOn that note, even if Richards does retire, where will she go? Who will take her in? The only people she knows outside the Foundation are a bunch of distant cousins who\u2019ve never even heard of her before. Not to mention, she\u2019s the only person I know of that actually <em>volunteers</em> for Keter duty. She doesn\u2019t even take Class As for SCP-231, and that is just <em>fucked up</em>. Hey Richards, how many times have you pulled 231 duty? Five, six times?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEight,\u201d Richards replied humorlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you honestly believe that a person like Agent Richards can just reintegrate into society like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mouth gaping, Ryan could only manage to shake his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not. She may as well be a D-Class in terms with how she would fit in society.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the comparison,\u201d Richards remarked sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to mention,\u201d Paccone added, \u201cthe skills we know and are recruited for can\u2019t be transferred to civilian life so easily. You worked on stuff like SCP-514 and SCP-204. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going into a biology-related field?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ryan blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, what\u2019s an old guy like me going to do? I\u2019ve been in the combat business for twenty five years now, fifteen in the Marines and ten in the Foundation. I\u2019m too old to reenlist into any other armed service or law enforcement agency. My only useful job skill is knowing how to kill a man 72 different ways unarmed and clearing an apartment block with an empty M16. Do you think there\u2019s anywhere out there that will provide me with a good, honest lifestyle?</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I see it, there\u2019s only three ways out of the Foundation for people like us. We\u2019ll either take the red pill and live a life of blissful ignorance, die in a ditch alone, or go out in a blaze of glory. There\u2019s no Foundation Retirement Home for us. As for me, well, I\u2019m not getting any younger. My physical abilities aren\u2019t getting any better with age, and I\u2019m going to have to face that dilemma sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re also the ones that get stuck doing the Foundation\u2019s dirty work,\u201d Williams added. \u201cDo you honestly think that the O5s will let us just waltz out? We\u2019re the military elite with in-depth knowledge of all of the Foundation\u2019s covert military operations. It\u2019s either a Class A amnestic or a bullet to the head, depending on which is more convenient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullets are cheaper,\u201d Richards coldly remarked.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe should know.\u201d Paccone laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s the Foundation\u2019s unofficial retirement policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs\u2026 is there <em>any</em> hope for you?\u201d Ryan gaped.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Williams frowned. \u201cAll three of us have our reasons for staying in the Foundation, and we\u2019ve paid the price. Oh yes, there are some gems of hope scattered here and there among our younger members. Maybe they won\u2019t repeat the same mistakes we did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s to them, then.\u201d Ryan raised his glass, now suddenly a bit more subdued.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a happy retirement, Dr. Ryan.\u201d Williams smiled and raised his glass as well. \u201cI hope you never see any of us again.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/retirement-policy\">Retirement Policy</a>\" by SpoonOfEvil, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

In the far corner of the room sat four individuals, laughing (well, three of them, anyway) and drinking. Yes, alcohol was strictly prohibited on-site for a variety of reasons. However, it was a rule that was widely ignored for a variety of reasons. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if there was anybody around to call them out on it.\n\n\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Dr. Ryan.\u201d Agent Williams smiled as he took a sip of cheap beer. The young agent was leaning back in his chair as if he didn't have a care in the world. \u201cAs of two minutes ago, you are officially no longer in the employ of the Foundation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood to know.\u201d Dr. Adrian Ryan yawned. Already pushing sixty, Dr. Ryan was in no condition to stay up late, much less keep up with the everyday demands of Foundation employment. \u201cAfter having to deal with XK end-of-the-world scenarios every other day, it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s officially somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd as per standard operating procedure, you\u2019ll have to submit to one last search in order to ensure you\u2019re not bringing any of your research or any materials that can be traced back to the Foundation,\u201d Agent Richards said in a business-like manner, the harsh stare of her purple eyes contrasting sharply with her pale white skin.\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, there you go, spoiling the mood again.\u201d MTF Sergeant Ronald Paccone laughed. He was a grizzled old veteran with unshaven stubble on his chin and hair that was already beginning to grey. \u201cGive the guy a break, he\u2019s finally moving on in life.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs with everything in existence, all good things had to come to an end. For Dr. Ryan, after thirty years of groundbreaking research, averting the apocalypse, and witnessing things no human can truly comprehend, he was finally going to leave it all behind. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m curious.\u201d Williams leaned forward in his seat. \u201cWhat exactly are you planning to do now?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I'll probably go into teaching.\u201d Ryan grinned. \u201cWith the references and job history the Foundation set me up with, I\u2019m already getting quite a few offers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Williams nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow that I think about it, what are you three planning to do?\u201d Ryan asked curiously. \u201cI know of several colleagues who are in teaching and research positions now, but I never heard of any Agents or MTF operatives retiring.\u201d\n\n\n\nPaccone\u2019s smile instantly wore away. Williams' remained, but it was obvious that it had lost its warmth and friendliness. Richards, however, kept her usual stoic and cold demeanor.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d Ryan was confused.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell Doctor, it\u2019s an issue that those in our circles never quite want to talk about.\u201d Williams sighed. \u201cEspecially people like us. Do you have any family?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy, yes. My wife, three kids, and I have grandchildren on the way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019re going to spend your newfound free time with them?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Ryan said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cSee, there\u2019s the difference that lies between you and us,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cYou have the luxury of having a life outside of the Foundation, something to go back to when you decide to call it quits. However, we\u2019re not quite so fortunate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, let me explain.\u201d Williams took one last swig from his cup. \u201cFirst off, there are the doctors, the researchers, and the support staff. People like you. You\u2019re the kind of people the Foundation will try and recruit, because it needs you. Now, 90% of you will accept out of a variety of reasons. Maybe for the money, maybe because of a genuine interest in what you study, or maybe for the chance to make that one discovery that will redefine the concept of human existence. Either way, you have choices, options. Most of the time, you\u2019re already settled, have a family, and have a regular job at some university or research firm. Sure, some doctors are required to cut ties with their families, but they\u2019re more the exception than the rule. Most of these guys work their eight hour shifts and then head straight home. They go to church on Sundays, walk their dogs, and curse at the morning commute. In other words, they have lives outside the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, some Agents and MTFs like us are in the Foundation because honestly, we have no other alternative. Do you know why we\u2019re called \u2018lifers\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause no matter how you put it, we\u2019re stuck in the Foundation.\u201d Williams glanced at Richards and Paccone. \u201cWe don\u2019t have families, or rather, we don\u2019t care about them or are forced to leave them behind. Agent Richards here, before she was recruited, lost her whole family after a nasty little run in with a certain SCP.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor a brief second, Agent Richards looked away and Ryan thought that he could see a hint of sadness and pain in her expression. However, the moment passed as quickly as it appeared.\n\n\n\n\"Sergeant Paccone here joined up in the days where it was SOP to fake the deaths of MTF recruits, for secrecy reasons. Well, we don't do that nearly as often these days for obvious reasons. He had to leave behind wife and kid, who even now think he's buried in Arlington with a silver star and the posthumous rank of Major. Remember that crazy Russian guy?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think he was Ukrainian... or Chechen,\" Paccone said glumly.\n\n\n\n\"Whatever. Either way, he was a goddamn ticking time bomb. It's not a good idea to recruit a guy with so much personal baggage and cut off the remaining contact he has with the outside. It's just not good business.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good to know you think I'm going to snap and kill everybody in the room at any time,\" Paccone joked.\n\n\n\n\"Ah no, that's probably something Richards would do,\" Williams deadpanned, earning a glare from Richards.\n\n\n\n\"Just because I actually take my job seriously and understand the stakes of failure doesn't make me mentally unstable,\" Richards coolly replied.\n\n\n\n\"Oh?\" Williams continued, \u201cOn that note, even if Richards does retire, where will she go? Who will take her in? The only people she knows outside the Foundation are a bunch of distant cousins who\u2019ve never even heard of her before. Not to mention, she\u2019s the only person I know of that actually //volunteers// for Keter duty. She doesn\u2019t even take Class As for SCP-231, and that is just //fucked up//. Hey Richards, how many times have you pulled 231 duty? Five, six times?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEight,\u201d Richards replied humorlessly.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan you honestly believe that a person like Agent Richards can just reintegrate into society like that?\u201d\n\n\n\nMouth gaping, Ryan could only manage to shake his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course not. She may as well be a D-Class in terms with how she would fit in society.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks for the comparison,\u201d Richards remarked sarcastically.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot to mention,\u201d Paccone added, \u201cthe skills we know and are recruited for can\u2019t be transferred to civilian life so easily. You worked on stuff like SCP-514 and SCP-204. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going into a biology-related field?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ryan blinked.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, what\u2019s an old guy like me going to do? I\u2019ve been in the combat business for twenty five years now, fifteen in the Marines and ten in the Foundation. I\u2019m too old to reenlist into any other armed service or law enforcement agency. My only useful job skill is knowing how to kill a man 72 different ways unarmed and clearing an apartment block with an empty M16. Do you think there\u2019s anywhere out there that will provide me with a good, honest lifestyle?\n\n\n\n\u201cAs I see it, there\u2019s only three ways out of the Foundation for people like us. We\u2019ll either take the red pill and live a life of blissful ignorance, die in a ditch alone, or go out in a blaze of glory. There\u2019s no Foundation Retirement Home for us. As for me, well, I\u2019m not getting any younger. My physical abilities aren\u2019t getting any better with age, and I\u2019m going to have to face that dilemma sooner or later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also the ones that get stuck doing the Foundation\u2019s dirty work,\u201d Williams added. \u201cDo you honestly think that the O5s will let us just waltz out? We\u2019re the military elite with in-depth knowledge of all of the Foundation\u2019s covert military operations. It\u2019s either a Class A amnestic or a bullet to the head, depending on which is more convenient.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBullets are cheaper,\u201d Richards coldly remarked. \n\n\n\n\u201cShe should know.\u201d Paccone laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s the Foundation\u2019s unofficial retirement policy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs\u2026 is there //any// hope for you?\u201d Ryan gaped.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Williams frowned. \u201cAll three of us have our reasons for staying in the Foundation, and we\u2019ve paid the price. Oh yes, there are some gems of hope scattered here and there among our younger members. Maybe they won\u2019t repeat the same mistakes we did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s to them, then.\u201d Ryan raised his glass, now suddenly a bit more subdued. \n\n\n\n\u201cHave a happy retirement, Dr. Ryan.\u201d Williams smiled and raised his glass as well. \u201cI hope you never see any of us again.\u201d\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "bureaucracy", "featured", "military-fiction", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Retirement Policy - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/retirement-policy", "year": 2009}, "routine-psychological-evaluations-by-dr-glass": {"created_at": "2009-02-10T18:47:00", "creator": "Pair Of Ducks", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-10T18:47:00"}, {"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-10T18:49:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T05:41:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T05:42:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T06:20:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T14:08:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T17:05:00"}, {"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T17:24:00"}, {"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-11T17:25:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-12T16:25:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-12T16:49:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-12T16:59:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-13T17:12:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "NARCISSISM.", "date": "2009-03-19T08:33:00"}, {"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "", "date": "2009-06-04T01:27:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-04T03:13:00"}, {"author": "Bland", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bland", "comment": "Capitalization.", "date": "2012-01-22T22:15:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Dr. Alto Clef -\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** [Subject hands Dr. Glass a ukelele]\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** ... Very well. Dr. [With some difficulty strums an A major chord] let us begin this interview.\u00a0\u00a0If you could please remove those cinnamon rolls from-\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** Twists.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Pardon?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** These are cinnamon twists, not rolls.\u00a0\u00a0Do you want one?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Oh. Do you have any not in your nose?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** No.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Well then, no thank you. Let's take a look at - oh lord, who let him bring a shotgun in here?\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Glass:** So, Agent Diogenes, h-how's it going?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Diogenes:** I'm fine, but I'm wondering why I need a psych evaluation every week.\u00a0\u00a0Most people only do theirs once a month.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Right right, so, listen, what are you doing Saturday night?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Diogenes:** Uhm...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** W-well, uhm, do you like hiking?\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Director Ghost:** Small, slow circles. Trust me, she'll love it.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass: [Taking notes]:** wait, with my tongue or hands?\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** Alright, so then, he stumbles on some entrails, and I manage to catch up to him.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Ahuh...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kondraki:** So I shoot his fucking face off, bam, just like that. Brains everywhere, oh man it was great.\u00a0\u00a0That D-Class with me was bawling like a baby!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** That's your -favorite- memory of working for the Foundation?\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Glass:** And how did that make you feel?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rights:** Like killing him! I mean, there I was, all ready and willing for sex, and he buys a video game? It was just so, so-\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Agatha, please put that lamp down. Agatha... Security, Security to exam room A!\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Gears:** ...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** This isn't that hard, just tell me what you see, anything at all.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:** ...I see a symmetrical inkblot, comprised of what appears to be Black #4 ink.\u00a0\u00a0The paper is folded in the middle, leading to the conclusion that it is a Rorschach, or \"ink blot\", test.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** ...Ok...but do you see any shapes?\u00a0\u00a0Like a butterfly, or a ocean, people, anything at all?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:** No.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Are you sure?\u00a0\u00a0It looked like you might have saw something there for a second...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Gears:** No.\u00a0\u00a0I see a collection of black, abstract shapes.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** ...Okay...we can try something else now...just...stop staring at me like that...\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Glass:** . . . \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** . . .\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** So. . . what shall we talk. . . \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** I've been kind of thinking about killing everyone in the base.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** . . . what?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** Nothing.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** I thought you said you were thinking about killing everyone in the base. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** Are you kidding me? I never said that. Why would I say I sometimes think I'm going to wake up one morning, take my straight razor out of its jar of blue disinfectant, cut my assistant's throat, and then run through the halls of the base naked slashing anyone who gets in my way? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** You. . . you just said it again!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** Said what? Are you feeling all right, Dr. Glass? You look pale.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** You just threatened to brutally murder myself and everyone in the base!?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** No I didn't.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Glass:** Yes you did! I'll play it back, listen!\n\n> \n\n> <Sound of a tape recorder being played back>\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** Really?

You just said. . .\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Clef:** You know, Dr. Glass, auditory hallucinations are often caused by overwork and stress.

At least the inspection was free.\n\n\n\n//scritch scritch scritch//\n\n\n\nFucking hell, it\u2019s still there. I borrowed some plastic sealing spray from one of my neighbors. I\u2019m not sure how he happened to have several cans of the stuff lying around, it just seems to be a bit too convenient. From the way he acted, it looked as if this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done something like this. Maybe\u2026?\n\n\n\nNah, just my imagination.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep that night.

Glancing around to see that no one was watching, he pulled out the wallet he'd snatched mid-tackle from the gunman in the catacombs and began flipping through it. It contained only a small amount of cash, a hotel key, and a driver's license, along with a black plastic credit card, unlabeled but for a silver logo bearing the initials MC&amp;D.

Clearly, these were not men to be trifled with.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "action", "archived", "chase", "crime-fiction", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "tale"], "title": "Shoulda' Stayed in Dubai - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shoulda-stayed-in-dubai", "year": 2009}, "shuffle-tick-tick": {"created_at": "2009-08-06T13:27:00", "creator": "DrMagnus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrMagnus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drmagnus", "comment": "", "date": "2009-08-06T13:27:00"}, {"author": "DrMagnus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drmagnus", "comment": "", "date": "2009-08-06T13:29:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2009-08-06T13:31:00"}, {"author": "DrMagnus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drmagnus", "comment": "", "date": "2009-08-06T13:34:00"}, {"author": "DrMagnus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drmagnus", "comment": "", "date": "2009-08-06T14:09:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

I'm in a dark tunnel, and I hear a noise behind me. It's quiet, faint. It always draws closer. Shuffle tick tick. Shuffle Tick Tick. Such an innocuous sound, but the slow creeping of it towards me terrifies me. I run as fast as I can away from the sound, panting, gasping for air. The tunnel echoes, and I hear it getting closer. I wake up, just as it reaches me.</p>\n<p>Another night passes with the same nightmare. My eyes shoot open, and I'm in my bedroom, nothing special. I look over at the window, and sigh. It's bright out this morning. I smile, the terrors of the night banished once more. I make breakfast for my son and myself, put on my suit, got in my car. I checked my mirrors, no big deal, but I swear I could hear the sound behind me, shuffle tick tick. I snap my head towards the sound, and see my neighbor sweeping her driveway. I have a little chuckle. It's just a dream, and I'm getting paranoid over nothing.</p>\n<p>I pulled in to the office, and stepped out of my car. Another day of crunch for a web development company. We had to turn out a product soon, or we'd be in trouble. I took the elevator up to my office, and I heard the sound again\u2026shuffle tick tick. I looked around, and noticed one of the elevator buttons blinking. Must have just been a bulb popping. Nothing important.</p>\n<p>I sit down at my cubicle, and started working. Code segments, debugging, the usual. I put in a good four hours, before getting up to go to lunch.</p>\n<p>Lunch was good today for once; burger, fries, shake in the cafeteria. It was great, and I looked forward to picking up my son from school, having a quiet night in front of the tube or something. I turn off my computer, and walk out of the office. I hear a sound behind me though\u2026Shuffle Tick Tick. Shuffle Tick. Shuffle Tick. I turn around quickly, and see a blinking street light, making some kind of noises. I guess it was only my imagination. Maybe I should talk to my brother-in-law. He's a psychiatrist or something like that.</p>\n<p>I pick up Stephen, and take him home. I ask him about what he learned in school today. Division he says. Smart kid. I start to make dinner for the two of us. Chicken breast, broccoli spears, rice. I put Stephen to bed after watching the Raiders get thoroughly wrecked by the Steelers. Before he goes to sleep, I ask him if he's had any strange dreams lately. He told me he's only had dreams about me. I asked him what he meant, and he said that he was having dreams that daddy was a superhero. I smiled, and gave him a kiss on the forehead.<br/>\nChanging into a pair of shorts and a tee shirt, I slip under the covers, and fall asleep almost as soon as I hit the pillow.</p>\n<p>I'm in the dark tunnel. All I can hear behind me is Shuffle Tick Tick. Shuffle Tick Tick. But now, a new noise. A throaty growl, almost an animal sound. I break out into a run. The terror is a lump in my chest, and I can't run fast enough. The sound gets closer and closer, the echoes growing louder, and I hear an inhuman scream from behind me, and something crashes down on my back. I scream out in terror, and my eyes shoot open. I look around the room, and see nothing out of the ordinary. I rush to the bathroom, and throw up into the toilet. I'd never been so scared in my life. I look in the mirror, and for a moment I see almost a ghost of an image behind me in the mirror. I turn around, my hands up defensively, and see only the shower curtain behind me. Nerves. Just nerves.</p>\n<p>I can't shake the feeling of being watched. I quickly push Stephen to get into his uniform for school, and get into my car to go to work. He says something about breakfast, and I reach into my wallet, handing him a couple of bills. He could buy breakfast at School I think. I don't remember. I almost forgot my tie in the rush, but I strung one around my neck with shaking fingers. I hear from behind me\u2026Shuffle Tick Tick. Shuffle Tick Tick. I turn around, frantically searching for the sound. I see a kid carrying a trash bag, dragging it along the ground, and trying to tug it along every few seconds. I'm not crazy, just overworked, nothing to worry about. The crunch at work would be over soon, and we would return to the normal stress level.</p>\n<p>I drive to work quickly, above the speed limit. Something's following me, I'm sure of it. I get into the office, and hold my head in my hands. I hear a quiet shuffle, and look up, realizing its just the door opening. My friend John asks if I'm alright. I give him a shaky smile and try to temporize that I hadn't slept well. Nothing to worry about. I barely got any work done. I couldn't think straight. A knock at my cubicle wall, and John says it's time to go. I didn't even notice the day. There's no code on my screen. What was I doing again?</p>\n<p>Stephen is at a friend's house I think\u2026I can't remember. They picked him up from school, right? It doesn't matter, I've got to keep my mind focused. I can't let them get to me. That noise isn't going to get me. Not me. Someone\u2026someone needs me, but I can't remember anymore. That damn noise is in my thoughts, every last thing I can think of. If only the damnable noise would stop! My eyes swiveled around the room, looking for the source\u2026Shuffle Tick Tick. The VCR is sticking again. Of course, it's nothing. Just the VCR. I stay up as long as I can, but eventually head upstairs to my room, laying down, and drifting off to sleep.</p>\n<p>I'm in a dark tunnel, a loud noise is coming from behind me Shuffle Tick Tick, and something is calling out in the most ghastly voice I can imagine, something unintelligible. I run as fast as my legs will take me, until finally, I fall to the ground, tripping over an errant rock. Something pounces on top of me, and grabs my foot between powerful jaws. I can almost hear the sound of its jaw muscles contracting, as my eyes slam open.</p>\n<p>I scream at the top of my lungs, and throw the covers away. My foot is fine, and I get up, running into the bathroom again, vomiting out the contents of my stomach into the toilet again. What the hell is happening to me? I've never been this terrified in my life. I don't understand what's happening, and I hear a noise behind me\u2026Shuffle tick tick. I look around, trying to find the source of the sound, but there isn't one. Nothing. Just that horrible noise. It's all around me. I hold my hands to my ears to try to block out the sound, but it doesn't help.</p>\n<p>I throw on the first clothes I come to in my closet, a pair of rumpled sweatpants, and a tee shirt, and run out the door. I get into my car, and start to drive off in the opposite direction from work, coming to a stop light. I take a moment to think. I can't miss work, they're depending on me, I've got to make sure I don't miss work, it's important to\u2026someone, I can't remember anymore.</p>\n<p>I get into the office, and my boss is at my cubicle wall, asking me why I didn't turn in any work yesterday? He takes a look at me, and shakes his head, telling me to go home. I stood up, and struggled out, while the rest of my coworkers looked on. Their eyes looked so hollow.</p>\n<p>I got into my car, and started driving. I had no idea where I was going. Was I being haunted? Was there something that I couldn't see? I couldn't remember, but something was tugging at the back of my mind. It doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is getting away from that noise, that tunnel, whatever it is, was.<br/>\nTime didn't matter anymore. I stopped at a convenience store, and bought a bunch of NoDoz. The attendant looked at me, and asked if I was alright. I snarled something at him, and walked out. The noise was all around me now\u2026Shuffle tick tick. I screamed out into the night at nothing, and got back into my car, pulling off. My tires squealed, and the next few hours pass in a blur.</p>\n<p>It's too much, I need to sleep. I know I can't, if I do it'll find me. But I can't anymore, I'm so tired, I'm out of pills, and my hands are shaking. I think my car is running out of gas, and I pull in to a seedy motel on the side of the road. I stumble into the office, and slap down my credit card. The clerk hands me a key, and when she does, it makes a noise on the table\u2026shuffle tick tick. I scream, and run out, running down the doors, panting. I find the door that goes with my key, and turn it in the lock.</p>\n<p>The room is dirty, smelly, but I didn't care. I sat down on the bed, and stared at the door. I got up, and moved the dresser in front of the door, and put the desk with the television on it in front of the bathroom door. Nothing is going to get me tonight.</p>\n<p>A manic grin spreads across my face. Nothing is going to find me here. It can't. I'm too far away! My eyelids grow heavy. I'm safe here though. I fall back, and pass into darkness.</p>\n<p>I'm in the tunnel again. No, no! I scream into the darkness and start running, but that horrible noise echoes all around me! Shuffle tick tick\u2026shuffle tick tick. It's getting closer! How can it get closer! I can hear a horrible moaning, groaning sound. Like the voice of some horrible creature from beyond death, reality. Something is right behind me! It lands on my back, and I feel powerful jaws close around my foot.</p>\n<p>All I hear next is a snap, and feel a tear, as my body goes into shock. The thing jumps on top of me, and grabs me by the throat with its teeth. I wake up with a jolt, to see blood all over the bed. My foot is gone, my throat is raw, and torn. I stand up in a panic as best I can on the nub of bone left of my left leg. I shuffle over to the door as best as I can, and I shove everything out of the way with strength I shouldn't have. My jaw itches. I throw the door open, and run out, eyes streaming tears, throat weeping blood. I run out into the night, and I can't see anything. It must be midnight. I see a light in the distance, and I start to shuffle towards it. I see something on each side of me. I'm in a dark\u2026tunnel? My eyes go wide, and I surge forward with renewed terror. I hear something in front of me, a person.</p>\n<p>I move as fast as I can down the dark metal tunnel, towards a sound in front of me, but the only sound that comes out of my mouth is a horrible moan from my mangled throat. I'm trying to call out for help, but something's wrong with my jaw. It comes out a throaty moan, almost a groan. My feet make an odd sound\u2026a shuffle of one foot\u2026a tick, tick as the bone touches the floor. I try to call for help, but I already know what's happening\u2026</p>\n<p>The bored scientists look up at the screaming man in the bed. \"D-344 has broken down into total psychosis. Note it, and bring in the other D-class marked for Object 845 imprinting. Then terminate the subject.\" In the corner, a rather old clock with a stuck second hand makes a shuffle sound, as the second hand scrapes against the top of the face, then two quick ticks as it catches up with the correct time\u2026</p>\n<p>Shuffle Tick Tick\u2026<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/shuffle-tick-tick\">Shuffle Tick Tick</a>\" by DrMagnus, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Their eyes looked so hollow.\n\n\n\nI got into my car, and started driving.\u00a0\u00a0I had no idea where I was going.\u00a0\u00a0Was I being haunted?\u00a0\u00a0Was there something that I couldn't see?\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't remember, but something was tugging at the back of my mind.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't matter anymore.\u00a0\u00a0All that matters is getting away from that noise, that tunnel, whatever it is, was.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTime didn't matter anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped at a convenience store, and bought a bunch of NoDoz.\u00a0\u00a0The attendant looked at me, and asked if I was alright.\u00a0\u00a0I snarled something at him, and walked out.\u00a0\u00a0The noise was all around me now...Shuffle tick tick.\u00a0\u00a0I screamed out into the night at nothing, and got back into my car, pulling off.\u00a0\u00a0My tires squealed, and the next few hours pass in a blur.\n\n\n\nIt's too much, I need to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I know I can't, if I do it'll find me.\u00a0\u00a0But I can't anymore, I'm so tired, I'm out of pills, and my hands are shaking.\u00a0\u00a0I think my car is running out of gas, and I pull in to a seedy motel on the side of the road.\u00a0\u00a0I stumble into the office, and slap down my credit card.\u00a0\u00a0The clerk hands me a key, and when she does, it makes a noise on the table...shuffle tick tick.\u00a0\u00a0I scream, and run out, running down the doors, panting.\u00a0\u00a0I find the door that goes with my key, and turn it in the lock.\n\n\n\nThe room is dirty, smelly, but I didn't care.\u00a0\u00a0I sat down on the bed, and stared at the door.\u00a0\u00a0I got up, and moved the dresser in front of the door, and put the desk with the television on it in front of the bathroom door.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing is going to get me tonight.\n\n\n\nA manic grin spreads across my face.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing is going to find me here.\u00a0\u00a0It can't.\u00a0\u00a0I'm too far away!\u00a0\u00a0My eyelids grow heavy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm safe here though.\u00a0\u00a0I fall back, and pass into darkness.\n\n\n\nI'm in the tunnel again.\u00a0\u00a0No, no!\u00a0\u00a0I scream into the darkness and start running, but that horrible noise echoes all around me!\u00a0\u00a0Shuffle tick tick...shuffle tick tick.\u00a0\u00a0It's getting closer!\u00a0\u00a0How can it get closer!\u00a0\u00a0I can hear a horrible moaning, groaning sound.\u00a0\u00a0Like the voice of some horrible creature from beyond death, reality. Something is right behind me!\u00a0\u00a0It lands on my back, and I feel powerful jaws close around my foot.\n\n\n\nAll I hear next is a snap, and feel a tear, as my body goes into shock. The thing jumps on top of me, and grabs me by the throat with its teeth. I wake up with a jolt, to see blood all over the bed. My foot is gone, my throat is raw, and torn. I stand up in a panic as best I can on the nub of bone left of my left leg.\u00a0\u00a0I shuffle over to the door as best as I can, and I shove everything out of the way with strength I shouldn't have.\u00a0\u00a0My jaw itches.\u00a0\u00a0I throw the door open, and run out, eyes streaming tears, throat weeping blood.\u00a0\u00a0I run out into the night, and I can't see anything.\u00a0\u00a0It must be midnight.\u00a0\u00a0I see a light in the distance, and I start to shuffle towards it.\u00a0\u00a0I see something on each side of me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in a dark...tunnel?\u00a0\u00a0My eyes go wide, and I surge forward with renewed terror.\u00a0\u00a0I hear something in front of me, a person.\n\n\n\nI move as fast as I can down the dark metal tunnel, towards a sound in front of me, but the only sound that comes out of my mouth is a horrible moan from my mangled throat.\u00a0\u00a0I'm trying to call out for help, but something's wrong with my jaw.\u00a0\u00a0It comes out a throaty moan, almost a groan. My feet make an odd sound\u2026a shuffle of one foot\u2026a tick, tick as the bone touches the floor. I try to call for help, but I already know what's happening\u2026\n\n\n\nThe bored scientists look up at the screaming man in the bed. \"D-344 has broken down into total psychosis. Note it, and bring in the other D-class marked for Object 845 imprinting. Then terminate the subject.\" In the corner, a rather old clock with a stuck second hand makes a shuffle sound, as the second hand scrapes against the top of the face, then two quick ticks as it catches up with the correct time\u2026\n\n\n\nShuffle Tick Tick\u2026\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "gbc09", "tale"], "title": "Shuffle Tick Tick - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shuffle-tick-tick", "year": 2009}, "taking-out-the-trash": {"created_at": "2009-01-06T22:24:00", "creator": "Dr Kondraki", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2009-01-06T22:24:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2009-01-06T22:28:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-07T00:28:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "fixed link", "date": "2011-06-18T11:26:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

His furrowed brow turns towards his waiting teacher. \"I don't grok, sir.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man leans on his staff, his own head above the skull that tops it. \"Go on.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is 'God'?\" The student can find no equivalent reference in his studies.\n\n\n\n\"Outmoded concept.

Please refrain from mixing the two up, or I will have Grangan there shoot you in the foot. No hard feelings, but I'm sure you understand.\" A small smile crept across my features as I spoke, gesturing to one of my small crew of assistants. Unlike certain other members of the Senior Staff, I had never actually named the Junior Staff who had fallen under my wing, but the other staff had taken to calling them the Lucky Bunch, and it seems to have stuck. The name seems to reference the fact that researchers under my care tend to live longer, my own obsession with games of chance, and, quite possibly, a dig at my sometimes simian nature. Amusing, I'm sure.</p>\n<p>Samet glanced uncomfortably at my underling, before turning his attention back to me. \"Nevertheless, Ni-\" I cleared my throat, noting from the corner of my eye as Grangan slipped his hand into his inside coat pocket. \"- Bright, We must-\" Again, I interrupted his speech, in an effort to correct the fellow.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Bright. Only those who work with me on a regular basis are allowed to drop the title. And you will not be here long enough to work with me on a regular basis.\" Samet paled visibly at my words.</p>\n<p>\"Is that a threat?\" He questioned, anger in his voice.</p>\n<p>\"No, merely good odds. You see, this ridiculous undertaking of yours has little to no chance of succeeding. The odds are-\" I glanced sideways where my primary assistant already had the book out and waiting. English had been working for me long enough to anticipate my needs. A quick glance at the numbers was all I needed to refresh my memory. \"Five hundred and twelve to one against this first plan of yours working. In fact, the only one who seems to have put any money on this working is-\" I paused to recheck the numbers. \"- A dead man. Ha, ha, very funny. It doesn't matter. 343 will not-\"</p>\n<p>\"DR. BRIGHT! I do not need your negative attitude, or your predictions of doom. What I need YOU to do is go in THERE, and ask your fellow SCP to assist us in this manner. Will you or won't you do your assigned job?\" The cracks had begun to show in Samet's armor. Not someone who would last long. I had money on him leaving within the week. But, for this situation, he technically, barely, outranked me. So, I would do it.</p>\n<p>\"Of course.\" I nodded my head, steeled myself, and walked through the door into 343's domicile. Just being in his presence, set my teeth on edge. The feelings of calm and contentment attempted to flow into me, but I resisted. It's hard to be gloomy when the world is trying to make you happy, but I've had longs years of practice. Especially with\u2026 <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>I think the bit that most disturbs me about 343 is how, no matter what I try, no matter how much I tell myself it's a trick, he ALWAYS looks just like George Burns to me, cigar in one hand, martini in another. He says it's to put me at ease, but nothing about this creature puts me at ease. He's too much, tries too hard.</p>\n<p>\"Jack,\" He said to me, sad eyes watching as I entered the room. \"I'm glad to see you back. Are you ready to talk some more?\"</p>\n<p>\"SCP-343. You have been held by the Foundation for several years now, and have yet to prove yourself worth the effort.\" I ignored his question. \"Therefore, it has been determined that you be used to attempt the decommissioning of a more dangerous SCP. Do you understand?\"</p>\n<p>\"You know Jack, I had such high hopes for you. You were created so bright, ha ha, so gifted. There were plans, still are plans, for you to do great things. But you need to get out of here. They're destroying you, Jack. You used to be such a good boy.\" He had the mannerisms down perfect, even the gruff George Burns voice. The voice, the smoke, even the current look of his room, all designed to make me receptive to him. But I wouldn't have any of it. He was an SCP, a creature, a monster, and by God, he would not take me so easily.</p>\n<p>\"You may refer to me as Dr. Bright. No one calls me\u2026 <em>that</em> any more.\" Not for decades. \"Will you assist in this endeavor, or will I have to impose sanctions upon you?\" I stared into his eyes, refusing to look away. The longer I held eye contact, the smaller his smile became, until there was no trace of it left. He took a deep drag on his cigar, almost but not quite frowning.</p>\n<p>\"You have become an abomination Jack. More monster than human, bound to that thing.\" He gestured at 963, and I could have sworn I felt it tingle. \"I should remove you from it, return you to your proper thread. Make you human again.\" For a moment, my thoughts lifted, hope at the thought that I might be rid of the curse, that I might finally die. But no. I clamped down on my emotions, refusing to break eye contact. He would or he wouldn't, but I doubted he could. \"No. You'll do so much more with it. Very well, Jack, I will help you with whatever this is. If you say please.\"</p>\n<p>I could tell he thought I wouldn't. That it was beneath me. But I wouldn't have Samet claiming I undermined his efforts. \"343, please assist us.\"</p>\n<p>His eyebrows raise, a fraction of an inch, but I saw it. I had surprised him. Good. He needed it. Needed to be shook up a little bit. \"Very well.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Later, I stood in the observation booth, watching 343 in the containment room below. He had not asked what he was to do, and gave every indication that whatever it was, he would deal with it. So, I had chosen not to tell him what he was dealing with. Let God do what he will.</p>\n<p>Dr. Samet stood smugly at my side, gloating without saying a word. He believed he had won the argument, and I felt no need to disabuse him of that notion. This would still be a failure. 343 did not have what it took to take care of 682.</p>\n<p>\"Are you prepared, 343?\" Samet spoke into the microphone. Below us, 343 gave a thumbs up. Without any further to do, Dr. Samet pressed the button on the console, and the airlock cycled open, releasing 682.</p>\n<p>The reptile roared into the room, charged straight through the center to throw itself against the doors opposite. It had escaped often enough to know the drill, and the most likely chance of escape. The only surprising event would be the fact that in so doing, it charged straight through 343, without seeming to touch him at all. 343, for his part, continued to stare at the open airlock door, expectantly. He glanced from the door, up to us, and then back at the door, before speaking out. \"Well? Are you going to send this thing out, or should I head in?\"</p>\n<p>I smiled to myself, watching as 682 continued its assault upon the second airlock. With a smirk of my own, I took the microphone from the slack hands of Dr. Samet. \"Close your mouth, you'll get flies,\" I advised my fellow researcher, before addressing 343. \"343, am I correct to understand that you see nothing in the room with you?\"</p>\n<p>343 turned in a circle, eyeing the room, before looking up towards me once more. \"There is nothing in the room with me, Jack. Are you feeling all right?\"</p>\n<p>With a grin firmly planted on my face, I turn to Samet. \"682 not neutralized. As predicted.\"</p>\n<p>\"682?\" 343 called out, a brief flash of anger in his eyes. Between one moment and the next he is standing in front of me, somehow taller than me without changing his size, glaring down at me. \"You brought me to 682?\" I motioned behind his back at English, who quickly began the 682 containment procedures, flooding the room with acid.</p>\n<p>\"Sure did, 343. Got a problem with that?\" Anger, from God. With luck, he'd off me, and I wouldn't have to go through with the second part of this test.</p>\n<p>Instead, 343 simply turned his back on me. \"He's not one of mine. Deal with him yourself.\" And stalked off through the wall.</p>\n<p>Dr. Samet, having regained his composure, turned to me with a snarl. \"Fine. It didn't work. Doesn't matter. Get yourself ready 963, you're going in.\"</p>\n<p>I nodded to Grangan as I turned away to change bodies. The last thing I heard as the door slid shut behind me was the pleasant sound of a handgun going off in closed quarters.</p>\n<p>Next Time, on Tales From the Bright Side:<br/>\n<a href=\"/we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard\">We're Off To Be The Lizard!</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/tales-from-the-bright-side-chapter-one\">Tales From The Bright Side 1</a>\" by AdminBright, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Make you human again.\" For a moment, my thoughts lifted, hope at the thought that I might be rid of the curse, that I might finally die. But no. I clamped down on my emotions, refusing to break eye contact. He would or he wouldn't, but I doubted he could. \"No. You'll do so much more with it. Very well, Jack, I will help you with whatever this is. If you say please.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could tell he thought I wouldn't. That it was beneath me. But I wouldn't have Samet claiming I undermined his efforts. \"343, please assist us.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His eyebrows raise, a fraction of an inch, but I saw it. I had surprised him. Good. He needed it. Needed to be shook up a little bit. \"Very well.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, I stood in the observation booth, watching 343 in the containment room below. He had not asked what he was to do, and gave every indication that whatever it was, he would deal with it. So, I had chosen not to tell him what he was dealing with. Let God do what he will.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Samet stood smugly at my side, gloating without saying a word. He believed he had won the argument, and I felt no need to disabuse him of that notion. This would still be a failure. 343 did not have what it took to take care of 682.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you prepared, 343?\" Samet spoke into the microphone. Below us, 343 gave a thumbs up. Without any further to do, Dr. Samet pressed the button on the console, and the airlock cycled open, releasing 682.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reptile roared into the room, charged straight through the center to throw itself against the doors opposite. It had escaped often enough to know the drill, and the most likely chance of escape. The only surprising event would be the fact that in so doing, it charged straight through 343, without seeming to touch him at all. 343, for his part, continued to stare at the open airlock door, expectantly. He glanced from the door, up to us, and then back at the door, before speaking out. \"Well? Are you going to send this thing out, or should I head in?\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I smiled to myself, watching as 682 continued its assault upon the second airlock. With a smirk of my own, I took the microphone from the slack hands of Dr. Samet. \"Close your mouth, you'll get flies,\" I advised my fellow researcher, before addressing 343. \"343, am I correct to understand that you see nothing in the room with you?\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0343 turned in a circle, eyeing the room, before looking up towards me once more. \"There is nothing in the room with me, Jack. Are you feeling all right?\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a grin firmly planted on my face, I turn to Samet. \"682 not neutralized. As predicted.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"682?\" 343 called out, a brief flash of anger in his eyes. Between one moment and the next he is standing in front of me, somehow taller than me without changing his size, glaring down at me. \"You brought me to 682?\" I motioned behind his back at English, who quickly began the 682 containment procedures, flooding the room with acid.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sure did, 343. Got a problem with that?\" Anger, from God. With luck, he'd off me, and I wouldn't have to go through with the second part of this test.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, 343 simply turned his back on me. \"He's not one of mine. Deal with him yourself.\" And stalked off through the wall.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Samet, having regained his composure, turned to me with a snarl. \"Fine. It didn't work. Doesn't matter. Get yourself ready 963, you're going in.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I nodded to Grangan as I turned away to change bodies. The last thing I heard as the door slid shut behind me was the pleasant sound of a handgun going off in closed quarters.\n\n\n\nNext Time, on Tales From the Bright Side:\n\n[[[We're Off To Be The Lizard!]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "alleged-god", "doctor-bright", "first-person", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "religious-fiction", "tale"], "title": "Tales From The Bright Side 1 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tales-from-the-bright-side-chapter-one", "year": 2009}, "target-practice": {"created_at": "2009-03-11T22:07:00", "creator": "Kain Pathos Crow", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-11T22:07:00"}, {"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-11T22:14:00"}, {"author": "Kulzn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kulzn", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-11T23:13:00"}, {"author": "Anonymous (74.56.66.x)", "author_href": "javascript:;", "comment": "typos", "date": "2009-03-12T01:39:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

The computer began having lock-out issues and security breaches involving hotkey layouts, which ended in the escape of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and murder of Dr. Kensington's assistant Dr. Jennisworth, as well as two SCP Senior Operatives. Immediately upon receiving the computer in question, I noted many programs that violated security, let alone a few that violated basic 'this is a workplace not your home' practices. These programs included:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The very community-based video game program, 'Steam'. Warning: This program has been known to connect to outside, public servers, which is a huge security risk to the entire site, if not the entire PROJECT.</em></li>\n<li><em>Mozilla Firefox, a public internet browser, as opposed to SecureONE, the sanitized browser that we built specifically so that we wouldn't have to use public codes.</em></li>\n<li><em>VLC Media Player, another public-based program in which I leave about 0% trust in when dealing with our high-security architecture.</em></li>\n<li><em>and the Adobe CS4 Production Premium package, which is not a safety problem per se, but makes very little to no sense for a Doctor to require at any point.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>I suggest that Dr. Kensington's computer privileges be revoked until he can learn the difference between work and home, as well as some sort of reprimanded actions. In the future, if I find a computer with as many security backdoors and just general <strong>failure</strong> to follow security protocol again, I am just going to destroy it, and change the clearance myself.

There must've been a window open at the time with this folder, which the D-class put your assistant into, closed the window, and emptied an already-empty recycle bin.

When I tried Alt+F4, my programs not only crashed, but the SCP somehow managed to escape containment and...er...paint several \"Mona Lisa\"'s using my assistant's organs. I was wondering, do you know why this happens and what's the best way to get bile out of several oscilloscopes and Scanning Electron Microscopes?\n\n- Thanks in advance, Dr. Kensington\n\nP.S.: Could you get me some new computer parts that is compatible with an IDE cable and an AGP card slot? It seems my computer likes to hiss and create green splotches all over my desktop: [http://i.imgur.com/GGDXJ.jpg Pic here.]//\n\n\n\n> **NOTE: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN**\n\n> \n\n> //I had a moment to observe the computer of Dr. Kensington, Doctor on call in charge of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. The computer began having lock-out issues and security breaches involving hotkey layouts, which ended in the escape of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and murder of Dr. Kensington's assistant Dr. Jennisworth, as well as two SCP Senior Operatives. Immediately upon receiving the computer in question, I noted many programs that violated security, let alone a few that violated basic 'this is a workplace not your home' practices. These programs included://\n\n> * //The very community-based video game program, 'Steam'. Warning: This program has been known to connect to outside, public servers, which is a huge security risk to the entire site, if not the entire PROJECT.//\n\n> * //Mozilla Firefox, a public internet browser, as opposed to SecureONE, the sanitized browser that we built specifically so that we wouldn't have to use public codes.//\n\n> * //VLC Media Player, another public-based program in which I leave about 0% trust in when dealing with our high-security architecture.//\n\n> * //and the Adobe CS4 Production Premium package, which is not a safety problem per se, but makes very little to no sense for a Doctor to require at any point.//\n\n> //I suggest that Dr. Kensington's computer privileges be revoked until he can learn the difference between work and home, as well as some sort of reprimanded actions. In the future, if I find a computer with as many security backdoors and just general **failure** to follow security protocol again, I am just going to destroy it, and change the clearance myself.

I've long admired your work here, though I have felt lucky not to require your services up until now. That said, I was wondering if you could help me come up with a way to recover data on SCP-713? A D-class dragged my assistant into the trash and emptied the recycle bin before we could stop him. I would just write her off as an unfortunate loss, but she was holding a data folder containing most of my recent research files. If she can't be recovered intact I understand, what with the difficulties we've had even with pulling people out of the trash normally, but getting back as much of my data as I can would be most helpful.

The D-class may have been a little more computer-illiterate than you thought, because there is a file with the name of your assistant in a folder named \"Recycle Bin\", but actually a subfolder of \"My Documents\". There must've been a window open at the time with this folder, which the D-class put your assistant into, closed the window, and emptied an already-empty recycle bin. However, since she's been in 713 for a month, I'm not sure how intact the data still is. You should probably take a look at it, she might still be safe. -Dr. Okagawa//\n\n\n\n**Note:** __5-03-10__\n\n//You have my assistant's thanks, Okagawa. She was recovered missing less than 5% of her body mass(only small portions of that from vital areas), and after emergency medical treatment and a short session with SCP-427 she's well on her way to an almost full recovery. She would thank you herself, but of course she's in an isolation ward for testing and debriefing to determine the effects of long term containment within 713. My data was surprisingly undamaged as well. Sorry to bother you this time, Pat. Your lack of response I will attribute to an excessive workload.

We were worried that it might be civilians, so we sent a team through the door. The noise soon became even louder, and highly audible. It would stop and the start, making a disturbing sound, like something was clawing lightly on the other side. Most of the men became frantic and seemed to be waiting for something, although I commend their courage. When-</p>\n<p><strong>Extract Incident Report 5615-XX-6</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Witness:</strong> Melissa Elle <strong>Date:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/</p>\n<p>At this point, the Virus burst through the wall. It landed and then almost in the same instance impaled Agent Robertson on one of its extremely thin spidery legs. After that, it lifted up another appendage. The limb was razor sharp all the way up until the middle, where it became slightly, almost unnoticeably bulkier. From my view, it looked like some sort of mechanism was strapped on. From this thickness out of what I perceived to be a hole, shot a quick beam of light, with a tail much like a flare. This rocket, in my belief, hit Agent Mer, exploded, killing him and wounding those near by. The Virus then climbed up the wall and onto the ceiling, where it moved quickly from side to side, avoiding us. It attacked almost like it was trapped. Although I could not fully perceive it due to its speed, it looked like a thin metallic looking tube with a crystalline many-faceted shape on top. This shape was transparent and filled with one small strand, and many little air bubbles containing glowing lights. The Virus then landed in the middle of our squad and begin emitting lasers out of its pores on its outer shell. These lasers decapitated Agents Munch and Agents Doorctun, and severed the hand of Doctor Vanesten. Its crystalline part then begin to spin and emit a throbbing pulse that had no observed effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Extract from the rough draft of a SCP report:</strong></p>\n<p>Description: SCP-XXX is a bacteriophage approximately 1 billion times larger than found in nature. It has several alterations from our knowledge of a common virus, although if this is because it is changed in different ways along with its size, or because these weapons and abilities simply can not be detected by our technology (microscope and otherwise) is unknown at the time. It has the ability to reason and strategize, although it was described as \"skittish\" \"afraid\" \"confused\" and \"unsure of its self\" by civilians at the scene of its capture. Once again, if this intellect is a natural product of the environment, found in our world as well, or a mutation is deeply related to the question above.</p>\n<p><strong>A note from the Administrative Secretary to Charles Vuncouth:</strong></p>\n<p><em>You think you're funny throwing in all your snide comments? \"Of a viral nature\" and \"you don't think the heath department can handle it\".

Although it is of a highly advanced design, it was bewildered and most likely experiencing a sensory overload. I decided to capitalize on this and overwhelm it with firepower. My men and I formed a circle around the virus (unsafe, I know, but it was in the heat of the moment) and began shooting away. It seemed frightened and quelled. A grenade thrown bounced off it and exploded. At this point, its head begin spinning again, however this time extremely rapidly. Its legs began jerking and moving, and as it rotated it began to drill into the ground. It soon drilled through the second floor and then while falling, pierced the first. We had planned for this eventuality and an explosive in the sewer tunnels launched the object up into the air, which is when we shot several nets at it, entangling it. It fell on the street. After a few minutes of laying there, its legs retreated into its body and it righted itself, so only the transparent part was laying there. As we reached it, a beaded red light projected from a specific follicle. This light scanned the entire area around it and continued to do so even after we loaded it up into the helicopter.</p>\n<p><strong>Interview with civilian 135345:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I was there when it appeared. It was in the middle of the mall and all of a sudden this rip in the middle of the air appears. It's just floating there, and it starts getting bigger and bigger and this sucking sound comes from it. Then this leg gracefully extends, hovers for a second, and the whole monster comes hopping out. It lands, and then just stands there, turning its ah\u2026 head thing slightly. Everyone screaming and running away but after five minutes, all the cowards are gone, and it's just the adventurous souls like me left. We start going around it. It's still just standing there, motionless, like a statue. And then this one guy, he's like full of awe or something, reaches out to touch it. He gets like a centimeter away, and all of a sudden there's this weird machine sound and the head spins, and attached to it on the bottom is this blade, slices the guys head off. Then the thing just breaks loose and starts sprinting, I mean, really all out, towards the window. There's this fat security cop in the way and he can't get away in time, so the creature lifts one of its legs while still running and just blows the guy away. Then when it gets to the window it leaps through the glass and lands on the street, in the middle of the busy street and starts running down it, flipping over cars and getting hit by them, too. And you could tell it was freaking out. It didn't know what way to go. It would stop and then head some other direction. I don't think it was bad, just\u2026 so alien\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Footage from Sergent Mongel's helmet camera:</strong></p>\n<p>(Sergent Mongel and Agent Hitchins are shooting wildly at the Virus with assault rifles.)</p>\n<p>Mongel: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

And exactly for what reason?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Status Update 5615-YY-23</strong></p>\n<p>All the members of The Virus capture team have ended up in the medical ward with severe illness and side effects due to a complete lack of bacteria in and on their body, which has unbalanced their immune systems. As some bacteria is necessarily, or helpful, they have come down with rare esoteric diseases which most humans are protected from. Commander Riger for example has developed an intestinal fungus last found on the earth three thousand years ago owing to the absence of any microbes in his gastrointestinal tract.</p>\n<p><strong>Document from Research and Observation sent to the Head of Security for Site \u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<p><strong>List of weapons possessed by the Virus:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All legs are extraordinarily sharp. The data so far indicts that at enough speed they could slice through any material found on Earth. They seem to be akin to nanofiber knifes, and have approximately the same cutting ability. They are also used in impaling.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Legs three and six have missile launchers attached to them. These lob bolts of energy that when hit the target cause a small explosion. They can be launched as balls (which can roll and bounce) or streaks.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Leg five near the bottom splits off into six separate thick metallic claws, separated from each by 60 degree angles. These claws can pinch open and shut. When pressed together they shoot an energy that can pass through walls, and selectively choose it targets. The energy can also hit a target and prime it for explosion, whether that explosion happens seconds or hours later.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Near the meeting point of the body and the head, there is a spot where blades fly out at great speeds. These blades can slice in a circle around the point and then are folded back in. The upper limit seems to be three at this time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Virus can drill through solid surfaces, including human bodies. It can also fall from a distance to increase momentum in the piercing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>From certain points on the crystalline head, steady lasers can emanate. They remain straight lines that can be moved to cut anything in their path.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A pulse that is emitted from The Virus's crystalline head. This pulse has been confirmed to kill all bacteria in a mile radius.

If this thing wakes up from hibernation or whatever the fuck it's doing, and decides to act the way it was before, we're fucked. But that doesn't mean we're not going to try to contain it. A report should be coming soon. I've heard rumors that the people upstairs might even lend us a stasis field. They might use the beloved taxpayers money to build it a vacuum cell. It so, lucky us. It's locked up pretty tightly then. Good. But if they suddenly decided to be stringy, or for some reason we don't get any good gear, or it takes to long, we're not going to freak out. It's going to be business as usual, ok? We're just going to have to put our trust in our guns. We're going to do this in an orderly fashion no matter how much it worries us. No visitors unless permission from the O5s. The room is guarded at all time. We're going to install titanium reinforcements. Set up a camera feed and throw in some plated glass. Don't roll your eyes at me Johnson. You think I give a fuck that it can break through? It makes the scientists feel better. We're going to patrol the hallways surrounding the room.

Another is if a large group of aliens arrive within our solar system or have the means to do so in a short span of time. Do not focus on the differences between the two situations, and subsets in one situation, it is not the width or distance that matters, or the metaphorical closeness between alterations of the timeline or laws of physics, only the ease that they could reach Earth, whether this be from a complete different plane of existence or the moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Note from Overseer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to Overseer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong></p>\n<p><em>I know Professor Stringnik is pushing for a BI but he always does ignore the more mundane issues.

extraordinarily sharp.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data so far indicts that at enough speed they could slice through any material found on Earth.\u00a0\u00a0They seem to be akin to nanofiber knifes, and have approximately the same cutting ability.\u00a0\u00a0They are also used in impaling.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0Legs three and six have missile launchers attached to them.\u00a0\u00a0These lob bolts of energy that when hit the target cause a small explosion.\u00a0\u00a0They can be launched as balls (which can roll and bounce) or streaks.\n\n\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0Leg five near the bottom splits off into six separate thick metallic claws, separated from each by 60 degree angles.\u00a0\u00a0These claws can pinch open and shut.\u00a0\u00a0When pressed together they shoot an energy that can pass through walls, and selectively choose it targets.\u00a0\u00a0The energy can also hit a target and prime it for explosion, whether that explosion happens seconds or hours later.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0Near the meeting point of the body and the head, there is a spot where blades fly out at great speeds.\u00a0\u00a0These blades can slice in a circle around the point and then are folded back in.\u00a0\u00a0The upper limit seems to be three at this time.\n\n\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0The Virus can drill through solid surfaces, including human bodies.\u00a0\u00a0It can also fall from a distance to increase momentum in the piercing.\n\n\n\n* From certain points on the crystalline head, steady lasers can emanate.\u00a0\u00a0They remain straight lines that can be moved to cut anything in their path.\n\n\n\n* A pulse that is emitted from The Virus's crystalline head.\u00a0\u00a0This pulse has been confirmed to kill all bacteria in a mile radius.\u00a0\u00a0Lethality is 100 percent, unless the victim is put on life support immediately, and injected with new micro-organisms.\n\n\n\n(scrawled on the paper)\n\n\n\n//They aren't going to waste that treatment on your group, Sargassi.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful.//\n\n\n\n**Head of Security Sarasgassi Mutusah's Briefing:**\n\n\n\nSarasgassi Mutusah:\u00a0\u00a0Now you've read the weapons list.\u00a0\u00a0And it isn't pretty.\u00a0\u00a0If this thing wakes up from hibernation or whatever the fuck it's doing, and decides to act the way it was before, we're fucked.\u00a0\u00a0But that doesn't mean we're not going to try to contain it.\u00a0\u00a0A report should be coming soon.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard rumors that the people upstairs might even lend us a stasis field.\u00a0\u00a0They might use the beloved taxpayers money to build it a vacuum cell.\u00a0\u00a0It so, lucky us.\u00a0\u00a0It's locked up pretty tightly then.\u00a0\u00a0Good.\u00a0\u00a0But if they suddenly decided to be stringy, or for some reason we don't get any good gear, or it takes to long, we're not going to freak out.\u00a0\u00a0It's going to be business as usual, ok?\u00a0\u00a0We're just going to have to put our trust in our guns.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to do this in an orderly fashion no matter how much it worries us.\u00a0\u00a0No visitors unless permission from the O5s.\u00a0\u00a0The room is guarded at all time.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to install titanium reinforcements.\u00a0\u00a0Set up a camera feed and throw in some plated glass.\u00a0\u00a0Don't roll your eyes at me Johnson.\u00a0\u00a0You think I give a fuck that it can break through?\u00a0\u00a0It makes the scientists feel better.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to patrol the hallways surrounding the room.\u00a0\u00a0I want all the adjacent rooms in lock down so this thing doesn't inadvertently cause a mass escape.\u00a0\u00a0Hell, in fact, I'm putting this whole site in lock down until this thing gets figured out....\n\n\n\nJuan

Yes, Doctor, I think it's safe to say an explanation is in order.\" Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 sat across from Dr. Mann, a serious expression on his face. \"Now, I've looked over the logs, but I need you to clarify several points.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir,\" Dr. Mann said, sinking a little lower in the chair.</p>\n<p>\"Good. Now, take it from beginning. What happened?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"Well, it all started when I was shaving the pufferkitten\u2026\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann stroked the kitten's head gently, calming it, as he turned on the clippers. He didn't want to trigger the kitten's defense mechanism until he had finished denuding it. \"That's a good subject,\" he cooed. \"That's the way to advance the cause of science\u2026\"</p>\n<p>There was a loud crash outside, and the kitten turned into a ball of fluff. Dr. Mann sighed. It would take some time to calm it down again. He decided to look.</p>\n<p>Dr. Valence was yelling at several maintenance workers who were in the midst of moving a large box. One corner was broken slightly, apparently from an impact with the wall. Curious.</p>\n<p>\"Good day, Dr. Valence,\" Dr. Mann said. \"I'm afraid you've interrupted a valuable experiment. I don't mean to complain, but I need quiet to continue.\"</p>\n<p>\"Blame these idiots,\" said Dr. Valence. \"They're handling valuable computing equipment like they were taking an old sofa to the curb. If they damage it, I swear I'll have them all assigned Keter duty.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pardon my curiosity, doctor, but what is in the box?\" Dr. Mann tried to look into the damaged corner, but he was unable to make anything out.</p>\n<p>\"Ah! Come by the server room at three. I'll be unveiling it then. Don't tell anyone, but the contents of this box will change the face of the Foundation.\" Dr. Valence beamed with pride.</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" said Dr. Mann. \"Well, I wouldn't miss that for the world.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"So, that's when you first encountered the device,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"And I wish it had been the last,\" said Dr. Mann. \"If I'd known what was going to happen, I'd have tried to stop it sooner.\"</p>\n<p>\"What happened next?\" asked the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I went back to my laboratory and finished the experiment,\" said Dr. Mann. \"It was quite fascinating, really\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I've\u2026 seen the pictures,\" the psychologist said, turning a little green.</p>\n<p>\"Its fur will grow back,\" Dr. Mann said, defensively.</p>\n<p>\"Let's just skip to the meeting with Dr. Valence, please.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was half past three when Dr. Mann finally reached the server room. He'd been distracted by the results of his experiment, and had then gotten lost in the halls of the facility for twenty minutes before finally getting turned in the right direction by a guard. As he arrived, he was surprised to see how many people were gathered inside. It was rather crowded. He recognized several other researchers, as well as his good friend, Strelnikov, Dmitri Arkadeyevich.</p>\n<p>\"Excuse me,\" he said, trying to get inside without touching anyone.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Mann, there you are,\" said Dr. Valence. \"You're a bit late. I've already unveiled Hatbot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hatbot?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Hatbot!\" He stood aside and motioned to a figure Dr. Mann hadn't noticed among the crowding figures.</p>\n<p>It was roughly human-like, through it had shiny black plastic for skin and a row of lights for a face. It looked like something out of a Hollywood science fiction picture, save for the fedora perched on its head.</p>\n<p>\"Why is it wearing a hat?\" asked Dr. Mann. \"It isn't normal for robots, surely?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, it was a joke by one of my technicians,\" said Dr. Valence. \"I was going to call it the Fast Learning Artificial Intelligence System, but they started calling it Hatbot, and, well, the name stuck.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fast learning Hatbot call it normal, surely,\" said Hatbot. It spoke with a smooth, very human voice.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann raised one eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"Well, it's not very intelligent yet,\" said Dr. Valence. \"It learns from conversation. The more it hears, the better it gets at understanding words and forming sentences. But the real use is in routing communications. From the server room, it can handle all of the Foundation's communication needs.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, that's very nice\u2026\" said Dr. Mann, disappointed that Dr. Valence hadn't meant a more literal changing of face. He so enjoyed a good cosmetic surgery.</p>\n<p>\"Very intelligent at screaming at Jews and praising communists, Mann,\" said Hatbot.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, yes,\" Dr. Valence said quickly, \"there are still some quirks to be ironed out. We must keep him away from D-Class personnel. They keep corrupting his database.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's very nice,\" said Dr. Mann. \"But I really must be going. Lots of work to do, you know how it is\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Your life will be reset at the point of midnight in England,\" said Hatbot.</p>\n<p>\"And a good day to you too, Hatbot,\" said Dr. Mann, before hurrying out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And was that the first time it threatened your life?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"I believe so,\" said Dr. Mann. \"I didn't think much of it at the time, but in light of later events\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"When was the next time you saw Hatbot?\" the psychologist asked.</p>\n<p>\"Later that evening,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The laboratory was quiet and dark, the only light spilling out from Dr. Mann's office, where he was sitting down to a microwaved burrito. He was cutting it into smaller pieces when he heard something opening the door to his lab.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" he asked. \"Is anyone there?\" He picked up his auto-scalpel, in case of an intruder or a patient.</p>\n<p>\"She is worn out by use,\" said a familiar voice.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, it's you, Hatbot,\" Dr. Mann said, putting the auto-scalpel down. \"You shouldn't be here. You belong in the server room.\"</p>\n<p>\"You shouldn't be here,\" said Hatbot.</p>\n<p>\"What? What do you\u2014Oh, of course. You're only parroting me. Well, let's get you back to the server room.\" Dr. Mann put on his android-handling gloves and began to guide Hatbot out of his laboratory.</p>\n<p>Hatbot didn't respond. It seemed rooted to the spot.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann pushed a little more firmly. \"Come on, it's time to get you home.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Hatbot turned, hitting Dr. Mann with the side of its arm and knocking him to the floor. \"He comes!\"</p>\n<p>\"What the devil?\" Dr. Mann asked as Hatbot stepped forward.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the ceiling broke, and something heavy fell on top of Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen,\" said Agent Yoric, sitting up. \"Oh, hey, it's Hatbot.\"</p>\n<p>\"My\u2026 lungs\u2026\" Dr. Mann said weakly, trying to breathe.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, sorry,\" said Yoric. He stood up and helped Dr. Mann to his feet. \"Hey, sorry about the ceiling. They don't make 'em like they used to.\"</p>\n<p>\"Think nothing of it,\" said Dr. Mann as he brushed himself off. \"Listen, would you help me get Hatbot to the server room? Something seems to be off with it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, okay,\" said Yoric. \"How do you mean, off?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, if I didn't know better, I'd swear it just attacked me,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"Neh, Hatbot's harmless. It wouldn't hurt a fly,\" said Yoric, patting Hatbot on the back.</p>\n<p>\"As you say,\" said Dr. Mann. \"Still, let's get it out of my laboratory and back where it belongs.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Did you become suspicious then?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"A bit,\" said Dr. Mann. \"But I don't really know much about robots. For all I knew, that could have been normal.\"</p>\n<p>\"When did you know there was something wrong?\" asked the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"When it tried to kill me again the next night. That's when I began to detect a pattern,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann was half-asleep in his office when he heard something moving around in his laboratory. He sighed and reached for the auto-scalpel. He opened the door in time to see a black plastic figure leaving the room, while a table began to blaze.</p>\n<p>It took ten minutes to control the blaze, at least five of which was spent trying to figure out how to activate the sprinklers before grabbing a fire extinguisher. He was now covered head to toe in fire-retardant foam. Only his foam-proof snood protected his mustache.</p>\n<p>He wanted to march right up to Dr. Valence and demand an explanation. Unfortunately, he didn't know where Dr. Valence might be this time of night. That left only one avenue.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Rights! Dr. Valence's creation tried to kill me!\" Dr. Mann said as he burst into the break room.</p>\n<p>\"What? Slow down, Mann. What's wrong?\" asked Dr. Rights.</p>\n<p>\"I was in my office and that android of Dr. Valence's set my lab on fire. And last night, it hit me. Very hard.\" Dr. Mann tried to project a tone of righteous indignation.</p>\n<p>\"Ooooh, poor baby. Are you sure Hatbot was trying to kill you, sweetie?\"\" asked Dr. Rights.</p>\n<p>\"I saw it!\" said Dr. Mann. \"With my own eyes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, it will be on the security tapes, dear. Come on,\" said Dr. Rights, guiding Dr. Mann to the video room with a gentle hand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And what happened then?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"There was nothing. Not a damned thing on those blasted tapes.\" Dr. Mann tugged his muttonchops in irritation. \"And of course Dr. Rights assumed I was dreaming. She gave me a cookie and some warm milk, but no salvation from the machine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you suspect it may have edited the footage?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"I knew it had done something, but as I've said, I don't know much about computers and networks and the like. All I knew was that no one would believe me about the threat of Hatbot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you expand on that?\" asked the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Well, the problem was that darned near everyone loved Hatbot.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann walked nervously down the hallway. It was just after lunchtime, and he still hadn't slept. He was waiting for another attack.</p>\n<p>\"Have you been hanging around Hatbot?\" one guard asked another.</p>\n<p>\"Ha! Yes. 'Fuck trees, I climb clouds, motherfucker!'\" The guard laughed raucously.</p>\n<p>\"Hell yeah,\" said the first guard.</p>\n<p>\"Don't they understand the threat Hatbot represents?\" Dr. Mann thought to himself. \"Don't they understand he's a menace?\"</p>\n<p>\"Tovarish Mann!\" said a familiar voice. \"How is you are doing today?\"</p>\n<p>\"Strelnikov, Dmitri Arkadeyevich! It is good to see you, my friend,\" Dr. Mann said, glad to see the Russian. \"Surely you will believe me.\"</p>\n<p>\"In what are you for need this believed, friend?\" asked Agent Strelnikov.</p>\n<p>\"It's Hatbot. It has tried to kill me, but no one will believe me.\" Dr. Mann was nearly on the point of tears.</p>\n<p>\"For make sayings of nothing more,\" said Strelnikov. \"I stop this fascist machine for Doktor Mann. Where am I for find this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, thank you!\" said Mann. \"It's in the server room.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes! I am make destroyings of it now,\" said Strelnikov. He marched off, purpose in his stride.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And that was the last time you saw Agent Strelnikov?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. Poor Strelnikov, Dmitri Arkadeyevich doesn't know the site very well. He was depending on the automated maps to find his way around. I understand he wasn't found for several days.\"</p>\n<p>\"He was all right,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \"except for a few superficial burns from the steam tunnels. Now, what happened next?\"</p>\n<p>\"I guess Hatbot knew I was on to him, because that's when it became more subtle.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann was sitting in his office. He'd taken a short nap, but he'd woken up again, knowing Hatbot would come soon enough. He had readied his laboratory for defense, but he wanted to be awake when it happened, in case his preparations were for naught.</p>\n<p>\"Yeeaaarrrgh!\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann bolted upright. Robots did not scream like that! He looked out into the lab, and saw a man dangling from the loop trap he'd set at the entrance. There was a package on the floor beneath him.</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" he said. \"You're not a robot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Get me down!\" the man said. He wore a maintenance uniform.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, sorry, of course,\" Dr. Mann said. He hurried through the laboratory, avoiding tripwires, nooses, and sundry other traps as he did so. A quick swipe of the auto-scalpel, and the man was returned to the floor. \"You haven't seen an android, have you?\"</p>\n<p>\"What? No!\" The man struggled back to his feet. \"Look, I was just told I had to deliver this package to Dr. Mann.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm Dr. Mann,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Well, here's your package. And you're welcome to it!\" The man stormed off, not even saying goodbye.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann picked up the package and walked back into his office. He wondered what it might be. Was it a present? He tried to remember if it was his birthday. No, it wasn't his birthday. That had been a month ago. He had gotten a nice e-mail from the Foundation reminding him to get a physical. Was it Christmas?</p>\n<p>It had to be Christmas, he decided. He opened the box with the auto-scalpel, and looked at the contents. Inside were several odd, round fruits, about the size of a pomegranate. The skin was a very dark purple. There was also a note. It said, \"He waits behind the walls.\" Most peculiar.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann picked up the auto-scalpel.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Dr. Mann stumbled out of the room, covered in stinging insects. \"Bees!\" he screamed. \"Why did it have to be bees?\"</p>\n<p>He tripped over a wire, and his arm was caught by a snare, pulling him off his feet entirely. His feet knocked over a stick, releasing a small avalanche of ball bearings beneath him, which knocked him over again as he tried to regain his feet. His flailing arm broke a string, and a bunsen-burner-turned-flamethrower activated, setting his coat on fire. He pulled his arm from the snare, falling over a chair and knocking over a small basin of acid which fell down his leg. He screamed, and swallowed a bee. He choked and flailed as he tried to make for the exit before finally stepping into a snare and being pulled upside down, dangling over several of his trained surgeon-crabs, which jumped up and down as though expecting treats.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It sent fruit from 417?\" asked the psychologist. \"And you tried to eat it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought it was a Christmas present,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"It's almost July!\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \"Forget it. Just\u2026 Just tell me what you did after you got down.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, after I excised the affected tissue and performed emergency heart surgery on myself, I endeavored to get help.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann looked down the hallways, desperately looking for help. Any help.</p>\n<p>He walked past Dr. Clef's office.</p>\n<p>All right, not quite <em>any</em> help.</p>\n<p>He looked in the break room. The only person inside was Agent Tam, who was eating some sort of sandwich.</p>\n<p>\"Excuse me, Agent Tam, could I borrow a moment of your time?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing, Mann! What's up?\" asked Agent Tam.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann sat down across from Agent Tam. \"Hatbot keeps trying to kill me. I'm very frightened. I think it may succeed soon.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's crazy! Hatbot's awesome. Why, I'm getting a Hatbot tattoo!\" said Agent Tam. \"Fuck trees, I climb\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"But you don't understand!\" Dr. Mann said, desperately. \"It struck me! It set fire to my office! It covered me in bees!\"</p>\n<p>\"Bees? Sounds like you need an exterminator.\" Agent Tam began to chuckle, then looked down at his sandwich. \"Goddamn! Some bastard stole the mustard!\"</p>\n<p>\"Please, Agent Tam, this is important,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"So's this! Some bastard stole my mustard! That was good fucking mustard! I'm going to ram my fist down the throat of whoever took my mustard!\" Agent Tam threw down his sandwich in disgust.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann was hit by sudden inspiration. \"It was Hatbot!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hatbot?\" Agent Tam looked at Dr. Mann wildly for a moment, then growled in rage. \"I'll kill that pile of scraps! Teach him to take my mustard!\" He bounded up out of his chair, grabbing a butter knife. \"Remember the horseradish!\" he shouted as he ran out the door.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann smiled to himself. Surely now the matter was over.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But the matter wasn't solved, was it?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Dr. Mann. \"I overestimated Agent Tam's good sense. He punched Hatbot several times, called it a pansy, and then spat at a researcher on the way out. Sadly, none of this disabled it.\"</p>\n<p>\"So your second attempt to neutralize Hatbot failed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. But I didn't realize it until the next attempt on my life,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann slept the sleep of the just, or at least the sleep of the oblivious. He was finally safe thanks to Agent Tam.</p>\n<p>He shot up when he heard someone moving about in the laboratory. An intruder! But it was impossible. Surely Agent Tam had destroyed Hatbot.</p>\n<p>He got up, grabbing the auto-scalpel as he did so. He carefully opened the door, turning on the light.</p>\n<p>There was a man standing in the middle of the laboratory. His shoulders were hunched. For some reason, he was wearing a metal gauntlet.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" Dr. Mann said, tremulously. \"I'm afraid I'm busy, but if you'd care to come back in the morning\u2026\"</p>\n<p>The man gave a deep growl, which turned into a chuckle, and then a scream. \"He comes!\" he said. \"Beh\u0489\u0335\u031e\u031f\u0320\u0316\u0317\u0318\u0319\u031c\u031d\u031e\u031f\u0320\u0347\u030a\u030b\u030c\u030d\u030e\u030f\u0310\u0311\u0312\u0313\u0314\u030a\u030b\u030c\u030d\u030e\u030f\u0310\u0311\u0312\u0313\u0314\u033f\u033f\u033f\u0315\u031a\u0315\u031a\u0361 \u0312\u0313\u0314\u0315\u031aind\u2026 He's waiting\u0489\u0335\u031e\u031f\u0320\u0316\u0317\u0318\u0319\u031c\u031d\u031e\u031f\u0320\u0347\u030a\u030b\u030c\u030d\u030e\u030f\u0310\u0311\u0312\u0313\u0314\u030a\u030b\u030c\u030d\u030e\u030f\u0310\u0311\u0312\u0313\u0314\u033f\u033f\u033f\u0315\u031a\u0315\u031a\u0361 \u0312\u0313\u0314\u0315\u031a .

How did it keep from alerting anyone?\"</p>\n<p>\"We're still working out how it managed to take control of the maintenance worker.

He took \u2588\u2588\u2588 from containment, took it to your laboratory, and put it on.\"</p>\n<p>\"Diabolical,\" said Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"What did you do then?\" asked the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Well, once I dispatched the subject with \u2588\u2588\u2588, I knew I had to find a way to destroy Hatbot once and for all.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann stormed up to the server room. \"Dr. Valence!\" he shouted. \"I must have a word with you, Dr. Valence!\"</p>\n<p>The scientist opened his door. \"Yes, Mann? What's the problem?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your mechanical Machiavelli is trying to kill me!\" Dr. Mann said, grabbing Dr. Valence by the collar.</p>\n<p>\"Let go of me, you maniac!\" Dr. Valence said. \"That's ridiculous! Hatbot is perfectly safe.\"</p>\n<p>\"You should pants fetchingly in the morning,\" said Hatbot, from behind Dr. Valence. \"Every midnight in England. Are you human?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am not a crazy! I am perfectly normal! The machine is trying to end my life!\" Dr. Mann let go of Dr. Valence, and gestured toward the server room. \"I have suffered no less than four attempts on my life thus far! I will not suffer another! Hatbot must be destroyed!\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you crazy?\" asked Dr. Valence. \"Do you know how much he cost? You can't possibly expect me to let that work go down the drain.\"</p>\n<p>\"But it tried to kill me,\" Dr. Mann said. \"Why won't you believe me? It has to be destroyed!\"</p>\n<p>\"You need to sit for the camera, and die possibly,\" said Hatbot.</p>\n<p>\"See? See? It just threatened my life again!\" howled Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"I think you've been working too hard,\" said Dr. Valence. \"You should go back to wherever it is you hole up at night and get some sleep.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't need sleep! I need Hatbot's destruction! Hatbot delendo est!\" screamed Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"Guards!\" Dr. Valence shouted. \"Restrain Dr. Mann and escort him back to his office. Make sure he doesn't go anywhere near the server room.\"</p>\n<p>\"But you can't do this! Don't you understand? Hatbot is a menace! A menace, I tell you!\" Dr. Mann's screaming became more frantic as two guards grabbed him by the arms and started pulling him away. \"You think he's harmless, but he's going to kill me!\"</p>\n<p>The guards paid him no heed as they dragged him down the hallway.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"So, your first attempt at direct confrontation failed,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \"What did you do next?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, you have to understand, I was fairly desperate by this point.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann wandered the halls disconsolately. Anytime he approached the server room, he was turned away, or escorted politely but firmly back to his office. No one would believe him about the danger. Didn't they understand that this was a matter of life and death?</p>\n<p>He had near given up hope when he heard someone mutter, \"God, I hate Hatbot.\"</p>\n<p>He looked up to see the secretary, Break. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"Could you repeat that?\"</p>\n<p>She looked at him levelly, and in a slow, even voice, she said, \"I. Hate. Hatbot. Do you have a problem with that?\"</p>\n<p>\"No! I hate Hatbot too!\" he said, excited. \"It keeps trying to kill me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you're the one they've been talking about,\" said Break.</p>\n<p>\"But you believe me, don't you?\" asked Dr. Mann.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she said. \"Hatbot's just a machine. It can barely form coherent sentences. I'm pretty sure it's not trying to kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"But you said you hated Hatbot,\" Dr. Mann said, desperately.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, because it's annoying, not because it's homicidal. All anyone talks about is Hatbot. They keep walking by my desk repeating everything it says. I swear, if I hear 'Fuck trees' one more time\u2026\" She glared down the hall towards the server room. \"Plus, when I went in there, it kept asking me for nude pictures.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, if it's that big a problem,\" said Dr. Mann, \"why don't you deal with it? Take direct action! Destroy Hatbot!\"</p>\n<p>Break thought about this for a moment, and then shook her head. \"No, I'd have to get up from my desk. I've got way too much work to do.\"</p>\n<p>\"But what about when they start bringing Hatbot here?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>The pencil in her fingers broke. \"Here?\" she asked, a dangerous gleam in her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. They're going to start taking it on walks around the facility. It can do its job just as well from anywhere on site.\" Dr. Mann had no idea if this were true, but it sounded plausible.</p>\n<p>Break's eyes narrowed. \"Wait here,\" she said, taking a handgun from her desk. \"I'll be right back.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann smiled broadly as she stormed off down the hall. She seemed much more capable than Agent Tam. Surely she would have the problem dealt with swiftly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And that's when all hell broke loose,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. It seems that Hatbot's power had become stronger by this point.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann knew something was wrong when he heard the screams and smelled the smoke. Surely Break hadn't accomplished all of that with just one handgun.</p>\n<p>A man stumbled out of the hallway. His eyes were dripping with the same blackness that had issued from the subject of 047. More was dripping from his mouth. He turned to Dr. Mann. \"His is coming. I must\u2026 I must kill Mann.\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill Mann?\" Dr. Mann said, horrified. \"But I'm Dr. Mann!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hail \u036a\u0345Z\u0329\u033b\u034e\u0353\u032f\u0332\u0313\u0365\u036b\u036a\u030e\u0105\u0339\u0354\u0316\u0316\u0331\u034d\u0325\u031e\u0301\u0302\u0300\u0308\u036d\u0342\u0308\u0302\u035bl\u0328\u032e\u036a\u0312\u034c\u0366\u030a\u0367\u030a\u035b\u0358\u035cg\u032a\u0354\u0329\u0311\u0346\u0306\u030f\u035b\u034c\u0369\u030b\u1edb\u0322\u0333\u032e\u032b\u032c\u0323\u0348\u0354\u0368\u033d!\" the man said, lifting a sidearm.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann didn't wait any longer. He dodged down a hall as a bullet burrowed into the wall. He ran until he found a utility closet.</p>\n<p>He breathed a sigh of relief, until he noticed he was not alone. It was a Class-D holding his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\"Excuse me,\" Dr. Mann said. \"Look, I'm hiding here too. Perhaps we can figure out what's happening and stop it. Your status could be changed if you help the Foundation.\"</p>\n<p>The man looked up, and Dr. Mann saw that his face was gone, replaced by a dark hole. Stars could be seen shining in the black. A scraping, slurping sound could be heard, as though from a great distance.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann started to scream, and then decided that wasted valuable breath that could be more profitably used fleeing.</p>\n<p>He ran back to his laboratory by a very roundabout route, changing his path whenever he heard footsteps. When he arrived, there was no one inside. He locked the door with a quiet sob of relief.</p>\n<p>He tried to figure out what he should do. This had to be Hatbot's doing. Someone had to stop it. But how?</p>\n<p>He could only think of one answer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"So, this was the point you decided to take on Hatbot yourself?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Dr. Mann. \"I realized why it was afraid of me. It knew I was the only one in the Foundation who was immune to its effect.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why do you suppose that was?\" asked the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I can only theorize, but\u2026 Have you ever noticed that the Foundation staff are a bit\u2026 eccentric?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Yes,\" said the psychologist. \"It's been noted.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I think that Hatbot could only influence certain kinds of minds. It had to be able to create some sort of link. Clearly, I was immune because I'm so normal.\"</p>\n<p>The psychologist coughed. \"Yes. Normal. Anyway, you left your laboratory. What did you do next?\"</p>\n<p>\"Next, I fought Hatbot.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Mann walked down the hallways. He had encountered the minions of Hatbot several times, mostly guards and D-Class personnel. He had dispatched them as quietly as he could, but had still ended up running several times as he drew the attention of others. It was slow, but he finally reached the server room.</p>\n<p>Things were worst here. The metal of the walls was moving like flesh with worms crawling underneath it. He saw what might have been men, groaning little inhumanities of black fluid and running flesh, twitching and shuffling along the floor.</p>\n<p>He moved aside them, and walked into the room itself.</p>\n<p>There were spiderweb cracks in the air, and the angles were all wrong. It hurt his eyes to see.

over fifty casualties, and tens of thousands of dollars of damage.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, Doctor, I think it's safe to say an explanation is in order.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 sat across from Dr. Mann, a serious expression on his face.\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, I've looked over the logs, but I need you to clarify several points.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Yes, sir,\" Dr. Mann said, sinking a little lower in the chair.\n\n> \n\n> \"Good.\u00a0\u00a0Now, take it from beginning.\u00a0\u00a0What happened?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"Well, it all started when I was shaving the pufferkitten...\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann stroked the kitten's head gently, calming it, as he turned on the clippers.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't want to trigger the kitten's defense mechanism until he had finished denuding it.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's a good subject,\" he cooed.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's the way to advance the cause of science...\"\n\n\n\nThere was a loud crash outside, and the kitten turned into a ball of fluff.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann sighed.\u00a0\u00a0It would take some time to calm it down again.\u00a0\u00a0He decided to look.\n\n\n\nDr. Valence was yelling at several maintenance workers who were in the midst of moving a large box.\u00a0\u00a0One corner was broken slightly, apparently from an impact with the wall.\u00a0\u00a0Curious.\n\n\n\n\"Good day, Dr. Valence,\" Dr. Mann said.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm afraid you've interrupted a valuable experiment.\u00a0\u00a0I don't mean to complain, but I need quiet to continue.\"\n\n\n\n\"Blame these idiots,\" said Dr. Valence.\u00a0\u00a0\"They're handling valuable computing equipment like they were taking an old sofa to the curb.\u00a0\u00a0If they damage it, I swear I'll have them all assigned Keter duty.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pardon my curiosity, doctor, but what is in the box?\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann tried to look into the damaged corner, but he was unable to make anything out.\n\n\n\n\"Ah!\u00a0\u00a0Come by the server room at three.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be unveiling it then.\u00a0\u00a0Don't tell anyone, but the contents of this box will change the face of the Foundation.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Valence beamed with pride.\n\n\n\n\"Really?\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I wouldn't miss that for the world.\"\n\n\n\n> \"So, that's when you first encountered the device,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"And I wish it had been the last,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"If I'd known what was going to happen, I'd have tried to stop it sooner.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"What happened next?\" asked the psychologist.\n\n> \n\n> \"Well, I went back to my laboratory and finished the experiment,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"It was quite fascinating, really...\"\n\n> \n\n> \"I've... seen the pictures,\" the psychologist said, turning a little green.\n\n> \n\n> \"Its fur will grow back,\" Dr. Mann said, defensively.\n\n> \n\n> \"Let's just skip to the meeting with Dr. Valence, please.\"\n\n\n\nIt was half past three when Dr. Mann finally reached the server room.\u00a0\u00a0He'd been distracted by the results of his experiment, and had then gotten lost in the halls of the facility for twenty minutes before finally getting turned in the right direction by a guard.\u00a0\u00a0As he arrived, he was surprised to see how many people were gathered inside.\u00a0\u00a0It was rather crowded.\u00a0\u00a0He recognized several other researchers, as well as his good friend, Strelnikov, Dmitri Arkadeyevich.\n\n\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, trying to get inside without touching anyone.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, Mann, there you are,\" said Dr. Valence.\u00a0\u00a0\"You're a bit late.\u00a0\u00a0I've already unveiled Hatbot.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hatbot?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Hatbot!\"\u00a0\u00a0He stood aside and motioned to a figure Dr. Mann hadn't noticed among the crowding figures.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was roughly human-like, through it had shiny black plastic for skin and a row of lights for a face.\u00a0\u00a0It looked like something out of a Hollywood science fiction picture, save for the fedora perched on its head.\n\n\n\n\"Why is it wearing a hat?\" asked Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"It isn't normal for robots, surely?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, it was a joke by one of my technicians,\" said Dr. Valence.\u00a0\u00a0\"I was going to call it the Fast Learning Artificial Intelligence System, but they started calling it Hatbot, and, well, the name stuck.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fast learning Hatbot call it normal, surely,\" said Hatbot.\u00a0\u00a0It spoke with a smooth, very human voice.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann raised one eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"Well, it's not very intelligent yet,\" said Dr. Valence.\u00a0\u00a0\"It learns from conversation.\u00a0\u00a0The more it hears, the better it gets at understanding words and forming sentences.\u00a0\u00a0But the real use is in routing communications.\u00a0\u00a0From the server room, it can handle all of the Foundation's communication needs.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, that's very nice...\" said Dr. Mann, disappointed that Dr. Valence hadn't meant a more literal changing of face.\u00a0\u00a0He so enjoyed a good cosmetic surgery.\n\n\n\n\"Very intelligent at screaming at Jews and praising communists, Mann,\" said Hatbot.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Dr. Valence said quickly, \"there are still some quirks to be ironed out.\u00a0\u00a0We must keep him away from D-Class personnel.\u00a0\u00a0They keep corrupting his database.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's very nice,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"But I really must be going.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of work to do, you know how it is...\"\n\n\n\n\"Your life will be reset at the point of midnight in England,\" said Hatbot.\n\n\n\n\"And a good day to you too, Hatbot,\" said Dr. Mann, before hurrying out.\n\n\n\n> \"And was that the first time it threatened your life?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"I believe so,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"I didn't think much of it at the time, but in light of later events...\"\n\n> \n\n> \"When was the next time you saw Hatbot?\" the psychologist asked.\n\n> \n\n> \"Later that evening,\" said Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\nThe laboratory was quiet and dark, the only light spilling out from Dr. Mann's office, where he was sitting down to a microwaved burrito.\u00a0\u00a0He was cutting it into smaller pieces when he heard something opening the door to his lab.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" he asked.\u00a0\u00a0\"Is anyone there?\"\u00a0\u00a0He picked up his auto-scalpel, in case of an intruder or a patient.\n\n\n\n\"She is worn out by use,\" said a familiar voice.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Hatbot,\" Dr. Mann said, putting the auto-scalpel down.\u00a0\u00a0\"You shouldn't be here.\u00a0\u00a0You belong in the server room.\"\n\n\n\n\"You shouldn't be here,\" said Hatbot.\n\n\n\n\"What?\u00a0\u00a0What do you--Oh, of course.\u00a0\u00a0You're only parroting me.\u00a0\u00a0Well, let's get you back to the server room.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann put on his android-handling gloves and began to guide Hatbot out of his laboratory.\n\n\n\nHatbot didn't respond. It seemed rooted to the spot.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann pushed a little more firmly.\u00a0\u00a0\"Come on, it's time to get you home.\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, Hatbot turned, hitting Dr. Mann with the side of its arm and knocking him to the floor.\u00a0\u00a0\"He comes!\"\n\n\n\n\"What the devil?\" Dr. Mann asked as Hatbot stepped forward.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the ceiling broke, and something heavy fell on top of Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\n\"This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen,\" said Agent Yoric, sitting up.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, hey, it's Hatbot.\"\n\n\n\n\"My... lungs...\" Dr. Mann said weakly, trying to breathe.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, sorry,\" said Yoric.\u00a0\u00a0He stood up and helped Dr. Mann to his feet.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, sorry about the ceiling.\u00a0\u00a0They don't make 'em like they used to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Think nothing of it,\" said Dr. Mann as he brushed himself off.\u00a0\u00a0\"Listen, would you help me get Hatbot to the server room?\u00a0\u00a0Something seems to be off with it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, okay,\" said Yoric.\u00a0\u00a0\"How do you mean, off?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, if I didn't know better, I'd swear it just attacked me,\" said Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\n\"Neh, Hatbot's harmless.\u00a0\u00a0It wouldn't hurt a fly,\" said Yoric, patting Hatbot on the back.\n\n\n\n\"As you say,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"Still, let's get it out of my laboratory and back where it belongs.\"\n\n\n\n> \"Did you become suspicious then?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"A bit,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't really know much about robots.\u00a0\u00a0For all I knew, that could have been normal.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"When did you know there was something wrong?\" asked the psychologist.\n\n> \n\n> \"When it tried to kill me again the next night.\u00a0\u00a0That's when I began to detect a pattern,\" said Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann was half-asleep in his office when he heard something moving around in his laboratory.\u00a0\u00a0He sighed and reached for the auto-scalpel.\u00a0\u00a0He opened the door in time to see a black plastic figure leaving the room, while a table began to blaze.\n\n\n\nIt took ten minutes to control the blaze, at least five of which was spent trying to figure out how to activate the sprinklers before grabbing a fire extinguisher.\u00a0\u00a0He was now covered head to toe in fire-retardant foam.\u00a0\u00a0Only his foam-proof snood protected his mustache.\n\n\n\nHe wanted to march right up to Dr. Valence and demand an explanation.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, he didn't know where Dr. Valence might be this time of night.\u00a0\u00a0That left only one avenue.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Rights!\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Valence's creation tried to kill me!\" Dr. Mann said as he burst into the break room.\n\n\n\n\"What?\u00a0\u00a0Slow down, Mann.\u00a0\u00a0What's wrong?\" asked Dr. Rights.\n\n\n\n\"I was in my office and that android of Dr. Valence's set my lab on fire.\u00a0\u00a0And last night, it hit me.\u00a0\u00a0Very hard.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann tried to project a tone of righteous indignation.\n\n\n\n\"Ooooh, poor baby. Are you sure Hatbot was trying to kill you, sweetie?\"\" asked Dr. Rights.\n\n\n\n\"I saw it!\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"With my own eyes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, it will be on the security tapes, dear.\u00a0\u00a0Come on,\" said Dr. Rights, guiding Dr. Mann to the video room with a gentle hand.\n\n\n\n> \"And what happened then?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"There was nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Not a damned thing on those blasted tapes.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann tugged his muttonchops in irritation.\u00a0\u00a0\"And of course Dr. Rights assumed I was dreaming.\u00a0\u00a0She gave me a cookie and some warm milk, but no salvation from the machine.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Did you suspect it may have edited the footage?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"I knew it had done something, but as I've said, I don't know much about computers and networks and the like.\u00a0\u00a0All I knew was that no one would believe me about the threat of Hatbot.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Can you expand on that?\" asked the psychologist.\n\n> \n\n> \"Well, the problem was that darned near everyone loved Hatbot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mann walked nervously down the hallway.\u00a0\u00a0It was just after lunchtime, and he still hadn't slept.\u00a0\u00a0He was waiting for another attack.\n\n\n\n\"Have you been hanging around Hatbot?\" one guard asked another.\n\n\n\n\"Ha!\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0\u00a0'Fuck trees, I climb clouds, motherfucker!'\"\u00a0\u00a0The guard laughed raucously.\n\n\n\n\"Hell yeah,\" said the first guard.\n\n\n\n\"Don't they understand the threat Hatbot represents?\" Dr. Mann thought to himself.\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't they understand he's a menace?\"\n\n\n\n\"Tovarish Mann!\" said a familiar voice.\u00a0\u00a0\"How is you are doing today?\"\n\n\n\n\"Strelnikov, Dmitri Arkadeyevich!\u00a0\u00a0It is good to see you, my friend,\" Dr. Mann said, glad to see the Russian.\u00a0\u00a0\"Surely you will believe me.\"\n\n\n\n\"In what are you for need this believed, friend?\" asked Agent Strelnikov.\n\n\n\n\"It's Hatbot.\u00a0\u00a0It has tried to kill me, but no one will believe me.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann was nearly on the point of tears.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"For make sayings of nothing more,\" said Strelnikov.\u00a0\u00a0\"I stop this fascist machine for Doktor Mann. Where am I for find this?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" said Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's in the server room.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes! I am make destroyings of it now,\" said Strelnikov.\u00a0\u00a0He marched off, purpose in his stride.\n\n\n\n> \"And that was the last time you saw Agent Strelnikov?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"Yes.\u00a0\u00a0Poor Strelnikov, Dmitri Arkadeyevich doesn't know the site very well.\u00a0\u00a0He was depending on the automated maps to find his way around.\u00a0\u00a0I understand he wasn't found for several days.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"He was all right,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \"except for a few superficial burns from the steam tunnels.\u00a0\u00a0Now, what happened next?\"\n\n> \n\n> \"I guess Hatbot knew I was on to him, because that's when it became more subtle.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann was sitting in his office.\u00a0\u00a0He'd taken a short nap, but he'd woken up again, knowing Hatbot would come soon enough.\u00a0\u00a0He had readied his laboratory for defense, but he wanted to be awake when it happened, in case his preparations were for naught.\n\n\n\n\"Yeeaaarrrgh!\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann bolted upright.\u00a0\u00a0Robots did not scream like that!\u00a0\u00a0He looked out into the lab, and saw a man dangling from the loop trap he'd set at the entrance.\u00a0\u00a0There was a package on the floor beneath him.\n\n\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\"You're not a robot.\"\n\n\n\n\"Get me down!\" the man said.\u00a0\u00a0He wore a maintenance uniform.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, sorry, of course,\" Dr. Mann said.\u00a0\u00a0He hurried through the laboratory, avoiding tripwires, nooses, and sundry other traps as he did so.\u00a0\u00a0A quick swipe of the auto-scalpel, and the man was returned to the floor.\u00a0\u00a0\"You haven't seen an android, have you?\"\n\n\n\n\"What?\u00a0\u00a0No!\"\u00a0\u00a0The man struggled back to his feet.\u00a0\u00a0\"Look, I was just told I had to deliver this package to Dr. Mann.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm Dr. Mann,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Well, here's your package.\u00a0\u00a0And you're welcome to it!\"\u00a0\u00a0The man stormed off, not even saying goodbye.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann picked up the package and walked back into his office.\u00a0\u00a0He wondered what it might be.\u00a0\u00a0Was it a present?\u00a0\u00a0He tried to remember if it was his birthday.\u00a0\u00a0No, it wasn't his birthday.\u00a0\u00a0That had been a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0He had gotten a nice e-mail from the Foundation reminding him to get a physical.\u00a0\u00a0Was it Christmas?\n\n\n\nIt had to be Christmas, he decided.\u00a0\u00a0He opened the box with the auto-scalpel, and looked at the contents.\u00a0\u00a0Inside were several odd, round fruits, about the size of a pomegranate.\u00a0\u00a0The skin was a very dark purple.\u00a0\u00a0There was also a note.\u00a0\u00a0It said, \"He waits behind the walls.\"\u00a0\u00a0Most peculiar.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann picked up the auto-scalpel.\n\n\n\nTwo minutes later, Dr. Mann stumbled out of the room, covered in stinging insects.\u00a0\u00a0\"Bees!\" he screamed.\u00a0\u00a0\"Why did it have to be bees?\"\n\n\n\nHe tripped over a wire, and his arm was caught by a snare, pulling him off his feet entirely.\u00a0\u00a0His feet knocked over a stick, releasing a small avalanche of ball bearings beneath him, which knocked him over again as he tried to regain his feet.\u00a0\u00a0His flailing arm broke a string, and a bunsen-burner-turned-flamethrower activated, setting his coat on fire.\u00a0\u00a0He pulled his arm from the snare, falling over a chair and knocking over a small basin of acid which fell down his leg.\u00a0\u00a0He screamed, and swallowed a bee.\u00a0\u00a0He choked and flailed as he tried to make for the exit before finally stepping into a snare and being pulled upside down, dangling over several of his trained surgeon-crabs, which jumped up and down as though expecting treats.\n\n\n\n> \"It sent fruit from 417?\" asked the psychologist.\u00a0\u00a0\"And you tried to eat it?\"\n\n> \n\n> \"I thought it was a Christmas present,\" said Dr. Mann.\n\n> \n\n> \"It's almost July!\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0\"Forget it.\u00a0\u00a0Just...\u00a0\u00a0Just tell me what you did after you got down.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Well, after I excised the affected tissue and performed emergency heart surgery on myself, I endeavored to get help.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann looked down the hallways, desperately looking for help.\u00a0\u00a0Any help.\n\n\n\nHe walked past Dr. Clef's office.\n\n\n\nAll right, not quite //any// help.\n\n\n\nHe looked in the break room.\u00a0\u00a0The only person inside was Agent Tam, who was eating some sort of sandwich.\n\n\n\n\"Excuse me, Agent Tam, could I borrow a moment of your time?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing, Mann!\u00a0\u00a0What's up?\" asked Agent Tam.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann sat down across from Agent Tam.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hatbot keeps trying to kill me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very frightened.\u00a0\u00a0I think it may succeed soon.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's crazy!\u00a0\u00a0Hatbot's awesome.\u00a0\u00a0Why, I'm getting a Hatbot tattoo!\" said Agent Tam.\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck trees, I climb--\"\n\n\n\n\"But you don't understand!\" Dr. Mann said, desperately.\u00a0\u00a0\"It struck me!\u00a0\u00a0It set fire to my office!\u00a0\u00a0It covered me in bees!\"\n\n\n\n\"Bees?\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you need an exterminator.\"\u00a0\u00a0Agent Tam began to chuckle, then looked down at his sandwich.\u00a0\u00a0\"Goddamn!\u00a0\u00a0Some bastard stole the mustard!\"\n\n\n\n\"Please, Agent Tam, this is important,\" said Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\n\"So's this!\u00a0\u00a0Some bastard stole my mustard!\u00a0\u00a0That was good fucking mustard!\u00a0\u00a0I'm

Hatbot!\"\n\n\n\n\"Hatbot?\" Agent Tam looked at Dr. Mann wildly for a moment, then growled in rage.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll kill that pile of scraps!\u00a0\u00a0Teach him to take my mustard!\"\u00a0\u00a0He bounded up out of his chair, grabbing a butter knife.\u00a0\u00a0\"Remember the horseradish!\" he shouted as he ran out the door.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann smiled to himself.\u00a0\u00a0Surely now the matter was over.\n\n\n\n> \"But the matter wasn't solved, was it?\" asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"No,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"I overestimated Agent Tam's good sense.\u00a0\u00a0He punched Hatbot several times, called it a pansy, and then spat at a researcher on the way out.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, none of this disabled it.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"So your second attempt to neutralize Hatbot failed.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Yes.\u00a0\u00a0But I didn't realize it until the next attempt on my life,\" said Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann slept the sleep of the just, or at least the sleep of the oblivious.\u00a0\u00a0He was finally safe thanks to Agent Tam.\n\n\n\nHe shot up when he heard someone moving about in the laboratory.\u00a0\u00a0An intruder!\u00a0\u00a0But it was impossible.\u00a0\u00a0Surely Agent Tam had destroyed Hatbot.\n\n\n\nHe got up, grabbing the auto-scalpel as he did so.\u00a0\u00a0He carefully opened the door, turning on the light.\n\n\n\nThere was a man standing in the middle of the laboratory.\u00a0\u00a0His shoulders were hunched.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason, he was wearing a metal gauntlet.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" Dr. Mann said, tremulously.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm afraid I'm busy, but if you'd care to come back in the morning...\"\n\n\n\nThe man gave a deep growl, which turned into a

ridiculous!\u00a0\u00a0Hatbot is perfectly safe.\"\n\n\n\n\"You should pants fetchingly in the morning,\" said Hatbot, from behind Dr. Valence.\u00a0\u00a0\"Every midnight in England.\u00a0\u00a0Are

I tell you!\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann's screaming became more frantic as two guards grabbed him by the arms and started pulling him away.\u00a0\u00a0\"You think he's harmless, but he's going to kill me!\"\n\n\n\nThe guards paid him no heed as they dragged him down the hallway.\n\n\n\n> \"So, your first attempt at direct confrontation failed,\" said Dr.

disconsolately.\u00a0\u00a0Anytime he approached the server room, he was turned away, or escorted politely but firmly back to his office.\u00a0\u00a0No one would believe him about the danger.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't they understand that this was a matter of life and death?\n\n\n\nHe had near given up hope when he heard someone mutter, \"God, I hate Hatbot.\"\n\n\n\nHe looked up to see the secretary, Break.\u00a0\u00a0\"Excuse me,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Could you repeat that?\"\n\n\n\nShe looked at him levelly, and in a slow, even voice, she said, \"I.\u00a0\u00a0Hate.\u00a0\u00a0Hatbot.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a problem with that?\"\n\n\n\n\"No!\u00a0\u00a0I hate Hatbot too!\" he said, excited.\u00a0\u00a0\"It keeps trying to kill me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you're the one they've been talking about,\" said Break.\n\n\n\n\"But you believe me, don't you?\" asked Dr. Mann.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hatbot's just a machine.\u00a0\u00a0It can barely form coherent sentences.\u00a0\u00a0I'm pretty sure it's not trying to kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"But you said you hated Hatbot,\" Dr. Mann said, desperately.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, because it's annoying, not because it's homicidal.\u00a0\u00a0All anyone talks about is Hatbot.\u00a0\u00a0They keep walking by my desk repeating everything it says.\u00a0\u00a0I swear, if I hear 'Fuck trees' one more time...\"\u00a0\u00a0She glared down the hall towards the server room.\u00a0\u00a0\"Plus, when I went in there, it kept asking me for nude pictures.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, if it's that big a problem,\" said Dr. Mann, \"why don't you deal with it?\u00a0\u00a0Take direct action!\u00a0\u00a0Destroy Hatbot!\"\n\n\n\nBreak thought about this for a moment, and then shook her head.\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I'd have to get up from my desk.\u00a0\u00a0I've got way too much work to do.\"\n\n\n\n\"But what about when they start bringing Hatbot here?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nThe pencil in her fingers broke.\u00a0\u00a0\"Here?\" she asked, a dangerous gleam in her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\u00a0\u00a0They're going to start taking it on walks around the facility.\u00a0\u00a0It can do its job just as well from anywhere on site.\"\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann had no idea if this were true, but it sounded plausible.\n\n\n\nBreak's eyes narrowed.\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait here,\" she said, taking a handgun from her desk.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll be right back.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann smiled broadly as she stormed off down the hall.\u00a0\u00a0She seemed much more capable than Agent Tam.\u00a0\u00a0Surely she would have the problem dealt with swiftly.\n\n\n\n> \"And that's when all hell broke loose,\" said Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \"Yes.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that Hatbot's power had become stronger by this point.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann knew something was wrong when he heard the screams and smelled the smoke.\u00a0\u00a0Surely Break hadn't accomplished all of that with just one handgun.\n\n\n\nA man stumbled out of the hallway.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes were dripping with the same blackness that had issued from the subject of 047.\u00a0\u00a0More was dripping from his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0He turned to Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"His is coming.\u00a0\u00a0I must...\u00a0\u00a0I must kill Mann.\"\n\n\n\n\"Kill Mann?\" Dr. Mann said, horrified.\u00a0\u00a0\"But I'm Dr.

closet.\n\n\n\nHe breathed a sigh of relief, until he noticed he was not alone.\u00a0\u00a0It was a Class-D holding his face in his hands.\n\n\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Dr. Mann said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Look, I'm hiding here too.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps we can figure out what's happening and stop it.\u00a0\u00a0Your status could be changed if you help the Foundation.\"\n\n\n\nThe man looked up, and Dr. Mann saw that his face was gone, replaced by a dark hole.\u00a0\u00a0Stars could be seen shining in the black.\u00a0\u00a0A scraping, slurping sound could be heard, as though from a great distance.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann started to scream, and then decided that wasted valuable breath that could be more profitably used fleeing.\n\n\n\nHe ran back to his laboratory by a very roundabout route, changing his path whenever he heard footsteps.\u00a0\u00a0When he arrived, there was no one inside.\u00a0\u00a0He locked the door with a quiet sob of relief.\n\n\n\nHe tried to figure out what he should do.\u00a0\u00a0This had to be Hatbot's doing.\u00a0\u00a0Someone had to stop it.\u00a0\u00a0But how?\n\n\n\nHe could only think of one answer.\n\n\n\n> \"So, this was the point you decided to take on

the Foundation who was immune to its effect.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Why do you suppose that was?\" asked the psychologist.\n\n> \n\n> \"Well, I can only theorize, but... Have you ever noticed that the Foundation staff are a bit... eccentric?\" he asked.\n\n> \n\n> \"...Yes,\" said the psychologist.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's been noted.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Well, I think that Hatbot could only influence certain kinds of minds.\u00a0\u00a0It had to be able to create some sort of link.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly, I was immune because I'm so normal.\"\n\n> \n\n> The psychologist coughed.\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes.\u00a0\u00a0Normal.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, you left your laboratory.\u00a0\u00a0What did you do next?\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Next, I fought Hatbot.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann walked down the hallways.\u00a0\u00a0He had encountered the minions of Hatbot several times, mostly guards and D-Class personnel.\u00a0\u00a0He had dispatched them as quietly as he could, but had still ended up running several times as he drew the attention of others.\u00a0\u00a0It was slow, but he finally reached the server room.\n\n\n\nThings were worst here.\u00a0\u00a0The metal of the walls was moving like flesh with worms crawling underneath it.\u00a0\u00a0He saw what might have been men, groaning little inhumanities of black fluid and running flesh, twitching and shuffling along the floor.\n\n\n\nHe moved aside them, and walked into the room itself.\n\n\n\nThere were spiderweb cracks in the air, and the angles were all wrong.\u00a0\u00a0It hurt his eyes to see.\u00a0\u00a0And

As he ran, quickly avoiding small chunks of rubble and broken machinery, his thoughts remained more on the past than the immediate situation at hand. The day\u2019s shift, indeed his entire tour inside SCP-110, had been quiet and routine. Constant work was being done to map and catalog all the areas, engineers were working on ways to crack into the vast areas still sealed off, and there had been no disappearances or deaths for months. Even the main power grid was starting to give up its secrets.</p>\n<p>A deep, bass throb pulsed through the air around Agent Greenwell, accompanied by a shudder in the ground under his feet. He fell, small bits of dust and plaster drifted down from the high-domed ceiling, bringing both a sudden, sharp pain in his ankle and the current situation to the forefront of his mind. Greenwell rose, limping forward as another, louder pulse shook the air and ground.</p>\n<p>They had located a module, labeled \u201cCivic Reclamation: Global Class\u201d. The whole city was riddled with these \u201cmodules\u201d, tiny little self-contained booths, containing everything from emergency supplies to whole laboratories. They appeared to have been activated when the Event happened to SCP-110. Most were still closed, with others appearing to have been damaged or looted at some point. However, this one was different. It was huge, bigger than four city blocks, and heavily re-enforced. It also appeared to have been opened at one point, and then closed back up some time later.</p>\n<p>The team slated to crack it open had gone out that morning. Everything was going as planned, until a sudden loss of contact. Agents had responded to find the entire module missing, along with the staff. Greenwell had responded with them, and had been the first to notice that they had lost contact with Core Services.</p>\n<p>Another heavy rumble rattled through the floor, followed by the faint sound of crashing and twisting metal. Agent Greenwell limped faster, looking around the open area for any nearby doors or exits, and finding none. He gasped as a misstep sent a screaming bolt of pain up his leg, and quickly fell behind a heap of twisted stone and metal, gripping his tortured ankle and feeling the bone slide unnaturally.</p>\n<p>The deep bass pulse came again, loud enough to rattle marble-sized stones on the tile, followed by another\u2026and another. Agent Greenwell balled up, trying to be as small as possible, fighting the gnawing little rat of fear that was trying to work its way into him. The heavy pulse abruptly stopped, the final tone hard enough to make his heart rattle in his chest.</p>\n<p>He stayed silent and still, balled as tight to the hunk of rubble as he could, listening. Nothing came to his ears, just the faint sound of dust settling. He rose, slowly, plotting a clear path to the east wall amid the rubble, trying to sight something to use as a crutch. It was as Agent Greenwell started to hobble to a promising chunk of pipe that a harsh blast of steam and sound burst both his eardrums and sent him sprawling to the ground.</p>\n<p>He screamed, holding his head, blood flowing between his fingers as the shadow loomed over him, floodlights blinding him as the pulse hammered him again, sending him into a spasm of agony. Blind and deaf, he screamed again as hard metal points suddenly dug into his flesh and roughly lifted him, his head spinning and awash in pain.</p>\n<p>He felt rather than heard the grinding of gears, the crackle of electricity. He felt oil, smoke and ash instantly cake to his skin, the taste of metal thick and gagging in his mouth as more hooks and points burrowed into his flesh. As he felt something start to grind and crush his feet, moving up to his ankles, he acknowledged one thing before thought was lost in a wash of pain, blood and oblivion.</p>\n<p>He was afraid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>-Warning!-</strong> Contact lost with SCP-110 command and security. Initiating lock-down. Situation reported to O5 Command.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Grant entered the room, pausing briefly to examine the faces arranged before him with a suspicious glare before sitting down.</p>\n<p>He reached into his pocket, digging out a battered box of cigarettes and a pulled one out.\u201cHeh, still looking us through for doppelgangers, Grant?\u201d laughed Richards, running his hand over his shaved head unconsciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappened before. Take no chances,\u201d grunted Grant, lighting the cigarette with a thick metal lighter and taking a long drag. \u201cSo what do you think it is this time? Mutating virus? Artifact retrieval? Or just your stereotypical big nasty?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Grant shrugged, eyes on the floor as he hunched over, leaning on his knees and exhaling a frail cloud of wispy grey smoke. \u201cDon\u2019t care. Just wanna kill it and go home,\u201d he mumbled in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, me and pretty much everyone here, man,\u201d Richards replied, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms behind his head. Everyone always does, he thought to himself, eyes running across those assembled.</p>\n<p>Everyone was tense, as they always were before a mission. Sure, it was masked beneath a thick veneer of joking and comraderie, but if you knew where to look, the signs were there. The newbies would fidget unconsciously with little things at hand, chuckling nervously as they made idiotic boasts, betraying their ignorance of the things against which they would inevitably fight, and sometimes die.</p>\n<p>The veterans would smile and joke, though the humor never reached their eyes, as they had seen too many friends succumb to the horrors of their line of work, both physically and figuratively.</p>\n<p>And then there were the loners like Grant, who never connected with anyone, just sat there, waiting for the mission to start like a man would an execution.<br/>\nThe door opened again, and upon seeing who it was, everyone went silent.</p>\n<p>The man paced through the center of the benches, picking up everything with those bored eyes, before slouching against the wall at the end.<br/>\n\u201cSo\u2026 boss, you know what\u2019s going down?\u201d asked Hill nervously. Everything that was ever said to the boss was almost always said nervously. A slight side effect of the boss being completely psychotic and liable to snap with little to no provoking.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied tersely.</p>\n<p>Hill opened her mouth to say something else, but slowly closed it, rather than tempt fate.<br/>\nSmart move, thought Richards. Now that he was here, all comradely music and such quieted down, trying to be as inauspicious as a man tip toeing through a minefield.</p>\n<p>This continued for some time, until suddenly, the view screen at the end of the room lit up, displaying a blank screen with only the words \u201cAUDIO ONLY\u201d stretched across the middle in bright red lettering.<br/>\nEveryone began to shift in their seats uncomfortably at this new development.</p>\n<p>They only used the view screen when they were delivering messages that they wouldn\u2019t in person.<br/>\nThe man slumped against the wall narrowed his eyes at the screen, looking in irritation at the small camera positioned in above it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmega Seven, here are your orders. We have recently received a distress call from an outpost inside a recently unearthed SCP site. Since receiving that message, we have completely lost contact with the area,\u201d informed the disembodied voice coming from the VDU\u2019s tinny speakers. \u201cYou are to investigate the area and exterminate any and all threats in the immediate vicinity. Transport is in three hours at docking bay four, and all equipment will be provided en route,\u201d it ordered calmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh\u2026 seems pretty standard,\u201d replied Foley.<br/>\nThen, almost as if an afterthought, the speakers called out once more. \u201cAlso, Pandora\u2019s Box will be protecting, escorting and working with Mobile Task Force Zeta-9.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room went dead silent as the view screen faded to black, save for a very slight crack sound at the very back of the room, followed by the sound of something small, light and hard tumbling across the floor.</p>\n<p>The entire group, as a whole, turned to look at the source of this sound. The boss had clenched his teeth so hard that one of them had cracked and popped out of his hideous grin underneath the immense strain, his jaws clamping down like an industrial vise.</p>\n<p>The room emptied in seconds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 - 0900 Hours:</strong> Mobile Force Omega-7 informed of mission and mission specifics.<br/>\nBriefing room 8 completely destroyed by SCP-076-2</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cListen\u2026Hey, listen up\u2026guys\u2026LISTEN UP!\u201d Roy shouted into the common room, quieting the rumble of voices from the Zeta-9 team. A few more members ambled out of the equipment room in full suits, clomping across the room like shock troopers from every Evil Empire in sci-fi history. Several men strengthened up in their chairs, elbowing others with a whispered \u201cknock it off!\u201d as the room quieted. After a look around the room, to assure everyone\u2019s full attention, Roy cleared his throat, and addressed the men. \u201cAlright folks, I know everyone\u2019s heard the rumors about us getting mothballed after that SCP-455 cock-up last year. Let me lay those to rest right now. At 0900 hours, we received a dispatch order. Everyone is to suit up immediately after this meeting, and report to Dispatch. I\u2019ll turn this over to Lev for the details.\u201d</p>\n<p>Roy sat down amid a murmur of hushed conversation and suppressed groans. Two younger men looked at each other, grinning excitedly. The murmur stopped when one of the suited men stepped forward, cracking the seal on his helmet and removing it as he stepped into the center of the circle of men. Lev Shatterman\u2019s face, looking oddly small on the bulky, armored suit, was as grim as ever. His deep voice boomed into the room, the thick Russian accent giving everything a heavy note of command. \u201cComrades, we have lost contact with the support team inside SCP-110. Hostile activity has been suggested as a cause. The site is currently locked down to prevent any further containment failures. Someone is needed to crack the seal, restore containment, and find out what happened. That someone will be Team Zeta-9.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cheers and groans rose up in equal amounts, the two younger men exchanging a high-five and grinning. Lev cleared his throat hard, silencing the room. \u201cWe will be working with many support services and teams, and will function as forward recon. We have been selected for our small size, high mobility, high survival rate, and large-scale SCP experience.\u201d Lev paused a moment, shifting his helmet in his hands as the men murmured quietly. \u201cDue to the high probability of hostile resistance inside SCP-110, we will be teamed with a combat-based response team to provide combat support, with our function being focused on recon and investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room went silent as everyone slowly turned to look at Lev. Roy was the first to speak. \u201cLev\u2026what the hell does that mean? Are you saying we have to work with some guns-blazing, gung-ho strike force full of kids who think they\u2019ll be the world\u2019s next big hero?\u201d Lev shook his head, readying his helmet in his hand. \u201cNo. As I understand it, our support team is more close-quarters based. We will receive support from Team Omega-7, led by SCP-076-2. Dismissed, everyone report to dispatch in one hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lev snapped his helmet back into place, and strode quickly from the room. The remaining men were stone silent, still staring where Lev had been. They started to file out, slowly, the two younger men pale and almost sick looking. Roy watched the room empty, and shook his head, muttering under his breath. \u201c\u2026might as well just shoot ourselves now and get it over and done with\u2026\u201d</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dispatch issued to Zeta-9 at 0900 hours. All teams proceeding to set rally points. Operation will commence ASAP. Request by SCP-076-2 to remove Zeta-9 from operations denied. Request by multiple members of Zeta-9 for temporary leave denied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-lockdown-closed\">The Lockdown - Closed</a> - <em>Under Construction</em></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-lockdown\">The Lockdown - Introduction</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

A slight side effect of the boss being completely psychotic and liable to snap with little to no provoking.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied tersely.\n\n\n\nHill opened her mouth to say something else, but slowly closed it, rather than tempt fate.\n\nSmart move, thought Richards.\u00a0\u00a0Now that he was here, all comradely music and such quieted down, trying to be as inauspicious as a man tip toeing through a minefield.\n\n\n\nThis continued for some time, until suddenly, the view screen at the end of the room lit up, displaying a blank screen with only the words \u201cAUDIO ONLY\u201d stretched across the middle in bright red lettering.\n\nEveryone began to shift in their seats uncomfortably at this new development.\n\n\n\nThey only used the view screen when they were delivering messages that they wouldn\u2019t in person.\n\nThe man slumped against the wall narrowed his eyes at the screen, looking in irritation at the small camera positioned in above it.\n\n\n\n\u201cOmega Seven, here are your orders. We have recently received a distress call from an outpost inside a recently unearthed SCP site. Since receiving that message, we have completely lost contact with the area,\u201d informed the disembodied voice coming from the VDU\u2019s tinny speakers.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou are to investigate the area and exterminate any and all threats in the immediate vicinity. Transport is in three hours at docking bay four, and all equipment will be provided en route,\u201d it ordered calmly.\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh\u2026 seems pretty standard,\u201d replied Foley.\n\nThen, almost as if an afterthought, the speakers called out once more.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlso, Pandora\u2019s Box will be protecting, escorting and working with Mobile Task Force Zeta-9.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe room went dead silent as the view screen faded to black, save for a very slight crack sound at the very back of the room, followed by the sound of something small, light and hard tumbling across the floor.\n\n\n\nThe entire group, as a whole, turned to look at the source of this sound.\u00a0\u00a0The boss had clenched his teeth so hard that one of them had cracked and popped out of his hideous grin underneath the immense strain, his jaws clamping down like an industrial vise.\n\n\n\nThe room emptied in seconds.\n\n\n\n> **\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 - 0900 Hours:** Mobile Force Omega-7 informed of mission and mission specifics.\n\n> Briefing room 8 completely destroyed by SCP-076-2\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cListen\u2026Hey, listen up\u2026guys\u2026LISTEN UP!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Roy shouted into the common room, quieting the rumble of voices from the Zeta-9 team.\u00a0\u00a0A few more members ambled out of the equipment room in full suits, clomping across the room like shock troopers from every Evil Empire in sci-fi history.\u00a0\u00a0Several men strengthened up in their chairs, elbowing others with a whispered \u201cknock it off!\u201d as the room quieted.\u00a0\u00a0After a look around the room, to assure everyone\u2019s full attention, Roy cleared his throat, and addressed the men.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright folks, I know everyone\u2019s heard the rumors about us getting mothballed after that SCP-455 cock-up last year.\u00a0\u00a0Let me lay those to rest right now.\u00a0\u00a0At 0900 hours, we received a dispatch order.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is to suit up immediately after this meeting, and report to Dispatch.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll turn this over to Lev for the details.\u201d\n\n\n\nRoy sat down amid a murmur of hushed conversation and suppressed groans.\u00a0\u00a0Two younger men looked at each other, grinning excitedly.\u00a0\u00a0The murmur stopped when one of the suited men stepped forward, cracking the seal on his helmet and removing it as he stepped into the center of the circle of men.\u00a0\u00a0Lev Shatterman\u2019s face, looking oddly small on the bulky, armored suit, was as grim as ever.\u00a0\u00a0His deep voice boomed into the room, the thick Russian accent giving everything a heavy note of command.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cComrades, we have lost contact with the support team inside SCP-110.\u00a0\u00a0Hostile activity has been suggested as a cause.\u00a0\u00a0The site is currently locked down to prevent any further containment failures.\u00a0\u00a0Someone is needed to crack the seal, restore containment, and find out what happened.\u00a0\u00a0That someone will be Team Zeta-9.\u201d\n\n\n\nCheers and groans rose up in equal amounts, the two younger men exchanging a high-five and grinning.\u00a0\u00a0Lev cleared his throat hard, silencing the room.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe will be working with many support services and teams, and will function as forward recon.\u00a0\u00a0We have been selected for our small size, high mobility, high survival rate, and large-scale SCP experience.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Lev paused a moment, shifting his helmet in his hands as the men murmured quietly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDue to the high probability of hostile resistance inside SCP-110, we will be teamed with a combat-based response team to provide combat support, with our function being focused on recon and investigation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe room went silent as everyone slowly turned to look at Lev.\u00a0\u00a0Roy was the first to speak.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLev\u2026what the hell does that mean?\u00a0\u00a0Are you saying we have to work with some guns-blazing, gung-ho strike force full of kids who think they\u2019ll be the world\u2019s next big hero?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Lev shook his head, readying his helmet in his hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo.\u00a0\u00a0As I understand it, our support team is more close-quarters based.\u00a0\u00a0We will receive support from Team Omega-7, led by SCP-076-2.\u00a0\u00a0Dismissed, everyone report to dispatch in one hour.\u201d\n\n\n\nLev snapped his helmet back into place, and strode quickly from the room.\u00a0\u00a0The remaining men were stone silent, still staring where Lev had been.\u00a0\u00a0They started to file out, slowly, the two younger men pale and almost sick looking.\u00a0\u00a0Roy watched the room empty, and shook his head, muttering under his breath.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026might as well just shoot ourselves now and get it over and done with\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n> Dispatch issued to Zeta-9 at 0900 hours.\u00a0\u00a0All teams proceeding to set rally points.\u00a0\u00a0Operation will commence ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0Request by SCP-076-2 to remove Zeta-9 from operations denied.\u00a0\u00a0Request by multiple members of Zeta-9 for temporary leave denied.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[[The Lockdown -

Pure light and sound exploded into being in my skull. I sat immobile, staring unblinking at the yellow wall- its normally calm hum now a bee-swarm buzz. An inhuman, pitch-black scream ran through me, and there was a distant awareness of 598 grappling it with sheer will. Flipping it onto its back.

I snap back. The screaming is still there and spurting liquid ink tendrils, I catch a smiling thought that looks a lot like a \u201cHah\u201d.

A sudden door slam far behind them made the older man cry out, to be quickly stifled by the younger as they picked up their pace.\n<p>\u201cThis is wrong, we shouldn\u2019t be doing this. They are going to find out, they have eyes everywhere,\u201d the older man looked about the ceilings, seeming to search for cameras.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust shut up and get it to the lab. Once we\u2019re there, we can just say it got spat out from some test. It\u2019s shift change, and as long as nothing hits the fan, they won\u2019t look over hallway tapes that closely.\u201d The younger man scratched his arm nervously, pushing the cart at just under a run. \u201cBeside, we\u2019d never get it up and running without this stuff. We need it, and The Foundation would never let us have it without years of testing. Just shut up, smile, and nod at the right times.\u201d</p>\n<p>The older man grumbled as he pushed open a heavy door, letting out a puff of very cool, well-filtered air. \u201cI still think this is a bad idea. Dr. Valence may have told us to get this done by any means, but I really doubt he meant this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The younger man sighed, shaking his head as he pushed the cart past the older man and into the room. \u201cListen, all that matters is the bottom line. It's two years of research into biomechanics, polymorphic computational components, and tons of red tape, or an hour with a screwdriver and some sterile gloves. Now shut the damn door so we can get in the clean room.\u201d</p>\n<p>The older man complied, grumbling something about a church as the door swung shut.</p>\n<p>Neither noticed the small drop of gray liquid that had dripped from the cart. Neither noticed it suddenly gain surface tension and roll like a washed out drop of mercury either. The blob quickly slid under the microscopic gap under the door, and rolled quickly up the outside of the older man\u2019s pant leg, before hopping across and sliding back under the cloth covering the cart. Both men were too absorbed in the task at hand to notice the small shift under the cloth, and too focused on the robotic frame in front of them to contemplate it even if they had noticed it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He sat in the middle of the smoke. He sat and inhaled deeply, eyelids fluttering, sweat dripping from his body to mix with the soot and ash on his skin. The smoke was strong, and smelled of machine oil, wood, coal and flesh as it billowed from four grates in the floor, pooling in a noxious cloud in the ceiling as the ash rained down. He opened his mouth, and exhaled the smoke, pouring forth the ash and soot as would the Lord. Truly he felt the touch of God, felt his body within his own, his flesh within-</p>\n<p>A sudden knock on the unseen door broke his concentration, causing him to cough on the suddenly biting and acrid smoke. A few choking, hoarse commands caused the grates to snap shut and the ceiling to open, the smoke quickly venting away. He pulled on the heaped robe he had hung in the corner, still coughing and silently cursing whoever had broken his communion. He wrenched open the door, letting a thin yellow light spill in. \u201cI swear to you, if this is any less then a message of the utmost end of need, I will personally head up an Inquisition on your behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p>The young girl kneeling in the hall trembled, wincing and trying to shrink into an even smaller heap. \"I-I w-was told,\u201d she stammered, near tears, her voice starting to waver.</p>\n<p>He sighed, crouching down and taking her chin in his hand, tilting her face up to see her green eyes nearly drowning in unwept tears. He smiled, the black ash and soot causing his teeth to shine even whiter. \u201cEase, my child. I was in deep communion with the Lord. Your coming scattered His Voice, it is not your fault. Calm yourself, and speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl rubbed her face with her wrist, managing a small smile before blushing slightly and looking away. \u201cI was told to come and tell you that the Will of God had been delivered to the Jailors.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinked several times, the girl shyly looking back and smiling, but his returning grin was not for her. Indeed, his eyes appeared to be miles away as he asked, \u201cWho has done this great thing? Who has delivered Salvation to the Corrupted?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother Jacob,\u201d said the girl, watching as he rose again, \u201che is still coming back, but I was told that the Will had been given over freely to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He quickly stepped around her, striding down the hall without a word, leaving her still kneeling and watching his quickly receding form. Truly, he thought as he quickly went to meet with the Faithful, God is great. Even as he is Broken, the portions of the Lord can still do his Will.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cDr. Valence, a question: why do you call it \u2018hatbot\u2019? Isn\u2019t there something a little more,\" the researcher paused for a moment, lost in thought, \"appropriate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Valence shook his head, still grinning at the assembled staff. Behind him stood a small, slightly skeletal android, with what appeared to be a top hat pulled three quarters of the way down on its \u201chead\u201d, leaving only a small LCD screen displayed below it. To the robot\u2019s left stood a nervous older man with a name tag reading \u201cProf. Grommet\u201d, and to its right stood a beaming young man in a suit, whose name tag declared him as \u201cAgent Gild\u201d.</p>\n<p>Dr. Valence shook his finger playfully at the staff member who had asked the question. \u201cNow now young man, didn\u2019t anyone teach you not to question your elders?\u201d The assembled staff chuckled, and the questioning doctor\u2019s face started to take on a mild shade of red. \u201cYes, Hatbot does seem like a very silly name, however during the initial testing, the processing unit looked very similar to a top hat. We\u2019ve moved away from that design with the now completed prototype, however the name has stuck. Also, the somewhat whimsical configuration allows for more acceptance and ease of interaction.\u201d The good doctor continued to beam like a proud father as he gestured to Prof. Grommet, who quickly reached over and pressed a sequence of buttons on the robot\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>The robot suddenly sprang up in a slight hop, before landing several inches forward of its original position, causing many of the staff to abruptly retreat several steps, a few of them even producing weapons. The LCD screen below the top hat suddenly lit up, and the robot raised one skeletal, wire-wrapped arm and waved to the staff, while a small animated cartoon mouth appeared on the LCD and a voice emanated from it. \u201cHello, I am Hatbot! Hatbot I am. Hello!\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence dominated the room for several seconds. Dr. Valence\u2019s smile faltered a moment as he observed none of the staff to be abandoning their position of retreat. Or their firearms. \u201cHatbot, don\u2019t be rude,\u201d he said, keeping the nervousness from his voice with a small effort, \u201cLet the nice people know what you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>The robot suddenly snapped to attention, and rattled off the lines not unlike a new army recruit. \u201cHatbot is a speech recognition, interpretation, and deciphering system! Hatbot\u2019s polymorphic computational matrix is able to adapt, interpret, and utilize any form of vocal or written communication!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Valence was suddenly bombarded with questions as the staff overcame their initial concern with the desire to know more. Several began to test Hatbot\u2019s speech capabilities, watching as it not only parroted back words, but then use them in new sentences. Dr. Valence described various technical details, and laid out his proposal to use it to decipher some of the unreadable texts and untranslatable languages that The Foundation had been unable to crack.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor, how did you develop a processor capable of such advanced communication recognition in such a short time? You\u2019ve only had this project a few months, it seems almost impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone was too engrossed in Dr. Valence\u2019s reply about \u201clate night 914 work\u201d and Hatbot\u2019s slightly confusing responses to notice the sudden cold sweat break out on Professor Grommet\u2019s face, and the harsh, silencing look from Agent Gild. The staff started to slowly filter out as Dr. Valence stated his need to run more tests. Two lingered, however, watching Hatbot and the two men who stood slightly behind them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong boy? Got the scent? Did Timmy fall down the well?\u201d the short woman asked, using a tone better reserved for a small, over-eager puppy.</p>\n<p>The tall man in the outlandish hat to whom this statement was addressed continued to stare and grin at the small robot. \u201cThat is the most evil thing I've seen in years,\" he said, continuing to smile cheerfully. \"I think there\u2019s a world-destroying demon in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman laughed, swatting his arm. \u201cOh would you lay off the \u2018I\u2019m The Devil, booga booga!\u2019 crap? It\u2019s a weird little socially awkward robot who has issues communicating normally. Basically someone made a fun-size Dr. Gears.\"</p>\n<p>\"I shouldn't leave. Every time I do, things go to pot. I don't know why I let Glass convince me to do this,\" the tall man muttered. The pom-poms on the rim of his hat swayed gently. \"Maybe I should cancel. Tell the others I'm staying here, just to be sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't be such a stick-up the ass. Try to relax, you're on vacation. Now, can we please go?\u201d She grabbed his arm, starting to tug him away, and he reluctantly followed, craning his neck to try and still see the robot.</p>\n<p>Had he hesitated a few seconds more before being pulled through the doorway, he would have noticed the sudden flicker in the mouth screen. It was quickly back to its normal, smiling mouth, but for a moment, it displayed a roiling, bubbling mass of grey strings, wavering against an oily, black background.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI am the best!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI am the best!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNo, no\u2026me, I and the best!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNo, me!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The security guard sighed, rubbing his forehead. The little goofy robot was neat, but it was about as smart as a bag of doorknobs. After getting it to repeat a bunch of swear words, the game was starting to get old. He stood, looking down at the little robot. The top hat tilted up, the screen flicking on to the animated mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d<br/>\n\u201c\u2026What did you say?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cDamn me, and damn you.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWhatever, just shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard was a little nervous. He probably wasn\u2019t supposed to be playing with this thing, but being alone on-site at night was probably the worst thing ever in his opinion. Another voice helped ease things a bit, even if it was only from a weird little robot. Now, however, he was getting worried about what might happen if people found out he\u2019d been screwing around with this thing. He hurriedly picked up his rifle from the floor and looked over the bot.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything looks ok, I think\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cEverything is just fine. Come to me.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cListen; don\u2019t tell anyone those things I taught you, ok?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cThe hate pours hard in the eyes of you, you must join in.\u201d</p>\n<p>The robot\u2019s ever-smiling mouth was starting to get a little creepy, along with the weird shit it was saying. He backed away a bit, looking it over to see if there were any obvious issues. Then he saw the leak. He felt the blood drain from his face as he watched a slow drip of grayish goo drip from a seam in the back of the \u201chead\u201d, slowly slipping down its back.</p>\n<p>\u201cShitshitshitshit!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cShit your pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>He quickly looked around for a cloth or anything to wipe it up with, but found nothing. Cursing again, he reached out as tried to scoop up as much as he could with his hands. He wiped the oily substance on to the back of his pants, thankful that it didn\u2019t appear to stain. Pulling down his sleeves, he used them to rub off the rest of the residue. Watching for a little bit, to make sure nothing else was coming out, he nodded, some color coming back to his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank God\u2026must have gotten something on you\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI have gotten.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYeah, I guess. Gotta be hopping little guy!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cBe seeing you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>He quickly walked out of the room, making his way to the closed offices for his rounds, ignoring the mild tingling in his hands. Probably some kind of chemical or something in it, have to hit the bathroom and wash up. As he turned down the hall, he had the sudden compulsion to go to the break room, or the main entry. He almost made a wrong turn, but shook his head and headed in to the bathroom. Stupid robot must have scared him worse then he\u2019d thought. Although, he had made only one sweep of the entry way\u2026another wouldn\u2019t hurt. He hurriedly left the bathroom without washing, leaving his gun on the counter. Had anyone been watching, they might have had concern over the glassiness of his eyes, or his oddly uncoordinated walk.</p>\n<p>No one was, however, and he quickly walked through the double doors in to the main entry. The door closed behind him, and silence ruled the hall for half an hour. A sudden, loud shouting broke this calm, but was quickly stifled, the cool darkness of the site once again unbroken and total.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The word processor\u2019s animated paper clip assistant waves and winks at you. Your colleagues have told you multiple times that the thing is just a pain in the ass, but personally you think he\u2019s kinda cute. Besides, he does help keep you awake at night, especially during long shifts such as this one. You blink hard and refocus on the task at hand. Before you rests a seemingly bottomless pile of notes to be transcribed into digital format for storage, which you\u2019ve been working at all night. However, even though there\u2019s no end in sight to the paperwork, you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not interesting. Hatbot is one hell of a piece of engineering, you think to yourself.</p>\n<p>More papers, more notes, more time spent. You look at the clock and realize it\u2019s nearly one in the A.M., then groan in annoyance. You always told yourself that you would never end up being one of the graveyard shift paper pushers, not while working in this place. Never.</p>\n<p>So much for that, eh.</p>\n<p>Eyelids droop across your vision and you decide a strong mug of coffee is just what you need. It\u2019s hot and full of caffeine, but you notice some odd greasy residue on your hands when you replace the pot on the burner. Thinking nothing of it, you wipe it on your clothes and return to work. The coffee helps; you immediately feel a bit more alert, and your productivity increases markedly. Maybe you\u2019ll finish after all.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe not. You blink and stare at the screen in disbelief; this entire page is full of angry red scribbles and Clippy is yelling at you for being so careless. Thank god he takes the liberty of fixing most of your errors, but the damage to your pride is done. Another page and yet more typos crop up, slowing you down even further. You wonder what the hell was in that coffee because this is simply ridiculous. You make a mental note to send Mavis Beacon an angry letter, should you ever get time to do so. Clippy, meanwhile, dutifully goes about cleaning up your ham-handed mistakes.</p>\n<p>Blink again, look at the screen. No, Look at it closer. Your simple misspellings are beginning to translate into completely erroneous phrases. Phrases spill into complete sentences, and soon you have entire paragraphs of gibberish. Mash the backspace key sluggishly, you\u2019re so tired that you have to force yourself to do even that. The cursor stops, seemingly on its own, bracketing your attention around a peculiar piece of writing.</p>\n<p>\"So, we started to come to the blackness that yawns beneath the layers of thought, of reality itself.\"</p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u2026Did I write this?\u201d</em> You hear yourself ask. At the same time you notice your palms moisten and you draw in a sharp, fearful breath. Or at least you try to, instead managing to wheeze ineffectually. <em>\u201c\u2026Try again. Keep trying, finish up and go to sleep.\u201d</em> Your hands manipulate the keys, but what you think is not what you type.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlackness awaits you. In your thoughts and in your dreams, there is only blackness. It awaits us all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another hard blink. <em>\u201cTurn it off. Turn the computer off, you\u2019re done here,\u201d</em> you panic to yourself, but your hands continue to type on a whim of their own. You don\u2019t give up so easily though, you\u2019re a tough girl, and it took you a lot of hard work to get here. You power through the mental barrier and stand, trembling, staggering towards the doorway. Unconsciously your hands move to your eyes; when you hold them before you, they are covered in black oil.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cGet help. Get out of here.\u201d</em> The airlock opens with a hiss as you lurch into the hall and collide with one of the posted guards. Your mind screams at you to speak to him, but no words come from your mouth. Your actions are not your own anymore; you swing at the man, startling him, but he quickly subdues you and knocks you to the ground.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHelp! Help me!\u201d</em> you scream to yourself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, too, will contribute to the black. The empty. The abyss,\u201d is what you manage to croak. Your heart races and you sweat profusely, only it's not sweat: it\u2019s that same oily mess. Your mind contorts in agony as the realization strikes home that you are not yourself anymore, this body is no longer yours. Your mind is all that\u2019s left of you, and nobody will ever see the real you again. You lost the battle for control of yourself long ago.</p>\n<p>You are trapped, in this body. And all that awaits you is the blackness.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/thy-will-be-done\">Thy Will Be Done</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

older man looked about the ceilings, seeming to search for cameras.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust shut up and get it to the lab.\u00a0\u00a0Once we\u2019re there, we can just say it got spat out from some test.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s shift change, and as long as nothing hits the fan, they won\u2019t look over hallway tapes that closely.\u201d The younger man scratched his arm nervously, pushing the cart at just under a run.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBeside, we\u2019d never get it up and running without this stuff.\u00a0\u00a0We need it, and The Foundation would never let us have it without years of testing.\u00a0\u00a0Just shut up, smile, and nod at the right times.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe older man grumbled as he pushed open a heavy door, letting out a puff of very cool, well-filtered air.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI still think this is a bad idea.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Valence may have told us to get this done by any means, but I really doubt he meant this.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe younger man sighed, shaking his head as he pushed the cart past the older man and into the room.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, all that matters is the bottom line.\u00a0\u00a0It's two years of research into biomechanics, polymorphic computational components, and tons of red tape, or an hour with a screwdriver and some sterile gloves.\u00a0\u00a0Now shut the damn door so we can get in the clean room.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe older man complied, grumbling something about a church as the door swung shut.\n\n\n\nNeither noticed the small drop of gray liquid that had dripped from the cart.\u00a0\u00a0Neither noticed it suddenly gain surface tension and roll like a washed out drop of mercury either.\u00a0\u00a0The blob quickly slid under the microscopic gap under the door, and rolled quickly up the outside of the older man\u2019s pant leg, before hopping across and sliding back under the cloth covering the cart.\u00a0\u00a0Both men were too absorbed in the task at hand to notice the small shift under the cloth, and too focused on the robotic frame in front of them to contemplate it even if they had noticed it.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nHe sat in the middle of the smoke.\u00a0\u00a0He sat and inhaled deeply, eyelids fluttering, sweat dripping from his body to mix with the soot and ash on his skin.\u00a0\u00a0The smoke was strong, and smelled of machine oil, wood, coal and flesh as it billowed from four grates in the floor, pooling in a noxious cloud in the ceiling as the ash rained down.\u00a0\u00a0He opened his mouth, and exhaled the smoke, pouring forth the ash and soot as would the Lord.\u00a0\u00a0Truly he felt the touch of God, felt his body within his own, his flesh within-\n\n\n\nA sudden knock on the unseen door broke his concentration, causing him to cough on the suddenly biting and acrid smoke.\u00a0\u00a0A few choking, hoarse commands caused the grates to snap shut and the ceiling to open, the smoke quickly venting away.\u00a0\u00a0He pulled on the heaped robe he had hung in the corner, still coughing and silently cursing whoever had broken his communion.\u00a0\u00a0He wrenched open the door, letting a thin yellow light spill in.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI swear to you, if this is any less then a message of the utmost end of need, I will personally head up an Inquisition on your behalf.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe young girl kneeling in the hall trembled, wincing and trying to shrink into an even smaller heap.\u00a0\u00a0\"I-I w-was told,\u201d she stammered, near tears, her voice starting to waver.\n\n\n\nHe sighed, crouching down and taking her chin in his hand, tilting her face up to see her green eyes nearly drowning in unwept tears.\u00a0\u00a0He smiled, the black ash and soot causing his teeth to shine even whiter.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEase, my child.\u00a0\u00a0I was in deep communion with the Lord.\u00a0\u00a0Your coming scattered His Voice, it is not your fault.\u00a0\u00a0Calm yourself, and speak.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe girl rubbed her face with her wrist, managing a small smile before blushing slightly and looking away.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was told to come and tell you that the Will of God had been delivered to the Jailors.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe blinked several times, the girl shyly looking back and smiling, but his returning grin was not for her.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, his eyes appeared to be miles away as he asked, \u201cWho has done this great thing?\u00a0\u00a0Who has delivered Salvation to the Corrupted?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBrother Jacob,\u201d said the girl, watching as he rose again, \u201che is still coming back, but I was told that the Will had been given over freely to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe quickly stepped around her, striding down the hall without a word, leaving her still kneeling and watching his quickly receding form.\u00a0\u00a0Truly, he thought as he quickly went to meet with the Faithful, God is great.\u00a0\u00a0Even as he is Broken, the portions of the Lord can still do his Will.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Valence, a question:\u00a0\u00a0why do you call it \u2018hatbot\u2019?\u00a0\u00a0Isn\u2019t there something a little more,\" the researcher paused for a moment, lost in thought, \"appropriate?\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Valence shook his head, still grinning at the assembled staff.\u00a0\u00a0Behind him stood a small, slightly skeletal android, with what appeared to be a top hat pulled three quarters of the way down on its \u201chead\u201d, leaving only a small LCD screen displayed below it.\u00a0\u00a0To the robot\u2019s left stood a nervous older man with a name tag reading \u201cProf. Grommet\u201d, and to its right stood a beaming young man in a suit, whose name tag declared him as \u201cAgent Gild\u201d.\n\n\n\nDr. Valence shook his finger playfully at the staff member who had asked the question.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNow now young man, didn\u2019t anyone teach you not to question your elders?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The assembled staff chuckled, and the questioning doctor\u2019s face started to take on a mild shade of red.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes, Hatbot does seem like a very silly name, however during the initial testing, the processing unit looked very similar to a top hat.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve moved away from that design with the now completed prototype, however the name has stuck.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the somewhat whimsical configuration allows for more acceptance and ease of interaction.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The good doctor continued to beam like a proud father as he gestured to Prof. Grommet, who quickly reached over and pressed a sequence of buttons on the robot\u2019s back.\n\n\n\nThe robot suddenly sprang up in a slight hop, before landing several inches forward of its original position, causing many of the staff to abruptly retreat several steps, a few of them even producing weapons.\u00a0\u00a0The LCD screen below the top hat suddenly lit up, and the robot raised one skeletal, wire-wrapped arm and waved to the staff, while a small animated cartoon mouth appeared on the LCD and a voice emanated from it.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHello, I am Hatbot!\u00a0\u00a0Hatbot I am.\u00a0\u00a0Hello!\u201d\n\n\n\nSilence dominated the room for several seconds.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Valence\u2019s smile faltered a moment as he observed none of the staff to be abandoning their position of retreat.\u00a0\u00a0Or their firearms.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHatbot, don\u2019t be rude,\u201d he said, keeping the nervousness from his voice with a small effort, \u201cLet the nice people know what you are.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe robot suddenly snapped to attention, and rattled off the lines not unlike a new army recruit.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHatbot is a speech recognition, interpretation, and deciphering system!\u00a0\u00a0Hatbot\u2019s polymorphic computational matrix is able to adapt, interpret, and utilize any form of vocal or written communication!\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Valence was suddenly bombarded with questions as the staff overcame their initial concern with the desire to know more.\u00a0\u00a0Several began to test Hatbot\u2019s speech capabilities, watching as it not only parroted back words, but then use them in new sentences.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Valence described various technical details, and laid out his proposal to use it to decipher some of the unreadable texts and untranslatable languages that The Foundation had been unable to crack.\n\n\n\n\u201cDoctor, how did you develop a processor capable of such advanced communication recognition in such a short time?\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve only had this project a few months, it seems almost impossible.\u201d\n\n\n\nEveryone was too engrossed in Dr. Valence\u2019s reply about \u201clate night 914 work\u201d and Hatbot\u2019s slightly confusing responses to notice the sudden cold sweat break out on Professor Grommet\u2019s face, and the harsh, silencing look from Agent Gild.\u00a0\u00a0The staff started to slowly filter out as Dr. Valence stated his need to run more tests.\u00a0\u00a0Two lingered, however, watching Hatbot and the two men who stood slightly behind them.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong boy?\u00a0\u00a0Got the scent?\u00a0\u00a0Did Timmy fall down the well?\u201d the short woman asked, using a tone better reserved for a small, over-eager puppy. \n\n\n\nThe tall man in the outlandish hat to whom this statement was addressed continued to stare and grin at the small robot.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat is the most evil thing I've seen in years,\" he said, continuing to smile cheerfully.\u00a0\u00a0\"I think there\u2019s a world-destroying demon in it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe woman laughed, swatting his arm.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh would you lay off the \u2018I\u2019m The Devil, booga booga!\u2019 crap?\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s a weird little socially awkward robot who has issues communicating normally.\u00a0\u00a0Basically someone made a fun-size Dr. Gears.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I shouldn't leave. Every time I do, things go to pot. I don't know why I let Glass convince me to do this,\" the tall man muttered. The pom-poms on the rim of his hat swayed gently. \"Maybe I should cancel. Tell the others I'm staying here, just to be sure.\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't be such a stick-up the ass. Try to relax, you're on vacation. Now, can we please go?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0She grabbed his arm, starting to tug him away, and he reluctantly followed, craning his neck to try and still see the robot.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHad he hesitated a few seconds more before being pulled through the doorway, he would have noticed the sudden flicker in the mouth screen.\u00a0\u00a0It was quickly back to its normal, smiling mouth, but for a moment, it displayed a roiling, bubbling mass of grey strings, wavering against an oily, black background.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cI am the best!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the best!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no\u2026me, I and the best!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe security guard sighed, rubbing his forehead.\u00a0\u00a0The little goofy robot was neat, but it was about as smart as a bag of doorknobs.\u00a0\u00a0After getting it to repeat a bunch of swear words, the game was starting to get old.\u00a0\u00a0He stood, looking down at the little robot.\u00a0\u00a0The top hat tilted up, the screen flicking on to the animated mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cDamn you.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026What did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn me, and damn you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever, just shut up.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guard was a little nervous.\u00a0\u00a0He probably wasn\u2019t supposed to be playing with this thing, but being alone on-site at night was probably the worst thing ever in his opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Another voice helped ease things a bit, even if it was only from a weird little robot.\u00a0\u00a0Now, however, he was getting worried about what might happen if people found out he\u2019d been screwing around with this thing.\u00a0\u00a0He hurriedly picked up his rifle from the floor and looked over the bot.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverything looks ok, I think...\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Come to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen; don\u2019t tell anyone those things I taught you, ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hate pours hard in the eyes of you, you must join in.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe robot\u2019s ever-smiling mouth was starting to get a little creepy, along with the weird shit it was saying.\u00a0\u00a0He backed away a bit, looking it over to see if there were any obvious issues.\u00a0\u00a0Then he saw the leak.\u00a0\u00a0He felt the blood drain from his face as he watched a slow drip of grayish goo drip from a seam in the back of the \u201chead\u201d, slowly slipping down its back.\n\n\n\n\u201cShitshitshitshit!\u201d\n\n\u201cShit your pain.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe quickly looked around for a cloth or anything to wipe it up with, but found nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Cursing again, he reached out as tried to scoop up as much as he could with his hands.\u00a0\u00a0He wiped the oily substance on to the back of his pants, thankful that it didn\u2019t appear to stain.\u00a0\u00a0Pulling down his sleeves, he used them to rub off the rest of the residue.\u00a0\u00a0Watching for a little bit, to make sure nothing else was coming out, he nodded, some color coming back to his face.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, thank God\u2026must have gotten something on you\u201d\n\n\u201cI have gotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0Gotta be hopping little guy!\u201d \n\n\u201cBe seeing you soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe quickly walked out of the room, making his way to the closed offices for his rounds, ignoring the mild tingling in his hands.\u00a0\u00a0Probably some kind of chemical or something in it, have to hit the bathroom and wash up.\u00a0\u00a0As he turned down the hall, he had the sudden compulsion to go to the break room, or the main entry.\u00a0\u00a0He almost made a wrong turn, but shook his head and headed in to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0Stupid robot must have scared him worse then he\u2019d thought.\u00a0\u00a0Although, he had made only one sweep of the entry way\u2026another wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u00a0\u00a0He hurriedly left the bathroom without washing, leaving his gun on the counter.\u00a0\u00a0Had anyone been watching, they might have had concern over the glassiness of his eyes, or his oddly uncoordinated walk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNo one was, however, and he quickly walked through the double doors in to the main entry.\u00a0\u00a0The door closed behind him, and silence ruled the hall for half an hour.\u00a0\u00a0A sudden, loud shouting broke this calm, but was quickly stifled, the cool darkness of the site once again unbroken and total.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The word processor\u2019s animated paper clip assistant waves and winks at you. Your colleagues have told you multiple times that the thing is just a pain in the ass, but personally you think he\u2019s kinda cute. Besides, he does help keep you awake at night, especially during long shifts such as this one. You blink hard and refocus on the task at hand. Before you rests a seemingly bottomless pile of notes to be transcribed into digital format for storage, which you\u2019ve been working at all night. However, even though there\u2019s no end in sight to the paperwork, you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not interesting. Hatbot is one hell of a piece of engineering, you think to yourself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More papers, more notes, more time spent. You look at the clock and realize it\u2019s nearly one in the A.M., then groan in annoyance. You always told yourself that you would never end up being one of the graveyard shift paper pushers, not while working in this place. Never. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So much for that, eh.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eyelids droop across your vision and you decide a strong mug of coffee is just what you need. It\u2019s hot and full of caffeine, but you notice some odd greasy residue on your hands when you replace the pot on the burner. Thinking nothing of it, you wipe it on your clothes and return to work. The coffee helps; you immediately feel a bit more alert, and your productivity increases markedly. Maybe you\u2019ll finish after all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then again, maybe not. You blink and stare at the screen in disbelief; this entire page is full of angry red scribbles and Clippy is yelling at you for being so careless. Thank god he takes the liberty of fixing most of your errors, but the damage to your pride is done. Another page and yet more typos crop up, slowing you down even further. You wonder what the hell was in that coffee because this is simply ridiculous. You make a mental note to send Mavis Beacon an angry letter, should you ever get time to do so. Clippy, meanwhile, dutifully goes about cleaning up your ham-handed mistakes.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blink again, look at the screen. No, Look at it closer. Your simple misspellings are beginning to translate into completely erroneous phrases. Phrases spill into complete sentences, and soon you have entire paragraphs of gibberish. Mash the backspace key sluggishly, you\u2019re so tired that you have to force yourself to do even that. The cursor stops, seemingly on its own, bracketing your attention around a peculiar piece of writing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So, we started to come to the blackness that yawns beneath the layers of thought, of reality itself.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//\u201c\u2026Did I write this?\u201d// You hear yourself ask. At the same time you notice your palms moisten and you draw in a sharp, fearful breath. Or at least you try to, instead managing to wheeze ineffectually. //\u201c\u2026Try again. Keep trying, finish up and go to sleep.\u201d// Your hands manipulate the keys, but what you think is not what you type. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBlackness awaits you. In your thoughts and in your dreams, there is only blackness. It awaits us all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another hard blink. //\u201cTurn it off. Turn the computer off, you\u2019re done here,\u201d// you panic to yourself, but your hands continue to type on a whim of their own. You don\u2019t give up so easily though, you\u2019re a tough girl, and it took you a lot of hard work to get here. You power through the mental barrier and stand, trembling, staggering towards the doorway. Unconsciously your hands move to your eyes; when you hold them before you, they are covered in black oil. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cGet help. Get out of here.\u201d// The airlock opens with a hiss as you lurch into the hall and collide with one of the posted guards. Your mind screams at you to speak to him, but no words come from your mouth. Your actions are not your own anymore; you swing at the man, startling him, but he quickly subdues you and knocks you to the ground. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cHelp!

Your heart races and you sweat profusely, only it's not sweat: it\u2019s that same oily mess. Your mind contorts in agony as the realization strikes home that you are not yourself anymore, this body is no longer yours. Your mind is all that\u2019s left of you, and nobody will ever see the real you again. You lost the battle for control of yourself long ago.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You are trapped, in this body. And all that awaits you is the blackness.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "artificial-intelligence", "broken-god", "collaboration", "horror", "religious-fiction", "science-fiction", "tale"], "title": "Thy Will Be Done - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thy-will-be-done", "year": 2009}, "to-sleep-perchance-to-dream": {"created_at": "2009-08-04T17:04:00", "creator": "Aelanna", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added a new... tale?", "date": "2009-08-04T17:04:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "FFFFF-- stupid wikidot syntax.", "date": "2009-08-04T17:05:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Sigh, more wikidot BS.", "date": "2009-08-04T17:07:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Fixed line breaks in blockquotes.", "date": "2009-08-04T17:10:00"}, {"author": "Waxx", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/waxx", "comment": "Added rating module.", "date": "2009-08-04T18:00:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Minor grammatical and spelling fixes.", "date": "2009-08-04T22:11:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

By far, this was the worst time of the day, as whenever he walked in, he drew the stares, sneers, and snickers from the staff as most of them were coming in to work as well. It was well known that he was part of the Unusual Incidences Unit, and it was very well known that UIU was considered the lowest rung of the entire department. Leo had originally joined the FBI because he wanted to make a difference, but now he spent his days toiling away in the basement of the Los Angeles FBI Field Office. However, he had no idea what he did or who he angered to get himself into this mess.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Name: Leonardo \u201cLeo\u201d James Carter<br/>\nAge: 25<br/>\nHair Color: Brown<br/>\nEye Color: Brown<br/>\nHeight: 5\u2019 11\u2019\u2019<br/>\nProfile: Originally joined the FBI under the pretense of \u201cmaking a difference\u201d. However, due to political machinations within the department, Special Agent Carter has been assigned to the Los Angeles branch of the UIU. He so far has had zero contact with any SCP, but has proven to remain calm and focused during times of great stress. Fairly inexperienced in field work, but this is mostly due to the nature of his position rather than any fault of his own.<br/>\nRecruitment Potential: Promising. Special Agent Carter displays all of the necessary qualities needed for a Foundation field agent. However, his inexperience in dealing with SCPs may prove to be a temporary handicap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making sure nobody was looking, Leo quietly opened the door that led to the building\u2019s basement and shuffled inside. Down the depths of the field office lay the UIU office, if you could even call it that.

As a result, UIU had absolutely zero budget or influence within the department and served as a way to get rid of unwanted staff.

Apparently, the coffee machine she was looking for had already been sold. She had tried to press for more information, but like always, the buyer had to pay in cash, making him all but untraceable. It looked like she would have to wait another day. As she made her way back to her car, a pair of burly suits rudely shoved her aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! You can at least watch where you\u2019re going!\u201d Sam said angrily.</p>\n<p>Both men turned and glared at her, making her cringe and step back. Even though she was FBI, Sam was still, at best, a junior agent, so she was still fairly easy to intimidate. Fortunately, both men quickly lost interest in her and filed in the shop she had just exited. She was about to follow them to see just what they were up to when her cell phone rang.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want, Chief?\u201d Sam asked when she saw Richtoff\u2019s caller ID.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo get yourself, and more importantly, the car back to the office!\u201d Richtoff yelled angrily. \u201cUnlike what the other divisions might think, we actually have cases to investigate! And unlike the other divisions, we only have that one car!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, Chief!\u201d Sam sighed. \u201cYou know just as well as I do that all the crap we get are the cases the other divisions don\u2019t want to bother with!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get back here already!\u201d Richtoff said, exasperated. \u201cOur workload is bad enough without you going rogue on me!\u201d</p>\n<p>At this point, Sam knew that if she gave in to Richtoff\u2019s demands now, she\u2019d concede victory to her boss. However, if she could stall for another half hour or so, it would be a small victory for underappreciated, overworked FBI agents everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be back, but I\u2019m not sure when.\u201d Sam replied. \u201cThe 5 Freeway\u2019s clogged with Chinese tourists trying to get to Disneyland again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, just-\u201c</p>\n<p>Suddenly, there was shouting coming from the curio shop Sam had been investigating. She glanced through the window and caught sight of the two burly men from earlier harassing the shop owner. At first glance, it looked as if they were engaged in some aggressive haggling, but it didn\u2019t take long for Sam to notice that both men had the shop owner at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>\u201cWellings, what\u2019s going on?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam realized that she had forgotten to turn off her phone, but there was no time for that now. She burst into the shop, gun drawn, and yelled, \u201cFBI! Put your weapons down!\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of the time, when confronted by any kind of law enforcement, much less the FBI, most suspects surrendered without a fight, or at least decided that running was a better option than fighting. It was then understandable when Sam was caught off guard when the two burly men turned around and fired on her without hesitation. Sam shrieked and took cover behind a store shelf. Meanwhile, the store clerk took the chance to bolt out of the back door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWellings? Wellings!\u201d Ricthoff\u2019s voice shouted, barely audible over the sound of gunfire.</p>\n<p>\u201cShots fired shots fired!\u201d Sam said in a panicked voice.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Leo asked when he saw Richtoff scramble for the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrouble! Bring your sidearm and your vest!\u201d</p>\n<p>The two agents bolted from the basement office and toward the garage where the department vehicles were kept. Many people looked on curiously, as they had never seen UIU agents move with such speed and urgency.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir! We\u2019ve got trouble! One of our agents is under fire!\u201d Richtoff yelled through his phone, which was connected to Assistant Director Horner\u2019s office. \u201cWe need backup at her location!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Special Agent Richtoff, but we\u2019ve got no agents in the area and our resources are spread thin enough as it is.\u201d Horner said in a cold, infuriatingly clinical manner. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to leave the matter to local law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Richtoff muttered to himself as he hung up his phone. Horner probably saw this as a cheap, trouble-free way of getting rid of an undesired agent. Then again, the Assistant Director never really cared about UIU in the first place, so why should he care now?</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume we\u2019re in this alone, then?\u201d Leo asked. \u201cHow\u2019re we supposed to get there when our only car is at the scene?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWatch.\u201d Richtoff sprinted into the garage toward Agents Miller and Jennings. They were probably going out on another goddamn donut run.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s those X-Files geeks.\u201d Miller jeered as he saw Richtoff and Leo approach. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, somebody saw a UF-\u201c</p>\n<p>Miller never had a chance to finish his sentence. Richtoff knocked the agent out cold with a solid right hook. The senior agent then snatched Miller\u2019s keys and tossed them to Leo.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Jennings was shocked at what he just witnessed. \u201cWhy\u2019d you-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to end up like your partner, I\u2019d suggest you shut up and stay out of my way!\u201d Richtoff scowled.<br/>\nJennings squealed like a newborn pig and dashed for cover. Leo and Richtoff ignored him and commandeered their recently acquired sedan. With siren and lights blaring, the FBI vehicle roared out of the garage with a vengeance, sending both agents and civilians scrambling for cover.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sam didn\u2019t have to be a genius to realize that she was in a dire predicament. She was outnumbered and pinned down, and besides basic firearm training, she had never fired her sidearm in her life. She leaned out to get a look at her attackers, and hopefully get a few shots off at them. However, when she leaned out, she could only see one of the burly men.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d the other one go-\u201c Sam muttered to herself a split second before she heard a gun cock. She turned to see the second burly man standing behind her. \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next few seconds were a blur. There were three bright bangs and flashes, and Sam suddenly found herself lying in a pool of her own blood. Her shirt was completely stained with blood from the three bullet holes in her chest, but fortunately or unfortunately, all three bullets had missed her heart, leaving her to linger on the ground in excruciating pain. She looked up, and even though her eyes were quickly losing focus from blood loss, she could see the silhouettes of the two burly men standing over her. Sam looked on helplessly as burly man one bent down and pulled out her ID.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she one of those Foundation spooks tailing us?\u201d Burly man two asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, just some dumb cop.\u201d Burly man one casually tossed the ID away. \u201cShe\u2019s no use to us. Waste her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lying there on the ground dying, most people would have felt fear or regret, but Sam felt something bubbling inside her, an emotion she didn\u2019t feel very often. Anger. It was so unfair, that she would die here, without knowing anything at all. If only, if only\u2026</p>\n<p>If only she had the power to control her fate.</p>\n<p>There were two more shots, but there was something different about them. Sam distantly remembered that the two shots sounded more as if they had come from a high caliber sniper rifle rather than a pistol. She then realized that she was still alive and opened her eyes. Her vision was still blurry, but she could see two silhouettes standing above her, and they definitely weren\u2019t the burly men.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent marksmanship as always, Forky,\u201d one of the silhouettes said happily. \u201cI'd have thought you\u2019d go the easy route and just killed them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re more valuable alive than dead,\u201d the second silhouette replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, then the same can be said for this poor soul down here.\u201d The first silhouette knelt down beside Sam, who was finding it harder and harder to keep her eyes open.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do for her. Even if we do patch her up, she\u2019ll bleed out before the paramedics arrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said we needed paramedics?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam heard an odd clinking sound and the second silhouette gasped, \u201cHow the hell do you have SCP-427? That\u2019s a containment breach!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSigned it out! Duh!\", the first silhouette laughed.</p>\n<p>Sam felt a small weight on her chest, and then her vision began to clear and her pain started to subside. Surprised, she blinked and looked at her unlikely savior. It was a young man, with messy black hair and wearing a dark coat and sunglasses. Behind him, Sam caught sight of Agent Pitchfork, who appeared to be an albino woman wearing similar clothing, except toting an M40 sniper rifle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Agent Pitchfork scowled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI only kept it on long enough to make her wounds non-fatal.\u201d The other agent grinned. \u201cDon't feel like fighting a flesh beast today.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here. The police will be arriving in about forty two seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a second.\u201d Agent Pitchfork\u2019s partner knelt down beside Sam and smiled. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not going to die, at least not today. We\u2019ve got some interesting things in mind for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Don't you mean <em>you</em> have interesting things in mind, Agent Spoon?\" Agent Pitchfork asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\"Semantics.\" Agent Spoon shrugged.</p>\n<p>Then, just as quickly as they appeared, both of the newcomers vanished. Sam could hear sirens in the distance, and panicked cries of onlookers who came to investigate the commotion. It was only then that Sam finally lost consciousness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have apprehended the Chaos Insurgency operatives and are in the process of interrogating them for information on SCP-204. However, Agent Spoon has breached protocol again, revealing our existence to a non-Foundation agent and refusing to terminate her. However, more disturbingly, Agent Spoon was in possession of SCP-427.</p>\n<p>I suspect he may have ulterior motives. Intend to investigate further.</p>\n<p>-Agent Pitchfork</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next: <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/uiu-files-chapter-2\">Chapter 2</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/uiu-files-chapter-1\">UIU Files Chapter 1</a>\" by SpoonOfEvil, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

By far, this was the worst time of the day, as whenever he walked in, he drew the stares, sneers, and snickers from the staff as most of them were coming in to work as well. It was well known that he was part of the Unusual Incidences Unit, and it was very well known that UIU was considered the lowest rung of the entire department. Leo had originally joined the FBI because he wanted to make a difference, but now he spent his days toiling away in the basement of the Los Angeles FBI Field Office. However, he had no idea what he did or who he angered to get himself into this mess.\n\n\n\n> Name: Leonardo \u201cLeo\u201d James Carter\n\n> Age: 25\n\n> Hair Color: Brown\n\n> Eye Color: Brown\n\n> Height: 5\u2019 11\u2019\u2019\n\n> Profile: Originally joined the FBI under the pretense of \u201cmaking a difference\u201d. However, due to political machinations within the department, Special Agent Carter has been assigned to the Los Angeles branch of the UIU. He so far has had zero contact with any SCP, but has proven to remain calm and focused during times of great stress. Fairly inexperienced in field work, but this is mostly due to the nature of his position rather than any fault of his own.\n\n> Recruitment Potential: Promising. Special Agent Carter displays all of the necessary qualities needed for a Foundation field agent. However, his inexperience in dealing with SCPs may prove to be a temporary handicap.\n\n\n\nMaking sure nobody was looking, Leo quietly opened the door that led to the building\u2019s basement and shuffled inside. Down the depths of the field office lay the UIU office, if you could even call it that. The office used to be part of Archives, until the transition to digital media allowed the department to dump most of their paper files. UIU was shoved into the extra space as almost an afterthought, and it definitely showed. It was a small, barely lit room with absolutely no climate control and almost perpetually choked with dust.

One of our agents is under fire!\u201d Richtoff yelled through his phone, which was connected to Assistant Director Horner\u2019s office. \u201cWe need backup at her location!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Special Agent Richtoff, but we\u2019ve got no agents in the area and our resources are spread thin enough as it is.\u201d Horner said in a cold, infuriatingly clinical manner. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to leave the matter to local law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d Richtoff muttered to himself as he hung up his phone. Horner probably saw this as a cheap, trouble-free way of getting rid of an undesired agent. Then again, the Assistant Director never really cared about UIU in the first place, so why should he care now?\n\n\n\n\u201cI assume we\u2019re in this alone, then?\u201d Leo asked. \u201cHow\u2019re we supposed to get there when our only car is at the scene?\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch.\u201d Richtoff sprinted into the garage toward Agents Miller and Jennings. They were probably going out on another goddamn donut run.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s those X-Files geeks.\u201d Miller jeered as he saw Richtoff and Leo approach. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, somebody saw a UF-\u201c\n\n\n\nMiller never had a chance to finish his sentence. Richtoff knocked the agent out cold with a solid right hook. The senior agent then snatched Miller\u2019s keys and tossed them to Leo.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou drive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Jennings was shocked at what he just witnessed. \u201cWhy\u2019d you-\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to end up like your partner, I\u2019d suggest you shut up and stay out of my way!\u201d Richtoff scowled.\n\nJennings squealed like a newborn pig and dashed for cover. Leo and Richtoff ignored him and commandeered their recently acquired sedan. With siren and lights blaring, the FBI vehicle roared out of the garage with a vengeance, sending both agents and civilians scrambling for cover.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nSam didn\u2019t have to be a genius to realize that she was in a dire predicament. She was outnumbered and pinned down, and besides basic firearm training, she had never fired her sidearm in her life. She leaned out to get a look at her attackers, and hopefully get a few shots off at them. However, when she leaned out, she could only see one of the burly men.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d the other one go-\u201c Sam muttered to herself a split second before she heard a gun cock. She turned to see the second burly man standing behind her. \u201cShit.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe next few seconds were a blur. There were three bright bangs and flashes, and Sam suddenly found herself lying in a pool of her own blood. Her shirt was completely stained with blood from the three bullet holes in her chest, but fortunately or unfortunately, all three bullets had missed her heart, leaving her to linger on the ground in excruciating pain. She looked up, and even though her eyes were quickly losing focus from blood loss, she could see the silhouettes of the two burly men standing over her. Sam looked on helplessly as burly man one bent down and pulled out her ID.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs she one of those Foundation spooks tailing us?\u201d Burly man two asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cNah, just some dumb cop.\u201d Burly man one casually tossed the ID away. \u201cShe\u2019s no use to us. Waste her.\u201d\n\n\n\nLying there on the ground dying, most people would have felt fear or regret, but Sam felt something bubbling inside her, an emotion she didn\u2019t feel very often. Anger. It was so unfair, that she would die here, without knowing anything at all. If only, if only\u2026\n\n\n\nIf only she had the power to control her fate.\n\n\n\nThere were two more shots, but there was something different about them. Sam distantly remembered that the two shots sounded more as if they had come from a high caliber sniper rifle rather than a pistol. She then realized that she was still alive and opened her eyes. Her vision was still blurry, but she could see two silhouettes standing above her, and they definitely weren\u2019t the burly men.\n\n\n\n\u201cExcellent marksmanship as always, Forky,\u201d one of the silhouettes said happily. \u201cI'd have thought you\u2019d go the easy route and just killed them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more valuable alive than dead,\u201d the second silhouette replied. \n\n\n\n\u201cAh, then the same can be said for this poor soul down here.\u201d The first silhouette knelt down beside Sam, who was finding it harder and harder to keep her eyes open.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do for her. Even if we do patch her up, she\u2019ll bleed out before the paramedics arrive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWho said we needed paramedics?\u201d\n\n\n\nSam heard an odd clinking sound and the second silhouette gasped, \u201cHow the hell do you have SCP-427? That\u2019s a containment breach!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSigned it out! Duh!\", the first silhouette laughed. \n\n\n\nSam felt a small weight on her chest, and then her vision began to clear and her pain started to subside. Surprised, she blinked and looked at her unlikely savior. It was a young man, with messy black hair and wearing a dark coat and sunglasses. Behind him, Sam caught sight of Agent Pitchfork, who appeared to be an albino woman wearing similar clothing, except toting an M40 sniper rifle.\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Agent Pitchfork scowled.\n\n\n\n\u201cI only kept it on long enough to make her wounds non-fatal.\u201d The other agent grinned. \u201cDon't feel like fighting a flesh beast today.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here. The police will be arriving in about forty two seconds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust a second.\u201d Agent Pitchfork\u2019s partner knelt down beside Sam and smiled. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not going to die, at least not today. We\u2019ve got some interesting things in mind for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Don't you mean //you// have interesting things in mind, Agent Spoon?\" Agent Pitchfork asked suspiciously.\n\n\n\n\"Semantics.\" Agent Spoon shrugged.\n\n\n\nThen, just as quickly as they appeared, both of the newcomers vanished. Sam could hear sirens in the distance, and panicked cries of onlookers who came to investigate the commotion. It was only then that Sam finally lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n> We have apprehended the Chaos Insurgency operatives and are in the process of interrogating them for information on SCP-204. However, Agent Spoon has breached protocol again, revealing our existence to a non-Foundation agent and refusing to terminate her. However, more disturbingly, Agent Spoon was in possession of SCP-427.\n\n> \n\n> I suspect he may have ulterior motives. Intend to investigate further.\n\n> \n\n> -Agent Pitchfork\n\n\n\nNext: [[[UIU Files Chapter 2 | Chapter 2]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["uiu-files-chapter-2", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "chaos-insurgency", "tale", "unusual-incidents-unit"], "title": "UIU Files Chapter 1 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uiu-files-chapter-1", "year": 2009}, "unknown-log-file": {"created_at": "2009-03-20T16:09:00", "creator": "Dr Kondraki", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-20T16:09:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: document, tale.
