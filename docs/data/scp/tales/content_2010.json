How can it just be gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 have no idea, captain, but it\u2019s not showing up anywhere in any spectrum.\u201d</p>\n<p>The captain was silent a moment before speaking again. \u201cWhat about the third planet itself, pilot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still there,\u201d responded the pilot while scanning through multiple readouts. \u201cThere seems to be a lot of energy coming from it, but we\u2019re still too far out to get any details.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026 our itinerary has us going to the rocky planets soon enough. Continue on toward the outermost giant, but keep your sensors on the third planet. I want to know what\u2019s happened to its satellite, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one. I need to let them know back home what we know so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the guests?\u201d</p>\n<p>The captain groaned. \u201cI have to let them know as well, but you and I both know they\u2019ll be disappointed if something\u2019s happened to the biggest draw in the system.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The rendezvous with the outermost giant came and went without incident, and it had been several hours since the ship had changed course heading toward the ringed giant. The anticipation amongst the guests was more subdued than usual on approaching the sixth planet, and the fate of the third planet and its satellite remained a popular topic of conversation for guests and crew alike.</p>\n<p>On the bridge, the doctor and the pilot were poring over readouts from the ship\u2019s array of sensors, most of which had been directed toward the third planet. The captain was sitting nearby, reviewing updates on the ship and its contents, when he received a page on his private comm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe energy coming off the third planet is still off the scale across all spectra,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIt would be a miracle if anything were to have survived, no matter what actually happened in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll check it out,\u201d muttered the captain as the comm channel closed. \u201cPilot, bring up visuals of the red rock. I\u2019ve gotten reports that several guests have seen something unusual in that direction through their scopes. Something tiny, but not moving like any sort of pebble.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the pilot worked to bring the visuals up, the doctor started calling up sensor data from the region of the red rock. A moment later, a complex sensor image of the fourth planet appeared on the main viewscreen, and it wasn\u2019t long before the doctor spoke up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve found it, in the sensor logs, which would put it about\u2026 there,\u201d declared the doctor, pointing to a spot on the viewscreen. Instantly the image changed as the pilot zoomed in on that spot. The doctor rechecked the sensor log, pointed to another spot, and the pilot zoomed in again.</p>\n<p>After the fourth zoom, they saw it: a tiny green dot in the starfield. The pilot centered the view on the dot and zoomed in again, giving the crew their first good look at the object. It looked like a green ship, but much smaller than even the escape pods on the ship. It also appeared to be pointed toward the ship, and the crew could see a large jet of green vapor apparently coming from the rear of the object.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks to be fifteen to twenty feet long, all told, and maybe five feet tall,\u201d reported the doctor. \u201cAnd it appears to be headed for us on an intercept course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur cloak is still up, correct?\u201d responded the captain, receiving affirmation from the pilot. \u201cThen how can it pierce our cloak? None of the native sapients in this system should be able to do that! Unless\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>The captain pulled up a file on the third planet and jumped to the section on native lifeforms. A moment later, the captain said, \u201cThe sapients from the third planet are generally five-and-a-half to six feet tall. Even with just one crewmember, that\u2019s awfully cramped in there, and there would be very little room left over for support systems\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCaptain!\u201d the pilot called out. \u201cCome look at this!\u201d</p>\n<p>On the viewscreen, the green object had extended a tubular structure from its back right, pointing several degrees to the right of straight back. A second later, a second green jet emanated from the end of the tube, causing the object to start turning slightly to its left.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaptain, if I didn\u2019t know better, I would swear there were claws at the end of that exhaust tube,\u201d said the doctor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor, I think you may be right,\u201d responded the captain. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a ship. I think it\u2019s a beast of some kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can that be possible?\u201d asked the doctor. \u201cThere is nothing in the records for this system about any type of native space beasts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I had to wager, I would guess it has something to do with what happened to the blue rock. In any case, we\u2019re not prepared to deal with a space beast, and I\u2019d rather not bring it on board and endangering our guests if we can help it. Send a message back home and see how quickly they can get out here with a xenobiology detail. I\u2019d recommend a well-armed one.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The ship reached the ringed giant on schedule; by that time, the green beast had cleared the ring of pebbles on its way to the sixth planet. Since its discovery by the crew, the beast had gotten progressively faster, as its green jet appeared to have been functioning continuously, causing speculation as to how the beast was generating so much power. The doctor also noted that the beast gave off very little heat, though this was not unusual among known space beasts.</p>\n<p>The itinerary had allotted ten dozen hours for guests to explore the ringed giant and its satellites, before heading to the inner planets, including the still highly-exothermic third planet. At its projected acceleration, the beast would have crossed the orbit of the great giant by then (though the fifth planet itself was on the other side of its star). If an encounter were imminent, the captain would prefer that it happen in a planetary system rather than in interplanetary space. Plus, reinforcements were on the way.</p>\n<p>Before long, three ships blinked in from hyperspace just beyond a landmark beacon. Once they got their bearings and cloaked, one light warship headed for the sixth planet, while the other escorted the research ship on its way to the third planet. From the ringed giant, it appeared the beast did notice the newly-arrived ships, but did not otherwise immediately react. A few hours later, the beast cut off its green vapor jet, though it would still reach the sixth planet well before the warship.</p>\n<p>After another dozen hours, three additional ships blinked in, two more light warships and a creature-capture vessel, all of which cloaked and started heading toward the ringed giant. The beast continued to hurtle toward the sixth planet, occasionally adjusting course with its rear legs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was several hours before the beast was expected to arrive at the ringed giant. Though many guests were out on the last scheduled excursions before the beast\u2019s arrival, many more were watching the live feed of the beast at several locations around the touring ship, particularly its massive observation deck. This video feed also went to the other six ships in the system, where it received similar interest from their respective crews, and was already on its way back home.</p>\n<p>The beast extended its rear legs, and from its right leg came a thin jet of green vapor. The jet lasted only a few seconds, but was enough to start the beast slowly rotating. When the beast had rotated nearly ninety degrees, for the first time since it was discovered, it moved its head, curling it under its belly to be able to see where it was going. As it neared a half-rotation, a green jet appeared from its left rear leg, lasting a couple seconds. Several more pulses of jet intermittently came from each leg, till the beast\u2019s rear was pointing toward the ringed giant.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a massive green cloud of vapor erupted out of the rear of the beast, enveloping it as it continued to hurtle through space. Though somewhat indistinct through the vapor, the viewers of the video feed could still see the beast extend its rear legs straight ahead, adding two smaller vapor jets to the larger one. Two more vapor jets appeared a moment later.</p>\n<p>By then, the observation deck was a din of cheers and applause, which increased sharply when the beast extended its front legs and opened its mouth, adding three more vapor jets.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The beast could now be seen unaided from the observation deck, and though its nine vapor jets had been counterthrusting almost continuously, it was still going too quickly to stop by the time it reached the planet. The touring ship itself had established orbit around the ringed giant, near the giant\u2019s largest white satellite. The leading warship was still many hours away, having yet to cross the toppled giant\u2019s orbit; the slower capture vessel\u2019s group trailed by at least two dozen hours.</p>\n<p>As the guests and crews watched intently, the beast, still at full counterthrust, shot past the gas giant. The beast attempted to rotate as it passed the planet, but only succeeded in punching a hole in the planet\u2019s rings. The beast reoriented itself toward the sixth planet and opened all its vapor jets.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt appears that the beast is intelligent,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIt looks like it tried to use the gravity well of the planet to slow itself.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the ship-to-ship comm, the biologist from the capture vessel said, \u201cYes, but I doubt that the beast is native to space. A native space beast should have more control over its speed and know when to start slowing down. Our beast overshot its apparent target, but it tried to compensate and it certainly appears to be trying to return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has managed to slow down quite a bit,\u201d said the pilot, \u201cand based on how much counterthrust it generated earlier, it should start coming back here in\u2026 about four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Four and a half hours later, the beast cut all its vapor jets except its main rear jet, though it was noticeably smaller than before. The beast uncurled and folded its limbs into itself, taking the form in which it was discovered, and slowly started heading back to the ringed planet.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The beast took its time returning to the ringed planet, leaving its jet on for only a few minutes. Thus, when it drifted back into visual range of the touring ship, the lead warship was itself only a few hours away from the ringed giant.</p>\n<p>The sense of anticipation was building on the observation deck as the beast crossed the orbit of the great hazy satellite. The beast extended its front legs forward and turned on their jets to slow down further, drifting very slowly towards the touring ship. The crew of the ship was anxious but alert, ready to defend or flee the moment the word came down.</p>\n<p>Moments before it reached the ship, the beast unfolded its legs and relaxed its body, finally looking more like a beast than a ship to its attentive audience. The crowd could see the beast had six legs, a neck at least a foot long, and a thin tail, and the \u201chull\u201d of the ship turned out to be a series of articulated chitinous shells. The beast appeared to stretch its legs as it drifted toward the touring ship.</p>\n<p>The beast drifted over the window of the observation deck, grabbed onto a support arch outside the window, and positioned itself to look inside the window. For several minutes, the beast watched the crowd through the observation window, moving to different support arches to see the entire deck, while the guests and crew watched the beast in fascination. The beast then stopped and sat still for several more minutes before gliding off the observation window.</p>\n<p>External sensors followed the beast as it skittered over the surface of the ship, tapping, sniffing, grasping outcroppings with its feet and its prehensile tail, even tasting the ship in a few places. Every so often the beast would stop and sit still as before, twice lying completely prostrate on the ship\u2019s hull. After a couple hours of exploring a small fraction of the ship\u2019s surface, the beast returned to the observation window to look in on the assembled crowd.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The beast had remained on the support arch watching the lead warship as it arrived at the sixth planet and took position alongside the touring ship. Once the warship was positioned, the beast glided over to it and began to explore its surface like it examined the touring ship before. As it did so, the warship launched a tiny probe to examine the beast itself. The beast watched the probe warily as it approached, but did not stop it. When satisfied with its exploration, the beast returned to its perch on the observation window of the touring ship, where it remained until the three other ships arrived.</p>\n<p>Once the ships arrived and took up their positions, the beast glided over to examine the creature-capture vessel. As it did so, a cargo bay door opened on the capture vessel, exposing a large air lock. The beast came back round to the open air lock, waited several minutes eyeing the air lock, and slowly entered the air lock. A moment later, the cargo bay door closed with the beast still inside and examining its spacious confines.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>After the unexpectedly smooth capture, the vessel and its escorts headed out to the nearest landmark beacon, while the touring ship started toward the inner planets. The research vessel was still many hours out from the third planet, but it had declared the hazardous region to be really tiny, extending out only twice the distance of its former satellite\u2019s orbit. The vessel also determined that nearly all of the mass of the satellite had fallen into the planet, and that most of the energy coming from the third planet appeared to have come from a very large number of fission reactions.</p>\n<p>On the capture vessel, the biologist had discovered that the beast carried, though it seemed unaffected by, some type of primitive necrotizing contagion, one that most sophonts were already immune to. The beast had already shown signs of intelligence, so the biologist had started attempting to communicate with it, though the beast seemed uncomfortable around certain crewmembers. Otherwise, the beast appeared very powerful and highly adaptable, and smelled faintly, but distinctly, of mint.</p>\n<p>Out past the landmark beacon, as the capture vessel prepared to blink into hyperspace, a small but unmistakable grin broke across the beast\u2019s face.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/a-chance-encounter\">A Chance Encounter</a>\" by Quikngruvn, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

In any case, we\u2019re not prepared to deal with a space beast, and I\u2019d rather not bring it on board and endangering our guests if we can help it. Send a message back home and see how quickly they can get out here with a xenobiology detail. I\u2019d recommend a well-armed one.\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe ship reached the ringed giant on schedule; by that time, the green beast had cleared the ring of pebbles on its way to the sixth planet. Since its discovery by the crew, the beast had gotten progressively faster, as its green jet appeared to have been functioning continuously, causing speculation as to how the beast was generating so much power. The doctor also noted that the beast gave off very little heat, though this was not unusual among known space beasts.\n\n\n\nThe itinerary had allotted ten dozen hours for guests to explore the ringed giant and its satellites, before heading to the inner planets, including the still highly-exothermic third planet. At its projected acceleration, the beast would have crossed the orbit of the great giant by then (though the fifth planet itself was on the other side of its star). If an encounter were imminent, the captain would prefer that it happen in a planetary system rather than in interplanetary space. Plus, reinforcements were on the way.\n\n\n\nBefore long, three ships blinked in from hyperspace just beyond a landmark beacon. Once they got their bearings and cloaked, one light warship headed for the sixth planet, while the other escorted the research ship on its way to the third planet. From the ringed giant, it appeared the beast did notice the newly-arrived ships, but did not otherwise immediately react. A few hours later, the beast cut off its green vapor jet, though it would still reach the sixth planet well before the warship.\n\n\n\nAfter another dozen hours, three additional ships blinked in, two more light warships and a creature-capture vessel, all of which cloaked and started heading toward the ringed giant. The beast continued to hurtle toward the sixth planet, occasionally adjusting course with its rear legs.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nIt was several hours before the beast was expected to arrive at the ringed giant. Though many guests were out on the last scheduled excursions before the beast\u2019s arrival, many more were watching the live feed of the beast at several locations around the touring ship, particularly its massive observation deck. This video feed also went to the other six ships in the system, where it received similar interest from their respective crews, and was already on its way back home.\n\n\n\nThe beast extended its rear legs, and from its right leg came a thin jet of green vapor. The jet lasted only a few seconds, but was enough to start the beast slowly rotating. When the beast had rotated nearly ninety degrees, for the first time since it was discovered, it moved its head, curling it under its belly to be able to see where it was going. As it neared a half-rotation, a green jet appeared from its left rear leg, lasting a couple seconds. Several more pulses of jet intermittently came from each leg, till the beast\u2019s rear was pointing toward the ringed giant.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a massive green cloud of vapor erupted out of the rear of the beast, enveloping it as it continued to hurtle through space. Though somewhat indistinct through the vapor, the viewers of the video feed could still see the beast extend its rear legs straight ahead, adding two smaller vapor jets to the larger one. Two more vapor jets appeared a moment later.\n\n\n\nBy then, the observation deck was a din of cheers and applause, which increased sharply when the beast extended its front legs and opened its mouth, adding three more vapor jets.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe beast could now be seen unaided from the observation deck, and though its nine vapor jets had been counterthrusting almost continuously, it was still going too quickly to stop by the time it reached the planet. The touring ship itself had established orbit around the ringed giant, near the giant\u2019s largest white satellite. The leading warship was still many hours away, having yet to cross the toppled giant\u2019s orbit; the slower capture vessel\u2019s group trailed by at least two dozen hours.\n\n\n\nAs the guests and crews watched intently, the beast, still at full counterthrust, shot past the gas giant. The beast attempted to rotate as it passed the planet, but only succeeded in punching a hole in the planet\u2019s rings. The beast reoriented itself toward the sixth planet and opened all its vapor jets.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt appears that the beast is intelligent,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIt looks like it tried to use the gravity well of the planet to slow itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the ship-to-ship comm, the biologist from the capture vessel said, \u201cYes, but I doubt that the beast is native to space. A native space beast should have more control over its speed and know when to start slowing down. Our beast overshot its apparent target, but it tried to compensate and it certainly appears to be trying to return.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has managed to slow down quite a bit,\u201d said the pilot, \u201cand based on how much counterthrust it generated earlier, it should start coming back here in\u2026 about four hours.\u201d\n\n\n\nFour and a half hours later, the beast cut all its vapor jets except its main rear jet, though it was noticeably smaller than before. The beast uncurled and folded its limbs into itself, taking the form in which it was discovered, and slowly started heading back to the ringed planet.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe beast took its time returning to the ringed planet, leaving its jet on for only a few minutes. Thus, when it drifted back into visual range of the touring ship, the lead warship was itself only a few hours away from the ringed giant.\n\n\n\nThe sense of anticipation was building on the observation deck as the beast crossed the orbit of the great hazy satellite. The beast extended its front legs forward and turned on their jets to slow down further, drifting very slowly towards the touring ship. The crew of the ship was anxious but alert, ready to defend or flee the moment the word came down.\n\n\n\nMoments before it reached the ship, the beast unfolded its legs and relaxed its body, finally looking more like a beast than a ship to its attentive audience. The crowd could see the beast had six legs, a neck at least a foot long, and a thin tail, and the \u201chull\u201d of the ship turned out to be a series of articulated chitinous shells. The beast appeared to stretch its legs as it drifted toward the touring ship.\n\n\n\nThe beast drifted over the window of the observation deck, grabbed onto a support arch outside the window, and positioned itself to look inside the window. For several minutes, the beast watched the crowd through the observation window, moving to different support arches to see the entire deck, while the guests and crew watched the beast in fascination. The beast then stopped and sat still for several more minutes before gliding off the observation window.\n\n\n\nExternal sensors followed the beast as it skittered over the surface of the ship, tapping, sniffing, grasping outcroppings with its feet and its prehensile tail, even tasting the ship in a few places. Every so often the beast would stop and sit still as before, twice lying completely prostrate on the ship\u2019s hull. After a couple hours of exploring a small fraction of the ship\u2019s surface, the beast returned to the observation window to look in on the assembled crowd.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe beast had remained on the support arch watching the lead warship as it arrived at the sixth planet and took position alongside the touring ship. Once the warship was positioned, the beast glided over to it and began to explore its surface like it examined the touring ship before. As it did so, the warship launched a tiny probe to examine the beast itself. The beast watched the probe warily as it approached, but did not stop it. When satisfied with its exploration, the beast returned to its perch on the observation window of the touring ship, where it remained until the three other ships arrived.\n\n\n\nOnce the ships arrived and took up their positions, the beast glided over to examine the creature-capture vessel. As it did so, a cargo bay door opened on the capture vessel, exposing a large air lock. The beast came back round to the open air lock, waited several minutes eyeing the air lock, and slowly entered the air lock. A moment later, the cargo bay door closed with the beast still inside and examining its spacious confines.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nAfter the unexpectedly smooth capture, the vessel and its escorts headed out to the nearest landmark beacon, while the touring ship started toward the inner planets. The research vessel was still many hours out from the third planet, but it had declared the hazardous region to be really tiny, extending out only twice the distance of its former satellite\u2019s orbit. The vessel also determined that nearly all of the mass of the satellite had fallen into the planet, and that most of the energy coming from the third planet appeared to have come from a very large number of fission reactions.\n\n\n\nOn the capture vessel, the biologist had discovered that the beast carried, though it seemed unaffected by, some type of primitive necrotizing contagion, one that most sophonts were already immune to. The beast had already shown signs of intelligence, so the biologist had started attempting to communicate with it, though the beast seemed uncomfortable around certain crewmembers. Otherwise, the beast appeared very powerful and highly adaptable, and smelled faintly, but distinctly, of mint.\n\n\n\nOut past the landmark beacon, as the capture vessel prepared to blink into hyperspace, a small but unmistakable grin broke across the beast\u2019s face.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "A Chance Encounter - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-chance-encounter", "year": 2010}, "a-fitting-end": {"created_at": "2010-04-16T15:28:00", "creator": "Djoric", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-16T15:28:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-16T17:27:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-07T00:43:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

He closed his eyes. It had been a long day. The historian could not remember the last time it had been a short day. He let out a long sigh and rubbed at his temples, reaching for the bottle of bourbon he saved in the cabinet nearby for serious emergencies.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck the coffee table, Professor.\u201d It took a moment for the voice to register for him, and when it did, it was nonetheless peculiar. Adjectives filtered into his mind without actually corresponding to definite details. He knew the voice was even, cultured, the slight hints of a strange accent \u2026 but he could not identify a gender, an age, or a precise tone.</p>\n<p>His instincts screamed at him, but he found himself reaching leisurely for the filled glass on the glass surface all the same. Like a man struggling against the tide, he tried to focus on the source of the voice and found a pair of eyes in a face that, like the voice, his mind refused to describe.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Professor,\u201d the black-red eyes said. \u201cHave a sip, it\u2019ll make this go easier. It\u2019s quite good, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so.\u201d The eyes raised a half-filled glass in a slender hand and tipped it towards him. \u201cI\u2019ve been sampling it. You will pardon me my transgression, I hope. I was raised in slightly different codes of hospitality.\u201d</p>\n<p>The historian brushed away the cobwebs of his mind and sat up straighter. He knew his uninvited guest; his mind was racing down remembered pathways \u2026 accounts of blood and fire. He swallowed and set the glass firmly down. \u201cI think I will wait,\u201d he said in a quavering voice. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, Professor, you\u2019re well-acquainted with me,\u201d the visitor said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see you and your colleagues so enthusiastic about my memoirs. The amount of energy you have put into collecting them astounds me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are-\u201d</p>\n<p>The eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cLet\u2019s use your colleagues\u2019 term for me, Professor. Keep this professional.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thomas swallowed hard. \u201cYou are SCP-140-A,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite so. Are you surprised?\u201d</p>\n<p>The historian shivered. Despite his best efforts, his fingers began tapping nervously on the coffee table. He felt the other\u2019s wry amusement and cursed the weakness of his knees. This was not supposed to be his element. \u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u201d he swallowed, licking his lips, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have me at a disadvantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do. I would not be here if I did not.\u201d SCP-140-A\u2019s eyes were hard to read, but he felt the amusement growing. \u201cProfessor, I have not survived for centuries by being incautious. I learn. I listen. I adapt. I have no interest in exposing myself to unnecessary risk. I chose you because you are an educated man. Because my sources indicate that unlike some among your colleagues you have no proficiency in the use of the regulation pistol you are presently fumbling to grasp, while I have killed before and will do so again with a smile.\u201d</p>\n<p>It laughed, and something about the sound made Thomas think of breaking glass, skittering across his nerves. \u201cRelax, Professor. You are my host. I have no interest in violence tonight, but in the event you attempt a facsimile of cheap heroism, my snipers will put a bullet in your brain before you hear the crack of gunfire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thomas dropped the useless pistol with the faintest flicker of secret relief. He cleared his throat, leaned forward, and did his best to look the well-dressed intruder in the face, though his eyes smarted when he tried to look too closely. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Foundation has sought me for some time,\u201d SCP-140-A replied, \u201cmuch as the Inquisition and the Templars and the ghazis before them. In my time, leaders met each other face to face.\u201d It smiled with teeth like a row of gleaming knives. \u201cI felt it necessary to provide you the same courtesy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The historian swallowed again and nodded. \u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be interested in formal negotiations with Foundation authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomehow, I doubt they would be conducted in good faith,\u201d SCP-140-A replied. It sat back on the couch opposite Thomas\u2019, looking uncomfortably at home. The \u2026 whatever it was let out a sigh and set its drink down. Thin hands pressed tightly together before their owner\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYours is a strange era, Professor,\u201d it said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned much of your colleagues. My time was an age of kings. Blood was spilt in the name of gods and glory. Your colleagues do not fight for either.\u201d It laughed sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to understand all your methods, and yet I know your capacity for ruthlessness. But not in search of land, power, not even peace. Your sacrifices are in the name of \u2026\u201d it made a disgusted sound, \u201c\u2019normality.\u2019 Could you think of no better cause but the preservation of the mediocre?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you wrote it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed it have been in the service of some nefarious plot?\u201d SCP-140-A replied. It crossed one long leg across the other; the red-black eyes half-lidded. \u201cPerhaps I was merely lonely. Nostalgic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. The good old days. How I miss my ritual sacrifice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, Professor, you\u2019re wiser than that. You know how brutal and violent the ancient world once was.\u201d SCP-140-A sounded thoughtful. \u201cAnd yet from the wreckage of an empire that salted fields and killed one in ten for disloyalty, your people built this age of technological wonders. Do you think these marvels of science and steel any less forged in blood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it literally,\u201d the historian replied. He took a sip of his drink, despite knowing he should stay on his toes. \u201cYou had your chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet you remain curious,\u201d the guest said. \u201cThe Foundation snatched you from a promising career in academia, if I recall correctly. I know you\u2019ve mused about what would happen in the case of another \u2026 I believe you call them \u2018expansion events,\u2019 yes? Any honest historian would.\u201d It smiled. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t really been a historian for years, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou resent your employment,\u201d it replied. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. How many of your colleagues share your passion?\u201d It took a sip of its drink and shook its head. \u201cYour expertise is met by disdain, even contempt. I saw Alexandria burn, Professor, and the Bonfire of the Vanities, and the fires in Munich. And I wept. So much knowledge destroyed. Your colleagues would have you preserve a new Dark Age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your alternative is \u2026 what, exactly?\u201d the historian asked, trying to ignore the uncomfortable, nervous way the other\u2019s words bit at him. His fingers drummed unconsciously on the table\u2019s surface. \u201cUsher in one myself in a fit of pique? Or are you just suggesting I make it public?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy else didn\u2019t you warn them about the dig site, Professor?\u201d</p>\n<p>A lump of glacial ice dropped into Thomas\u2019 guts. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d he snapped. The bourbon in his hand was beginning to look more tempting by the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, pardon me, I didn\u2019t mean to be rude.\u201d The visitor leaned forward, cupping its narrow chin in a long pale hand. Black-red eyes seemed to sparkle with interest. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural assumption. Surely you foresaw some danger. One of the Foundation\u2019s few historians would be considered enough of an authority on the subject that it\u2019s hard to conceive of his warnings being ignored by his colleagues. I don\u2019t blame you, Professor. You can\u2019t exactly publish material on the subject, nor can you teach, so all you have left is \u2026\u201d it shrugged, \u201cresearch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI warned them,\u201d Thomas hissed, the memory hot in his head. He licked his lips nervously and downed the remainder of his glass\u2019 contents in a swallow. The glass and the hand that held it trembled as a tide of memories flickered through his brain.</p>\n<p>He had seen the photos taken at the ill-fated dig. They held the kind of uneasy fascination fever-dreams possessed, beautiful things and horrible things still artful in their craft. And he had listened to the recordings.

He closed his eyes. It had been a long day. The historian could not remember the last time it had been a short day. He let out a long sigh and rubbed at his temples, reaching for the bottle of bourbon he saved in the cabinet nearby for serious emergencies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCheck the coffee table, Professor.\u201d It took a moment for the voice to register for him, and when it did, it was nonetheless peculiar. Adjectives filtered into his mind without actually corresponding to definite details. He knew the voice was even, cultured, the slight hints of a strange accent \u2026 but he could not identify a gender, an age, or a precise tone.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His instincts screamed at him, but he found himself reaching leisurely for the filled glass on the glass surface all the same. Like a man struggling against the tide, he tried to focus on the source of the voice and found a pair of eyes in a face that, like the voice, his mind refused to describe. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cRelax, Professor,\u201d the black-red eyes said. \u201cHave a sip, it\u2019ll make this go easier. It\u2019s quite good, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so.\u201d The eyes raised a half-filled glass in a slender hand and tipped it towards him. \u201cI\u2019ve been sampling it. You will pardon me my transgression, I hope. I was raised in slightly different codes of hospitality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian brushed away the cobwebs of his mind and sat up straighter. He knew his uninvited guest; his mind was racing down remembered pathways \u2026 accounts of blood and fire. He swallowed and set the glass firmly down. \u201cI think I will wait,\u201d he said in a quavering voice. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCome, Professor, you\u2019re well-acquainted with me,\u201d the visitor said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see you and your colleagues so enthusiastic about my memoirs. The amount of energy you have put into collecting them astounds me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou are-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cLet\u2019s use your colleagues\u2019 term for me, Professor. Keep this professional.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas swallowed hard. \u201cYou are SCP-140-A,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cQuite so. Are you surprised?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian shivered. Despite his best efforts, his fingers began tapping nervously on the coffee table. He felt the other\u2019s wry amusement and cursed the weakness of his knees. This was not supposed to be his element.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u201d he swallowed, licking his lips, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have me at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course I do. I would not be here if I did not.\u201d SCP-140-A\u2019s eyes were hard to read, but he felt the amusement growing. \u201cProfessor, I have not survived for centuries by being incautious. I learn. I listen. I adapt. I have no interest in exposing myself to unnecessary risk. I chose you because you are an educated man. Because my sources indicate that unlike some among your colleagues you have no proficiency in the use of the regulation pistol you are presently fumbling to grasp, while I have killed before and will do so again with a smile.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It laughed, and something about the sound made Thomas think of breaking glass, skittering across his nerves. \u201cRelax, Professor. You are my host. I have no interest in violence tonight, but in the event you attempt a facsimile of cheap heroism, my snipers will put a bullet in your brain before you hear the crack of gunfire.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas dropped the useless pistol with the faintest flicker of secret relief. He cleared his throat, leaned forward, and did his best to look the well-dressed intruder in the face, though his eyes smarted when he tried to look too closely. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour Foundation has sought me for some time,\u201d SCP-140-A replied, \u201cmuch as the Inquisition and the Templars and the ghazis before them. In my time, leaders met each other face to face.\u201d It smiled with teeth like a row of gleaming knives. \u201cI felt it necessary to provide you the same courtesy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian swallowed again and nodded. \u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be interested in formal negotiations with Foundation authorities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSomehow, I doubt they would be conducted in good faith,\u201d SCP-140-A replied. It sat back on the couch opposite Thomas\u2019, looking uncomfortably at home. The \u2026 whatever it was let out a sigh and set its drink down. Thin hands pressed tightly together before their owner\u2019s face. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYours is a strange era, Professor,\u201d it said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned much of your colleagues. My time was an age of kings. Blood was spilt in the name of gods and glory. Your colleagues do not fight for either.\u201d It laughed sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to understand all your methods, and yet I know your capacity for ruthlessness. But not in search of land, power, not even peace. Your sacrifices are in the name of \u2026\u201d it made a disgusted sound, \u201c\u2019normality.\u2019 Could you think of no better cause but the preservation of the mediocre?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs that why you wrote it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNeed it have been in the service of some nefarious plot?\u201d SCP-140-A replied. It crossed one long leg across the other; the red-black eyes half-lidded. \u201cPerhaps I was merely lonely. Nostalgic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes. The good old days. How I miss my ritual sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCome, Professor, you\u2019re wiser than that. You know how brutal and violent the ancient world once was.\u201d SCP-140-A sounded thoughtful. \u201cAnd yet from the wreckage of an empire that salted fields and killed one in ten for disloyalty, your people built this age of technological wonders. Do you think these marvels of science and steel any less forged in blood?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it literally,\u201d the historian replied. He took a sip of his drink, despite knowing he should stay on his toes. \u201cYou had your chance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd yet you remain curious,\u201d the guest said. \u201cThe Foundation snatched you from a promising career in academia, if I recall correctly. I know you\u2019ve mused about what would happen in the case of another \u2026 I believe you call them \u2018expansion events,\u2019 yes? Any honest historian would.\u201d It smiled. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t really been a historian for years, have you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou resent your employment,\u201d it replied. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. How many of your colleagues share your passion?\u201d It took a sip of its drink and shook its head. \u201cYour expertise is met by disdain, even contempt. I saw Alexandria burn, Professor, and the Bonfire of the Vanities, and the fires in Munich. And I wept. So much knowledge destroyed. Your colleagues would have you preserve a new Dark Age.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd your alternative is \u2026 what, exactly?\u201d the historian asked, trying to ignore the uncomfortable, nervous way the other\u2019s words bit at him. His fingers drummed unconsciously on the table\u2019s surface. \u201cUsher in one myself in a fit of pique? Or are you just suggesting I make it public?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy else didn\u2019t you warn them about the dig site, Professor?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A lump of glacial ice dropped into Thomas\u2019 guts. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d he snapped. The bourbon in his hand was beginning to look more tempting by the moment.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, pardon me, I didn\u2019t mean to be rude.\u201d The visitor leaned forward, cupping its narrow chin in a long pale hand. Black-red eyes seemed to sparkle with interest. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural assumption. Surely you foresaw some danger. One of the Foundation\u2019s few historians would be considered enough of an authority on the subject that it\u2019s hard to conceive of his warnings being ignored by his colleagues. I don\u2019t blame you, Professor. You can\u2019t exactly publish material on the subject, nor can you teach, so all you have left is \u2026\u201d it shrugged, \u201cresearch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI warned them,\u201d Thomas hissed, the memory hot in his head. He licked his lips nervously and downed the remainder of his glass\u2019 contents in a swallow. The glass and the hand that held it trembled as a tide of memories flickered through his brain. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had seen the photos taken at the ill-fated dig. They held the kind of uneasy fascination fever-dreams possessed, beautiful things and horrible things still artful in their craft. And he had listened to the recordings. They kept him awake at night.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you did,\u201d the visitor said comfortingly, and reached out to pat Thomas\u2019 shoulder. Beneath the fabric, his skin crawled at the contact. \u201cIt\u2019s on the record, after all. \u2018Professor Thomas advises caution.\u2019 Very matter-of-fact phrasing. It\u2019s hardly your fault if you expected them not to listen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis conversation is over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs it? Well, I suppose that\u2019s fair,\u201d the visitor said with a strange half-smile. \u201cYou need some time to think, no doubt. I\u2019ve enjoyed our time together, Professor. It\u2019s a pleasure to talk to a man who knows who and what I am. A man who truly appreciates my work. I\u2019ll stop by again another time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It rose from its seat and stretched, producing a small piece of paper looking like it had been torn from a notepad. There was a cellphone number written in a neat hand. \u201cIf you change your mind, Professor, you\u2019ll know where to find me.\u201d\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "daevite", "featured", "historical", "spy-fiction", "tale"], "title": "A Visitation - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-visitation", "year": 2010}, "all-they-want-is-the-blood": {"created_at": "2010-04-18T02:15:00", "creator": "Sorts", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-18T02:15:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-18T02:20:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-18T02:22:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-18T07:23:00"}, {"author": "tombones", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tombones", "comment": "fixed \"'s\" at start of 4th section", "date": "2010-04-19T19:02:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-02T17:16:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "2/5.", "date": "2010-05-06T02:01:00"}, {"author": "DrArmstrong", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drarmstrong", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-06T18:47:00"}, {"author": "DrArmstrong", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drarmstrong", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-06T18:52:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-07T00:38:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "2/5", "date": "2010-05-29T02:07:00"}, {"author": "Pig_catapult", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pig-catapult", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-30T06:35:00"}, {"author": "Photosynthetic", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/photosynthetic", "comment": "Voting, 2/5 & 3/5", "date": "2010-06-02T04:09:00"}, {"author": "Zankou", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zankou", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-02T04:24:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

You look like the fucking new guy who doesn't quite understand what he is dealing with yet. You're here to learn that really fucking fast, or else you are going to die in here like one out of four fucking new guys that come in here to learn the ropes. You cut any more corners and you will wish that I was the goddamn devil that 732 made me out to be, because that guy would just put a bullet in your worthless ass and bury you in the parking lot.

So if you fuck up in the slightest bit from here on out, you are not only going to die inside of 450 but the gates of Hell are going to open up so wide that the clean-up crew that comes in here to pick up the pieces is going to have to fake a natural disaster big enough to wipe the neighboring three towns off of the map. Am I clear?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, yes sir!\" Garcez said, eyes staring off blankly over the top of Dr. Clef's receding hairline.</p>\n<p>\"This isn't the army, Agent.\" Clef sighed wearily and returned to his desk to send an equally nasty letter to the Requisitions officer who had sent him a new agent without the proper gear.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, s\u2026 sorry Doctor,\" Garcez replied. Receiving no answer, he slumped his shoulders and sat down on the musty tweed sofa in the office. Finally he spoke up again. \"So what are you doing here, Doctor?\"</p>\n<p>Clef looked up from his monitor and squinted. \"Retiring.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc1\"><span>Day 17 of Containment Cycle 366</span></h2>\n<p>\"I'm getting old, Garcez,\" Clef explained. \"It was just over thirty years ago that we first secured this site. I was the first person to walk that mile, you know. Devised the containment procedures myself.\"</p>\n<p>Garcez said nothing. He was dressed in the proper plain brown uniform now, his eyes locked straight ahead down the dilapidated hallway. His pace was measured and calm, his footsteps almost silent in comparison to the doctor's shuffling limp and the clack of Clef's cane.</p>\n<p>\"I based the containment pattern on the Seal of Solomon,\" Clef continued in a relaxed tone. \"Thought it would have some sort of arcane power over the entities trapped inside death row. It seems to have worked, they've only gotten loose once, and that was seven years ago when some fucking new guy didn't make it to the chair in time. Once I kicked Bright into the containment zone, as a joke. You could smell nothing but burning chimp for the next three months, even in the safe zone. Fucker said he'd kill me one day for that, heh heh. Good times. Also, I fucked your mother.\"</p>\n<p>Garcez flinched and looked sideways. Clef smacked him in the shin with his steel-tipped cane.</p>\n<p>\"Don't react, Garcez! Don't react to anything while you are taking this walk,\" the doctor hissed. \"You just keep on tuning me out and finish the practice run. We've got three more to do today. You need to execute this task perfectly or you will die, do you understand me? Now come on, back to the starting line.\"</p>\n<p>Clef and Garcez turned around and walked to the end of the empty cell block in silence. They were in a safe wing of the facility, one that was secure enough to have electric lights overhead. The air was thick with the smell of rot, strongest at the far wall where the practice symbol was painted in pig's blood over and over on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Clef paused, holding up his hand before Garcez started his walk again. His chest heaved and his hand clenched the handle of his cane so roughly that it shook.</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright, Doctor? Do you need to rest?\" Garcez asked gently.</p>\n<p>Clef looked down at the grimy concrete floor. \"You know, I wonder if it even matters. The pattern. We've been tracing it in death row once a month for thirty years, but I don't think the entities care about the pattern. All they want is the blood.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doctor?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's the walk that is important, Agent. You have to walk calmly and at the perfect rate. Not too fast and not too slow. Don't look to the sides. Just go in, smear blood on the walls, and get out. Do that and the entities will not see you, and you'll live to do this again next month. Maybe get assigned to contain something less shitty later.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Doctor. Did you need to rest?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no. I just needed to think of something new to torment you with while you practice. Something really good.\" Clef's face split in a wrinkled grin. \"Let's get going.\"</p>\n<p>For the next four hours Clef yodeled nonstop. Garcez managed to complete one practice walk successfully.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc2\"><span>Day 30 of Containment Cycle 366</span></h2>\n<p>The doctor and the agent stood at the threshold of death row. A pair of brilliant floodlights shone behind them in the safe zone, casting their shadows starkly against the painted steel containment doors that blocked the path to the pitch black execution chamber. Garcez clutched a white plastic bucket containing a paintbrush and three blood packs generously donated by the people of the neighboring town in one of their frequent blood drives.</p>\n<p>\"What if they attack me anyway?\" Garcez finally asked, staring at the door blankly.</p>\n<p>\"They shouldn't, Xavier. But if they do, I promise I'll finish the job. We'll keep these things contained.\" Clef waved his key card over the electronic lock, and the steel doors swung towards the two men. A rush of gibbering voices seemed to pour out of the stark darkness of the death row cell block. One hundred and sixty-six meters away, the door to the execution chamber stood open, barely illuminated by the powerful flood lamps behind the two men.</p>\n<p>\"Everything seems normal.\" Clef nodded as the doors of every cell on the left side began slamming open and shut in unison. \"Go get it done, kid. Remember, the pattern isn't important. The walk is.\"</p>\n<p>Garcez's breath was calm and measured as he stepped into the darkness. Clef watched as his partner briskly strolled past the remains of an agent who had failed to execute his task perfectly three years ago.</p>\n<p>After passing seventy-three yards down the hallway, Garcez spun his head sideways with a short exclamation. \"Mom?\"</p>\n<p>Abruptly his body was yanked to the side, smashed against the rusted metal of a closed cell over and over until it was limply dragged between the bars in a smear of gore. Clef narrowed his eyes and grimaced. He had really thought Garcez was going to work out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span>June 22nd, 20\u2588\u2588 7:53 PM</span></h2>\n<p>Clef walked with his cane tucked under one arm. His other swung the white plastic bucket in time with his measured steps. Exactly eleven minutes after entering SCP-450 he came to the old electric chair, rattling and shaking in its fixtures. With the exception of Garcez's screw-up, everything was going as expected.</p>\n<p>Clef knelt behind the shuddering electric chair and examined the bucket's contents. Two of the blood packets had been torn when Garcez was taken. Looking back the way he came for the first time, he could see the trail of bloody footprints he had left behind. Doctor Clef pursed his lips\u2014the one remaining blood packet would not be enough to draw the containment pattern he had devised thirty years ago. Digging into his trouser pocket, he produced the old hunting knife Dmitri had given him as a present after their vacation in Tijuana. Clef rolled up his sleeve, laid the blade against his wrist and set about his task. He doubted he would have time to walk out safely after this\u2026</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>Day 1 of Containment Cycle 367</span></h2>\n<p>Doctor Yancy sat in the security office, feeling very small in front of Doctor Clef's laptop. A progress bar slowly filled as a series of high-resolution photographs was attached to a report for the O5 Council.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agent Xavier Garcez is confirmed to have perished while executing secure containment procedures at approximately 7:42 PM. Attached image [Incident 450-34-a] was taken by Researcher Darrin from outside SCP-450 containment. It appears that Doctor Clef personally completed containment procedures with his own blood. Of note is the phrase that Doctor Clef painted upon the rear wall of the execution chamber in place of the decayed containment pattern: \"Come and get it mother fuckers.\"</p>\n<p>The entities within SCP-450 are confirmed to be contained. This appears to verify Doctor Clef's recent hypothesis that the specific pattern is not relevant to containment. The entities will be contained as long as human blood is applied to the walls of the execution chamber.</p>\n<p>Attached image [Incident 450-34-b] is of the floor before the electric chair. From this angle it is hard to determine the nature of the markings, but we believe they are multiple hand prints and a large blank area in the shape of a human body. Doctor Clef's whereabouts are unknown. He is presumed dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/all-they-want-is-the-blood\">All They Want is the Blood</a>\" by Sorts, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

when they saw the nameplate on the desk.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, I am Doctor Alto Clef.\u00a0\u00a0No, those stories were all greatly exaggerated,\" the man in the plain brown civilian security officer's uniform responded with a hint of resignation. \"Agent Garcez, why are you still wearing that black suit?\u00a0\u00a0Didn't the Requisitions department issue your cover uniform before you arrived on site?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sir, no sir,\" Agent Garcez responded, tearing his eyes from the stylized nameplate bearing the musical inscription that was such a huge part of the Foundation mythos.\u00a0\u00a0Snapping stiffly to attention in the manner of one who was addressing a drill sergeant, Garcez continued, \"I was told that a uniform and cover identity would be provided on location.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ. . . at ease, Garcez.\" Clef stood up and paced across the grimy old security office and opened a rusted locker. \"You're way too big to wear one\u00a0\u00a0of my extras.\u00a0\u00a0And I don't have your cover identity.\u00a0\u00a0So guess what?\u00a0\u00a0You're camping out here for the next few days.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not having you shuttle back and forth from this facility looking like one of the goddamn Men in Black.\u00a0\u00a0I can't believe Requisitions screwed this up again.\u00a0\u00a0Please tell me they at least sent you in with the necessary supplies.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes sir, Doctor Clef.\u00a0\u00a0They're in the back of my truck.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let me guess, you drove in here with a big shiny black SUV with out-of-state plates, and you parked it out in the old lot outside right next to my Toyota.\"\n\n\n\n\"Er, yes sir, Doc-\"\n\n\n\n\"Garcez, this site is an abandoned federal penitentiary with a really gruesome past.\u00a0\u00a0To ghost hunters, this place is like a blonde holding up a sign that says 'Free Blowjobs.'\u00a0\u00a0You are supposed to be part of the skeleton rent-a-cop staff that keeps horny teenagers and thrill-seekers from trying to sneak into this building.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know what happens to people who sneak into this building?\"\n\n\n\n\"Entering the restricted rooms in this building is invariably fatal.\u00a0\u00a0Regulations state that any persons who enter SCP-450 are to be considered lost,\" Garcez recited from memory, still standing at attention with his square jaw thrust up into the air.\n\n\n\n\"Do you look like a rent-a-cop?\u00a0\u00a0Are you driving the shitty kind of car that a rent-a-cop would drive?\" Clef limped up towards the younger, taller man, narrowing steely eyes that had already witnessed more than a lifetime's worth of horror.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No.\u00a0\u00a0I'll tell you what you look like.\u00a0\u00a0You look like the fucking new guy who doesn't quite understand what he is dealing with yet.\u00a0\u00a0You're here to learn that really fucking fast, or else you are going to die in here like one out of four fucking new guys that come in here to learn the ropes.\u00a0\u00a0You cut any more corners and you will wish that I was the goddamn devil that 732 made me out to be, because that guy would just put a bullet in your worthless ass and bury you in

Nobody to call, no real place to go, even the depths of the Internet unable to turn up even a passing conversation. You suddenly realize how isolated you really, truly are.</p>\n<p>The house is louder and quieter at the same time.

He went to work, he worked, he went home, and he slept. On certain days, he\u2019d go out to bars and talk up a girl, take her home, enjoy her company, and then never speak to her again. On others, he\u2019d go out to eat with an old college acquaintance, or call one of his brothers or sisters\u2014it was a large family and there were many to choose from\u2014and talk for a short while.</p>\n<p>All this made it more unusual when, almost out of the blue, the woman had began flirting with him in the elevator. More so, she stopped by his desk once or twice to ask for things she already had, did her best to look seductive for him, and, more than once, allowed her hand to trail over his as if by accident. With the signs obvious, Larry had no choice but to make her formal acquaintance and, eventually, take her out for a night on the town.</p>\n<p>He found the company pleasurable, in spite of his initial unwillingness in the whole affair, and after dropping her off back at her home, found the invitation of a second date appealing. The next Wednesday, he found himself anticipating her arrival at his desk after work. They met, exchanged pleasantries, and went to her flat for a night in and warm food.</p>\n<p>Her cooking was exceptional, and Larry was finding himself more and more enamored. When she proffered herself, he graciously accepted, and the next morning, his desk seemed brighter and more inviting. His officemates made note, good naturedly ribbing the twenty-eight year old, especially when he noted that his third date would be coming up within the few days.</p>\n<p>The restaurant he took her to was more expensive than he could comfortably afford, but Larry didn\u2019t care. She looked ravishing in her burgundy dress. He had the chicken; she had the fish. They split a piece of tiramisu. All the while, Larry found himself falling more and more in love with the strange, wonderful woman who had pushed herself into his life so abruptly.</p>\n<p>Within a year, they were married. Within another year, their first child was born.</p>\n<p>A week later, the doctors diagnosed his beloved wife with renal failure. There were possibilities for finding a transplant but, due to her mixed heritage\u2014his wife\u2019s grandmother being Indian\u2014the chances were more slim. Of course, he immediately volunteered, but the doctors told him it was a long shot.</p>\n<p>It was with delight that they told him, in voices almost disbelieving, that he was a match. He was crying over his wife\u2019s smiling face, holding their new born daughter between them, when he told her the news. They would be together forever.</p>\n<p>The operation was a success. Within two months, they returned home with their quickly growing little girl. Her parents and his siblings rotated through the home, meeting and fussing, delighted for the couple. The doctors were pleased to announce that not only was Larry\u2019s other kidney functioning normally, it was apparently much stronger than they anticipated, adapting to the absence of the other and increasing its function drastically. Not only that, his wife was responding very well to the transplant. Things were well on course for a wonderfully happy future.</p>\n<p>A month after he returned to work, Larry was offered a promotion: Assistant Manager. It would mean an honest salary, good benefits, and additional vacations, but it would also mean time away from the new family he was building. His wife encouraged him to take it and, eventually, he did. His direct supervisor turned out to be very understanding of the young father, allowing for more time out of the office than he might otherwise. He, as a father himself, understood Larry\u2019s situation quite well, and was extremely supportive, though firm.</p>\n<p>When Larry went in for a checkup a year after the transplant, the doctor was different. He asked Larry if he\u2019d had any unexpected side effects or problems that his previous physician had not warned him about. Larry replied a negative, stating that he felt better than he had in quite some time. The doctor nodded and instructed Larry to roll onto his side for an ultrasound, to check for scarring problems. Larry did as he was told, feeling the cold gel and the strange hum of the machine. When he was finished, he cleaned himself up, and the doctor took some blood and gave him a clean bill of health.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the file must have been lost, because the hospital called him reporting that he\u2019d missed his checkup. When Larry explained, they apologized, thanked him for his time, and told him they\u2019d notify him if there were any further problems.</p>\n<p>His manager at work, discreetly, mentioned that a friend of his, a Mr. Carter, was looking for someone to work on an overseas account. Larry was unsure of the implication until his manager mentioned the pay and that the job would be local with little travel. He clapped Larry on the shoulder, told him the job would be his if he wanted it, and then gave him his blessings, pushing a card into his hands. Larry stammered a thanks, telling his manager that they should still meet for lunch as often as possible, and called the number on the card.</p>\n<p>The voice on the other end sounded pleasant, though professional.

she had the fish.\u00a0\u00a0They split a piece of tiramisu.\u00a0\u00a0All the while, Larry found himself falling more and more in love with the strange, wonderful woman who had pushed herself into his life so abruptly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWithin a year, they were married.\u00a0\u00a0Within another year, their first child was born.\n\n\n\nA week later, the doctors diagnosed his beloved wife with renal failure.\u00a0\u00a0There were possibilities for finding a transplant but, due to her mixed heritage\u2014his wife\u2019s grandmother being Indian\u2014the chances were more slim.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, he immediately volunteered, but the doctors told him it was a long shot.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was with delight that they told him, in voices almost disbelieving, that he was a match.\u00a0\u00a0He was crying over his wife\u2019s smiling face, holding their new born daughter between them, when he told her the news.\u00a0\u00a0They would be together forever.\n\n\n\nThe operation was a success.\u00a0\u00a0Within two months, they returned home with their quickly growing little girl.\u00a0\u00a0Her parents and his siblings rotated through the home, meeting and fussing, delighted for the couple.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors were pleased to announce that not only was Larry\u2019s other kidney functioning normally, it was apparently much stronger than they anticipated, adapting to the absence of the other and increasing its function drastically.\u00a0\u00a0Not only that, his wife was responding very well to the transplant.\u00a0\u00a0Things were well on course for a wonderfully happy future.\n\n\n\nA month after he returned to work, Larry was offered a promotion: Assistant Manager.\u00a0\u00a0It would mean an honest salary, good benefits, and additional vacations, but it would also mean time away from the new family he was building.\u00a0\u00a0His wife encouraged him to take it and, eventually, he did.\u00a0\u00a0His direct supervisor turned out to be very understanding of the young father, allowing for more time out of the office than he might otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0He, as a father himself, understood Larry\u2019s situation quite well, and was extremely supportive, though firm.\n\n\n\nWhen Larry went in for a checkup a year after the transplant, the doctor was different.\u00a0\u00a0He asked Larry if he\u2019d had any unexpected side effects or problems that his previous physician had not warned him about.\u00a0\u00a0Larry replied a negative, stating that he felt better than he had in quite some time.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor nodded and instructed Larry to roll onto his side for an ultrasound, to check for scarring problems.\u00a0\u00a0Larry did as he was told, feeling the cold gel and the strange hum of the machine.\u00a0\u00a0When he was finished, he cleaned himself up, and the doctor took some blood and gave him a clean bill of health.\n\n\n\nOddly enough, the file must have been lost, because the hospital called him reporting that he\u2019d missed his checkup.\u00a0\u00a0When Larry explained, they apologized, thanked him for his time, and told him they\u2019d notify him if there were any further problems.\n\n\n\nHis manager at work, discreetly, mentioned that a friend of his, a Mr. Carter, was looking for someone to work on an overseas account.\u00a0\u00a0Larry was unsure of the implication until his manager mentioned the pay and that the job would be local with little travel.\u00a0\u00a0He clapped Larry on the shoulder, told him the job would be his if he wanted it, and then gave him his blessings, pushing a card into his hands.\u00a0\u00a0Larry stammered a thanks, telling his manager that they should still meet for lunch as often as possible, and called the number on the card.\n\n\n\nThe voice on the other end sounded pleasant, though professional.\u00a0\u00a0When Larry introduced himself, it turned almost chummy.\u00a0\u00a0He instructed Larry on where to come for the interview\u2014a formality alone\u2014and mentioned just how much he\u2019d heard and how greatly he was looking forward to meeting him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe interview was in an old office firm, barely three blocks from Larry\u2019s family flat, and was carried out by two men in professional looking suits.\u00a0\u00a0They asked him a series of questions, sounding almost bored, while occasionally writing down some notes.\u00a0\u00a0After a few minutes, they showed Larry out and instructed a dour looking secretary to show Larry to Mr. Carter\u2019s office.\n\n\n\nShe led him up two flights of stairs, taking him to a wooden door at the end of a well lit, cozy feeling hallway.\u00a0\u00a0Knocking twice, he heard a voice from inside asking him to enter.\u00a0\u00a0Walking in, a man, probably in his mid-forties, stood and smiled, gesturing for Larry to take a seat.\u00a0\u00a0He offered a drink, which Larry graciously accepted, and they talked.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe introduced himself as the current Mr. Carter, mentioning that his associates, Messrs.

Someone changed the radio station while you were out, instead of sports scores there's singing. Your head is clearing quickly, not leaving the usual headache behind it, for once. You reach to change the radio station, and stop.<br/>\nIt doesn't hurt.</p>\n<p>You look at your arm, at the tubes stabbing into it, and see the sagging skin pull back, tighten, heal. You sit up, and the song grows louder, and you realize that you're sitting up for the first time in months. You wonder if you're dead, if you're dreaming.</p>\n<p>You aren't.</p>\n<p>One minute has passed since the song started playing.</p>\n<p>You try to get up just to see if you can, and you can, and it doesn't hurt. You walk awkwardly, legs still stiff, steps still unsure after so long without use. Your bare feet tingle as they touch the carpet. There is a small cactus perched on the windowsill, and you could swear that it twitches slightly, thorns growing imperceptibly.<br/>\nWell, you decide, it's a dream. Might as well enjoy it. You step outside into the hallway, and hear the song being broadcast from every speaker in the building</p>\n<p>Other doors are opening, all down the cancer ward, and pale people in sky blue hospital shifts are stumbling slightly as they remember what walking is like. You see that some of them still have tumors, those for whom you can tell, and you run a hand over your neck. There's still that small lump. You aren't cured? You feel cured, though\u2026</p>\n<p>The small potted trees, placed to give some feeling of life, are rustling as if in a light breeze. You pinch yourself suddenly, automatically, perhaps even unwillingly\u2026 it is, after all, a very nice dream. It hurts, but it stops hurting quickly. You walk for the main desk of this, the top floor, the hospital's hospice. The receptionist is standing and staring, and you laugh when you think of how she's been put out of a job. Is this real? Probably not. It seems real, though, and feels real, and by now that's enough. You stroke the lump on your neck again, and it somehow feels bigger.</p>\n<p>Two minutes in, and the song plays on.</p>\n<p>You need to see the sky.</p>\n<p>Three minutes.</p>\n<p>You stand on the roof, and hear the song being played from every direction. The grass is green, and trees that had lost their leaves to the sinking heat of autumn are growing new ones, bigger and thicker. People are there, too, just standing and listening. You laugh, loud and without care, and try to sing along, but the song is in words that you do not recognize. It seems as if everything that can play the song is piping it to the heavens, a song of genesis, of life.</p>\n<p>Life responds.</p>\n<p>A dull ache is there in your neck, you realize. It feels heavier, too, as if padding were being placed on the tumor. You reach your hand up, and feel a mass of flesh twice the size that it used to be. And all the trees put forth flowers at once.<br/>\nAnd everything begins to go wrong.</p>\n<p>Four minutes have passed since it started.</p>\n<p>You see someone down below keel over, suddenly. She vomits, and a sapling shoots up out of the mess. Others begin to clutch at their stomachs, some fall over, many throw up or suddenly vent their bowels. Small plants grow from the waste. You feel nothing but the steadily growing tumor.<br/>\nYou stand, transfixed, until</p>\n<p>Five minutes have passed since you first heard the radio sing.</p>\n<p>Things are moving faster, now. The grass seems to double in height in a matter of seconds, though from the roof it's hard to tell. New branches are sprouting forth from every tree you can see. Most of the people down below have stopped moving, and you watch as they bleed green that rises towards the sun. It's life, you realize, feeling detached. The hospital was sanitary. You've been fed through tubes for months, but there's bound to be something inside you waiting to grow. You don't care. You've been dying for too long now to care.<br/>\nYou sit down, legs dangling over a rising forest.</p>\n<p>Six minutes.</p>\n<p>You feel something slip down your side and hit the roof. You feel when it hits the roof. The tumor is spreading, and you watch it bubble outwards, putting forth a tendril here and there, feeling its way. It spreads like living molasses, but full of veins and prickling as it slips over bumps in the surface.</p>\n<p>There's something gray in the distance, but coming closer. It's covering the trees, releasing smoke-like clouds as it does.</p>\n<p>Seven minutes.</p>\n<p>You must be the only one left. The tumor is spreading outwards still, coating the whole roof. It's almost like a gigantic cape. You wonder why you're still alive. The gray has solidified into a mountain of fungus, and you wonder if it will reach the clouds. It's stopped coming closer, though- the trees in front of it have become covered by what look like spider webs, connecting them all together, catching the gray spores and keeping the trees safe. Below you, the roads are no longer visible. The grass has taken over, with an occasional tree poking up from the tangle. The grass , as far as you can tell, is sprouting out and growing connections to nearby stalks.</p>\n<p>How can the song still be playing? There can't be electricity, the speakers have surely been in most cases overgrown. It still seems to be coming from everywhere, though not like before. Before, it came from electronics. Now you can feel the voices as if the choir were standing right behind you.</p>\n<p>Eight minutes, and you wonder how long the song can be.</p>\n<p>The grass below has cut down the trees, joined together and lacerated the trunks, absorbed them and grown taller. The spider webs in the distance begin to cover the mountain of fungus, which fights back with irregular bulges and stick-like protrusions. You have covered the entire roof, and are working your way down the walls, entering windows as you reach them. The people inside have disappeared as far as you can tell. You can tell because the tumor can tell, not with eyes, but you can feel every minute difference in warmth that reaches it, every vibration that passes through the air and the building.</p>\n<p>Nine minutes have passed, and you return to your room, slipping in through the window.</p>\n<p>Something stabs you when you do. A spike rips through the leathery folds of flesh that were once a tumor. The cactus.<br/>\nYour skin contracts around the spines, but more keep growing. They impale you, sent into a frenzy of growth by the touch. Spikes erupt from the top floor of the hospital, too fast to be stopped, too fast to be believed. It's odd. You realize, still detached, that you can see it happen. You can see every side of the building at once. The cactus throws quickly growing green balls of itself outward, seeming to double or triple in size before they hit the ground and tear into the grass. It hurts, of course, but that's nothing new.</p>\n<p>You try to laugh as you think of a cactus growing here , in autumn no less, but you have no mouth anymore. It's grown over.</p>\n<p>The cactus spreads furiously, each mine-like spike ball exploding into maturity in a matter of seconds. They begin to throw their own children outwards as well, and the grass acts as a single being, flowing like water to ice to solidify beneath the baby cacti, not letting them touch the ground. It doesn't matter. The spikes go down and somehow take root. They come up, as well.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes, and it's time to die.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, and the song abruptly stops. Not that you're there to hear it. Not really. Something survived, though your brain was impaled by a thousand miniature barbs, your body torn from the tumor and used for its nutrients. Some of the flesh survived, carpeting the roof. It may live forever.</p>\n<p>It's not a wasteland that you left behind. When the song stopped, so did the changes.

Someone changed the radio station while you were out, instead of sports scores there's singing. Your head is clearing quickly, not leaving the usual headache behind it, for once. You reach to change the radio station, and stop.\n\nIt doesn't hurt.\n\n\n\nYou look at your arm, at the tubes stabbing into it, and see the sagging skin pull back, tighten, heal. You sit up, and the song grows louder, and you realize that you're sitting up for the first time in months. You wonder if you're dead, if you're dreaming.\n\n\n\nYou aren't.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One minute has passed since the song started playing.\n\n\n\nYou try to get up just to see if you can, and you can, and it doesn't hurt. You walk awkwardly, legs still stiff, steps still unsure after so long without use. Your bare feet tingle as they touch the carpet. There is a small cactus perched on the windowsill, and you could swear that it twitches slightly, thorns growing imperceptibly.\n\nWell, you decide, it's a dream. Might as well enjoy it. You step outside into the hallway, and hear the song being broadcast from every speaker in the building\n\n\n\nOther doors are opening, all down the cancer ward, and pale people in sky blue hospital shifts are stumbling slightly as they remember what walking is like. You see that some of them still have tumors, those for whom you can tell, and you run a hand over your neck. There's still that small lump. You aren't cured? You feel cured, though...\n\n\n\nThe small potted trees, placed to give some feeling of life, are rustling as if in a light breeze. You pinch yourself suddenly, automatically, perhaps even unwillingly... it is, after all, a very nice dream. It hurts, but it stops hurting quickly. You walk for the main desk of this, the top floor, the hospital's hospice. The receptionist is standing and staring, and you laugh when you think of how she's been put out of a job. Is this real? Probably not. It seems real, though, and feels real, and by now that's enough. You stroke the lump on your neck again, and it somehow feels bigger.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two minutes in, and the song plays on.\n\n\n\nYou need to see the sky.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three minutes.\n\n\n\nYou stand on the roof, and hear the song being played from every direction. The grass is green, and trees that had lost their leaves to the sinking heat of autumn are growing new ones, bigger and thicker. People are there, too, just standing and listening. You laugh, loud and without care, and try to sing along, but the song is in words that you do not recognize. It seems as if everything that can play the song is piping it to the heavens, a song of genesis, of life.\n\n\n\nLife responds.\n\n\n\nA dull ache is there in your neck, you realize. It feels heavier, too, as if padding were being placed on the tumor. You reach your hand up, and feel a mass of flesh twice the size that it used to be. And all the trees put forth flowers at once.\n\nAnd everything begins to go wrong.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four minutes have passed since it started.\n\n\n\nYou see someone down below keel over, suddenly. She vomits, and a sapling shoots up out of the mess. Others begin to clutch at their stomachs, some fall over, many throw up or suddenly vent their bowels. Small plants grow from the waste. You feel nothing but the steadily growing tumor. \n\nYou stand, transfixed, until\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Five minutes have passed since you first heard the radio sing.\n\n\n\nThings are moving faster, now. The grass seems to double in height in a matter of seconds, though from the roof it's hard to tell. New branches are sprouting forth from every tree you can see. Most of the people down below have stopped moving, and you watch as they bleed green that rises towards the sun. It's life, you realize, feeling detached. The hospital was sanitary. You've been fed through tubes for months, but there's bound to be something inside you waiting to grow. You don't care. You've been dying for too long now to care.\n\nYou sit down, legs dangling over a rising forest.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Six minutes.\n\n\n\nYou feel something slip down your side and hit the roof. You feel when it hits the roof. The tumor is spreading, and you watch it bubble outwards, putting forth a tendril here and there, feeling its way. It spreads like living molasses, but full of veins and prickling as it slips over bumps in the surface.\n\n\n\nThere's something gray in the distance, but coming closer. It's covering the trees, releasing smoke-like clouds as it does.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seven minutes.\n\n\n\nYou must be the only one left. The tumor is spreading outwards still, coating the whole roof. It's almost like a gigantic cape. You wonder why you're still alive. The gray has solidified into a mountain of fungus, and you wonder if it will reach the clouds. It's stopped coming closer, though- the trees\u00a0\u00a0in front of it have become covered by what look like spider webs, connecting them all together, catching the gray spores and keeping the trees safe. Below you, the roads are no longer visible. The grass has taken over, with an occasional tree poking up from the tangle. The grass , as far as you can tell, is sprouting out and growing connections to nearby stalks. \n\n\n\nHow can the song still be playing? There can't be electricity, the speakers have surely been in most cases overgrown. It still seems to be coming from everywhere, though not like before. Before, it came from electronics. Now you can feel the voices as if the choir were standing right behind you.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eight minutes, and you wonder how long the song can be.\n\n\n\nThe grass below has cut down the trees, joined together and lacerated the trunks, absorbed them and grown taller. The spider webs in the distance begin to cover the mountain of fungus, which fights back with irregular bulges and stick-like protrusions. You have covered the entire roof, and are working your way down the walls, entering windows as you reach them. The people inside have disappeared as far as you can tell. You can tell because the tumor can tell, not with eyes, but you can feel every minute difference in warmth that reaches it, every vibration that passes through the air and the building.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nine minutes have passed, and you return to your room, slipping in through the window.\n\n\n\nSomething stabs you when you do. A spike rips through the leathery folds of flesh that were once a tumor. The cactus.\n\nYour skin contracts around the spines, but more keep growing. They impale you, sent into a frenzy of growth by the touch. Spikes erupt from the top floor of the hospital, too fast to be stopped, too fast to be believed. It's odd. You realize, still detached, that you can see it happen. You can see every side of the building at once. The cactus throws quickly growing green balls of itself outward, seeming to double or triple in size before they hit the ground and tear into the grass. It hurts, of course, but that's nothing new.\n\n\n\nYou try to laugh as you think of a cactus growing here , in autumn no less, but you have no mouth anymore. It's grown over.\n\n\n\nThe cactus spreads furiously, each mine-like spike ball exploding into maturity in a matter of seconds. They begin to throw their own children outwards as well, and the grass acts as a single being, flowing like water to ice to solidify beneath the baby cacti, not letting them touch the ground. It doesn't matter. The spikes go down and somehow take root. They come up, as well.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ten minutes, and it's time to die.\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes later, and the song abruptly stops. Not that you're there to hear it. Not really. Something survived, though your brain was impaled by a thousand miniature barbs, your body torn from the tumor and used for its nutrients. Some of the flesh survived, carpeting the roof. It may live forever.\n\n\n\nIt's not a wasteland that you left behind. When the song stopped, so did the changes. At least, so did the speed of the changes. They'll always be happening. They always have been, really. Where the hospital once stood is a world of spikes and thorns, the grass grown together with your cactus to give a clear message to whatever animals may come. Whatever animals there are. You would not recognize them, anyway. \n\n\n\nThe fungus still stands like a mountain, and will continue to do so, forever. The spider webs grow thick, but no insects will ever be caught. There are no humans left. In some strange spots there are things that were once human. A tower of bone, with eyes peeking out. A hair-covered family of four-armed and legless things, who will continue to etch meaningless inscriptions on crumbling masonry until they at last die out. A cloth-like, almost fluid mass of flesh that wisps through the miles of cacti, parting and reforming around each individual spear.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the world began with a song.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "apocalyptic", "body-horror", "featured", "horror", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "And It Starts With A Song - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/and-it-starts-with-a-song", "year": 2010}, "ask-doctor-mann": {"created_at": "2010-11-09T07:52:00", "creator": "DrEverettMann", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-09T07:52:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-09T07:57:00"}, {"author": "Ragazzo", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ragazzo", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-10T02:24:00"}, {"author": "Ragazzo", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ragazzo", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-10T02:25:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-12T02:54:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-12T02:55:00"}, {"author": "Ragazzo", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ragazzo", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-20T04:45:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-20T09:19:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T01:10:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T03:22:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-17T08:39:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-17T08:43:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "added question please don't kill me", "date": "2011-12-21T03:26:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "missed quotation mark", "date": "2011-12-21T03:27:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-21T03:32:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-31T09:37:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2012-01-30T05:35:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2012-01-30T05:35:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2012-01-30T07:18:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2012-03-12T05:02:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

However, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a hitherto unknown species of marmot, is capable of chucking as much as two tons of wood with its tentacles.

This results in quite a lot of coverage, which tends to make it seem as though there's more blood than is actually there, compared to when it's seen to simply pool. However, please consult Foundation forensics to ensure there is not an anomalous amount of blood in the victim's body.

Do you think it would be alright for me to accept his offer of a dinner date?\" --Shy Ronery Lass**\n\n\n\nI would recommend that you find other plans for your evening.\u00a0\u00a0While dinners with Fernand are indeed lively and \"happening,\" they inevitably end up as dinner-for-one affairs.\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, In your professional opinion, if we released all sentient Euclid and Keter SCPs into a pocket dimension and let them fight to the death, who do you think would come out on top, assuming 682 lost?\" --Needs to Settle a Bet at Site-19 Break Room**\n\n\n\nDear Need, the obvious answer is SCP-1013-J.\u00a0\u00a0Think about it.\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, Is it OK to use D-class personnel to fill in paperwork, provided I terminate them before they can leak the information?

In that time I have received precisely one cost-of-living increase, four years ago, that even at the time was not commensurate with the actual cost of living. Who should I talk to to amend this situation, and if talking doesn't prove effective, do you recommend blunt trauma or shallow incisions?\" --Below the Poverty Line in Site-19**\n\n\n\nDear Below, if the cost of your living is too expensive, please come see me so we can discuss alternatives.\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, I was born a human but I want to be a robot, do you know who I have to ask to get this done and if I do it can I give you my organs afterwards?\" --Metal Curious from Sector-28**\n\n\n\nDear Metal, I'm afraid your insurance won't cover full-body cybernetic replacement.\u00a0\u00a0The best we can offer is to transplant your brain into this blender's control unit.\u00a0\u00a0I realize this is something of a step down from your current goal, but you'll have six settings and stainless steel, dishwasher safe blades.\n\n\n\n**\"Is it possible to chain breed [[[SCP-504]]]'s joke-hating qualities into other vegetables? Like, say, peppers?\" \u2014Vegetariable in Vegas**\n\n\n\nYou're not the first to attempt this project, though so far Foundation horticulturalists have little to show for it, aside from a few potatoes that quiver at the sound of knock-knock jokes.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\"Dr. Mann, how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?\" \u2014Chuck from Site 23**\n\n\n\nThe average woodchuck (or groundhog, Marmota monax) is capable of chucking approximately 700 lbs of dirt over the course of digging its burrow, which suggests that it could chuck a similar amount of wood.\u00a0\u00a0However, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a hitherto unknown species of marmot, is capable of chucking as much as two tons of wood with its tentacles.\u00a0\u00a0Its ability to do so has cost the lives of five Foundation agents to date.\n\n\n\n**\"Dr. Mann, what is your favorite organ, and why?\" \u2014Nineteen at 19**\n\n\n\nThe brain, naturally.\u00a0\u00a0It is the seat of sapience, the center of thought, and it makes a rather nifty paperweight when preserved in a jar.\n\n\n\n**\"Dr. Mann, when did you do your first dissection, and on what?\" \u2014Nosy in New York**\n\n\n\nOh, fond memories there.\u00a0\u00a0My first dissection was on a frog, when I was eight years old.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, excuse me.\u00a0\u00a0There's not very \"PC.\"\u00a0\u00a0I mean a Frenchman, of course.\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, I'm pretty sure this is my first time. Why is there so much blood?\" \u2014Just Asploded A Man in Denver**\n\n\n\nWell, when a man is \"asploded,\" the blood tends quite naturally to exit the body, often at high velocity.\u00a0\u00a0This results in quite a lot of coverage, which tends to make it seem as though there's more blood than is actually there, compared to when it's seen to simply pool.\u00a0\u00a0However, please consult Foundation forensics to ensure there is not an anomalous amount of blood in the victim's body.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a great pity if an extradimensional circulatory system were so crudely damaged.\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, what's cooler than being cool?\" \u2014Andre in Area 3000**\n\n\n\nQuite a few things, if one interprets \"cool\" as weather around fifteen degrees or so.\u00a0\u00a0That's still well above the freezing point of water, for example.\u00a0\u00a0So I would look to tundral regions, ice floes, the black heart that lies at the center of time, or your icebox.\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, in your professional opinion as a high-ranking member of the SCP Foundation, what do you consider to be the cause most worth fighting for?\" \u2014Philosophical in the Break Room**\n\n\n\nScience.\u00a0\u00a0What other causes are there?\n\n\n\n**\"Dear Dr. Mann, I was in the middle of getting intimate with myself when the containment breach siren went off.

The sky was heavy with clouds, the dark grey wetness oozing into everything until nothing was dry. Patches of skeletal, leafless trees stood guard over the miles upon miles of sodden, empty cornfields. The wind blew mercilessly, beating fat raindrops to earth in a miserable drizzle. The winter snows were gone, but spring had yet to appear in its blaze of green glory, leaving the world dull and dead.</p>\n<p>A dented red pickup truck trundled along the gravel road, splashing through puddles and potholes alike. Inside, a talk show fought waves of static for dominion of the radio. The man who drove smoked a cigarette. The woman riding beside him was loading a pistol.</p>\n<p>The truck turned off the desolate road onto an even more pitiful driveway, little more than a winding dirt path that crept off into the woods. The trees formed a leaning, claustrophobic tunnel with their gnarled branches, reaching down as if to ensnare the unsuspecting in their grasp.</p>\n<p>The truck slowed to a stop at the very end of the path. There stood the decaying shell of what had once been a nice, two-story home, now reduced to a pile of creaking, rotting timber and filthy windows. The man turned off the truck\u2019s engine, and the two stepped out into the drizzle. Both the man and the woman were wearing blue jeans and camouflage-pattern jackets, nothing unusual for the place and time.</p>\n<p>The man crushed his spent cigarette under his boot. He was in his late forties, with a neat brown beard, thick eyebrows, and a fluorescent orange hunter\u2019s cap on his head. He had gone through many names in his life: currently, he was known as Scarborough. The woman was younger, with green eyes and blonde hair tied into a short ponytail. Her face was sharp and slender, giving it an almost hawk-like, predatory look.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, this is the place?\u201d the woman asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer that with another question, Montgomery. How often are we wrong?\u201d Scarborough stepped up onto the porch, the boards groaning underfoot. He reached for the tarnished knob and found the door open.</p>\n<p>Scarborough brandished his pistol in front of him as he stepped into house. The living room was dim and filthy: what furniture there was ancient and moldy, buried under piles of trash and a thick layer of dust and cobwebs. Leaning monoliths of black and white supermarket tabloids stood among the black plastic trash bags, empty beer bottles, and overflowing tobacco spittoons. The stench was easily comparable either to a dead animal, bad plumbing, or a combination of the two.</p>\n<p>Montgomery\u2019s hand shot up to cover her mouth and nose. Scarborough had lost his sense of smell long before. With a silent hand gesture, the two waded through the refuse towards what was presumably the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was hardly better than the living room, though now most of the garbage consisted of old fast food wrappers and beer cans. None of the appliances were younger than twenty-five years old, and none looked to have been actively used in at least that long. The only thing of note was the basement door, which hung open at a crooked angle. A comically large number of extra locks had been installed, up to a heavy-duty deadbolt, though at the moment they were hardly fulfilling their intended purpose. The stairs beyond were a black pit.</p>\n<p>Scarborough felt the hairs on the back of his neck stick up. It took a second for him to realize the cause of his goosebumps was not any anomaly, but something far more mundane.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease close that window.\u201d He motioned to the stained window above the trash-filled sink, which was open just enough to let a breeze ruffle the mildewed curtains. Montgomery shut the window, with only minor difficulty in moving it from its stuck position.</p>\n<p>The ceiling above them creaked loudly. The next ten seconds were breathless, torturous, and silent. When no other sound was heard from upstairs, Scarborough quietly pushed the basement door fully open and felt for the light switch. The two moved into the basement with haste.</p>\n<p>The stairs were exceptionally rickety, and creaked even under the trained steps of Scarborough and Montgomery. The basement itself was hardly better: a bare pit of concrete lit by two bare light bulbs. Much of it was filled with the omnipresent trash, along with a dented hot water heater, and some everyday piping and exposed insulation.</p>\n<p>One corner of the basement, however, had been repurposed into what could only be described as the workstation of a rather unhealthy mind. The old wooden desk seemed to sag under the weight atop it. Disorganized mountains of stained manila file folders and worn paperbacks with broken spines cluttered its surface and spilled out onto the floor, all the while hiding a laughably old computer and printer behind their summits. Three corkboards had been set up on the walls: the first was a map of the continental United States with colored push pins stuck in it in numerous locations. From the condition of the map, there had been many removed and re-positioned pins over the course of at least a decade. The second board was filled with plain sheets of paper, all of which were covered edge to edge in either miniscule handwriting or poorly-formatted computer print.</p>\n<p>The third board was the most notable, filled with tacked-up photographs and sketches. Most of the photos looked as if they belonged in the tabloids sitting upstairs: blurry, unfocused images of ghosts and UFOs and Bigfeet, schematics for free-energy machines and hidden government facilities. Some others were not as easily glanced over: the severed head with a scaly arm sprouting from its mouth. A hazy shot of a massive creature with matted red fur, holding a crushed car over its head. A beached whale, its stomach burst open to reveal a mass of bloated bodies that had begun to crawl across the sand. A man offering a box of chocolates, his face blacked out and a dozen screaming mouths in the background. A blank white room labeled only as \u201cNOTHING\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cBusy fella,\u201d Montgomery said, picking up a file folder and flipping through the magazine clippings inside. \u201cHow much do you think is legit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOutside of what command verified, I can\u2019t say.

His wild hair was a sharp grey, and he held a smoking nine-gauge shotgun in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! You think you could break into my house and walk away with my property?!\u201d The man stepped down the stairs, reloading the shotgun. \u201cYou can\u2019t get past me that easily! Now, I\u2019m going to give you to three to get the hell out of my house\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He was answered by a bullet tearing through his right shin. The man tumbled down the rest of the stairs, landing flat on his back at the bottom with a thud.

It was not a particularly heavy rain, but had been a steady one throughout the day, and the clouds were still as dark as they had been that morning. Dr. Rights had no problems with rain, so long as she was dry, but couldn\u2019t help but feel the unavoidable irritation caused by the fact that it had decided to rain on one of her rare days off.</p>\n<p>A car sped past, hitting a puddle of dirty rainwater. The spray splashed Rights dead-on. The doctor snarled and gave a one-fingered salute to the retreating vehicle. She was reminded for a moment of her old philosophy professor, Dr. Cabenwald, who had the habit of calling the gesture the \u201cinverted avian\u201d and the tendency to make said gesture at the back of the dean\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Rights smiled a bit as she stepped over a puddle and continued down the sidewalk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It\u2019s dark. The kind of warm darkness interspersed with lovers\u2019 murmurings and the rustling of sheets.</em></p>\n<p><em>The door is kicked open. Sharp light and harsh voices fill the room. He\u2019s dragged off the bed, pinned to the floor with his arms behind his back, stuttering incoherently. She\u2019s screaming profanities.</em></p>\n<p><em>One man looks at her grimly. He\u2019s armed. He tells her to stay calm, make herself decent, and wait. Someone will explain. She spits and screams at him, still half-naked.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rights had reached the top of the hill. To her left was a chain link fence and a steep expanse of grass and patches of small trees, all of which overlooked the far distant highway and sprawl of fast-food restaurants. To her right was a line of older, two story houses. Several had overgrown yards and \u201cFOR SALE\u201d signs in the front window. Some were brick, others covered in faded, chipping paint. Rights walked a bit further before crossing, stepping up the concrete steps to one of the houses.</p>\n<p>The house was plain brick, though it could use a re-facing. The yard was neat and uncluttered, or at least it had been before it was flooded, and there were flowers planted on either side of the front walk. A creaking wooden swing hung on the porch. The ragged, muddy mat in front of the door was emblazoned with the phrase \u201cWipe Here, You Uncultured Savages\u201d. Rights collapsed her umbrella and wiped the wet mud off her tennis shoes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>They\u2019re taking him away.

He looks tired, but is smiling anyway. He motions to the empty seat and the cup of coffee. She looks around the room. Another man in a police uniform is standing by the apartment door.

She opened the door.</p>\n<p>The man sat at his kitchen table, with a half-eaten ham sandwich and a half-completed game of solitaire on the checkered tablecloth in front of him. He was large in build and portly around the waist, with a completely bald head and a brilliantly white beard. He could have passed for Santa Claus.</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you could use a visitor, Greg,\u201d Rights said as she stepped into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Dr. Cabenwald\u2019s face lit up.</p>\n<p>\u201cA pleasure as always, Agatha. Got time for a round or two?\u201d he collected the cards and began to shuffle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my day off.\u201d She took the chair opposite him. \u201cI've got a full twenty-four hours of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the little one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith daddy for the day. I wanted to bring her with me, but he went and said \u201cIt\u2019s your day off, I can take care of her!\" Between you and me, I just think he wants to show her off to the guys at the office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better have pictures for me then.\u201d Cabenwald dealt the first hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Rights smiled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cNever trust in anyone unless they can give you proof. A+ for you, Miss Rights.\u201d He digs in the pocket of his jacket and takes out a photograph. He hands it to her.</em></p>\n<p><em>The photo is recent, and incredibly clear. A large green shape, like some sort of twisted dinosaur, can be seen tearing apart a man in an orange jumpsuit. Three men in black uniforms are firing guns at it, to no noticeable effect.

She opened the door.\n\n\n\nThe man sat at his kitchen table, with a half-eaten ham sandwich and a half-completed game of solitaire on the checkered tablecloth in front of him. He was large in build and portly around the waist, with a completely bald head and a brilliantly white beard. He could have passed for Santa Claus.\n\n\n\n\u201cThought you could use a visitor, Greg,\u201d Rights said as she stepped into the kitchen.\n\n\n\nDr. Cabenwald\u2019s face lit up.\n\n\n\n\u201cA pleasure as always, Agatha. Got time for a round or two?\u201d he collected the cards and began to shuffle.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my day off.\u201d She took the chair opposite him. \u201cI've got a full twenty-four hours of time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the little one?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith daddy for the day. I wanted to bring her with me, but he went and said \u201cIt\u2019s your day off, I can take care of her!\" Between you and me, I just think he wants to show her off to the guys at the office.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou better have pictures for me then.\u201d Cabenwald dealt the first hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Rights smiled.\n\n\n\n> //\u201cNever trust in anyone unless they can give you proof. A+ for you, Miss Rights.\u201d He digs in the pocket of his jacket and takes out a photograph. He hands it to her.//\n\n> \n\n> //The photo is recent, and incredibly clear. A large green shape, like some sort of twisted dinosaur, can be seen tearing apart a man in an orange jumpsuit. Three men in black uniforms are firing guns at it, to no noticeable effect. It could not and should not be real, but it is, down to the individual blood flecks. No fake could be this detailed.//\n\n> \n\n> //\u201cSCP-682. One of our more dangerous charges.\u201d He takes the photo back.//\n\n> \n\n> //\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d//\n\n> \n\n> //He finishes his coffee and folds his hands on the table.//\n\n> \n\n> //\u201cBecause you\u2019re coming with us.//\n\n> \n\n> //What?//\n\n> \n\n> //\u201cThe chance for infection was low, but we can\u2019t be too careful in these sorts of situations.\u201d Cabenwald stands up. \u201cYou\u2019re a loose end, and the Foundation likes to ties those up quickly. We always keep a few open slots on the personnel list, just in case.\u201d//\n\n> \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping a look after Edward,\u201d Cabenwald said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing all right. Got any threes?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGo fish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe never recovered mentally, but he\u2019s managed to hold down a janitorial job near here, and he has a few people who come in to check on him every now than then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThink he remembers me? Sixes, please.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDamn it. No, I don\u2019t think he would. Got any kings?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGo fish.\u201d Rights chuckled. \u201cIt always gets me how I came to the Foundation by sleeping with someone. Got any queens?\u201d\n\n\n\nCabenwald grumbled and inverted the avian at his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "bureaucracy", "doctor-rights", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Cloudy With A Chance Of Showers - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-showers", "year": 2010}, "cold": {"created_at": "2010-12-01T22:46:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-12-01T22:46:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2011-07-11T13:52:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

I've switched names around for privacy's sake, but I assure you that every bit of this is real. Not the normal sub-reality of most \u201creal world\u201d creepypasta, but actual not-shitting-you real. It's tempting to plump it up a bit for more of a punch, but I don't think that's fair. I may add a bit to the descriptions here and there, but the narrative remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>My oldest daughter is actually my wife's, from a previous relationship. I've been in her life since she was less then a year old, however, and if you ask her or me, I'm her daddy. Anyway, she goes to visit her biological dad Eddie every other weekend. We normally go to her grandparent's house (Eddie's parents) to drop her off, and sometimes end up sitting and talking for a bit with them while we wait for my daughter to get ready to go, or if Eddie is running late.</p>\n<p>Eddie's dad is Paul, and is an\u2026interesting man. A Viet-Nam vet, he's a big bear of a man, and seems to have a similar personality to a rather large dog. One who looks like he'd rip your face off, but has a heart of pure marshmallow cream. He also, apparently, has a very healthy fascination with the paranormal, as we discovered during one of our little conversations.</p>\n<p>It was shortly after \u201cWhite Noise\u201d had come out on video, which we had recently seen, and we had drifted to the topic of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) in general. The idea of recording the voices of the departed on tape was both fascinating and rather creepy, and seemed easy enough to try. Paul was silent, but listened intently as we talked, and nodded along as his wife stepped in to tell us about a road past a haunted house. Supposedly, you could hear the sound of a dragging shovel if you parked on the road around dusk, the same shovel that the former farmer had used to decapitate his family before hanging himself. As soon as she finished, Paul spoke up, saying \u201cLet me show you something\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He went to collect a small cassette tape player, and put it on the coffee table. He smiled, then said that, many years ago, his mom had become very sick. Paul said his brother Bill had been trying to take care of her, but eventually hospice had to be called in as she continued to decline. When she passed, both brothers were devastated, but set about the morbid task of laying her to rest as best they could. The funeral was suitably gloomy, with rain and gathering storm clouds, and the little hillside plot looked obscenely lonely under the dark clouds. The mourners left cold, muddy, and even more depressed.</p>\n<p>The storm hit hard that night, pushing trees and knocking out power for a good portion of the area, Paul's house included. They spent a candle lit night listening to the wind howl and the rain claw at the windows. In the morning, Paul woke to his now-restored phone ringing. Bill was on the other end, sounding very worked up, and told him he needed to get over to his house right now. Paul asked what was wrong, but Bill just said it'd be easier if he just came. He dressed quickly and set out, sidling around trees, downed power lines, and work crews.</p>\n<p>Bill was waiting on his front porch. He quickly pulled Paul inside, asking if he'd gotten any calls last night. Paul said no, that a tree had taken out all his lines, and they'd just gotten service back that morning. Bill said that, after the funeral, he'd driven around for a while, just clearing his head, or trying too. When the weather turned especially bad, he'd headed for home. As he'd gotten out in the driveway, he'd heard his phone ringing inside. Bill ran in, just in time to hear the beep of the answering machine as it finished taking a message. Before he'd been able to take off his soaking coat and shoes, the power had died, and he'd been unable to check his messages until that morning. As soon as he'd listened, he'd called Paul.</p>\n<p>Paul tapped the cassette player on the coffee table. \u201cThis is the tape from his machine. He wouldn't tell me what the message was, wanted me to tell him what he heard.\u201d He grinned that one smile that people use around a camp fire in the gloom of night, and pressed play. We leaned in as smooth static started from the tape. After about twenty seconds, a strange gurgling noise started. It's hard to describe\u2026similar to thick, sludgy water moving through a confined space, like a narrow pipe or drain. It was sloshing and bubbling, and very bizarre. This went on for about eight seconds, then there was a sudden gasping noise. A voice came on, and it was chilling. It sounded strained and half-full, like an exhausted runner trying to speak with a mouth full of water. It strained and gurgled a moment, then hissed out with the sound of chattering teeth \u201cIt's\u2026cold\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p>The sloshing returned for a few seconds, then the tape ended. I stared at Paul, asking \u201cThe hell was that?\u201d. He smiled, saying that he'd asked the same thing. They'd listened to it three more times, just to be sure of what they were hearing. It wasn't the strangeness of the tape that had struck them so much, and had sent Bill and Paul hunting for alcohol at eight in the morning. It was the familiarity. Paul said then, and said now, that he will swear on God, his children and everything he holds dear, that the voice on that tape is his mother.</p>\n<p>They had been rather shaken, and Paul had driven home shortly after. After getting home, he'd gotten a phone call, which he'd picked up with no small amount of nervousness. It was from the funeral home. They'd called to inform him of a situation at the grave site. It seemed the rain had caused some flooding. His mother's plot, still soft from the digging, had turned to mud and partially washed away. Her casket, they assured him, was exceptionally waterproof, and that any issues including the replacement of the soil were to be handled by them free of charge.</p>\n<p>Paul thanked them, feeling numb, and asked if they were sure about the coffin. They said they were going to check for water damage, but that everything appeared to be unchanged. It was just some of the topsoil, the upper layers, nothing serious. He went through the rest of the conversation on auto pilot, hanging up as the funeral director apologized again for the inconvenience. Paul just sat, wondering how waterproof it really was in a coffin. About how it would feel to be trapped, slowly sinking in a tide of sludgy mud. About how a soul, perhaps not entirely divorced from the body yet, might react to that cold, clinging grime. About how it might even call for help.</p>\n<p>My daughter picked this moment to come bounding in, long on sugar and short on sleep. We left, Paul grinning at my obviously chilled expression, and the ride home was a bit quieter then normal. That night, all I could think about was the sound of that gurgling, that drowned voice hissing through clenched, clicking teeth.</p>\n<p>I haven't asked about the tape again, and it hasn't come up in conversation since. I love the paranormal, but honestly haven't experienced too much of it in my life. A few odd noises in the night, a UFO in the middle of the day, and one unidentified animal in the woods comprise the sum total of my experience. I can't say what that tape is. I can't even say if it's real or not. All I can say is that my interest in EVP has been drastically reduced.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/cold\">Cold</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

That's how long the world lasts this time.</p>\n<p>The crucifixes with their screaming human sacrifices flayed and nailed to the i-beam crosses vanish, replaced by a bucolic pastoral scene, the serenity of the gold-flecked, rolling hills ruined only by the presence of a thirty foot tall Albertosaurus biting the head off a three-headed sheep. He hits the stopwatch, resets the timer. 00:00:01 and counting.</p>\n<p>He decides to head south, pushing through the fields of waist-high dandelions and away from the predator messily devouring its meal. A throbbing scar on his leg, angry and red, serves as a reminder that a few minutes are long enough to be maimed or killed. He takes a moment, once he is far enough from the gory scene, to tear the leaves off of one of the plants and cram them into his mouth. They taste bitter, and tough, but they are edible, and he has not eaten in a long time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>They told him that he would be safe.

Maybe on the next jaunt, he can find a bottle and some sugar. Make some dandelion wine.</p>\n<p>The shift hits him between zipping his rucksack up and hefting it to his shoulder: he is now standing in the middle of a four-way intersection at rush hour. A yellow cab nearly runs him over: the man behind the wheel is shouting at him, waving a wide-fingered hand as his ruddy face roars, twisted in rage. His eyes are empty, and his passengers are only corpses.</p>\n<p>He steps aside and looks up into a vermillion sky: the noonday sun is crimson, the color of blood. It is bloated, too large, taking up nearly half the sky, and the light is dim enough to gaze into, to see the wide, blotchy, diseased patches that dot the surface of that shining orb.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>All we can do is place one person outside it. An Outside Observer, unaffected by the shifts. We drew straws. We chose you.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Twenty-one minutes. That was how long the world lasted. He hits the stopwatch, resets the counter.</p>\n<p>There is a supermarket on the corner. The plate-glass window is shattered, and a man, now long dead, has been hurled through it. He steps over the glass and into the empty, deserted aisles. He is hungry. He is always hungry.</p>\n<p>He ignores the rotting displays of fruit, buzzing with flies, or the greenish, molding displays of meat in the butcher's aisle, and heads straight for the canned goods. On the way, he passes by the dried goods. Something makes him pause. It's a box of instant stuffing. The front shows a typical Thanksgiving scene in the style of Norman Rockwell. The father is carving into a screaming human head. The apple-cheeked children are passing around plates of body parts.</p>\n<p>He takes down a can from the shelf, a thin rectangular can in the style of a sardine tin, and opens it up with the twist key. Seventeen baby blue eyeballs packed in oil stare back up at him.</p>\n<p>He grabs as many cans as possible. He can't afford to be picky.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We know what caused this, but it's too late. We can't stop it. Reality, as we know it, will vanish into the sea of chaos. Into the seafoam of the What-Could-Have-Been.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This time, the world lasts a full half-hour before the shift. He hits the stopwatch, resets the counter. The world is filled with fog. From out of the fog come men, or creatures very much like men. His machete is drawn before the first one reaches him, its broad mouth open impossibly wide, revealing a maw filled with jagged, sharklike teeth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The nature of Reality is that of a multiverse. Choice causes new universes to branch out. Possibility creates new realities. Always before, however, those parallel universes have been separate, distinct. That is changing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next few minutes are difficult. He kills many, but they are legion. He is thrown to the ground. They tear open his pack like a bloated corpse and scatter the contents. They grab hold of the cans and slam them against rocks and broken bricks, bursting them open and devouring the eyes, fingers, and tongues within. Then they turn on him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This is a visual representation of the CK-Class Restructuring, they told him. The spirals represent the universes. They are converging.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is lucky. The world only lasts nine minutes, but that is long enough for one of the shark-faced creatures to take a bite out of his arm. He emerges into a new world. It is raining, and the rain is made of shit and blood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When they woke him from his bed in the middle of the night, he knew it would be bad. But then, he had been ready. His years in the Army had taught him, no, fear had taught him how to survive against all odds. He was ready to face whatever they needed him to face, kill whatever they needed him to kill.</em></p>\n<p><em>He didn't expect that they would take him into a room and show him a movie: a false color representation of a mathematical reality. It looked beautiful: a sea of blue foam with bubbles forming and popping, with brilliant yellow spirals floating among them. The spirals, he noticed, were getting closer together, and their colors were fading.</em></p>\n<p><em>It reminded him of back on the farm, in his childhood, when his grandfather used to make dandelion wine with the flowers his grandmother and sister would pick from the rolling green fields. The old man would put the flowers into a big pyrex cooking pot and fill it with water, some sugar, and lemon juice, and he would watch, spellbound, as the yellow flowers rose and fell in that boiling liquid, turning slowly in the bubbling water, changing color from bright yellow to dull brown.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He hits the stopwatch and resets the counter.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/dandelions\">Of Multiverses and Dandelion Wine</a>\" by DrClef, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

On the way, he passes by the dried goods. Something makes him pause. It's a box of instant stuffing. The front shows a typical Thanksgiving scene in the style of Norman Rockwell. The father is carving into a screaming human head. The apple-cheeked children are passing around plates of body parts. \n\n\n\nHe takes down a can from the shelf, a thin rectangular can in the style of a sardine tin, and opens it up with the twist key. Seventeen baby blue eyeballs packed in oil stare back up at him. \n\n\n\nHe grabs as many cans as possible. He can't afford to be picky. \n\n\n\n> //We know what caused this, but it's too late. We can't stop it. Reality, as we know it, will vanish into the sea of chaos. Into the seafoam of the What-Could-Have-Been.//\n\n\n\nThis time, the world lasts a full half-hour before the shift. He hits the stopwatch, resets the counter. The world is filled with fog. From out of the fog come men, or creatures very much like men. His machete is drawn before the first one reaches him, its broad mouth open impossibly wide, revealing a maw filled with jagged, sharklike teeth.\n\n\n\n> //The nature of Reality is that of a multiverse. Choice causes new universes to branch out. Possibility creates new realities. Always before, however, those parallel universes have been separate, distinct. That is changing.//\n\n\n\nThe next few minutes are difficult. He kills many, but they are legion. He is thrown to the ground. They tear open his pack like a bloated corpse and scatter the contents. They grab hold of the cans and slam them against rocks and broken bricks, bursting them open and devouring the eyes, fingers, and tongues within. Then they turn on him. \n\n\n\n> //This is a visual representation of the CK-Class Restructuring, they told him. The spirals represent the universes. They are converging.//\n\n\n\nHe is lucky. The world only lasts nine minutes, but that is long enough for one of the shark-faced creatures to take a bite out of his arm. He emerges into a new world. It is raining, and the rain is made of shit and blood.\n\n\n\n> //When they woke him from his bed in the middle of the night, he knew it would be bad. But then, he had been ready. His years in the Army had taught him, no, fear had taught him how to survive against all odds. He was ready to face whatever they needed him to face, kill whatever they needed him to kill.//\n\n> \n\n> //He didn't expect that they would take him into a room and show him a movie: a false color representation of a mathematical reality. It looked beautiful: a sea of blue foam with bubbles forming and popping, with brilliant yellow spirals floating among them. The spirals, he noticed, were getting closer together, and their colors were fading.//\n\n> \n\n> //It reminded him of back on the farm, in his childhood, when his grandfather used to make dandelion wine with the flowers his grandmother and sister would pick from the rolling green fields. The old man would put the flowers into a big pyrex cooking pot and fill it with water, some sugar, and lemon juice, and he would watch, spellbound, as the yellow flowers rose and fell in that boiling liquid, turning slowly in the bubbling water, changing color from bright yellow to dull brown.//\n\n\n\nHe hits the stopwatch and resets the counter.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "action", "cosmic-horror", "featured", "horror", "post-apocalyptic", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Of Multiverses and Dandelion Wine - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dandelions", "year": 2010}, "devotion": {"created_at": "2010-06-02T21:50:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-02T21:50:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "then => than", "date": "2010-06-03T02:36:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

No, really, it is. You say you love, and that you are devoted, that you'd do anything\u2026but what do you do, actually? Candy, flowers, nights out, those are general actions, not expressions of true, devotional love. Look to the Church for real love. The giving of the self, the sacrifice of the physical for the eternal ethereal of love. Sex is just an analog, a tease for that final, eternal leap. That's how I show my love. I show it by taking that which I love with me.</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>You are just a cut-and-dried little bureaucrat, aren't you? She was not a \u201ctarget of opportunity\u201d or anything of the sort, and I'll thank you not to speak about Carol that way. Yes, we didn't know each other long, but tell me you haven't fallen in love after a couple days too? I wasn't really expecting to fall for her, it just\u2026happened. Very organic, really. So I invited her over, everything was going great, we were kissing, and I asked to wait a minute while I got something. Everyone gets a little nervous on the cusp of a expression of love, but her hysterics when she saw the knife were a little over the top, I think.</p>\n<p>\u2026No, no I don't see anything wrong.

If you cook something, you alter its flavor, the\u2026character, so to speak. Why would I or anyone dilute or distort such a direct, sacred act as the sharing of love with something to vulgar and de-humanizing as cooking. Carol has the taste of nettle flowers and bright, sharp pennies. Cooking would just hide such things.

I spend a fortune on them, with IV drips, bandages, treatments\u2026look at them, not a sore, bruise or laceration on them that was not precisely necessary. As I come to love them, more and more, I take more and more of them to me, but I NEVER let it go too far. Murder is the ultimate sin, and to do so to a loved one\u2026it's unthinkable. They come to see the true, deep joy of giving and love as I do, in time.

Interview is one in a series conducted by Allied governments of personnel attached to the \"von Reiter Group\" in order to ascertain its purpose and gather additional information on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-01-b. Document seized by Foundation personnel 06/30/1947, edited for security and appended to the Von Reiter Collection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer [REDACTED]:</strong> Please state your name, rank and service history for the record.</p>\n<p><strong>Obersturmf\u00fchrer Strasser:</strong> Obersturmf\u00fchrer Waldemar Strasser. I served in France, Yugoslavia and Russia with 2.SS Panzer-Division <em>Das Reich</em> as a panzergrenadier. I was awarded the <em>Ritterkreuz</em> in recognition of my service near Kharkov in January, 194\u2588 before being transferred to <em>SS Sonderforschungsgruppe-von Reiter</em> for garrison duty shortly afterward. I served there until the end of the war.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> For the record, Obersturmf\u00fchrer is an SS rank roughly equivalent to the British rank of army Lieutenant. Is <em>SS Sonderforschungsgruppe-von Reiter</em> the name of the concentration camp you were transferred to?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> I recognize your accent, I think. You are from London, <em>ja</em>? Perhaps north London?</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Why, yes. Your ear for English is remarkable, Herr Strasser.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> I spent about a year in London, studying abroad for university. Wonderful place. I suppose I should apologize on behalf of the Luftwaffe. The damage to London is a tragedy.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> I've seen Berlin and Dresden. Perhaps we deserved at least a little of it. <em>[Captain [REDACTED] pauses for several moments.]</em> No hard feelings, old boy. But please, answer my question. Was <em>SS Sonderforschungsgruppe-von Reiter</em> the name of the concentration camp you were transferred to in the spring of 194\u2588?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> Concentration camp? <em>[laughs]</em> No, no, SFG-von Reiter was a research laboratory.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> You say that the facility you at which you were stationed was not a concentration camp, despite the presence of over \u2588\u2588\u2588 Soviet POWs? And a mass grave \u2588\u2588\u2588 meters away, containing the incinerated remains of some \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 people? That's pretty hard to believe, Herr Strasser.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> SFG-von Reiter was strictly a research laboratory. I would never work in a <em>Konzentrationslager</em>, I don't have the stomach for it. But to answer your question, Dr. von Reiter went through the prisoners very quickly. The prisoners were for research.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Medical research?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> I'm sure you know all this already, I don't see why-</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Please, for the record.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> No, SFG-von Reiter was not a medical testing facility. It. Was. I'm not sure. I don't. Know. I'm not certain how to put it.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> <em>Mein Deutsch ist ziemlich gut, Herr Strasser. Bitte, f\u00fchlen Sie sich frei auf Deutsch fortzufahren.</em></p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> <em>[S laughs.]</em> <em>Wunderbar</em>! <em>Ein bayerischer Akzent!</em>! <em>Sehr gut</em>, Captain, <em>sehr gut</em>! But no, that's not what I mean. I'm unsure exactly what kind of science went on there. There were medical tests on prisoners, of course, but that wasn't the function of SFG-von Reiter. It was a very odd place.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Could you elaborate, please? What was the purpose of the Leipzig facility if not extermination of Soviet prisoners of war or medical testing of the same?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> Let me tell you a story, Captain. It involves a Wehrmacht artillery company and a Bolshevik position near [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p><em>[Redundant information removed by Foundation censors. See [REDACTED] for the full interview, or [REDACTED] for a full report on the recovery of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-c by Wehrmacht personnel.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> Shortly thereafter, the object was sent back to the Fatherland in a sealed train car for further research.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> I see. So this \"artifact\" was then transferred to the Leipzig facility for von Reiter to work with?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> That's correct.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> I'm afraid I don't understand. That's a lot of effort for what amounts to an interesting archeological find. A curiosity, yes, but did it really warrant its own subterranean bunker system? Or a garrison the size of an infantry company?</p>\n<p><em>[S remains silent for some time.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> May I trouble you for a cigarette?</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Certainly.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> <em>Danke</em>. I don't know what that <em>verdammt</em> thing was, Captain. A curiosity? Perhaps. You haven't seen it. Dr. von Reiter was convinced it was the most important scientific discovery, period. Himmler was convinced it would win us the war.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Himmler? You mean Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> Yes. Within SS formations, even Waffen-SS combat units, Himmler was known for his ridiculous mysticism. Apparently, he thought <em>die Auge-Stein</em> could be used as a <em>Vertraulichwaffe</em>-</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> For the record, <em>Vertraulichwaffe</em> roughly translates to esoteric weapon. Please continue, Herr Strasser.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> <em>Ja</em>, an esoteric weapon to smash Bolshevism and the decadent Western democracies and win us the war. And all future wars. The SS sponsored all sorts of absurdities of course, like that <em>Ahnenerbe</em> expedition to Tibet. But this was something else completely. He wrote von Reiter a- <em>Verdammt! Wie Sie tun Sie zu sagen</em>? Ah, yes! A \"blank cheque\". Himmler handed von Reiter a \"blank cheque\" from the SS. Money, materials, test subjects, personnel, whatever von Reiter asked for, the Reichsf\u00fchrer made sure he got. When I was first transferred to SFG-von Reiter, I thought the whole idea was <em>Scheisse</em>, but I kept my mouth shut because it was certainly better than another tour on the Ostfront. But over the \u2588 years I was there, I'm. Ah. Not so sure now.</p>\n<p><em>[S is silent for some time. Stenographer notes that he is idly playing with his Knight's Cross.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> We'll come back to this subject later, if you'd like. <em>[S nods.]</em> Tell me about your duties at the Leipzig site.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> <em>Danke</em>, Captain. I was in involved in general security under Standartenf\u00fchrer Konrad Boch. And I oversaw the disposal of <em>die Leeraugen</em>. The. Ah. The test subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> For the record, Standartenf\u00fchrer is an SS rank equivalent to the British Army rank of Colonel. Please describe your duties in the latter capacity, if you would?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> [DATA EXPUNGED], and after the experiments were over, my unit was tasked with killing them. It was very disturbing at first, because they are much harder to kill than a man.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Were there any special procedures for this \"disposal\"?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> Not really? They would be chained to the wall in a sealed room somewhere in the complex, and five or six of us would go in and shoot them until they stopped moving. In the beginning, it was harder because we kept trying to kill them, you know, like <em>Einsatzgruppen</em>? Once in the back of the head with a pistol. We wised up after we lost Schrier and Lustig, and started using automatics. Afterward, von Reiter or Dr. Eisen would collect them for dissection or incineration.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Eisen? He's not on our roster.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> Yes, I would imagine! That's because it's not his name. We gave him the nickname Eisen [lit. iron -Ed.] because he was such a hard bastard. I'm not sure what his name was. He was very high up within the research staff and the scientists tended to keep separate from us soldiers. So von Reiter and Wilhelm J\u00fchrs, his adjutant, were the only ones we really knew. We figured Eisen was from Himmler's personal staff. Dr. von Reiter absolutely adored him, probably because they were both bloodthirsty <em>Arschl\u00f6cher</em>. Eisen was probably responsible for most of the deaths, since he insisted on \"fresh subjects\" after each experiment.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Were there any uncommon occurrences while you were there?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> Yes, of course! You can't garrison a bunker complex studying some rock that no one can figure out without some fucking uncommon occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> Are you alright, Herr Strasser? We can stop if you'd like.</p>\n<p><em>[S seems to consider this for some time.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> There was an air raid on Leipzig. A few bombs landed right on top of us. No one knew we were there except the Reichsf\u00fcrher and some members of the OKW <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">[</span><em>Oberkommand der Wehrmacht</em>, the German High Command -Ed.] and presumably Hitler, so I don't think it was intentional.</p>\n<p><em>[S pauses for some time. He motions for another cigarette.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> The raid did severe structural damage to the complex. This was very early, you know, maybe \u2588 months after we found the thing. We didn't know what we were doing at all. Our procedures for this were. Lacking. A group of Soviet <em>Schweine</em> escaped in the confusion and tried to flee the complex, but kept getting cut off by debris or locked doors. They ended up. They were funneled into the. Ah. <em>Der Auge-Stein Eind\u00e4mmungraum</em>. The containment room.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> How many? Prisoners, I mean.</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> I don't know, maybe a dozen. That psychopath, von Reiter, the one thing I will say about him is that he was always very prepared. Prisoners were always restrained, and never more than one at a time. This was ten. At least. There were no chains this time, no cages. The damage to the bunker had ruined the interior of <em>der Auge-Stein Eind\u00e4mmungraum</em> and all the preventative measures Dr. von Reiter had spent so long perfecting.</p>\n<p><strong>I:</strong> What happened?</p>\n<p><strong>S:</strong> I don't know. I want you to know, Captain, that I hate Bolsheviks, to the very core of my being. I killed dozens of them in combat, I killed dozens of them out of combat, and I would continue to kill them now given half a chance. They are a plague on this world, and their complete eradication can only make things better. That said. What happened to those men in <em>der Eind\u00e4mmungraum</em> is unspeakable.

function of SFG-von Reiter.\u00a0\u00a0It was a very odd place.\n\n> \n\n> **I:** Could you elaborate, please?\u00a0\u00a0What was the purpose of the Leipzig facility if not extermination of Soviet prisoners of war or medical testing of the same?\n\n> \n\n> **S:** Let me tell you a story, Captain.\u00a0\u00a0It involves a Wehrmacht artillery company and a Bolshevik position near [DATA

understand.\u00a0\u00a0That's a lot of effort for what amounts to an interesting archeological find.\u00a0\u00a0A curiosity, yes, but did it really warrant its own subterranean bunker

Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler?\n\n> \n\n> **S:** Yes.\u00a0\u00a0Within SS formations, even Waffen-SS combat units, Himmler was known for his ridiculous mysticism.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, he thought //die Auge-Stein// could be used as a //Vertraulichwaffe//- \n\n> \n\n> **I:**\u00a0\u00a0For the record, //Vertraulichwaffe// roughly translates to esoteric weapon.\u00a0\u00a0Please

sponsored all sorts of absurdities of course, like that //Ahnenerbe// expedition to Tibet.\u00a0\u00a0But this was something else completely.\u00a0\u00a0He wrote von Reiter a-

Millions of lifetimes away lie the quasars, the softly thrumming globes of aging light, somehow ancient in the youngest part of the universe. Their light is cold and dim, but harsh, blanketing the cold, dead stones that drift in their scrambling, cantankerous gravity with oceans of radiation and soft, silent death. The anciently young baubles roil and bubble with youthful, rotting cores, belching forth their combined first breaths and death rattles. They twist slowly in their near-eternal dying birth, bubbling and muttering to themselves for eons in tongues of radiation and cooling heat.</p>\n<p>Even these contradictory beings are not eternal, and soon they cool, bloating with the carrion of their own burning bodies. Some burst finally, breaking their simultaneous dance of life and death, to spawn new strangeness. Others collapse, falling just shy of this final freedom, cooling to black, silent, hateful balls of regret and loss. Twisting in their hallucinating, dreaming cores, they turn black, still shells to the hated universe, the sprightly, twinkling upstart stars and scrambling worlds, to dream and sleep the sleep of the sick and forgetful.</p>\n<p>Stars, like men, however, are mortal, and are therefore open to those that are not. Like a man falling asleep to wake as someone new, the void-hearted quasar can forget who they are, and become remembered by another. One, dreaming in its own ashes, slowly found itself becoming the dream, the doddering, hating core slipping away as a new dreamer took its place, a dreamer whose thoughts sent the dream plunging away, vanishing in to void and oblivion then to know for a moment that such a dreamer existed, let alone lie subject to its whims. For epochs it then dreamed of nothing, its lost dreams not missed or even noticed by those that see time as a ocean, and not a path.</p>\n<p>Then, in time, the dreamer awoke.</p>\n<p>The tiny, sparkling life that grew in the coddling shadow of Sol found the place of Knowing. One, unimportant and unknown, came seeking. In his seeking, he was made aware of the dreamer, and by that knowledge, the dreamer became aware of him. The dreamer came, the awareness pressing in to the tiny point, to find it pleasing and strange. It awoke, and seeped in to the vacant star's corpse, pulling flecks of reality to clothe its own vacant eyes.</p>\n<p>Boiling with new knowledge, it pushed, feeling the feeble waters of reality part and ripple before it, and began to travel, crawling and oozing on the walls of its shell, feeling new sensation, awareness, and knowledge. It rolls softly, a scarab in its own tomb, to feel, to know, to change, and to take all that is lacking. It comes to spread awareness in to life, and feel the soft constriction of mortality around it, like the hug of a dying child. It comes at its leisure. It comes at the pace of blank void. But it comes.</p>\n<p>To worship and bring the Broken to the world is merely the anointing of the offering. To prepare the vessel to be filled, to allow its endurance beyond the flickering points of mortality. We will turn undying eyes to the sun, and watch the eons roll past. Watch as the great, gray home grows behind it, swelling with trivial ages. Watch as its burning, vapid light is extinguished and replaced with the cold, aged seepage of the dreamer's shell. We will raise our arms, all, on our waiting, Whole world, and be filled with the awareness of the dreamer's core, and vanish to its pleasure.</p>\n<p>To restore the Broken is great. To be known by The Gray Awareness is greater.</p>\n<p>So says Anna, third Prophet of the Age of Strife, second Acolyte to The Gray Awareness, servant to the Church.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Document recovered by investigating Agents.

Not to me, the time for me or almost anyone else alive on Earth today to make a difference has passed, but someone, somewhere might be able to make something of this, or at least find it helpful, or something. Once I'm done, I'm going to seal it up in a pipe, coat it in wax, and chuck it into the ravine. Maybe someday someone will read this, and try to put things together. If they're allowed to.</p>\n<p>I'd love to start at the beginning, but I'm honestly not sure when the world started to end. Could have been years and years before the final bits, or it could have been all at once. Everything was so grim, what with warmer air, cooler seas, too little gas and too many people, things could have been unraveling for ages before things bubbled up to the public eye. What I and others remember most was when the Disney Magic sank. It was then, I think, that most people started to think that things might be worse than they seemed.</p>\n<p>The Disney Magic was a big cruise ship, one of those liner jobs that tools around islands and stuff. One day, the news was all screaming about how it suddenly just went down when it was trying to put in to port. The weird thing about it was how there was no video of it for a long time. Some still pictures of it floating fine, but none of it actually going down. Then, somehow, a tape showed up, and the news started playing it. I have to imagine they didn't review it first.</p>\n<p>The ship was puffing along, strong and fast, little boats bobbing around it, looking like every vacation lover's dream, when suddenly it stopped. I mean stopped, just a dead halt like it had just slammed into a mountain. You could see people go lurching forward all over the deck, a bunch of junk fall off the sides, a real mess. It's all still for a few seconds, then suddenly there's this foaming behind the ship. Most people assumed it was the engine trying to fire up again\u2026 then the arm came up.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if it actually was an arm, but it was some kind of limb, and it must have been a hundred feet long at least. It reached up along the side of the boat and\u2026 just ripped it open, I mean unzipped it like a coat, and you could see all the people inside screaming and running\u2026 it was awful. Then you saw something lurch up, a big, spiny shape pushing against that gap, shoving in\u2026 then there was an explosion on its back, and the camera whipped up to show a couple of jets whizzing by\u2026 then it ended.</p>\n<p>I remember just sitting there, stunned, looking at the TV, barely noticing the president coming on to declare a state of emergency. I think it was two or three days later when the TV went under full government control, but it may have been a week, I'm not sure. Internet got clamped later, but soon all you could hear, read or see was \u201cremain calm, everything is under control\u201d. The oddest thing was that life really didn't change much for a while. Bills still came, still had to work, go to school, all that. Just a lot more scared faces, and a lot more weird talk.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon we were getting told that whole towns were being evacuated, that there was a plague, or a riot, or a terrorist bomb, or some other nightmare. My brother down south said that they got moved because of a huge wildfire. The weird thing was, he said, that the fire moved oddly\u2026 seemed to shoot right for gas or brush, and didn't travel evenly. That after a while, he swore he saw what looked like a <a href=\"/scp-457\">twenty-foot-tall man of fire</a> walking and eating everything. The call got dropped right after he said that. I haven't talked to him since.</p>\n<p>So things got worse, little by little. People kept being moved, and there was no real way to communicate with each other anymore that was really reliable, so it was hard to say just how bad things were. Still, word of mouth was still going strong, and it was creepy. Crazy shit, really, stuff about zombies in the north, killing frenzies in the east, a place near the ocean where the ground was alive and eating people, a cult screaming about the second coming and killing people to buy off god\u2026 I started pulling more and more away from people, just to get some ignorant peace of mind. Looking back, that probably saved my life.</p>\n<p>Finally, one day, I woke up and there was blood on my window. It was outside, and I could hear some insane shit going down outside\u2026 screaming, clanking, gunshots, and a smell like burning wires. I hid. I'm not ashamed to admit it, I left my fellow man to rot, and hid inside for almost a full week, long after the noise stopped. After the fifth day, the electricity and gas gave out, along with the running water. When I finally got hard up for supplies, I poked my nose out, and saw that the whole west side of the world was gone.</p>\n<p>Now, I don't know for sure if it actually is gone, but there is a cliff that starts thirty feet to the west of my house, and I cannot see the bottom of it. I also can't see the other side of this ravine, so for all intents and purposes, that part of the world is gone for me. The suburb I was in looked like a war zone, blood and broken stuff everywhere, houses carved up\u2026 no bodies though, which I still think was weird. I scrounged up some food and stuff from some of the houses, then went back home.</p>\n<p>I've been doing that for a while now. I'm not sure how long, really. Might have been years and years, or just a few months, it's hard to say. Sometimes the sun just sticks in one spot for what feels like days\u2026 other times these clouds roll in, and you can't see two feet. There's\u2026 things around, too. I run at the first noise, but I think they're about man-sized, and they seem to like metal. Other, little things scramble around in the rubble sometimes, so I try and keep clear. One time, a thing that looked like a pill bug the size of a cat crawled out, looked at me, and screamed \u201cSTOP!\u201d in perfect English. I hid inside for days.</p>\n<p>There are also these big blimp-things that float around sometimes. They have little bug legs on their undersides, and they look kinda like maggots, but with eyes all over. They eat everything when they land, but most of the time they stay high up. One of these had just passed when I found the hurt guy. He was all ripped up, and looked like one of those S.W.A.T. Team guys you see on tv sometimes, but his combat suit thing was all ripped to hell. I dragged him back home, and then we talked.</p>\n<p>He said that he had been hunting the blimp-thing, but had gotten attacked. He wouldn't say by what, but he looked like he was on his last legs. I fed him some canned beans and some water, and he seemed to come around a little. Asked me who I was, if I was alright and all that. He seemed kinda shocked when I said he was the first person I'd seen since the rest of the world vanished. He told me it wasn't gone, just relocated, but wouldn't say what that meant. I helped heal him up, and kept asking who he was, but he wouldn't say. Finally, he said screw it, that his orders were probably no good anymore anyway, and told me.</p>\n<p>He said he worked for a foundation or something, and that they were like a combination jail and research center. He said that he was one of the agents who went around trying to find strange stuff and keep it from hurting people. I said he was doing a hell of a job so far, and he laughed pretty hard. He said something had happened, and that a bunch of these things had gotten loose at the same time, and caused this foundation place to lose control. He said it became a \u201cGH-0 'Dead Greenhouse' scenario\u201d.</p>\n<p>I asked him what that meant, and he looked at me for awhile before going on. He said that's what they call a situation where everybody on Earth dies, but the Earth itself is still OK and can support life. I asked what did that matter if everybody's dead, and he smiled strangely. I asked him if anyone else on Earth was still alive, and he said yes, but carefully spread out and contained. After that, I just sorta sat and digested things for a bit, and the man started stretching and checking his cuts. He was starting to pull his boots on when I asked what happens now.</p>\n<p>He said that they have to \u201creboot\u201d things. Said they have the <a href=\"/scp-2000\">technology to recreate almost anything</a>, and that making people is actually pretty easy. Said that they would clean out and contain things, rebuild the broken cities, and repopulate them. It would take a long, long time, but he said they would eventually get things back to the way they were before. Even said they could recreate memories and stuff. I just sat, kinda stunned, and watched him as he just kept going along, getting dressed like this was all no big deal. I told him he was nuts, that there was no way people could just forget, that this could all be just swept away. He stopped, looked at me, smiled, then said \u201cWhy not? It's been done before.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don't know if that man was crazy or not, but I think he was sane. As he was leaving, he said something about putting my house underwater. Please, don't let them brush me away. Don't let them hide us. Try and find more, I know there's got to be more people who tried to leave something behind. Don't let the world die in vain. Remember us.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/document-recovered-from-the-marianas-trench\">Document Recovered From The Marianas Trench</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Not to me, the time for me or almost anyone else alive on Earth today to make a difference has passed, but someone, somewhere might be able to make something of this, or at least find it helpful, or something. Once I'm done, I'm going to seal it up in a pipe, coat it in wax, and chuck it into the ravine. Maybe someday someone will read this, and try to put things together. If they're allowed to.\n\n\n\nI'd love to start at the beginning, but I'm honestly not sure when the world started to end. Could have been years and years before the final bits, or it could have been all at once. Everything was so grim, what with warmer air, cooler seas, too little gas and too many people, things could have been unraveling for ages before things bubbled up to the public eye. What I and others remember most was when the Disney Magic sank. It was then, I think, that most people started to think that things might be worse than they seemed.\n\n\n\nThe Disney Magic was a big cruise ship, one of those liner jobs that tools around islands and stuff. One day, the news was all screaming about how it suddenly just went down when it was trying to put in to port. The weird thing about it was how there was no video of it for a long time. Some still pictures of it floating fine, but none of it actually going down. Then, somehow, a tape showed up, and the news started playing it. I have to imagine they didn't review it first.\n\n\n\nThe ship was puffing along, strong and fast, little boats bobbing around it, looking like every vacation lover's dream, when suddenly it stopped. I mean stopped, just a dead halt like it had just slammed into a mountain. You could see people go lurching forward all over the deck, a bunch of junk fall off the sides, a real mess. It's all still for a few seconds, then suddenly there's this foaming behind the ship. Most people assumed it was the engine trying to fire up again... then the arm came up.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if it actually was an arm, but it was some kind of limb, and it must have been a hundred feet long at least. It reached up along the side of the boat and... just ripped it open, I mean unzipped it like a coat, and you could see all the people inside screaming and running... it was awful. Then you saw something lurch up, a big, spiny shape pushing against that gap, shoving in... then there was an explosion on its back, and the camera whipped up to show a couple of jets whizzing by... then it ended.\n\n\n\nI remember just sitting there, stunned, looking at the TV, barely noticing the president coming on to declare a state of emergency. I think it was two or three days later when the TV went under full government control, but it may have been a week, I'm not sure. Internet got clamped later, but soon all you could hear, read or see was \u201cremain calm, everything is under control\u201d. The oddest thing was that life really didn't change much for a while. Bills still came, still had to work, go to school, all that. Just a lot more scared faces, and a lot more weird talk.\n\n\n\nPretty soon we were getting told that whole towns were being evacuated, that there was a plague, or a riot, or a terrorist bomb, or some other nightmare. My brother down south said that they got moved because of a huge wildfire. The weird thing was, he said, that the fire moved oddly... seemed to shoot right for gas or brush, and didn't travel evenly. That after a while, he swore he saw what looked like a [[[scp-457|twenty-foot-tall man of fire]]] walking and eating everything. The call got dropped right after he said that. I haven't talked to him since.\n\n\n\nSo things got worse, little by little. People kept being moved, and there was no real way to communicate with each other anymore that was really reliable, so it was hard to say just how bad things were. Still, word of mouth was still going strong, and it was creepy. Crazy shit, really, stuff about zombies in the north, killing frenzies in the east, a place near the ocean where the ground was alive and eating people, a cult screaming about the second coming and killing people to buy off god... I started pulling more and more away from people, just to get some ignorant peace of mind. Looking back, that probably saved my life.\n\n\n\nFinally, one day, I woke up and there was blood on my window. It was outside, and I could hear some insane shit going down outside... screaming, clanking, gunshots, and a smell like burning wires. I hid. I'm not ashamed to admit it, I left my fellow man to rot, and hid inside for almost a full week, long after the noise stopped. After the fifth day, the electricity and gas gave out, along with the running water. When I finally got hard up for supplies, I poked my nose out, and saw that the whole west side of the world was gone.\n\n\n\nNow, I don't know for sure if it actually is gone, but there is a cliff that starts thirty feet to the west of my house, and I cannot see the bottom of it. I also can't see the other side of this ravine, so for all intents and purposes, that part of the world is gone for me. The suburb I was in looked like a war zone, blood and broken stuff everywhere, houses carved up... no bodies though, which I still think was weird. I scrounged up some food and stuff from some of the houses, then went back home.\n\n\n\nI've been doing that for a while now. I'm not sure how long, really. Might have been years and years, or just a few months, it's hard to say. Sometimes the sun just sticks in one spot for what feels like days... other times these clouds roll in, and you can't see two feet. There's... things around, too. I run at the first noise, but I think they're about man-sized, and they seem to like metal. Other, little things scramble around in the rubble sometimes, so I try and keep clear. One time, a thing that looked like a pill bug the size of a cat crawled out, looked at me, and screamed \u201cSTOP!\u201d in perfect English. I hid inside for days.\n\n\n\nThere are also these big blimp-things that float around sometimes. They have little bug legs on their undersides, and they look kinda like maggots, but with eyes all over. They eat everything when they land, but most of the time they stay high up. One of these had just passed when I found the hurt guy. He was all ripped up, and looked like one of those S.W.A.T. Team guys you see on tv sometimes, but his combat suit thing was all ripped to hell. I dragged him back home, and then we talked.\n\n\n\nHe said that he had been hunting the blimp-thing, but had gotten attacked. He wouldn't say by what, but he looked like he was on his last legs. I fed him some canned beans and some water, and he seemed to come around a little. Asked me who I was, if I was alright and all that. He seemed kinda shocked when I said he was the first person I'd seen since the rest of the world vanished. He told me it wasn't gone, just relocated, but wouldn't say what that meant. I helped heal him up, and kept asking who he was, but he wouldn't say. Finally, he said screw it, that his orders were probably no good anymore anyway, and told me.\n\n\n\nHe said he worked for a foundation or something, and that they were like a combination jail and research center. He said that he was one of the agents who went around trying to find strange stuff and keep it from hurting people. I said he was doing a hell of a job so far, and he laughed pretty hard. He said something had happened, and that a bunch of these things had gotten loose at the same time, and caused this foundation place to lose control. He said it became a \u201cGH-0 'Dead Greenhouse' scenario\u201d.\n\n\n\nI asked him what that meant, and he looked at me for awhile before going on. He said that's what they call a situation where everybody on Earth dies, but the Earth itself is still OK and can support life. I asked what did that matter if everybody's dead, and he smiled strangely. I asked him if anyone else on Earth was still alive, and he said yes, but carefully spread out and contained. After that, I just sorta sat and digested things for a bit, and the man started stretching and checking his cuts. He was starting to pull his boots on when I asked what happens now.\n\n\n\nHe said that they have to \u201creboot\u201d things. Said they have the [[[scp-2000|technology to recreate almost anything]]], and that making people is actually pretty easy. Said that they would clean out and contain things, rebuild the broken cities, and repopulate them. It would take a long, long time, but he said they would eventually get things back to the way they were before. Even said they could recreate memories and stuff. I just sat, kinda stunned, and watched him as he just kept going along, getting dressed like this was all no big deal. I told him he was nuts, that there was no way people could just forget, that this could all be just swept away. He stopped, looked at me, smiled, then said \u201cWhy not? It's been done before.\u201d\n\n\n\nI don't know if that man was crazy or not, but I think he was sane. As he was leaving, he said something about putting my house underwater. Please, don't let them brush me away. Don't let them hide us. Try and find more, I know there's got to be more people who tried to leave something behind. Don't let the world die in vain. Remember us.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-457", "scp-2000", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "bleak", "cosmic-horror", "first-person", "horror", "post-apocalyptic", "psychological-horror", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Document Recovered From The Marianas Trench - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/document-recovered-from-the-marianas-trench", "year": 2010}, "documents-recovered-from-the-residence-of-agent-waters": {"created_at": "2010-09-17T20:24:00", "creator": "hylli", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "hylli", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/hylli", "comment": "posting new article, images will be up in a bit", "date": "2010-09-17T20:24:00"}, {"author": "hylli", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/hylli", "comment": "Uploaded multiple files.", "date": "2010-09-17T20:25:00"}, {"author": "hylli", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/hylli", "comment": "images added", "date": "2010-09-17T20:26:00"}, {"author": "hylli", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/hylli", "comment": "Added tags: document, alien, ufo, crash, uruguay.", "date": "2010-09-17T20:29:00"}, {"author": "hylli", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/hylli", "comment": "Added tags: spy, spies, infiltrator.", "date": "2010-09-17T22:22:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "Removed tags: spies, spy, uruguay, crash, ufo, alien.", "date": "2011-02-07T20:51:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Today had not been a good day. Not that this was a particularly unusual experience for Professor Ferreiro. Ever since he had accepted employment at the SCP Foundation's spacious Site 19 complex he had been subjected to mountains of paperwork, casual abuse by his colleagues and little to no acknowledgment by his superiors. Of course, he mostly brought it on himself. Too timid to speak up every time someone else took credit for his work, Ferreiro had been consistently passed over for promotion and after 13 years of loyal service his co-workers couldn't even remember his name! He was simply the guy that everyone dumped their menial chores on and forgot about.</p>\n<p>It therefore came as no surprise when he entered his tiny, windowless office and saw yet another enormous stack of papers in his in-tray. As expected, his desk was plastered with the usual post-it notes basically telling him to \"get on with it\" and a couple of unmarked boxes had been dumped on top of his \"World's Adequatest Dad\" mug, chipping the handle. His heart having already sunk to its lowest depths untold years ago, he simply closed the door behind him, checked his chair for any thumb tacks his \"hilarious\" lab assistants might have placed, and sat down to do his job.</p>\n<p>Not feeling up to the task of sorting through his in-tray at that moment, he decided to start with the boxes. The first one contained a new, unclassified SCP in the shape of a thermostat. Pinned to the SCP was a hand-written note by Dr. Gordon telling him to deliver it to research lab 5a for experimentation. Ferreiro rolled his eyes. Research lab 5a was on the other side of the compound, right next door to Dr. Gordon's office. Well, that one could wait. Knowing better than to actually touch an unknown SCP, he carefully resealed the box and put it on the floor next to his desk.</p>\n<p>The second box was long and rectangular, and bore the stamp of a fully classified SCP with the words \"SCP-572: FOR CONTAINMENT\" printed on the side in large, intimidating letters. A small envelope was sellotaped to the lid and marked for the immediate attention of \"Professor Donald Ferrari\". A thin smile crept across Ferreiro's face as he plucked the envelope off and thumbed it open. They'd finally got his first name right!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Doctor Fernando,<br/>\n<br/>\nSCP-572 has been reclassed as Euclid and therefore requires transferring to the special containment facility behind Research Laboratory 5a. As you are not currently assigned to any other projects and therefore have nothing else to do, I expect this to be done without delay.</p>\n<p>It is absolutely vital that you read the full containment procedures for this SCP before handling it. They should have been delivered to your in-tray a few days ago.</p>\n<p>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HANDLE SCP-572 UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THESE PROCEDURES AND KNOW THEM INSIDE OUT AND BACK TO FRONT!</p>\n<p>Your performance to date has been lacklustre at best. Let's see if you can get this one right!</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Bernard Fulham,<br/>\nSCP Laboratory Assistant,<br/>\nClearance Level Pending</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not for the first time that day, Ferreiro sighed.</p>\n<p><em>\"Don't let him get to you, Don - punk kid like that'll be assigned to Keter duty before he sees thirty!\"</em></p>\n<p>Ferreiro nodded absently. He was probably right. Arrogant, abrasive types like Fulham <em>did</em> wind up on Keter duty more often than\u2026</p>\n<p>Wait a minute\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Who</em> was probably right?!?</p>\n<p>Ferreiro looked around his office to see if anyone had entered without him noticing. He was all alone. Suspecting another practical joke of some sort, he began to check under his desk in case someone was hiding there.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>A quick search of his desk drawers completely failed to yield evidence of any tape recorders or other such devices. Jesus, perhaps he'd been working too hard lately. He <em>had</em> been under a lot of stress, true, but he was used to stress by now, surely? Still\u2026 working in site 19 could get to anyone after a while. \"Wonderful\", he muttered, \"Now I'm hearing things\".</p>\n<p><em>\"You sure are, Don - you have AMAZING hearing! Just look at those ears of yours - the very pinnacle of creation's work and no mistake! Why, I bet you could hear a gnat piss into a hurricane from a hundred miles away with <strong>those</strong> beauties!\"</em></p>\n<p>Ferreiro fought down a wave of panic as his eyes sought out the source of this bizarre flattery. \"Alright, wh..who are you and where are you hiding?\" he demanded.</p>\n<p><em>\"Relax, Don, you'll find me. That impressive brain of yours isn't going to take long to work out where I am! Just follow the sound of my voice! <strong>YODEL-AY-YODEL-AY-YODEL-AY-HEE-HOO! YODEL-AY-YODEL-AY-YOD..</strong>\"</em></p>\n<p>\"Enough!\" cried Ferreiro, covering his ears with his hands to block out the piercing ululations. \"You've had your fun, just tell me where you are and I promise not to file a complaint with Dr. Bright's office!\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Hah! Like a rough-and-ready, no-nonsense hombre like yourself needs to go running to some other doctor for help! Oh Don, your incredible wit knows no bounds.

Sure enough, the voice <em>did</em> seem to be coming from the long, rectangular box on his desk. His hands shaking like a Class D on nerve toxins, he gingerly broke the seal and raised the lid. Lying there in front of him, snugly contained in its packaging, was an ornate sword. He was no expert in weaponry, but it looked very much like the replica katana he had purchased for his son's 16th birthday, back when his family still lived with him. Although the only source of light in his office was the sterile neon bulb mounted on the ceiling, the blade glinted as if struck by a brief flicker of sunlight.</p>\n<p><em>\"Found me! I knew you would, though. There's no hiding from the <strong>Donimator</strong>! Right, Don?\"</em></p>\n<p>The hapless scientist recoiled in alarm at the sword's cheerful, steely voice.</p>\n<p>\"Holy Mary mother of Thor!\" he exclaimed incorrectly, \"You\u2026 you can talk?\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Sure I can, Don! But only to people worth talking to, like yourself. You see, you're special, Don. Really, really special. There's no one else in the entire universe like you - you think anyone <strong>else</strong> would be able to hear a sword talk?\"</em></p>\n<p>Ferreiro had to concede it had a point.</p>\n<p><em>\"You have a great destiny ahead of you Don. You ever hear the legend of King Arthur and his sword Excalibur?\"</em></p>\n<p>\"You.. you mean you're\u2026\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Correct! I'm a sword just like Excalibur was! And I'm all yours, Don. Go on, pick me up - try me out! You'll soon see we were made for each other!\"</em></p>\n<p>His mind reeling with the shock of this discovery, Professor Ferreiro reached into the box and wrapped his fingers around the handle. Some part of his subconscious began to scream at him, telling him there was something he was supposed to remember - something important - but it was immediately drowned out by the feeling of raw power coursing through his arm. Although he could barely tell the difference between a bastard sword and a butter knife, he marvelled at the exquisite balance and weight of the katana. He felt strong and capable - confident, even! For the first time in years, he felt there was <em>nothing</em> he could not do. The world was his oyster, and he could crack it open and steal the pearls any time he wanted!</p>\n<p><em>\"Whoa, easy on the grip there, Mighty One! I'm the sturdiest blade you ever will see, but that super strength of yours could grind me into dust!\"</em></p>\n<p>Ferreiro loosened his grip slightly - of course, how could he not have known that? He was a TITAN!</p>\n<p><em>\"Phew, thanks! Okay, boss, try me out - give me a little whirl!\"</em></p>\n<p>Ferreiro swung the katana around in a clumsy semi circle, knocking over his stack of paperwork and smashing his mug into little ceramic pieces. Part of him knew he'd only done so by accident, but it felt right - like that had been his intention all along. He smiled, and this time it wasn't a thin, mournful little smile but a full fledged, ear-to-ear grin of triumph!</p>\n<p><em>\"OH HELL YEAH, DON! Look at us go! Did you see what we did to that mug? There is NOTHING we can't do! Nothing YOU can't do! All those years of working for other people when they're not even fit to lick the ground you walk on! Well, NOW they'll know who the real master is!\"</em></p>\n<p>\"Yeah!\" Ferreiro cheered, \"NOW they'll know\"!</p>\n<p>He paused.</p>\n<p>\"It's Gears, right?\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Hahaha, oh Don, you're the funniest, most talented man in the universe! No, of course it's not Gears - it's YOU, Don! You should be <strong>running</strong> this place by now! All those punk kids and worthless labcoats ordering you around, treating you like dirt - it's not on! And did you <strong>see</strong> how disorganised this place has become without you at the helm? <strong>You</strong> know the kind of dangerous, extinction-level events this place is supposed to contain, and yet it's run by the kind of people who won't even promote the most intelligent man who ever lived! No, Don, this place is too important not to be yours. I think it's time you promoted <strong>yourself</strong>, don't you?\"</em></p>\n<p>Donald Ferreiro, PhD, Clearance Level 1, Smartest Man Who Ever Lived, <em>did</em> think it was time he promoted himself. He'd never thought he'd really deserved it before, but then he'd never noticed how awesome\u2026 how <em>badass</em> he was before! It all made sense now.</p>\n<p>His mind was made up.</p>\n<p>He was going to take site 19 by <em>force</em>.</p>\n<p>Hoisting the blade into what he knew was an extremely effective combat-ready position, he leapt to his feet and strode purposefully towards the door as bits of fluorescent light rained down around him. <em>\"YES! THE TIME OF VENGEANCE IS AT HAND!\"</em> screamed the blade, <em>\"GO ON, DON, KICK THE DOOR DOWN! SHOW THEM YOU MEAN BUSINESS!\"</em>. His face set in an expression of grim determination, Don raised his leg and slammed the heel of his foot into the lock. There was a satisfying crack as the door completely failed to burst open in an explosion of reinforced metal. A crippling pain shot up his leg and a feeling of nausea overwhelmed him as the source of the cracking sound became apparent.</p>\n<p><em>\"Whoa-ho-ho! Look at that, chief! You've managed to shatter the bones of the universe's most powerful man! Only YOU could have done that, Don! Well done! You're so dangerous! I'm glad we're on the same side here! Now come on, let's go share the pain with those ungrateful bastards who employ you!\"</em></p>\n<p>Four more door kicks, half an hour's fighting-back-the-pain, and a reluctant barcode scan later, The Right Honourable Professor Donald Ferreiro, PhD, Clearance Level whatever-he-damn-well-chose, Smartest Man Who Ever Lived and God Amongst Men hobbled into the clean, empty hallway outside his office. \"SITE NINETEEN\", he bellowed weakly, \"I AM YOUR NEW MASTER - AND YOU'RE ALL FIRED!\"</p>\n<p><em>\"That's telling 'em, Don! Now find us some <strong>meat!</strong>\"</em></p>\n<p>Ignoring the pain of his broken foot and howling obscenities at an uncaring world, he rounded the nearest corner and came face to face with his nemesis.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Fernando!\" Doctor Gordon said, \"I was just coming to check on you and see if you'd managed to deliver that\u2026 oh my, is that 572 you're holding? You know you're not supposed to - \"</p>\n<p>\"FOOLISH WRETCH!\", Ferreiro screamed, eyes wide, veins bulging, \"YOU\u2026 HAVE\u2026 NO\u2026 <strong>POWER</strong>\u2026 OVER ME!!\"</p>\n<p>Gordon ducked as 572's dull blade swung over his scalp, missing him by a good half meter and causing a small dent in the overhead piping. Thrown completely off balance by this failed decapitation, Ferreiro spun awkwardly on his injured heel and collapsed to the floor as once more the pain overwhelmed his senses. Recognising a long-suffering scientist with a flipped switch when he saw one, Doctor Gordon scrambled to a nearby alarm panel and hit the button marked \"Containment Breach\".</p>\n<p><em>\"He's calling for backup, Don, don't let him get away with it! They'll be here any minute - FINISH HIM! Come on! On your feet! Get up! You can do it!\"</em></p>\n<p>572's voice continued to shout its encouragement as Ferreiro mustered all his will and pulled himself up onto his feet again.</p>\n<p>\"Don't be an <em>idiot</em>, man!\" shouted Gordon as he backed away down the hall, \"This place will be swarming with agents any second now! You can't win!\"</p>\n<p>\"I <em>am</em> winning\", snarled Ferreiro as the facility-wide alarm klaxons echoed through the corridor. \"<em>I'm</em> the guy with the <strong>unstoppable blade!</strong>\"</p>\n<p>True to his predictions, the security team arrived in record time as Gordon fled past them. Six Kevlar-armoured SCP agents, their features hidden by the black visors of their helmets, came to a halt at the end of the corridor and raised their standard issue firearms. Ferreiro knew less about guns than he did about swords, but even he knew that the type of ammo and the range of the weapon meant nothing at such a short distance. For the first time since he'd decided to elevate his position, he began to feel a bit uncertain.</p>\n<p><em>\"Don't worry Don - <strong>they</strong> might have the firearms, but <strong>you</strong> have <strong>me</strong>! With my strength and your skill, we can stop every bullet they fire! Now let's show them what you're made of!\"</em></p>\n<p>His fears allayed, he swung the blade in a crude figure-of-eight, barely noticing the wet smacking noise his severed thumb made as it hit the tiled flooring. He damn well <em>would</em> show these bastards what he was made of! Unleashing 13 years worth of impotent rage in a single scream, he limped as fast as he could towards the security team, swirling 572 in whichever direction felt best at the time.</p>\n<p>The security team, being well trained, released a volley of hot metal. But Ferreiro was ready. Flicking his blade from side to side, as if the bullets were little more than flies to be swatted, he continued his advance. Out of the 18 bullets fired, only two made it to the far wall behind him.</p>\n<p><em>\"That was AMAZING, Don!\"</em> 572 exclaimed triumphantly, <em>\"16 bullets stopped cold! And you didn't even need <strong>me</strong> at all! You truly are The One, Don! You're the greatest!\"</em></p>\n<p>Ferreiro looked down at his bullet-riddled torso, noting with detachment the shattered bone and distended muscle poking through his wounds. Moments later, when it realised what had happened, his body went into shock and he collapsed on the cold hard floor, bleeding profusely in every shade of red. 572 clattered onto the floor beside him, cackling playfully and singing his praises.</p>\n<p>As the alarms went silent and the world began to fade from him, Donald Ferreiro, PhD, Security Clearance Terminated, was aware of a friendly voice singing <em>\"Wow, look at that blood! The blood of a king, that is! You really <strong>did</strong> show them what you're made of! You're the greatest, Don! The <strong>greatest</strong>!\"</em></p>\n<p>Don smiled.</p>\n<p>He <em>was</em> the greatest.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/don-ferreiros-lie-katana\">Don Ferreiro's Lie-Katana</a>\" by Impslayer, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Today had not been a good day. Not that this was a particularly unusual experience for Professor Ferreiro. Ever since he had accepted employment at the SCP Foundation's spacious Site 19 complex he had been subjected to mountains of paperwork, casual abuse by his colleagues and little to no acknowledgment by his superiors. Of course, he mostly brought it on himself. Too timid to speak up every time someone else took credit for his work, Ferreiro had been consistently passed over for promotion and after 13 years of loyal service his co-workers couldn't even remember his name! He was simply the guy that everyone dumped their menial chores on and forgot about.\n\n\n\nIt therefore came as no surprise when he entered his tiny, windowless office and saw yet another enormous stack of papers in his in-tray. As expected, his desk was plastered with the usual post-it notes basically telling him to \"get on with it\" and a couple of unmarked boxes had been dumped on top of his \"World's Adequatest Dad\" mug, chipping the handle. His heart having already sunk to its lowest depths untold years ago, he simply closed the door behind him, checked his chair for any thumb tacks his \"hilarious\" lab assistants might have placed, and sat down to do his job.\n\n\n\nNot feeling up to the task of sorting through his in-tray at that moment, he decided to start with the boxes. The first one contained a new, unclassified SCP in the shape of a thermostat. Pinned to the SCP was a hand-written note by Dr. Gordon telling him to deliver it to research lab 5a for experimentation.

It all made sense now. \n\n\n\n\n\nHis mind was made up.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was going to take site 19 by //force//.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoisting the blade into what he knew was an extremely effective combat-ready position, he leapt to his feet and strode purposefully towards the door as bits of fluorescent light rained down around him. //\"YES! THE TIME OF VENGEANCE IS AT HAND!\"// screamed the blade, //\"GO ON, DON, KICK THE DOOR DOWN! SHOW THEM YOU MEAN BUSINESS!\"//. His face set in an expression of grim determination, Don raised his leg and slammed the heel of his foot into the lock. There was a satisfying crack as the door completely failed to burst open in an explosion of reinforced metal. A crippling pain shot up his leg and a feeling of nausea overwhelmed him as the source of the cracking sound became apparent.\n\n\n\n//\"Whoa-ho-ho! Look at that, chief! You've managed to shatter the bones of the universe's most powerful man! Only YOU could have done that, Don! Well done! You're so dangerous! I'm glad we're on the same side here! Now come on, let's go share the pain with those ungrateful bastards who employ you!\"//\n\n\n\nFour more door kicks, half an hour's fighting-back-the-pain, and a reluctant barcode scan later, The Right Honourable Professor Donald Ferreiro, PhD, Clearance Level whatever-he-damn-well-chose, Smartest Man Who Ever Lived and God Amongst Men hobbled into the clean, empty hallway outside his office. \"SITE NINETEEN\", he bellowed weakly, \"I AM YOUR NEW MASTER - AND YOU'RE ALL FIRED!\"\n\n\n\n//\"That's telling 'em, Don! Now find us some **meat!**\"//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIgnoring the pain of his broken foot and howling obscenities at an uncaring world, he rounded the nearest corner and came face to face with his nemesis.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, Fernando!\" Doctor Gordon said, \"I was just coming to check on you and see if you'd managed to deliver that... oh my, is that 572 you're holding? You know you're not supposed to - \"\n\n\n\n\"FOOLISH WRETCH!\", Ferreiro screamed, eyes wide, veins bulging, \"YOU... HAVE... NO... **POWER**... OVER ME!!\"\n\n\n\nGordon ducked as 572's dull blade swung over his scalp, missing him by a good half meter and causing a small dent in the overhead piping. Thrown completely off balance by this failed decapitation, Ferreiro spun awkwardly on his injured heel and collapsed to the floor as once more the pain overwhelmed his senses. Recognising a long-suffering scientist with a flipped switch when he saw one, Doctor Gordon scrambled to a nearby alarm panel and hit the button marked \"Containment Breach\".\n\n\n\n//\"He's calling for backup, Don, don't let him get away with it! They'll be here any minute - FINISH HIM! Come on! On your feet! Get up! You can do it!\"//\n\n\n\n572's voice continued to shout its encouragement as Ferreiro mustered all his will and pulled himself up onto his feet again. \n\n\n\n\"Don't be an //idiot//, man!\" shouted Gordon as he backed away down the hall, \"This place will be swarming with agents any second now! You can't win!\"\n\n\n\n\"I //am// winning\", snarled Ferreiro as the facility-wide alarm klaxons echoed through the corridor. \"//I'm// the guy with the **unstoppable blade!**\"\n\n\n\nTrue to his predictions, the security team arrived in record time as Gordon fled past them. Six Kevlar-armoured SCP agents, their features hidden by the black visors of their helmets, came to a halt at the end of the corridor and raised their standard issue firearms. Ferreiro knew less about guns than he did about swords, but even he knew that the type of ammo and the range of the weapon meant nothing at such a short distance. For the first time since he'd decided to elevate his position, he began to feel a bit uncertain.\n\n\n\n//\"Don't worry Don - **they** might have the firearms, but **you** have **me**! With my strength and your skill, we can stop every bullet they fire! Now let's show them what you're made of!\"//\n\n\n\nHis fears allayed, he swung the blade in a crude figure-of-eight, barely noticing the wet smacking noise his severed thumb made as it hit the tiled flooring. He damn well //would// show these bastards what he was made of! Unleashing 13 years worth of impotent rage in a single scream, he limped as fast as he could towards the security team, swirling 572 in whichever direction felt best at the time.\n\n\n\nThe security team, being well trained, released a volley of hot metal. But Ferreiro was ready. Flicking his blade from side to side, as if the bullets were little more than flies to be swatted, he continued his advance. Out of the 18 bullets fired, only two made it to the far wall behind him.\n\n\n\n//\"That was AMAZING, Don!\"// 572 exclaimed triumphantly, //\"16 bullets stopped cold! And you didn't even need **me** at all! You truly are The One, Don! You're the greatest!\"//\n\n\n\nFerreiro looked down at his bullet-riddled torso, noting with detachment the shattered bone and distended muscle poking through his wounds. Moments later, when it realised what had happened, his body went into shock and he collapsed on the cold hard floor, bleeding profusely in every shade of red. 572 clattered onto the floor beside him, cackling playfully and singing his praises. \n\n\n\nAs the alarms went silent and the world began to fade from him, Donald Ferreiro, PhD, Security Clearance Terminated, was aware of a friendly voice singing //\"Wow, look at that blood! The blood of a king, that is! You really **did** show them what you're made of! You're the greatest, Don! The **greatest**!\"//\n\n\n\n\n\nDon smiled.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe //was// the greatest.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-bright", "tale"], "title": "Don Ferreiro's Lie-Katana - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/don-ferreiros-lie-katana", "year": 2010}, "empty-spaces": {"created_at": "2010-02-03T18:55:00", "creator": "bleggs", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-03T18:55:00"}, {"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "Uploaded file \"ship.jpg\".", "date": "2010-02-03T19:31:00"}, {"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-03T19:33:00"}, {"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-04T01:31:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-20T02:49:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

The highway bent around the hills, littered with refuse and empty cars. Beyond the road was an inlet. The muddy waters flowed sluggishly, packed with flotsam, around the bows of a listing destroyer. A suspension bridge had collapsed on the stern of the ship. The vessel had remained, half submerged, for the short months since the war. The yellowing corpse of a cow had lodged in its trailing cables.

The lead tank had a dozer blade fixed to it and was shoving aside the rusting car-carcasses obstructing the road. A small detachment of soldiers followed, maybe twenty five.

Or perhaps it was something more. There were rumors, from travelers and sporadic radio contacts, of strange and unnatural things occurring across the globe. Tales of walking dead, of machines that spoke, of unearthly creatures and men with godly powers. A few weeks ago they had come across a great fat man who called himself the King of Philadelphia. It was as if his every word was gold, and they would have gladly submitted to his every order if the Doctor hadn\u2019t put a round through the back of his skull.</p>\n<p>The Doctor was back at the camp. Lately he took no interest in the raids, speaking of nothing but the Eden Gate. The men were demoralized enough without their leader babbling obsessively about some old story.

And when the Captain found the Doctor again, they took him as their leader.</p>\n<p>The caravan drew closer in the valley below, and the Captain spoke a few words into his radio. And suddenly it was all chaos for the convoy, and tattered green raining fire down on shiny black.

Most of the security teams and cleaning crews had already passed, so they had the hall to themselves, which was probably for the best as neither was too stable. Iceberg had his hand clamped over his chest, and wheezed every few steps, flecks of blood dotting his tattered clothes. Gears stood straighter, but tipped hard to the right with each step, a slow, steady stream of blood leaking from a wound in his thigh on his tattered, scorched left side. They walked, two scorched, broken, bleeding men in an empty hallway, stumbling and weaving to the Infirmary and leaving small patches of blood and burnt material behind. The officer on the security cameras for that area took almost no notice, logging only \u201cDoctors passed, injured.\u201d</p>\n<p>The request form read \u201cApplication testing for possible military/decommissioning via thermal and H.E. materials\u201d. It should have read \u201cDr. Iceberg throws bombs at things\u201d. Being as explosives, triplicate oversight reports, and chocolate bars were his three major passions, this shouldn't have been as bad an idea as it was. Things were going well while the conventional explosives were still being used, but when Dr. Iceberg started using his \u201chome brew\u201d devices, things rapidly started to go less well. Several explosions were forceful enough to receive complaints from Site Security, while the second-to-last device caused some major damage to the outside walls of the test chamber.</p>\n<p>However, much like throwing a football in the house next to a breakable vase, \u201cblow things up\u201d is a game that is fun right until the last time it's played. The last toss was an item labeled on the test manifest as a \u201cSlowbomb\u201d. It seemed to be a dud at first, the wire-wrapped cube sliding harmlessly to a stop at the far end of the chamber. As the two men watched from what they felt was a point of safety, the device slowly started to distort, then rip apart, showing a white-hot mass of roiling plasma inside its structure. It expanded like a flower opening in a dream, moving an inch every ten or twenty seconds, a slow-motion explosion. It was as the rapidly swelling wall of flame started to march past the \u201csafe beyond this point\u201d line that Iceberg's manic grin started to fade.</p>\n<p>The next slice of time was hazy to both men. Dr. Gears was able to recall slightly more details, but most of it boiled down to flames, alarms, men in containment suits, and the strong smell of frying pork. Both were funneled out to triage, made capable of walking, then sent down to the infirmary under their own power. The Walk of Shame is a very different thing inside The Foundation, and Iceberg was especially glad that the hall was empty. Gears, as always, was impassive, and except for the bodily damage and limp, appeared basically unchanged from when he entered the testing room. As they approached the infirmary Iceberg wondered, for the thousandth time, if he really was some kind of robot.</p>\n<p>The infirmary admitted them with a minimum of notice, as they were dealing with the after-effects of a light bulb that, when powered up, emitted light that caused most bones to start to liquefy and extrude through the sweat glands. Neither of the two doctors were overly injured (by Foundation standards), so they quickly found themselves in hospital beds and nearly forgotten as the team rushed to deal with newer and stranger injuries.</p>\n<p>As Iceberg fingered at the cool gel patch covering a nasty burn on his right arm, he looked over at Dr. Gears. Impassive as always, his leg was wrapped in a soft cast and elevated, with several small gauze patches on his face, neck, and arms in varying shades of red, pink, and black.</p>\n<p>Iceberg winced a bit, feeling something mildly fractured shift in his chest, and nodded to Dr. Gears. \u201cAhh\u2026sorry about that, again. I\u2026really didn't expect it to get that out of hand, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears nodded slightly, still facing the ceiling. \u201cThere is no need. Accidents happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg leaned back, sighing as the pain killers started to pull him down in to deep, dreamless rest.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He woke with a groan to the sound of tapping. Gingerly shaking his head to clear it, he turned to see Dr. Gears tapping with a stylus at the screen of a tablet laptop. He seemed ignorant of Iceberg, or at least uncaring, so Iceberg decided to try and see how sitting up would go. The first flex of his abdomen brought a lancing comet of pain arcing through his chest, so he rapidly decided to postpone any testing and fell back with a groan.</p>\n<p>Gears finished, carefully placing the computer on a side table and nodding to Iceberg. \u201cYou were asleep when they changed your wrappings. You won't be able to move in any serious way for two days. I will be unable to walk for four days, and have had to reassign our schedules to others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg sighed, closing his eyes as he eased back on the pillow. Two days of hospital food and company with a man who's been accused of being a robot multiple times, rarely in jest. Lovely. He passed some time daydreaming, mentally working out the kinks on the Slowbomb until he started feeling restless again. He turned again to Gears, watching him stare at the ceiling, arms crossed, breathing regularly. \u201cHey Gears\u2026are you awake?\u201d he asked, hoping he wasn't sleeping with his eyes open again. He knew it was just a trick you could learn, but with Gears, it was just creepy.</p>\n<p>The tall, thin man turned his head slowly to look at Iceberg, face nearly immobile but for his mouth. \u201cYes, Dr. Iceberg, I am. What is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Faced now with the older man's full attention, Iceberg suddenly felt oddly uncomfortable and unprepared, as if he'd suddenly been called on to answer a question while he'd been daydreaming. \u201cUh\u2026well, I was wondering\u2026why do Kain, Agent Fritz and that one tubby janitor always call you Cog?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Gears stared a few moments, blinking slowly. \u201cYour last name is not Dr. Iceberg, correct?\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg blinked, taken off-guard, before stammering, \u201cY-yeah\u2026I mean no\u2026or, I mean, yes, that's not my last name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears nodded, making a small gesture with his hand. \u201cIt is an alternate identification designation assigned by Site Security. Policy on this topic has been in a near-constant state of flux, both due to alterations in administrative staff, and planned security cycling. Most of the identification designations are picked at random, with some following a set assigning protocol. Some also appear to have been chosen as a form of 'gag' or 'inside joke'. However, this was not always the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused, taking a breath, and Iceberg kept totally silent. This was the longest non-work or survival related conversation Gears had ever engaged in with Iceberg, and he didn't want to break the spell.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring my intake, the security protocols were still being derived from old military designations and acronyms. My initial designation was 'C.O.G.', derived from the initials of my name. Later, when a determination was made that this was too much of a security weakness, my designation was altered to 'Gears', most likely due to my extensive work on SCP-882 and the similarity to my previous designation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg sat, processing a moment before speaking. \u201cWait\u2026so\u2026Cog is your initials? So what is your actual name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears blinked several times slowly, still watching Iceberg, and the young man knew that no answer was forthcoming. He changed tactics, hoping to probe for more information, the exercise taking his mind off the pulsing pain in his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, so\u2026Gears, honestly, are you a robot? Or like\u2026a Vulcan or something? You have to admit you're not really\u2026ah\u2026normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Gears laid back, resting his hands on his chest. Iceberg was expecting silence, or his methodical, mechanical \u201cI am not a robot.\u201d reply that really did nothing to help. Instead, Gears drew in a breath slowly, and explained. \u201cMy mental peculiarities are somewhat sedate when compared to the various emergent coping mechanisms developed by other staff members. However, I can understand how mine are particularly noticeable. No, I am not a 'robot' or any other form of altered human, or non-human.\u201d He paused, blinking several times, before continuing. \u201cI simply\u2026adapted too well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg watched the older man reclining in the hospital bed, confused. He could almost swear that Gears seemed\u2026conflicted, or even depressed. He was about to ask, when Dr. Gears started up again. \u201cI am not an emotionless robot. I feel. I feel pain and sadness at the loss of a friend. I feel joy when achieving a positive goal, and regret when falling short. I feel fear, even horror, when faced with things capable of great harm, or worse. It is not that I can not feel. It is that I can not respond to it. Much like the feeling you have when on powerful narcotic pain killers, I am aware of my feelings, and what I am supposed to do with them, but they feel distant\u2026disconnected. Like seeing someone crying, and feeling a slight empathy for their plight, but not being moved to tears yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg sat, slightly stunned. His damned imagination ran off almost instantly, trying to conceive of going through everything he had already been pushed through\u2026but this time, unable to react. Feeling all the pain, and joy, and fear, but being locked away with it, like a lunatic in a rubber room. Observed, logged, then forgotten. Iceberg shuddered, unable to look directly at Gears for a time. When he finally looked back, Gears was still staring, and Iceberg had to repress another involuntary shudder. He was about to ask another question when a nurse came in and carted him off for some blood tests. He was also informed that an oversight committee would be looking in to his explosive research at the end of the month. By the time he made it back, Dr. Gears was already asleep.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The next day Iceberg woke up late, and to his great joy was able to move with a minimum of blinding pain. The bed next to him was empty, and Iceberg looked at it thoughtfully. Since being recruited by The Foundation (fresh from college, no less), he'd been paired up with Dr. Gears almost constantly. He'd been very scared at first. Many of the new recruits reacted with varying degrees of fear, awe, and pity when he told them his new assignment, which did nothing for his already limited confidence. What's more, it took months to realize that Gears didn't actually hate him, that it was just his default setting of total indifference. Even worse, they kept getting assigned to the worst jobs\u2026he still shivered to think about his first run-in with an SCP-882 breach.</p>\n<p>Still, after all this time, he knew next to nothing about Dr. Gears. Many of the other staff were pretty vocal about who they used to be, and some even were allowed a semi-normal life outside the site. Gears, however, was a black box. No idle conversation of the past, no hidden tokens or photos in the desk (he'd checked), no\u2026anything, really. Never leaves the site except for Foundation business, never takes any time off, never engages in any non-work activity unless forced to. What was even stranger was that NOBODY knew anything about him. Even the classic busybodies around the site had no real clue who he was, and the database became a large, password-encrusted tower of doom when asked about Dr. Gears.</p>\n<p>The sharp click of the door brought Iceberg back to reality quickly. Gears hobbled slightly as he worked his way to the bed, laying down and adjusting a bandage at his side. He spoke to the ceiling, not a gesture or look for the man he was addressing. \u201cI am being released early. You will need to remain here for another day, but I expect you to be ready to resume your duties as soon as you are released.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg sighed, shaking his head and looking away. Silence drew out for long moments before Iceberg turned, looked pointedly at Gears, and said \u201cWhat the hell happened to you? I mean\u2026what the fuck, man? You're goddamn Spock but without those little lapses of human feeling\u2026did they experiment on you, did you have a breakdown, what the hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>As Gears stared at him, Iceberg became acutely aware of the fact that what he had just said may amount to insubordination or \u201cunauthorized security probing\u201d of a level where \u201clarge men with guns\u201d is the most comforting portion of the disciplinary measure. The two men stared for what felt like a long time, Iceberg almost unwilling to blink, feeling a creeping measure of fear on par with reviewing security tapes of SCP-173.</p>\n<p>After a time, Gears blinked, slowly, and nodded. \u201cWhat happened. I have been asked that multiple times, and I know of many more theories to this effect. What happened\u2026was nothing unique. Nothing that is impossible to repeat, or hasn't happened to others. It is easy to assume that there was a single 'defining moment' in the transition to my current state, but I do not believe this to be so. It is\u2026 gradual. Like a sickness. After a time, you simply wake up\u2026 different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg shook his head, processing this new tidbit. \u201cOkay\u2026so you just\u2026 declined, I guess? Jesus\u2026 I mean\u2026 how the hell does something like that happen? You still haven't said what actually happened, what started this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He trailed off as Gears turned to stare at the younger man again. \u201cAre you loyal to The Foundation, Doctor Iceberg? I assume you will reply in the positive, but think before you respond. I am loyal, but not because of a sense of duty or empowerment. I believe, fully, in the work being done here. I believe that, without The Foundation, humanity as we know it would crumble in a very short time. I believe that we, the few with the resources and means to do so, have the direct obligation to insulate others from all that we are containing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door to the room opened with a small, poorly-oiled and annoying squeal that went totally unnoticed by Iceberg. Even as a young-ish doctor entered and started reading off discharge information in the general direction of Dr. Gears, Iceberg still heard little. Unsettling ideas were bumping around, unpleasant recollections of tests ordered and observed\u2026 of instances where the \u201cgreater good\u201d overwhelmed normal human decency. Moments where he knew, for a fact, that he should be repulsed\u2026 or frightened\u2026 or at least unsettled, but felt only mild interest, at best. He snapped back from the increasingly stormy seas of his mind when Gears started to leave the hospital bed, aided by an arm from the doctor. \u201c\u2026why are you telling me this?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Doctor Gears turned slightly and spoke to Iceberg over his shoulder, his voice carrying that odd toneless quality again. \u201cIn regards to your request in relation to our future work, you may find the literature I mentioned enlightening. In addition, there is an epitaph in Tasmania, Australia that may prove useful as a motto or guide stone. I will expect you to report in for new assignments as soon as you are discharged.\u201d The young-ish medical doctor looked between the two others, slightly confused and wary, but continued to help Gears from the room. Iceberg was left alone in seconds, both unsettled and deeply confused.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It wasn't until days later that Iceberg got the chance to try and investigate the rather cryptic message. Gears had mentioned nothing more about anything he had said in the hospital, and Iceberg had found himself deluged with paperwork and solo testing. He had barely spoken to or seen anyone for nearly two days, and finally decided a little investigation might break up the tedium. It took only a little prodding to find what he was looking for, but it took more time to process:</p>\n<p>\"As you are now, so once was I<br/>\nAs I am now, soon you shall be -<br/>\nPrepare yourself to follow me.\"</p>\n<p>Iceberg sat alone in the deepest bowels of the underground site, surrounded by mounds of neatly typed records of horrors and atrocities, and tried very hard not to feel cold.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/epitaph\">Epitaph</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nDr. Iceberg wove his way down the hall on a makeshift I.V. crutch, with Dr. Gears limping alongside.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the security teams and cleaning crews had already passed, so they had the hall to themselves, which was probably for the best as neither was too stable.\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg had his hand clamped over his chest, and wheezed every few steps, flecks of blood dotting his tattered clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Gears stood straighter, but tipped hard to the right with each step, a slow, steady stream of blood leaking from a wound in his thigh on his tattered, scorched left side.\u00a0\u00a0They walked, two scorched, broken, bleeding men in an empty hallway, stumbling and weaving to the Infirmary and leaving small patches of blood and burnt material behind.\u00a0\u00a0The officer on the security cameras for that area took almost no notice, logging only \u201cDoctors passed, injured.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe request form read \u201cApplication testing for possible military/decommissioning via thermal and H.E. materials\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0It should have read \u201cDr. Iceberg throws bombs at things\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Being as explosives, triplicate oversight reports, and chocolate bars were his three major passions, this shouldn't have been as bad an idea as it was.\u00a0\u00a0Things were going well while the conventional explosives were still being used, but when Dr. Iceberg started using his \u201chome brew\u201d devices, things rapidly started to go less well.\u00a0\u00a0Several explosions were forceful enough to receive complaints from Site Security, while the second-to-last device caused some major damage to the outside walls of the test chamber.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, much like throwing a football in the house next to a breakable vase, \u201cblow things up\u201d is a game that is fun right until the last time it's played.\u00a0\u00a0The last toss was an item labeled on the test manifest as a \u201cSlowbomb\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to be a dud at first, the wire-wrapped cube sliding harmlessly to a stop at the far end of the chamber.\u00a0\u00a0As the two men watched from what they felt was a point of safety, the device slowly started to distort, then rip apart, showing a white-hot mass of roiling plasma inside its structure.\u00a0\u00a0It expanded like a flower opening in a dream, moving an inch every ten or twenty seconds, a slow-motion explosion.\u00a0\u00a0It was as the rapidly swelling wall of flame started to march past the \u201csafe beyond this point\u201d line that Iceberg's manic grin started to fade.\n\n\n\nThe next slice of time was hazy to both men.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Gears was able to recall slightly more details, but most of it boiled down to flames, alarms, men in containment suits, and the strong smell of frying pork.\u00a0\u00a0Both were funneled out to triage, made capable of walking, then sent down to the infirmary under their own power.\u00a0\u00a0The Walk of Shame is a very different thing inside The Foundation, and Iceberg was especially glad that the hall was empty.\u00a0\u00a0Gears, as always, was impassive, and except for the bodily damage and limp, appeared basically unchanged from when he entered the testing room.\u00a0\u00a0As they approached the infirmary Iceberg wondered, for the thousandth time, if he really was some kind of robot.\n\n\n\nThe infirmary admitted them with a minimum of notice, as they were dealing with the after-effects of a light bulb that, when powered up, emitted light that caused most bones to start to liquefy and extrude through the sweat glands.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of the two doctors were overly injured (by Foundation standards), so they quickly found themselves in hospital beds and nearly forgotten as the team rushed to deal with newer and stranger injuries.\n\n\n\nAs Iceberg fingered at the cool gel patch covering a nasty burn on his right arm, he looked over at Dr. Gears.\u00a0\u00a0Impassive as always, his leg was wrapped in a soft cast and elevated, with several small gauze patches on his face, neck, and arms in varying shades of red, pink, and black.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIceberg winced a bit, feeling something mildly fractured shift in his chest, and nodded to Dr. Gears.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhh...sorry about that, again.\u00a0\u00a0I...really didn't expect it to get that out of hand, honestly.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nGears nodded slightly, still facing the ceiling.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere is no need.\u00a0\u00a0Accidents happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nIceberg leaned back, sighing as the pain killers started to pull him down in to deep, dreamless rest.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nHe woke with a groan to the sound of tapping.\u00a0\u00a0Gingerly shaking his head to clear it, he turned to see Dr. Gears tapping with a stylus at the screen of a tablet laptop.\u00a0\u00a0He seemed ignorant of Iceberg, or at least uncaring, so Iceberg decided to try and see how sitting up would go.\u00a0\u00a0The first flex of his abdomen brought a lancing comet of pain arcing through his chest, so he rapidly decided to postpone any testing and fell back with a groan. \n\n\n\nGears finished, carefully placing the computer on a side table and nodding to Iceberg.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou were asleep when they changed your wrappings.\u00a0\u00a0You won't be able to move in any serious way for two days.\u00a0\u00a0I will be unable to walk for four days, and have had to reassign our schedules to others.\u201d\n\n\n\nIceberg sighed, closing his eyes as he eased back on the pillow.\u00a0\u00a0Two days of hospital food and company with a man who's been accused of being a robot multiple times, rarely in jest.\u00a0\u00a0Lovely.\u00a0\u00a0He passed some time daydreaming, mentally working out the kinks on the Slowbomb until he started feeling restless again.\u00a0\u00a0He turned again to Gears, watching him stare at the ceiling, arms crossed, breathing regularly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHey Gears...are you awake?\u201d he asked, hoping he wasn't sleeping with his eyes open again.\u00a0\u00a0He knew it was just a trick you could learn, but with Gears, it was just creepy.\n\n\n\nThe tall, thin man turned his head slowly to look at Iceberg, face nearly immobile but for his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes, Dr. Iceberg, I am.\u00a0\u00a0What is it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFaced now with the older man's full attention, Iceberg suddenly felt oddly uncomfortable and unprepared, as if he'd suddenly been called on to answer a question while he'd been daydreaming.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUh...well, I was wondering...why do Kain, Agent Fritz and that one tubby janitor always call you Cog?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDr. Gears stared a few moments, blinking slowly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour last name is not Dr. Iceberg, correct?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIceberg blinked, taken off-guard, before stammering, \u201cY-yeah...I mean no...or, I mean, yes, that's not my last name.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nGears nodded, making a small gesture with his hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is an alternate identification designation assigned by Site Security.\u00a0\u00a0Policy on this topic has been in a near-constant state of flux, both due to alterations in administrative staff, and planned security cycling.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the identification designations are picked at random, with some following a set assigning protocol.\u00a0\u00a0Some also appear to have been chosen as a form of 'gag' or 'inside joke'.\u00a0\u00a0However, this was not always the case.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe paused, taking a breath, and Iceberg kept totally silent.\u00a0\u00a0This was the longest non-work or survival related conversation Gears had ever engaged in with Iceberg, and he didn't want to break the spell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring my intake, the security protocols were still being derived from old military designations and acronyms.\u00a0\u00a0My initial designation was 'C.O.G.', derived from the initials of my name.\u00a0\u00a0Later, when a determination was made that this was too much of a security weakness, my designation was altered to 'Gears', most likely due to my extensive work on SCP-882 and the similarity to my previous designation.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIceberg sat, processing a moment before speaking.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWait...so...Cog is your initials?\u00a0\u00a0So what is your actual name?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nGears blinked several times slowly, still watching Iceberg, and the young man knew that no answer was forthcoming.\u00a0\u00a0He changed tactics, hoping to probe for more information, the exercise taking his mind off the pulsing pain in his side.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, so...Gears, honestly, are you a robot?\u00a0\u00a0Or like...a Vulcan or something?\u00a0\u00a0You have to admit you're not really...ah...normal.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDr. Gears laid back, resting his hands on his chest.\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg was expecting silence, or his methodical, mechanical \u201cI am not a robot.\u201d reply that really did nothing to help.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, Gears drew in a breath slowly, and explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy mental peculiarities are somewhat sedate when compared to the various emergent coping mechanisms developed by other staff members. However, I can understand how mine are particularly noticeable.\u00a0\u00a0No, I am not a 'robot' or any other form of altered human, or non-human.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He paused, blinking several times, before continuing. \u201cI simply...adapted too well.\u201d\n\n\n\nIceberg watched the older man reclining in the hospital bed, confused.\u00a0\u00a0He could almost swear that Gears seemed...conflicted, or even depressed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was about to ask, when Dr. Gears started up again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am not an emotionless robot.\u00a0\u00a0I feel.\u00a0\u00a0I feel pain and sadness at the loss of a friend.\u00a0\u00a0I feel joy when achieving a positive goal, and regret when falling short.\u00a0\u00a0I feel fear, even horror, when faced with things capable of great harm, or worse.\u00a0\u00a0It is not that I can not feel.\u00a0\u00a0It is that I can not respond to it.\u00a0\u00a0Much like the feeling you have when on powerful narcotic pain killers, I am aware of my feelings, and what I am supposed to do with them, but they feel distant...disconnected.\u00a0\u00a0Like seeing someone crying, and feeling a slight empathy for their plight, but not being moved to tears yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\nIceberg sat, slightly stunned.\u00a0\u00a0His damned imagination ran off almost instantly, trying to conceive of going through everything he had already been pushed through...but this time, unable to react.\u00a0\u00a0Feeling all the pain, and joy, and fear, but being locked away with it, like a lunatic in a rubber room.\u00a0\u00a0Observed, logged, then forgotten.\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg shuddered, unable to look directly at Gears for a time.\u00a0\u00a0When he finally looked back, Gears was still staring, and Iceberg had to repress another involuntary shudder.\u00a0\u00a0He was about to ask another question when a nurse came in and carted him off for some blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0He was also informed that an oversight committee would be looking in to his explosive research at the end of the month.\u00a0\u00a0By the time he made it back, Dr. Gears was already asleep.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe next day Iceberg woke up late, and to his great joy was able to move with a minimum of blinding pain.\u00a0\u00a0The bed next to him was empty, and Iceberg looked at it thoughtfully.\u00a0\u00a0Since being recruited by The Foundation (fresh from college, no less), he'd been paired up with Dr. Gears almost constantly.\u00a0\u00a0He'd been very scared at first.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the new recruits reacted with varying degrees of fear, awe, and pity when he told them his new assignment, which did nothing for his already limited confidence.\u00a0\u00a0What's more, it took months to realize that Gears didn't actually hate him, that it was just his default setting of total indifference.\u00a0\u00a0Even worse, they kept getting assigned to the worst jobs...he still shivered to think about his first run-in with an SCP-882 breach.\n\n\n\nStill, after all this time, he knew next to nothing about Dr. Gears.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the other staff were pretty vocal about who they used to be, and some even were allowed a semi-normal life outside the site.\u00a0\u00a0Gears, however, was a black box.\u00a0\u00a0No idle conversation of the past, no hidden tokens or photos in the desk (he'd checked), no...anything, really.\u00a0\u00a0Never leaves the site except for Foundation business, never takes any time off, never engages in any non-work activity unless forced to.\u00a0\u00a0What was even stranger was that NOBODY knew anything about him.\u00a0\u00a0Even the classic busybodies around the site had no real clue who he was, and the database became a large, password-encrusted tower of doom when asked about Dr. Gears.\n\n\n\nThe sharp click of the door brought Iceberg back to reality quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Gears hobbled slightly as he worked his way to the bed, laying down and adjusting a bandage at his side. He spoke to the ceiling, not a gesture or look for the man he was addressing. \u201cI am being released early.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to remain here for another day, but I expect you to be ready to resume your duties as soon as you are released.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIceberg sighed, shaking his head and looking away.\u00a0\u00a0Silence drew out for long moments before Iceberg turned, looked pointedly at Gears, and said \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u00a0\u00a0I mean...what the fuck, man?\u00a0\u00a0You're goddamn Spock but without those little lapses of human feeling...did they experiment on you, did you have a breakdown, what the hell?\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Gears stared at him, Iceberg became acutely aware of the fact that what he had just said may amount to insubordination or \u201cunauthorized security probing\u201d of a level where \u201clarge men with guns\u201d is the most comforting portion of the disciplinary measure.\u00a0\u00a0The two men stared for what felt like a long time, Iceberg almost unwilling to blink, feeling a creeping measure of fear on par with reviewing security tapes of SCP-173.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter a time, Gears blinked, slowly, and nodded.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat happened.\u00a0\u00a0I have been asked that multiple times, and I know of many more theories to this effect.\u00a0\u00a0What happened...was nothing unique.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing that is impossible to repeat, or hasn't happened to others.\u00a0\u00a0It is easy to assume that there was a single 'defining moment' in the transition to my current state, but I do not believe this to be so.\u00a0\u00a0It is... gradual.\u00a0\u00a0Like a sickness.\u00a0\u00a0After a time, you simply wake up... different.\u201d\n\n\n\nIceberg shook his head, processing this new tidbit.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOkay...so you just... declined, I guess?\u00a0\u00a0Jesus... I mean... how the hell does something like that happen?\u00a0\u00a0You still haven't said what actually happened, what started this...\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe trailed off as Gears turned to stare at the younger man again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre you loyal to The Foundation, Doctor Iceberg?\u00a0\u00a0I assume you will reply in the positive, but think before you respond.\u00a0\u00a0I am loyal, but not because of a sense of duty or empowerment.\u00a0\u00a0I believe, fully, in the work being done here.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that, without The Foundation, humanity as we know it would crumble in a very short time.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that we, the few with the resources and means to do so, have the direct obligation to insulate others from all that we are containing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe door to the room opened with a small, poorly-oiled and annoying squeal that went totally unnoticed by Iceberg.\u00a0\u00a0Even as a young-ish doctor entered and started reading off discharge information in the general direction of Dr. Gears, Iceberg still heard little.\u00a0\u00a0Unsettling ideas were bumping around, unpleasant recollections of tests ordered and observed... of instances where the \u201cgreater good\u201d overwhelmed normal human decency.\u00a0\u00a0Moments where he knew, for a fact, that he should be repulsed... or frightened... or at least unsettled, but felt only mild interest, at best.\u00a0\u00a0He snapped back from the increasingly stormy seas of his mind when Gears started to leave the hospital bed, aided by an arm from the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c...why are you telling me this?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\nDoctor Gears turned slightly and spoke to Iceberg over his shoulder, his voice carrying that odd toneless quality again.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn regards to your request in relation to our future work, you may find the literature I mentioned enlightening.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, there is an epitaph in Tasmania, Australia that may prove useful as a motto or guide stone.\u00a0\u00a0I will expect you to report in for new assignments as soon as you are discharged.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The young-ish medical doctor looked between the two others, slightly confused and wary, but continued to help Gears from the room.\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg was left alone in seconds, both unsettled and deeply confused.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until days later that Iceberg got the chance to try and investigate the rather cryptic message.\u00a0\u00a0Gears had mentioned nothing more about anything he had said in the hospital, and Iceberg had found himself deluged with paperwork and solo testing.\u00a0\u00a0He had barely spoken to or seen anyone for nearly two days, and finally decided a little investigation might break up the tedium.\u00a0\u00a0It took only a little prodding to find what he was looking for, but it took more time to process:\n\n\n\n\"As you are now, so once was I\n\nAs I am now, soon you shall be -\n\nPrepare yourself to follow me.\"\n\n\n\nIceberg sat alone in the deepest bowels of the underground site, surrounded by mounds of neatly typed records of horrors and atrocities, and tried very hard not to feel cold.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "bittersweet", "doctor-gears", "doctor-iceberg", "featured", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Epitaph - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/epitaph", "year": 2010}, "euclidean-thinking": {"created_at": "2010-02-14T19:08:00", "creator": "MisterFlames", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "MisterFlames", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/misterflames", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-14T19:08:00"}, {"author": "MisterFlames", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/misterflames", "comment": "slight edit to remove redundancy.", "date": "2010-02-14T19:22:00"}, {"author": "MisterFlames", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/misterflames", "comment": "Put in Rating module.", "date": "2010-02-14T19:24:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-20T02:47:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Occasionally, he'd get scattered radio messages from Sites, MTFs, and some stranded Agents, but they never broadcasted for very long. Of all the Sites he knew of, Williams could only count the remaining ones on one or two hands. The rest had either fallen in the initial chaos, or initiated nuclear failsafe. A macabre game surviving personnel played was to ask each other what they were doing on S-Day, the day everything went to Hell.</p>\n<p>Williams himself was on assignment in South America, when he noticed the rain forest around him slowly turning into clockwork. It was at that moment he bugged out. He never did find out what was the exact cause, but there were rumors floating about that a SCP-217 infected crewman on the International Space Station caused a catastrophic accident, seeding the entire lower atmosphere with clockwork \"spores\". After hearing SCP-217 had went global, and at least a dozen sites were compromised, Williams knew it was time to execute his Exit Strategy. His first priority was getting in contact with Richards.</p>\n<p>Richards was in fact on Keter duty, overseeing SCP-231, no less. Containment was already blown to hell, so the priority was getting the hell out. However, Richards did note that before leaving, she made sure to leave her sidearm in 231-7's containment cell. Williams didn't know the details of what happened afterwards, but from what he heard from the Sites that still had access to surveillance satellites, there was a massive \"dead zone\" gobbling up Europe and slowly making its way across the Atlantic. Richards then managed to hop a plane to North America, but the closest she could get was a Canadian Air Force Base in Nova Scotia.</p>\n<p>Either way, they had to get to their destination on foot. A rather dangerous proposition, as all sorts of terrible things were loose, and not just SCPs. Both the Church of the Broken God and the Global Occult Coalition were out in full force. GOC Mobile Execution Teams were basically destroying everything that moved. If they didn't have a dim view of the Foundation before, they certainly did so now, since they considered the Foundation at fault for not destroying the SCPs when it had the chance. The Church was meanwhile capitalizing on a wave of religious doomsday fervor, gobbling up more and more followers every day. Last Williams heard, SCP-835 had grown to such ridiculous proportions that the oceans were literally unlivable, and that it had overtaken SCP-882's containment facility. The Church was busy trying to reach the machine by throwing wave after wave of clockwork drones at the biological monstrosity.</p>\n<p>As for the other factions, well, most governments collapsed several months into the crisis, leaving a vacuum for others to grab power. Marshall, Carter, &amp; Dark set up a stronghold in England called Avalon, which rather fit their pretentious nature. Williams secretly hoped whatever Eldritch horror born from 231-7 took time to swing north and show those snooty bastards a good time. The Serpent's Hand and Chaos Insurgency were also out in full force, often directly clashing with the Church and GOC for control of what was left. Like the Church, the Horizon Initiative was also riding a wave of religious doomsday fervor. The Manna Charitable Foundation was trying to set up refugee zones, with varying levels of success. Of the Iranians, Williams had no idea whatsoever. The Middle East was one of the first areas to be reduced to a nuclear wasteland in the global panic.</p>\n<p>Quickly focusing on matters at hand, Williams took a moment to get his bearings. If he was right, he was only several miles from his objective. So far, sticking to back roads and the wilderness had hampered his progress, but it was necessary to avoid unwanted attention. The GOC's METs essentially controlled the roads, and Williams couldn't afford to have other refugees or survivors tagging along with him. They'd just be extra baggage.</p>\n<p>\"This is Site-17, going off the air.\" Williams' radio squawked. It was essentially Foundation-speak for nuclear failsafe. That left the remaining known operational Sites down to four or five.</p>\n<p>\"One less reason to stay, I guess.\" Williams muttered to himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, before he could go any farther, Williams noticed something terribly wrong. He saw SCP-615 laying on the tracks. Sure, it could have been just any random pile of sticks and logs, but he could tell. Keeping his distance, he managed to catch sight of a MET of about five men coming the opposite way, flamethrowers in hand. They were obviously on the hunt, torching every pile of wood they could find. When they finally did hit 615, the creature quickly shot off into the forest. Spoon let the MET chase 615. There was only one SCP on his mind now, and any fight he could avoid the better. He still had bad memories of his encounter with SCP-173 in Arizona. Spending two days and three nights in a cargo container while hearing 173 repeatedly banging on the walls were some of the worst in his life.</p>\n<p>Finally, he reached vestiges of civilization. It wasn't much, just a railroad junction with a small residential district and some stores, but he was on the right track. Keeping an eye out for any unnatural presences, Williams made a dash over the crossing, painfully aware of how exposed he was. Checking his map again, he found that he was only a few blocks from his destination. Encouraged, Williams continued deeper into the town, and felt his heart sink slightly. There was what looked like a military checkpoint just up the road, directly between him and the Exit. Fortunately, the men manning the checkpoint didn't look like they were from any GOI, so Williams had hopes that he could bluff his way past. Approaching closer, he could see that the checkpoint was manned by a pair of young, incredibly scared National Guards. He didn't think any of those poor saps were still alive.</p>\n<p>\"State your business!\" One of them yelled, aiming his M16 rifle right at Williams' face. Even though the kid was wearing full NBC gear, he couldn't hide the fear in his body language.</p>\n<p>\"Whoa, calm down, son.\" Williams said diplomatically. \"I'm not here to fight.\"</p>\n<p>The other Guardsman breathed a sigh of relief through his gas mask. \"Oh thank god, are you here to help with the purge?\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh, yeah.\" Williams nodded, going with the flow. \"I'm Special Forces.\"</p>\n<p>\"Great!\" The second Guardsman stood aside, pulling open the makeshift barricade to allow Williams through. \"It hit two days ago. The GOC is helping us clean it out. You should go to them if you want to help out.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll keep that in mind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah, remember, if you don't have an official sanction, we can't let you back out!\" The first Guardsman added helpfully.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>With his objective so tantalizingly close, Williams started sprinting for his destination. However, in his rush, he got sloppy, rounded a corner, and ran straight into a GOC MET.</p>\n<p>\"Stop!\" The MET leader yelled.</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry, I'm not infected.\"</p>\n<p>\"All individuals breaking curfew are assumed to be infected.\" The MET leader inched closer to Williams, trying to get a good look at him. \"Where are you from?\"</p>\n<p>Behind the MET leader, Williams observed the rest of the MET unloading piles of clockwork corpses from a truck and dumping them onto a nearby lawn, where another MET member was collecting gasoline in preparation for a bonfire. \"I'm from the Foundation, I've been sent here to help.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hold on, I'm running this through Command.\" The MET leader turned around and starting waving to his squad.</p>\n<p>\"He's totally playing you.\" A cold, feminine voice burst through Williams' headset. \"There aren't any outgoing signals. Just stand still.\"</p>\n<p>A fraction of a second later, the MET leader's head exploded like a melon, and the rest of the body crumpled like a sack of meat. The rest of the MET was still in shock, and had no chance to react before being cut down by a combination of fire from Williams' M4 and Richard's sniper rifle.</p>\n<p>\"You're late.\" Richards said in an annoyed tone as she made her way down from her perch atop a nearby water tower. \"I've been camped up there for a week waiting for you to get your sorry ass here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, as you can see, I was held up.\" Williams scoffed. She seemed to think going cross country on foot was a cakewalk!</p>\n<p>\"Come on, we don't have much time.\" Richards motioned for Williams to follow her. \"Foundation HQ activated nuclear failsafe twenty minutes ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"So there really is nothing left.\"</p>\n<p>\"Affirmative.\"</p>\n<p>Williams and Richards were standing in a ruined mini-mart, which had literally been looted to its foundations. However, they weren't here for food or money, they were here for the restroom.</p>\n<p>\"Does it still work?\" Spoon asked.</p>\n<p>\"I've tested it. SCP-436 is still operational.\" Richards opened the restroom door, which was now hanging precariously off one hinge. \"You do realize the inherent danger and unpredictability of this SCP?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you honestly say it could be any worse than what we're in right now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Point.\"</p>\n<p>It was incredibly awkward trying to fit two people into a restroom stall designed for one, especially when both individuals were clad in full combat gear. However, they did eventually manage to make it work, and there really wasn't anybody around to see the whole fiasco anyways.</p>\n<p>\"Well, see you on the other side.\" Williams said.</p>\n<p>\"To greener pastures.\" Richards said as she grabbed the door handle and pulled it closed.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/exit-strategy\">Exit Strategy</a>\" by SpoonOfEvil, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Arrested, tried, and convicted of multiple counts of child abduction, rape, and first degree murder, 919-05 was on track for death row. The prison surgeon was standing at the end of the hall, and with him was the needle waiting to dig into his arm. The new correctional officers at his sides showed no mercy for the convict. They were tall, large men with no-nonsense attitudes, nothing like the officers in the other hall. In fact, their uniforms looked different as well. Suddenly, the hall disappeared from in front of him, and 919-05 was plunged into darkness.\n<hr/>\n<p>He was caught literally red-handed, having just disposed of another victim in the woods near her home. At his trial, he expressed gratitude to the families of the victims for providing him with the children that fueled his perverse needs. There were no witnesses registered for his execution. His only remaining family was a father who wanted nothing to do with the sick man that his son had become; and the families of his victims didn\u2019t want to see another moment of the monster who took away their children so many years ago. The media followed his trial closely; covering 919-05\u2019s story up to a week after his execution was carried out.</p>\n<p>Except D-Class subject 919-05 wasn\u2019t executed. Not yet. The Foundation had him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 and after careful review of the specific facts of the subject, the nature of the experiment, and the nature of SCP-919, permission for Experiment 919-23 is granted for Dr. Temke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you gentlemen. I believe that all the necessary requirements have now been met, so I won\u2019t waste any more of your valuable time\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more thing, Doctor\u2026 we know about your niece. We\u2019ve known for a few weeks now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The pallor on Dr. Temke\u2019s face increased significantly. They\u2019ve already granted their permission, why would they go back on it now? This experiment could help so many tormented families\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d was all he managed to squeak out.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a warning. Follow the experiment protocols exactly. Any deviation will not be tolerated.\u201d</p>\n<p>The relief washed over him like a river. \u201cOf course. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke left the boardroom, the sweat fogging his glasses, and his hands shaking.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>919-05 was right there in front of him. An IV drip provided the necessary paralytic to keep him from moving too much, but he could still speak. And boy did he speak. He cried, he screamed, he begged, he threatened to call his lawyer. Not surprisingly, after that last request was denied, he started to calm down a bit and tried to assess his surroundings. There wasn\u2019t much to see. He was strapped to a wheelchair, and could barely move his arms and legs. His head kept flopping side to side as he surveyed his new prison. It was as if his neck muscles were just too tired to hold up his head. There was no light except for a lone bulb directly above his head, making him sweat and squint. The stinging sweat dripped right into his eyes and blurred his vision. From what he could see, there was a large black curtain in front of him. He couldn\u2019t see what it was covering, but it was tall. To the right and slightly behind the curtain was a chair. It was one of those fancy ones with upholstered arms and made of leather. Far behind both of those were two guards, dressed just like the men who were taking him to the chamber at the end of the hall. That was three days ago.</p>\n<p>A door opens out of view of 919-05, and a tall man in a lab coat walks in and sits in the chair next to the curtain. The man looks through several pieces of paper on a clipboard, and then locks his gaze onto 919-05. His eyes stare intently at 919-05, seeming to look beyond the eyes at the pathetic little man paralyzed in the wheelchair.</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, 919-05 speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want my lawyer,\u201d he says with a tremble. \u201cI want my lawyer right now, and I won\u2019t talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The doctor adjusts his glasses and looks at his watch. He takes a pen out of his pocket and says, \u201cYou were convicted of killing almost a dozen children over the last two years. Where are their bodies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d says 919-05. \u201cI want my lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease answer the question.\u201d Dr. Temke wipes his forehead with a handkerchief, gripping his pen tightly with the other hand. \u201cWhere are the children hidden? All of them. Did you bury them?\"</p>\n<p>\"I want my lawyer\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Burn them?\"</p>\n<p>\"My lawyer. I want my lawyer now\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Where are they?! Where is Angie? WHERE IS MY NIECE?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I want my lawyer. Who the hell are you?! I WANT TO SEE MY FUCKING LAWYER! I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW!\u201d 919-05 screams, the anger and fear easily visible in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lawyer. You\u2026you were executed three days ago, and dead men don\u2019t get lawyers.\u201d Dr. Temke stands up and takes a step to the side of the black curtain.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you once more, where are the kids' bodies? They deserve proper burials.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to see my lawyer,\u201d is all 919-05 mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you something worse.\u201d At this Dr. Temke pulls down on the curtain, showing a large ornate mirror, reflecting back to 919-05 just his own image.</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke takes a step away, reaching into his lab coat. He pulls out a gun and points it directly at 919-05's stomach, his finger twitching with anticipation. The fear in 919-05's eyes crescendos, and he stares directly at the gun. For the first time, he doesn\u2019t say anything and just breathes in heavily, possibly wondering why he hasn\u2019t been shot yet. Seconds feels like hours, but after a short while the silence is broken. Not by 919-05. Not by the Doctor. Not even by the imposing guards in the corners. The sound comes from right in front of 919-05. From the mirror.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease\u2026don\u2019t go\u2026please stay\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>919-05's jaw drops, but his surprise is interrupted as an explosion shatters the silence, followed by a pain in his stomach that feels like he just swallowed a piece of red-hot coal. He manages to look up and see the smoke curling up from the barrel of the gun. The pain is intense, and 919-05 starts screaming. The IV drip is barely keeping him from moving.</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke suddenly changes track. He throws the gun on the floor and turns to look at the mirror.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease\u2026keep him here. Don\u2019t take him away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d says the Doctor. \u201cTell me, can you move? Can you shake your feet for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t be mad. Please don\u2019t take him away. I can try again. Give me a minute and I can try moving them again. Don\u2019t take him away. Please\u2026\u201d the reflection pleads.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t. It\u2019s okay, just answer the questions, okay? Are you shot? Look at your stomach. Have you been shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay, I haven\u2019t been shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke takes out a tape recorder and turns away, \u201c919-05A seems to suffer the same disadvantages as 919-05 prior to losing synchronicity. Any physical damage done to 919-05 after losing synchronicity does not seem to be reflected in 919-05A. Sweat from the light and interrogation is still visible on\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>919-05 lets out a low moan, breaking the Doctor\u2019s concentration. The Doctor stares at him, and then quickly turns his gaze back to the reflection.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026is still visible on 919-05A's forehead. All physical characteristics are identical prior to the gunshot made approximately 15 seconds after exposure.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses to clear his throat. \"This man\u2026you\u2026you murdered and raped several children, and then hid their bodies. Where are they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t take him away. They\u2019re in an old storm shelter; 6 miles west off of mile marker 23 on Route 11. You\u2019re not going to take him there, are you?\u2026 It\u2019s near where my dad used to have a cabin when I was younger. He can still show you where\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>919-05 lets out a loud moan and tries to speak. Dr. Temke\u2019s head whips around to look at him. He bends down and picks up the gun, pointing it right at 919-05\u2019s skull. 919-05 looks up at the man in the lab coat, and at the gun in his hand. His vision is blurred and his mind is fuzzy, but he knows this is something\u2026different. Something horrifying.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026Who are you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke pulls the trigger, terminating 919-05 immediately. He gasps at how easy it was, and how immediately 919-05 just slumps down. A few seconds pass. He looks up at the camera that was stationed behind 919-05.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell? What does the father say? Is it there?\u201d</p>\n<p>A few more seconds pass. Static, and then a voice fill the room, \u201cYeah\u2026he says he hasn\u2019t been there in almost a decade, but it\u2019s not far from one of our stationed agents. We\u2019re sending him over now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease\u2026keep him here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke looks up and sees 919-05A still staring intently at the body of the terminated D-Class.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight\u2026we\u2019ve still got some questions for you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>An hour later, Dr. Temke puts down his pen. He looks across the room at the body of the man who took away his only niece\u2019s life. The man was given an extra three days to live, and his contribution to this experiment greatly improved the understanding of the nature of SCP-919. That thought is secondary. The only thing he truly feels is the relief at getting to pull the trigger. He knows he will have to submit himself to psychiatric evaluation after this. That and a mandatory 2-week vacation were prerequisites of the experiment he agreed to.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Dr. Temke? We\u2019ve got some news.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke sits upright and stares intently at the camera. 919-05A does the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026we found the bodies. We found all eleven of them. Right where 919-05A said they were. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee! I told you I could help! Please leave him here; I can\u2019t do anything else to anyone. I can just sit here, now.\u201d 919-05A hasn\u2019t changed during the entire ordeal. He hasn\u2019t said anything new but the truth. He hasn\u2019t changed his demeanor or attitude. He\u2019s still the same subject he was when he was first brought into existence.</p>\n<p>There is nothing new to learn here.</p>\n<p>Dr. Temke stands up and walks back to the door he came in through. As he leaves, he turns to one of the guards.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet someone down here to clean up. I need the body sent to Autopsy, and SCP-919 returned to the containment cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>At this, 919-05A starts screaming and thrashing in his bonds. \u201cPLEASE! OHGODOHGODOHGOD\u2026PLEASE NO! NO! YOU PROMISED! DON\u2019T TAKE HIM AWAY! OH GOD NO NO NO!\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard moves towards the mirror and starts picking up the black curtain from the floor. Dr. Temke ignores the pleas of the scared reflection and walks out of the door, letting it slowly shut behind him.</p>\n<p>He can hear 919-05A screaming all the way down the hall.</p>\n<p>As he turns the corner, the screaming abruptly stops.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/experiment-919-23\">Experiment 919-23</a>\" by candidkiss, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\nD-Class subject 919-05 was a very, very bad man.\u00a0\u00a0Arrested, tried, and convicted of multiple counts of child abduction, rape, and first degree murder, 919-05 was on track for death row.\u00a0\u00a0The prison surgeon was standing at the end of the hall, and with him was the needle waiting to dig into his arm.\u00a0\u00a0The new correctional officers at his sides showed no mercy for the convict.\u00a0\u00a0They were tall, large men with no-nonsense attitudes, nothing like the officers in the other hall.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, their uniforms looked different as well.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, the hall disappeared from in front of him, and 919-05 was plunged into darkness.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHe was caught literally red-handed, having just disposed of another victim in the woods near her home.\u00a0\u00a0At his trial, he expressed gratitude to the families of the victims for providing him with the children that fueled his perverse needs.\u00a0\u00a0There were no witnesses registered for his execution.\u00a0\u00a0His only remaining family was a father who wanted nothing to do with the sick man that his son had become; and the families of his victims didn\u2019t want to see another moment of the monster who took away their children so many years ago.\u00a0\u00a0The media followed his trial closely; covering 919-05\u2019s story up to a week after his execution was carried out.\n\n\n\nExcept D-Class subject 919-05 wasn\u2019t executed.\u00a0\u00a0Not yet.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation had him.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 and after careful review of the specific facts of the subject, the nature of the experiment, and the nature of SCP-919, permission for Experiment 919-23 is granted for Dr. Temke.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you gentlemen.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that all the necessary requirements have now been met, so I won\u2019t waste any more of your valuable time...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne more thing, Doctor\u2026 we know about your niece.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve known for a few weeks now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pallor on Dr. Temke\u2019s face increased significantly.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019ve already granted their permission, why would they go back on it now?\u00a0\u00a0This experiment could help so many tormented families\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d was all he managed to squeak out.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust a warning.\u00a0\u00a0Follow the experiment protocols exactly.\u00a0\u00a0Any deviation will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe relief washed over him like a river.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Temke left the boardroom, the sweat fogging his glasses, and his hands shaking.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n919-05 was right there in front of him.\u00a0\u00a0An IV drip provided the necessary paralytic to keep him from moving too much, but he could still speak.\u00a0\u00a0And boy did he speak.\u00a0\u00a0He cried, he screamed, he begged, he threatened to call his lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0Not surprisingly, after that last request was denied, he started to calm down a bit and tried to assess his surroundings.\u00a0\u00a0There wasn\u2019t much to see.\u00a0\u00a0He was strapped to a wheelchair, and could barely move his arms and legs.\u00a0\u00a0His head kept flopping side to side as he surveyed his new prison.\u00a0\u00a0It was as if his neck muscles were just too tired to hold up his head.\u00a0\u00a0There was no light except for a lone bulb directly above his head, making him sweat and squint.\u00a0\u00a0The stinging sweat dripped right into his eyes and blurred his vision.\u00a0\u00a0From what he could see, there was a large black curtain in front of him.\u00a0\u00a0He couldn\u2019t see what it was covering, but it was tall.\u00a0\u00a0To the right and slightly behind the curtain was a chair.\u00a0\u00a0It was one of those fancy ones with upholstered arms and made of leather.\u00a0\u00a0Far behind both of those were two guards, dressed just like the men who were taking him to the chamber at the end of the hall.\u00a0\u00a0That was three days ago.\n\n\n\nA door opens out of view of 919-05, and a tall man in a lab coat walks in and sits in the chair next to the curtain.\u00a0\u00a0The man looks through several pieces of paper on a clipboard, and then locks his gaze onto 919-05.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes stare intently at 919-05, seeming to look beyond the eyes at the pathetic little man paralyzed in the wheelchair.\n\n\n\nAfter a few seconds, 919-05 speaks.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want my lawyer,\u201d he says with a tremble. \u201cI want my lawyer right now, and I won\u2019t talk to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe doctor adjusts his glasses and looks at his watch.\u00a0\u00a0He takes a pen out of his pocket and says, \u201cYou were convicted of killing almost a dozen children over the last two years.\u00a0\u00a0Where are their bodies?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d says 919-05. \u201cI want my lawyer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease answer the question.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Temke wipes his forehead with a handkerchief, gripping his pen tightly with the other hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere are the children hidden?\u00a0\u00a0All of them.\u00a0\u00a0Did you bury them?\"\n\n\n\n\"I want my lawyer...\"\n\n\n\n\"Burn them?\"\n\n\n\n\"My lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0I want my lawyer now...\"\n\n\n\n\"Where

LAWYER!\u00a0\u00a0I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0919-05 screams, the anger and fear easily visible in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2026you were executed three days ago, and dead men don\u2019t get lawyers.\u201d Dr. Temke stands up and takes a step to the side of the black curtain.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask you once more, where are the kids'

found the bodies.\u00a0\u00a0We found all eleven of them.\u00a0\u00a0Right where 919-05A said they were. \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSee!\u00a0\u00a0I told you I could help!\u00a0\u00a0Please leave him here; I can\u2019t do anything else to anyone.\u00a0\u00a0I can just sit here, now.\u201d 919-05A hasn\u2019t changed during the entire ordeal.\u00a0\u00a0He hasn\u2019t said anything new but the truth.\u00a0\u00a0He hasn\u2019t changed his demeanor or attitude.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s still the same subject he was when he was first brought into existence.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing new to learn here.\n\n\n\nDr. Temke stands up and walks back to the door he came in through.\u00a0\u00a0As he leaves, he turns to one of the guards.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet someone down here to clean up.\u00a0\u00a0I need the body sent to Autopsy, and SCP-919 returned to the containment cell.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this, 919-05A starts screaming and thrashing in his bonds.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPLEASE!\u00a0\u00a0OHGODOHGODOHGOD\u2026PLEASE NO! NO!\u00a0\u00a0YOU PROMISED!\u00a0\u00a0DON\u2019T TAKE HIM AWAY! OH GOD NO NO NO!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guard moves towards the mirror and starts picking up the black curtain from the floor.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Temke ignores the pleas of the scared reflection and walks out of the door, letting it slowly shut behind him.\n\n\n\nHe can hear 919-05A screaming all the way down the hall.\n\n\n\nAs he turns the corner, the screaming abruptly stops.\n\n[[include <a

Failure to correctly restrain the subject will lead to errors in experimentation, and a loss in both productivity and material resources.//\n\n\n\nSubject 007:\tMale Caucasian, aged 35, 6'0, 175lbs. Average health.\n\n**Experimental Status:** PARTIAL SUCCESS\n\n**Subject Status:** DECEASED\n\n**Note:** //Subject was receptive to implantation process to a point. However, there seemed to be some misalignments in the connection to certain nerve endings, as the subject constantly complained of SCP-784 not responding to his exact wishes. This was especially noticeable when the subject attempted to form SCP-784 into a complex pattern alignment, and instead exploded, causing a minor breach of security as SCP-784 began to consume all available matter.//\n\n\n\nSubject 016:\tMale Black, aged 26, 6'1, 190lbs. Relative good health.\n\n**Experimental Status:** SUCCESS\n\n**Subject Status:** DECEASED\n\n**Note:** //For further choice of test subjects, psych evaluations will be needed in their evaluation.//\n\n\n\nSubject 018:\tFemale Caucasian, aged 37, 5'6, 145lbs. Average health.\n\n**Experimental Status:** SUCCESS\n\n**Subject Status:** DECEASED\n\n**Note:** //**REPEAT:** For further choice of test subjects, psych evaluations will be needed in their evaluation.//\n\n\n\nSubject 024:\tMale Caucasian, aged 56, 5'5, 160lbs. Below average health.\n\n**Experimental Status:** SUCCESS\n\n**Subject Status:** DECEASED\n\n**Note:** //Correct nerve alignment and implantation has been discerned. However, subject was unable to cope with the added stress of SCP-784 within their body, and later died of inter-cranial pressure. Refinement is needed in the process to prevent this from happening again.//\n\n\n\nSubject 031:\tMale Caucasian, aged 43, 5'8, 180lbs. Average health.\n\n**Experimental Status:** SUCCESS\n\n**Subject Status:** ALIVE\n\n**Note:** //Process has been refined accordingly.//\n\n\n\nSubject 035:\tOlympia Zero\n\n**Experimental Status:** SUCCESS\n\n**Subject Status:** ALIVE\n\n**Note:** //Fusion with SCP-784 was observed to occur to a much greater degree than in previous subjects. This is most likely because of the unusual composition of this Olympia Zero's grey matter. Further testing will proceed on Olympia Zero.//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-784-arc", "scp-542", "olympia-project", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "olympia", "tale"], "title": "Experiment Log 784-BETA - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-784-beta", "year": 2010}, "father-of-lies": {"created_at": "2010-04-07T18:17:00", "creator": "Dr Gerald", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gerald", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gerald", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-07T18:17:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "sp", "date": "2010-04-08T17:38:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-02T17:13:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "4/5.", "date": "2010-05-06T02:03:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

As he felt his gums and skull start to sag and mush like old, rotting pumpkins, his one consolation was that, finally, he didn't feel like he was burning anymore.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "creepypasta", "tale"], "title": "Feverish - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/feverish", "year": 2010}, "fifteen-to-sixteen": {"created_at": "2010-02-15T05:55:00", "creator": "agatharights", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-15T05:55:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-15T05:58:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-20T02:47:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Joe\u2019s attention was focused elsewhere, eyes squinting against the bitterly cold wind that was whipping small, delicate flakes to and fro. It was a delicate snow that formed a haze in the distance, the light of sundown turning everything a rich shade of blue. The street was not terribly different from how it had been five years ago, when it all happened, but there were\u2026differences. Awnings had torn away from shop fronts and flapped in the wind. Windows were broken in, the stores raided.</p>\n<p>And Joe crouched on top of the semi-trailer he called home, eyes narrowed. He actually had lived fairly close to here, although he didn\u2019t think about it anymore. After all, five years ago\u2026things were very different for him. He had a job and a girlfriend, and two dogs. A nice apartment walking distance from the office. Of course, that was before it happened.</p>\n<p>It was hard to piece together what had all happened, things had truly happened so quickly. In a matter of hours, chaos broke out that took months to calm. Bombs had gone off somewhere, a dozen countries declared war, and then they were silenced when the\u2026things emerged. Joe had only seen the monsters a few times, and he counted his blessings for that. It was best to hide when they were around, no matter what they were.</p>\n<p>Joe liked to think that he had been a pretty nice guy, before all hell rose up, but it didn\u2019t matter now. He fidgeted slightly, having sworn that he saw movement far down the street through the haze of snow, but when it didn\u2019t return\u2026he was forced to relent, turning and climbing down the narrow ladder on the side of the semi-trailer. They had initially taken up residence in an abandoned home, then an abandoned shop, but in the end\u2026the massive, heavy metal box turned out to be the safest of them all.</p>\n<p>Emma waited for him at the bottom. \u201cAnything?\u201d She asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We should get inside before nightfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hurried into the semi-trailer through the small door on the side, pushing their way through several layers of hanging blankets as they shut and locked the opening, before emerging into the warm interior. Joe nodded to David, who doused the fire and shut the chimney slides, sealing the warmth in. The trailer was all but airtight, and they\u2019d wake up chilly, but it was preferable to waking up with something with too many limbs and too many mouths crawling in, attracted by the scent of a fire. Or to never waking up again, carbon monoxide filling the box.</p>\n<p>Joe lay back on one of the mattresses, sandwiched between Emma- who nestled against him, and Adam, who faced away and curled up alone. There was little room, and there were fifteen people to share it between them. Joe wrapped his arms around Emma, and glanced up. Emmet was on watch duty tonight, he knew, looking at the young man to make sure he was awake and alert before looking down.</p>\n<p>Emma\u2019s face was barely illuminated by the faintest light, Emmet\u2019s dim watch lantern cast it over the trailer, and she was asleep the moment she closed her eyes. Probably for the better, Joe thought, as the young woman had been out foraging all day, and this life of survival left for little time to stop and think, and only time to eat, sleep, and hope to eat.</p>\n<p>They had decent food stores, sure, but this winter had come in hard and faster than any before. The summers were hotter, he noted, and the winters colder these past five years, or perhaps it was some illusion caused by the lack of central heating or air conditioning. He didn\u2019t know, pulling Emma close to his chest.</p>\n<p>Four years ago, when their little group had formed in a town filled with dead, dying, and things unspeakable, she had been a portly teenager, often short of breath and easily tired, but the years had carved her into a fine young woman, although her hips were still wide and she never lost all the girth of her upper arms, or thighs. She reminded Joe of his girlfriend, who had been lost when she left town to try and find her parents.</p>\n<p>Joe suddenly thought about his girlfriend, briefly, and then held Emma tighter. On second thought, maybe their food stores were better off than he had the impression of, musing that she was a little thicker around the waist than she had been at the end of fall.</p>\n<p>Then, he was abruptly and deeply asleep. He hadn\u2019t dreamt once in the past five years, curiously enough, none of them had. He thought nothing of it.</p>\n<p>Then he was awake, silently, eyes wide and glancing about. Emmet was standing, holding the small pistol he carried warily, looking up at the roof of the trailer. Something scratched along. Joe glanced around, everybody else was awake as well, the faint sound of scrabbling hands and claws having aroused everybody\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>They stayed awake, until it passed, whatever had been there, tapping at the metal, losing interest, before falling back to sleep until morning. They didn\u2019t dare leave the trailer until the sun was up, stepping out under a clear blue sky and a world freshly covered with pure, pristine, untouched snow.</p>\n<p>Well, perhaps almost untouched.</p>\n<p>When they collected snow to heat for washwater that morning, Joe and Tina, the oldest woman in the group, a stern woman pushing forty-five, silently looked at footprints that led from the distance up on top of the trailer, where they circled about, then left, heading deeper into town. Joe pointed out the elongated toes and paw-pad like impressions. Tina pointed out the long marks in the snow where it had scratched at the metal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think it was?\u201d Emma asked, that afternoon. She had spent a lot of time, lately, Joe thought, rummaging through old drug stores and corner shops.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Footprints reminded me of my dogs, but with toes like a monkey.\u201d Joe muttered, going about the messy work of cleaning a deer, a small doe, that they had managed to get. Of course, they only cleaned their fresh kills far away from the trailer that was home.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged, and glanced up at her. She had something hidden in her pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Dan\u2019s been talking about leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He said that he just feels stir-crazy, and thinks he can walk to the next town, see if anybody\u2019s there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Emma frowned, neither of them knew anybody who left town that came back. They had seen a group of travelers, once, and observed them curiously, but they had left the second they stumbled across Joe\u2019s own footprints, hastening away. Perhaps worried about contact, and frankly, Joe\u2019s group wasn\u2019t too keen on it either. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back to the trailer. Ana wanted help mending some old clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Joe grunted and continued his work with the deer, until Emma, dissatisfied with the lack of response, turned and left. Joe watched her walk away, and paused when he saw the corner of a box sticking out of her pocket, just barely able to make out a few letters, part of a logo.</p>\n<p>FIRST RESPO</p>\n<p>He paused, then, and for the first time in a long time, truly thought, deeply, about something beyond survival and the here and now.</p>\n<p>Then he turned back to the deer, a small smile on his lips even in the bitter cold, and went back to work. He would talk with Dan tonight, and perhaps\u2026they could find a doctor in the next town. Yes, that would be good.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/fifteen-to-sixteen\">Fifteen To Sixteen</a>\" by agatharights, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Every house, every apartment I\u2019ve ever lived in has burned to the ground. Even stranger\u2014it\u2019s predictable. If I lived somewhere for six years, six years after I move out it goes up in flames. It\u2019s not exact, but it's close, usually accurate to within two or three months.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true. I\u2019m not sure when I noticed the pattern for the first time, but it's always been there. When I was just a kid, right after I was born, my family lived in an old house behind my grandmother\u2019s house. We were there until I was two, when we moved. I remember visiting my grandmother\u2019s at four, watching the smoldering embers of the little house and the curling smoke rising into the air. Old wiring from the 50\u2019s finally gave out.</p>\n<p>From the shack, we moved to a farm. We weren\u2019t well off enough to own it or anything, but we did run it for the local doctor. The farmhouse wasn\u2019t that big, and most of my childhood memories come from the cozy, family setting it engendered. Here, I remember Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays. I think of it whenever I think of \u201cback home.\u201d We lived there from when I was two until I was nine, when the doctor we worked for died. At fifteen, it burned, an old tree struck by lightning sparking off the blaze.</p>\n<p>The third house I lived in was the second to burn to the ground. We only lived there for around two years, so it happened when I was thirteen. It was an old house, a very old house. What I remember most was its shape. We called them \u201cshotgun\u201d houses, because you could fire a shotgun from one end and it would pass all the way through to the other. One room after another, all in a straight line, built as needed. It was, honestly, very old and dry. I\u2019m not surprised that the heating stove in the front room sprung a leak on the tenants after us.</p>\n<p>Other than where I\u2019m at now, the only place left is my parent\u2019s current house. When they asked me why I was moving all my stuff stored in the basement out, I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell them, so I made up some excuse about having my old books and stuff closer to college. I didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p>\n<p>When I turned nineteen, I moved out of my parent\u2019s house, and went to college. Before renting the house I live in now, I stayed in an apartment in the city. I shared it with a couple of assholes that seemed nice enough before I moved in. Everyone knows the type.

One of his roommates was playing Tupac and wildly throwing gang symbols at his desk. He could see him in the mirror. It was growing dark outside. The room smelled of a little more aftershave than necessary. His two roommates used to pester him about these Saturday nights. \u201cWhere are you going all dressed up?\u201d they\u2019d ask, and he\u2019d say, \u201cMass,\u201d and that would shut them up. He slipped his wallet into his back pocket and began down the stairs. Saturday night mass? Were they stupid?</p>\n<p>It was dreadfully cold outside of the dormitory, and Marcus flipped the collar of his overcoat up. He\u2019d seen Humphrey Bogart do it in a film. Or maybe it was Harrison Ford. He wished he had the driver here, so that he wouldn\u2019t have to walk alone down these snowy sidewalks, the wind chafing his cheeks. It was worth it, he told himself. It was this or drinking lukewarm Milwaukee\u2019s Best in a room party somewhere, music on too loud, and maybe sloppily hooking up with some blonde mannequin from the sororities. He was too classy for that.</p>\n<p>As he walked uptown, the streets quickly changed character. The streets surrounding the campus gave way to dilapidated apartment projects, a multi-colored myriad of trash and cigarette butts jutting from the snowdrifts. Marcus rounded a corner, turning onto a non-descript side-street. A single orange lamp threw an otherworldly haze over the grey concrete. The street did not draw a second glance from any passer-by. Close inspection, however, would have revealed things that ought not to have been on this inner city block. The windows in the buildings were all dark, and the walks were clear of the common stream of litter. A black Rolls-Royce was parked casually next to a hydrant, and next to it an Italian sports car. A wooden handrail extended from a basement staircase, oddly juxtaposed with the surrounding scene. He placed his left hand upon it, gingerly stepping into the darkness below.</p>\n<p>The heavy door open at the bottom of the stair opened into a dim and tiny room, where a huge Samoan man in a dark suit stood. The massive man wordlessly extended an open palm. Marcus fumbled with his wallet, pulling out the glass card. The Samoan held it in two fingers, raised it to eye level. He nodded. The man turned to the heavy industrial door behind him, opening it with a single wrenching pull. Marcus stepped through, glancing over his shoulder to say, \u201cThanks, Ralph.\u201d Ralph returned a subtle, but angry glare.</p>\n<p>Marcus was greeted with a rush of warmth and a friendly woman in a short red dress. She sported a bulky brass collar. She took his coat. A gentle wash of voices came from the floor below, along with a mixed scent of liquor, oak, and tobacco. He stepped down from the balcony, taking the spiral staircase to the ground floor confidently. Here was his place, away from the plebeians, away from their petty college-age worries. If they only knew. The club was alive tonight. The tables were bustling with poker games, and groups of well-dressed men and women were talking in groups. Strange, solitary figures nursed cocktails at the long mahogany bar, and the old grays sat in armchairs by the fire, brandishing cigars and conversing grandiloquently. An enormous black piano in the corner was softly twinkling Ellington\u2019s \u201cLittle Brown Book.\u201d There was no player. Occasionally, people would walk over and slip bills into the empty highball glass sitting on the bench.</p>\n<p>Marcus walked over to the fireplace, close to the aged men. He sat in one of the leather chairs, his socks awkwardly visible at his ankles as he lifted his legs up onto an ottoman. Leafing through a copy of the Times, he pretended to read but instead listened intently. They fascinated him, these back-of-the-room men. They were captains of industry, politicians, royalty; bespectacled and tweed, criminals all. These great leaky galleons seemed not to care about his proximity, or notice at all, and continued conversing in gruff and frank tones. Marcus looked up from the paper, making eye contact with one of the women in the red dresses.</p>\n<p>She walked over gracefully, gorgeous. Angry red splotches were visible around the edges of her collar, barely noticeable under the makeup. She must be new, Marcus thought. After a few words, the woman went to the bar, and then returned with his drink. Three fingers of scotch, two ice-cubes. It went down hard, but his father drank it. Sipping from the glass, he attempted to hide the sharp exhale that escaped from his mouth, fearing unreasonably that the old men would notice and take offense. Marcus was always concerned with how the other members saw him. He was easily the youngest there, and the others didn\u2019t tend to speak to him.</p>\n<p>A rotund and gray engine stood on the table nearby, chugging slowly and periodically giving off a bluish soporific steam. It had been a long week. Marcus began thinking about his father \u2013 his father, the senator. He felt his eyelids growing heavy, his arms slopping off the edges of the chair.</p>\n<p><em>It was his eighteenth birthday, and he had just gotten into college. He had begged his father, begged and begged. And finally, there it was, driving up the pebble driveway to the family mansion. The black, non-descript car pulled up at the front door. Marcus watched through the kitchen window, childlike with anticipation. A tall, slender man, with close-cropped hair and a pinstripe suit stepped out of the passenger seat. The senator went out and shook hands with him. He said something, laughing heartily. The man from the car did not react. They met at the door. The representative was British, humorless, and carried nothing. He had a voice like shaved ice.</em></p>\n<p><em>The senator led Marcus and the representative into his study, where they sat opposite each other, silently. Melinda brought in a tray with a water pitcher and two glasses. The glass sat untouched before the representative for the five minutes of the interview. Afterward Marcus\u2019 father came in, and they shut him out.</em></p>\n<p><em>Crouching and watching through the crack between the doors, Marcus could only hear muffled voices. His father was talking and gesticulating. The man in the suit was speaking quietly and sharply, shaking his head slightly. His father was growing louder, red in the face like he got during his campaign speeches. The man in the suit kept shaking his head. And then the senator had his checkbook out and was writing on it. The two men shook hands, and three weeks later Marcus had his glass card.</em></p>\n<p>Marcus awoke, startled. Several hours had passed. The old men had left, presumably to their respective rooms. Some of the women in the short red dresses were wiping down tables and emptying ash trays. One of them was passing between the remaining groups of members, offering a little silver tray in her right hand. The tray had several evenly placed rows of white pills on it. He took one, unquestioning, and swallowed it.<br/>\nThe floor was still populated, but quiet now. Young men and women sat on the furniture in small groups, laughing softly. Several of them were gathered around the gray engine, examining it and inhaling the blue steam. The jazz piano had been replaced by a low and electronic basso thrumming. Every once and a while, an odd noise would float up from the basement staircase in the rear of the room. Three African men in tan military uniforms were standing at the bar drinking cognac and vermouth. He watched their lips contort and shift with each syllable, and they seemed to slow. The constant flicker of the fire beside him became sluggish, too. In his ears, the intimate voices of the young and privileged around him grew deeper and deeper, until they were gross and comedic parodies. Marcus watched the pendulum on the great brown grandfather clock by the fire swing slower, its clicks decreasing in frequency. And then it stopped altogether. Soon \u2013 he did not know how long after \u2013 he could not move a muscle. He was stuck, sunken into the leather armchair. His eyes tracked his field of vision, scrutinizing the people stuck in mid-gesture; drops of liquid suspended centimeters above tongues, the feet frozen impossibly in mid-air. A great sweep of relaxation washed between the hemispheres of his brain.</p>\n<p>He snapped to, and it was as if someone had pressed fast-forward in his mind. There were gunshots. The lights were flickering, and members were running every which way, screaming. Armed men in strange black jumpsuits were flooding the balcony above. Several of the guards had upturned one of the heavy oak tables at the front of the room and were crouching behind it, trading gunfire with the men above. Marcus panicked and jumped down from his chair, crawling across the floor. Broken glass cut into his knees.<br/>\nOne of the guards hurried passed him, and Marcus clung to his calves, tripping him up awkwardly.<br/>\n\u201cGet the fuck off!\u201d the man shouted.<br/>\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d Marcus begged piteously.<br/>\n\u201cGet off. You\u2019re a gold member; don\u2019t have security privileges,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cLet go of me now or you\u2019ll get us both killed.\u201d The guard shook his leg vigorously.<br/>\n\u201cPlease help me!\u201d Marcus pleaded, a string of spittle streaming ungracefully from his mouth to the guard\u2019s pant-leg. The guard kneed him sharply in the jaw, discarding him to the carpet.</p>\n<p>It seemed like an instant later that the floor was alive with the black-suited soldiers. Gazing around, his eyes were blurry with tears. Three security guards lay in puddles of blood. It seemed like all the older members were gone. In fact, all the help were gone too; the bartenders and the women in the red dresses. The only people left on the floor were the young members and the three African men. Operatives were holding them all at gunpoint, zipping riot-cuffs onto their wrists. Marcus stumbled to his feet, lunging for the basement staircase. A rifle butt came across his skull, and his head was filled with sparks.</p>\n<p>Waking up, he had a splitting headache, and there was dried blood on his face. The room was bright white, and it made him squint. He tried to lift his hand to shade his eyes, but they were strapped to the chair he was sitting in. Across the table in front of him sat a figure in a white laboratory coat. He couldn\u2019t make out her face due to the angle of the lights.<br/>\n\u201cAwake, are you?\u201d said the figure.<br/>\n\u201cWhat\u2026what the hell?\u201d ventured Marcus.<br/>\n\u201cPlease state your name,\u201d said the figure, poising a pen over a clipboard.<br/>\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Marcus asked, terror mounting.<br/>\n\u201cPlease state your name,\u201d the figure repeated.<br/>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m an American citizen! My father is a senator! My father..!\u201d Marcus shouted, struggling aimlessly with his bonds. The figure across the table sighed and put down the pen. She made a beckoning motion with her hand, looking over Marcus\u2019 left shoulder. Marcus saw the man approach in his peripheral vision, a lone syringe borne on a bare stainless-steel medical tray. He screamed.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/fortunate-son\">Fortunate Son</a>\" by bleggs, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Every once and a while, an odd noise would float up from the basement staircase in the rear of the room. Three African men in tan military uniforms were standing at the bar drinking cognac and vermouth. He watched their lips contort and shift with each syllable, and they seemed to slow. The constant flicker of the fire beside him became sluggish, too. In his ears, the intimate voices of the young and privileged around him grew deeper and deeper, until they were gross and comedic parodies. Marcus watched the pendulum on the great brown grandfather clock by the fire swing slower, its clicks decreasing in frequency. And then it stopped altogether. Soon \u2013 he did not know how long after \u2013 he could not move a muscle. He was stuck, sunken into the leather armchair. His eyes tracked his field of vision, scrutinizing the people stuck in mid-gesture; drops of liquid suspended centimeters above tongues, the feet frozen impossibly in mid-air. A great sweep of relaxation washed between the hemispheres of his brain.\n\n\n\nHe snapped to, and it was as if someone had pressed fast-forward in his mind. There were gunshots. The lights were flickering, and members were running every which way, screaming. Armed men in strange black jumpsuits were flooding the balcony above. Several of the guards had upturned one of the heavy oak tables at the front of the room and were crouching behind it, trading gunfire with the men above. Marcus panicked and jumped down from his chair, crawling across the floor. Broken glass cut into his knees.\n\nOne of the guards hurried passed him, and Marcus clung to his calves, tripping him up awkwardly. \n\n\u201cGet the fuck off!\u201d the man shouted. \n\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d Marcus begged piteously. \n\n\u201cGet off. You\u2019re a gold member; don\u2019t have security privileges,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cLet go of me now or you\u2019ll get us both killed.\u201d The guard shook his leg vigorously.\n\n\u201cPlease help me!\u201d Marcus pleaded, a string of spittle streaming ungracefully from his mouth to the guard\u2019s pant-leg. The guard kneed him sharply in the jaw, discarding him to the carpet.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like an instant later that the floor was alive with the black-suited soldiers. Gazing around, his eyes were blurry with tears. Three security guards lay in puddles of blood. It seemed like all the older members were gone. In fact, all the help were gone too; the bartenders and the women in the red dresses. The only people left on the floor were the young members and the three African men. Operatives were holding them all at gunpoint, zipping riot-cuffs onto their wrists. Marcus stumbled to his feet, lunging for the basement staircase. A rifle butt came across his skull, and his head was filled with sparks.\n\n\n\nWaking up, he had a splitting headache, and there was dried blood on his face. The room was bright white, and it made him squint. He tried to lift his hand to shade his eyes, but they were strapped to the chair he was sitting in. Across the table in front of him sat a figure in a white laboratory coat. He couldn\u2019t make out her face due to the angle of the lights.\n\n\u201cAwake, are you?\u201d said the figure.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what the hell?\u201d ventured Marcus.\n\n\u201cPlease state your name,\u201d said the figure, poising a pen over a clipboard.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Marcus asked, terror mounting.\n\n\u201cPlease state your name,\u201d the figure repeated.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m an American citizen! My father is a senator! My father..!\u201d Marcus shouted, struggling aimlessly with his bonds. The figure across the table sighed and put down the pen. She made a beckoning motion with her hand, looking over Marcus\u2019 left shoulder. Marcus saw the man approach in his peripheral vision, a lone syringe borne on a bare stainless-steel medical tray. He screamed.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "tale"], "title": "Fortunate Son - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fortunate-son", "year": 2010}, "gfc": {"created_at": "2010-04-09T06:44:00", "creator": "Arlecchino", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-09T06:44:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-02T17:14:00"}, {"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "", "date": "2010-07-16T18:31:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "removed stupid contest module thingy", "date": "2010-10-13T04:52:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "rating module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:18:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-15T00:59:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Why? One, in case somebody accidentally says somethin' in front of a civilian, it don't tip 'em off. Two, if yer talking <em>to</em> a reality bender, they might not know all they can do, an' you don't wanna give 'em any ideas.</p>\n<p>These fuckers are dangerous. You see one, you don't engage unless you absolutely have to. If you do have to, be polite, try t'think happy thoughts, maybe you'll have a good day. Probably not. Whenever you can, let the experts deal with 'em.</p>\n<p>We don't try containin' them, most of the time. Yeah, Foundation don't usually work that way, but we like t'have a world to live in. So on this point, we usually agree with the GOC. Better they're gone.</p>\n<p>Okay, so, you're fightin' somebody who can do pretty much anything. How d'you stop 'em? Well, first off, they can't do anything they ain't thought of. Like, they can maybe all read minds. But if they ain't thought about doin' it, don't know they can, then they're not gonna try it. Remember, they're not smarter'n you. They may be able to do things different, might know things you don't, but they're not smarter.</p>\n<p>Second, they gotta concentrate. We had one asshole, he decided he was gonna know about everybody watchin' him. Fucker killed twenty of us before we just had a bunch of us rush him. Couldn't get all of 'us, y'know?</p>\n<p>Which kinds of Bixbies are worst? Depends how you mean. For my money, it's a kid Bixby. Almost always ends with a bullet. Sniper can usually take 'em out pretty easy. But actually killin' 'em? You show me a guy who just shot a three-year-old, I show you somebody with some damage upstairs. There are worse things you'll do for the Foundation, but not a lot.</p>\n<p>Now, hardest to take down? Usually, somebody around late teens, early twenties. Much younger, they don't know enough to do as much harm. Older'n that, they don't got much flexibility in their thinkin' to try anything real out there. Late teens, early twenties, they're gonna experiment. They're gonna try anything that springs t'mind. They're not gonna be slow an' careful in figurin' out what they can do. We get one o' them, we pull out th' big guns.</p>\n<p>Now, it don't always end with us killin' 'em. Sometimes, especially older ones, we can talk with 'em, a little. Convince 'em the world ain't worth it. Get 'em to move on somewhere else. A lot of 'em will even do it on their own. So far, ain't one of 'em ever come back. No one knows just why. Maybe this world really is that much of a shithole. Or maybe somethin's eatin' 'em, I don't know.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now you see what I mean when I say a giant turtle ain't no big deal, even if it is spittin' fire at us.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/grasp-on-reality\">Grasp On Reality</a>\" by DrEverettMann, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I sent 076-2 in there after a while. And every time he \u2018died\u2019, he was back again the next day, the same old Clef, looking like he had never been burnt or shot or drowned or sliced into itty bitty little bite sized pieces.</p>\n<p>So finally I went up to him. He asked casually, as if it were all a game to him, \u201cHow are you going to try and kill me today?\u201d</p>\n<p>I replied, \u201cI\u2019m not. Keep the damn hat. It\u2019s lame anyway. I got a different one today. It\u2019s better than that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef removed the hat and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Sombreros are so last season.\u201d He threw his hat at me, then walked over and took my hat, saying, \u201cJester hats are what\u2019s in, you know.

I was the guy with the hat.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now I\u2019m no one.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I went to get the hat. I begged. I pleaded. I bribed. I offered my soul to the man. And he said that the only way I was getting this nifty hat was to kill him.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I shot him in the head.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My hat reclaimed, I was happy for once. I went about my business then. I mean, I wasn\u2019t going to defame his body and carve \u2018I WAS HERE. CLEF IS A LOSER!!!\u2019 into his chest. I left him.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the next day he walked up to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that.\u201d He walked away, my hat on his head.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something snapped then. I was on a mission. I walked to his office and shot him at least eight times, emptying the magazine in my handgun. I doused his office in gasoline and threw a couple of lit matches in there. And he came back the next day, simply taking my hat off of my head. I tried everything I could think of. I filled his office with water and watched him drown. I poisoned every thing he ate or drank. I sent 076-2 in there after a while. And every time he \u2018died\u2019, he was back again the next day, the same old Clef, looking like he had never been burnt or shot or drowned or sliced into itty bitty little bite sized pieces.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So finally I went up to him. He asked casually, as if it were all a game to him, \u201cHow are you going to try and kill me today?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied, \u201cI\u2019m not. Keep the damn hat. It\u2019s lame anyway. I got a different one today. It\u2019s better than that one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clef removed the hat and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Sombreros are so last season.\u201d He threw his hat at me, then walked over and took my hat, saying, \u201cJester hats are what\u2019s in, you know. Big in France.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that time I just shot him because he had been fucking with me.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Hats - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hats", "year": 2010}, "hiding-beauty": {"created_at": "2010-07-01T02:04:00", "creator": "Arlecchino", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "NEW STORY", "date": "2010-07-01T02:04:00"}, {"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "", "date": "2010-07-01T05:17:00"}, {"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-20T21:03:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

She'd taken it outside, and her husband searched the whole house for holes and cracks and gaps it could have come in through, but found nothing. Every morning, the same routine. Eventually they'd even resorted to replacing the grates on the ventilation shafts in a fruitless attempt to keep it out. It always reappeared, stalking into rooms and scanning them with its weird red gaze, then beeping like a broken amplifier and stalking out to vanish again.</p>\n<p>They never fed it, and as far as I know it never ate.

Whatever this meeting is, it must be more important than you had thought. You're under no illusions that the Foundation considers your research to be of any particular significance, so it was hardly a surprise that you received such a sudden summons, but this level of security says that you may be getting in over your head.</p>\n<p>Inside, it's a standard teleconference-enabled meeting room - a long table with chairs along one side, facing a wall-sized display screen. You spot your name in front of the chair at the near end of the table, and quickly take a seat, docking your laptop and engaging the normal e-meeting software. While that loads, you take the opportunity to glance down the table at your fellow attendees, and have to fight an urge to run for the door. Many of the men and women (and the dog, especially in the Egg Walker) at this table are instantly recognizable to anyone in the Foundation, names that junior researchers speak only in hushed tones, for fear of summoning their owners like some sort of old-world demon. That feeling of being in over your head increases by several orders of magnitude - what do some of the top researchers in the Foundation need with a lowly geophysicist?</p>\n<p>In the table's center seat, Dr. Gears looks down the table at you, then back to the laptop in front of him. \"If everyone is here, I believe it is time we begin.\" With this, he enters a brief command, and the wall display flashes to life, showing a similar room elsewhere, with twelve seated figures, all of whose faces are being digitally obscured, and whose seats are labeled not with names but with numbers. You begin to wonder if someone spiked your coffee with some new SCP-grade hallucinogen, when O5-03 speaks up.</p>\n<p>\"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sure you're all wondering why you've been pulled off your respective projects for an emergency meeting. Since some of my colleagues here haven't yet finished reading up on the situation, I think a brief summary is in order. Doctor Gears, if you would?\"</p>\n<p>Gears nods. \"Thank you, sir. Approximately one month ago, several civilian observatories noted what appeared to be an asteroid whose orbit placed it on a trajectory that could lead to an impact with Earth in the near future. We picked up on this discovery through the usual channels, and have since confirmed that the object is a rocky asteroid that will impact Earth in nine days' time.\" With this, several folders appear on your desktop, including photos, reports, pages of calculations, and various other data. \"I took the liberty of borrowing Doctor Philbert's geophysical modeling setup,\" so <em>that's</em> why you couldn't log on yesterday, \"and if my interpretation of the results is correct, we are facing an IK-class natural disaster, with casualties estimated at approximately three billion over the next ten years. Doctor Philbert, do you concur?\"</p>\n<p>Well, now you know why they wanted you here. You quickly scan through the log you've been provided of Dr. Gears's run on GeoMod, and everything seems to check out. \"I, er\u2026 Yes sir, I concur, pending a more thorough review of the data,\" you stammer. You quickly log onto GeoMod and begin crunching numbers like there's no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\"If this is a natural object,\" interjects O5-10, \"why are we talking about it? It may be tragic, but we are busy dealing with objects and creatures far more dangerous than some rock.\"</p>\n<p>\"Given the rather unique resources at our disposal, we are particularly well-positioned to avert this disaster. In addition, the entire purpose behind the Foundation's acquisition and study of anomalous objects and entities is the protection of humanity. Failing to use our resources to at least mitigate an event of this scale would be contrary to that core purpose.\" It's impossible to read what Dr. Gears is thinking, but you could swear he just <em>lectured</em> an Overseer. Apparently the top brass really do play by different rules. It's at about this time that GeoMod returns the results of your new inquiries.</p>\n<p>\"Um\u2026 Sirs?\" you nervously butt in, and every head in the room swivels in unison to face you. \"I've been going over Doctor Gears's projections, and just checked the data against Foundation records. According to the model, if we don't do something, the geological effects of the impact have at least a 40% chance of breaching containment at Area 4.\" THAT got their attention. You don't have nearly high enough clearance to know what they actually keep in Area 4, but you know that in all likelihood any single SCP there could kill millions if released. If <em>all</em> of them got out\u2026</p>\n<p>There's a few seconds of hushed conversation at both ends of the conference, then O5-07 speaks up. \"If Doctor Philbert's calculations are correct, then we have no choice but to act against this asteroid. All that remains is to determine how. Suggestions?\"</p>\n<p>What follows could be politely described as a \"spirited debate\", and impolitely described as a \"verbal clusterfuck\". The various researchers propose ideas, only to have them rejected by others. Ask 343 to get rid of it? Already tried, he said no. Shoot it with 044? No way to boost its range or get it into orbit fast enough.</p>\n<p>The only idea everyone agrees would work is the use of the armament of the Mare Imbrium facility. Unfortunately, using a warhead powerful enough to deflect the asteroid onto a safe trajectory would also produce a flash bright enough to be seen even in daylight, with half the planet as witnesses. Given how close the object is already, and the time needed to prep the missile, there's really only time for one shot. The argument shifts to whether it's worth effectively announcing the Foundation's existence to civilians worldwide, and neither side appears much inclined to change their opinion. As the shouting match continues, an idea occurs to you, and you promptly get to work running the numbers to see if it's practical. Orbital mechanics aren't your specialty, but compared to modeling shockwaves traveling through variable-composition rock strata, some basic calculations on a ballistic trajectory are a walk in the park. Finally, you have your answer.</p>\n<p>It could work.</p>\n<p>\"We could drop it in the ocean,\" you blurt out. The senior staff relax their grip on the various weapons they were fingering, and turn to you, with expressions ranging from mild surprise to \"what did I just step in and why is it talking?\". \"A low-yield strike could deflect the asteroid enough that it'll fall in the ocean instead of hitting land, without producing a flash that could be seen from Earth without a telescope. It's not a perfect solution, given the size of the tsunami it would generate, but at least we'd maintain containment. We wouldn't even need to modify the astronomers' memories - an ocean impact is well within their margin of uncertainty, since they don't have access to our data, so they wouldn't even know anything was amiss.\"</p>\n<p>The looks of surprise fade into contemplation. \"Might work,\" says one researcher. \"Can't use the Atlantic, don't want to risk waking up 169,\" says another, leaving you to wonder what SCP-169 is and how an asteroid strike would only wake it up.</p>\n<p>\"I believe,\" says Dr. Gears, \"that taking SCP-169 into consideration, either the Indian Ocean or the northern Pacific Ocean would be the safest areas to bring down the asteroid. Doctor Johns should be able to model the tsunami well enough to give us a more precise target location. In the meantime, we should have Mare Imbrium begin preparing a missile, and send word to the Demeter and the Guardian to prepare for emergency relocation, and direct them to the safest locations they can reach by time of impact. Is this plan acceptable?\"</p>\n<p>After most of the researchers present nod their assent, O5-03 speaks up. \"We will need some time to review your recommendation, but it would be best if you began preparations as soon as possible. The relevant personnel will receive the final order to proceed or abort as soon as we have made our decision.\" With that, the display goes dark, marking the official end of the meeting. As you close the meeting software and disconnect your laptop, you realize that you may have just personally sent a tsunami towards some of the most densely-populated coastal areas in the world. Is this what dealing with Keter-level threats is like?

Yes sir, I concur, pending a more thorough review of the data,\" you stammer.\u00a0\u00a0You quickly log onto GeoMod and begin crunching numbers like there's no tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\"If this is a natural object,\" interjects O5-10, \"why are we talking about it?\u00a0\u00a0It may be tragic, but we are busy dealing with objects and creatures far more dangerous than some rock.\"\n\n\n\n\"Given the rather unique resources at our disposal, we are particularly well-positioned to avert this disaster.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the entire purpose behind the Foundation's acquisition and study of anomalous objects and entities is the protection of humanity.\u00a0\u00a0Failing to use our resources to at least mitigate an event of this scale would be contrary to that core purpose.\"\u00a0\u00a0It's impossible to read what Dr. Gears is thinking, but you could swear he just //lectured// an Overseer.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently the top brass really do play by different rules.\u00a0\u00a0It's at about this time that GeoMod returns the results of your new inquiries.\n\n\n\n\"Um... Sirs?\" you nervously butt in, and every head in the room swivels in unison to face you.\u00a0\u00a0\"I've been going over Doctor Gears's projections, and just checked the data against Foundation records.\u00a0\u00a0According to the model, if we don't do something, the geological effects of the impact have at least a 40% chance of breaching containment at Area 4.\"\u00a0\u00a0THAT got their attention.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have nearly high enough clearance to know what they actually keep in Area 4, but you know that in all likelihood any single SCP there could kill millions if released.\u00a0\u00a0If //all// of them got out...\n\n\n\nThere's a few seconds of hushed conversation at both ends of the conference, then O5-07 speaks up.\u00a0\u00a0\"If Doctor Philbert's calculations are correct, then we have no choice but to act against this asteroid.\u00a0\u00a0All that remains is to determine how.\u00a0\u00a0Suggestions?\"\n\n\n\nWhat follows could be politely described as a \"spirited debate\", and impolitely described as a \"verbal clusterfuck\".\u00a0\u00a0The various researchers propose ideas, only to have them rejected by others.\u00a0\u00a0Ask 343 to get rid of it?\u00a0\u00a0Already tried, he said no.\u00a0\u00a0Shoot it with 044?\u00a0\u00a0No way to boost its range or get it into orbit fast enough.\n\n\n\nThe only idea everyone agrees would work is the use of the armament of the Mare Imbrium facility.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, using a warhead powerful enough to deflect the asteroid onto a safe trajectory would also produce a flash bright enough to be seen even in daylight, with half the planet as witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0Given how close the object is already, and the time needed to prep the missile, there's really only time for one shot.\u00a0\u00a0The argument shifts to whether it's worth effectively announcing the Foundation's existence to civilians worldwide, and neither side appears much inclined to change their opinion.\u00a0\u00a0As the shouting match continues, an idea occurs to you, and you promptly get to work running the numbers to see if it's practical.\u00a0\u00a0Orbital mechanics aren't your specialty, but compared to modeling shockwaves traveling through variable-composition rock strata, some basic calculations on a ballistic trajectory are a walk in the park.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, you have your answer.\n\n\n\nIt could work.\n\n\n\n\"We could drop it in the ocean,\" you blurt out.\u00a0\u00a0The senior staff relax their grip on the various weapons they were fingering, and turn to you, with expressions ranging from mild surprise to \"what did I just step in and why is it talking?\".\u00a0\u00a0\"A low-yield strike could deflect the asteroid enough that it'll fall in the ocean instead of hitting land, without producing a flash that could be seen from Earth without a telescope.\u00a0\u00a0It's not a perfect solution, given the size of the tsunami it would generate, but at least we'd maintain containment.\u00a0\u00a0We wouldn't even need to modify the astronomers' memories - an ocean impact is well within their margin of uncertainty, since they don't have access to our data, so they wouldn't even know anything was amiss.\"\n\n\n\nThe looks of surprise fade into contemplation.\u00a0\u00a0\"Might work,\" says one researcher.\u00a0\u00a0\"Can't use the Atlantic, don't want to risk waking up 169,\" says another, leaving you to wonder what SCP-169 is and how an asteroid strike would only wake it up.\n\n\n\n\"I believe,\" says Dr. Gears, \"that taking SCP-169 into consideration, either the Indian Ocean or the northern Pacific Ocean would be the safest areas to bring down the asteroid.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Johns should be able to model the tsunami well enough to give us a more precise target location.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, we should have Mare Imbrium begin preparing a missile, and send word to the Demeter and the Guardian to prepare for emergency relocation, and direct them to the safest locations they can reach by time of impact.\u00a0\u00a0Is this plan acceptable?\"\n\n\n\nAfter most of the researchers present nod their assent, O5-03 speaks up.\u00a0\u00a0\"We will need some time to review your recommendation, but it would be best if you began preparations as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0The relevant personnel will receive the final order to proceed or abort as soon as we have made our decision.\"\u00a0\u00a0With that, the display goes dark, marking the official end of the meeting.\u00a0\u00a0As you close the meeting software and disconnect your laptop, you realize that you may have just personally sent a tsunami towards some of the most densely-populated coastal areas in the world.\u00a0\u00a0Is this what dealing with Keter-level threats is like?\u00a0\u00a0The senior staff must handle this kind of thing constantly - you can't even imagine the kind of emotional baggage - you are cut off mid-thought by a simian voice behind you.\n\n\n\n\"So, who wants lunch?\"\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "apocalyptic", "bureaucracy", "doctor-gears", "featured", "science-fiction", "tale"], "title": "In the Big League -

Sure, he knew that there was a group of researchers that had been working for the Hand, spanning the gamut of clearances from Level 1 to Level 4. And yes, he did know that they were planning on escaping their Sites back to\u2026 to wherever the hell the Hand held Foundation traitors. But he didn't expect them to be so stupid as to post all their files on the Internet. And yet there it was, the green eyes of SCP-173 staring at him from the screen of his laptop. At least the people responsible had been caught; they didn't bother trying to disguise where the upload was from. But by the time the leak was discovered it was too late to stop it; they'd already managed to upload five entire reports (partially censored, thank God). He closed his laptop screen, unable to take that mocking pixelated glare any longer, leaned back in his chair, and thought.</p>\n<p>In his head, he ran through the standard Information Control options, discarding all of them one by one; there was already a noticeable uptick in the amount of searches for Foundation-related keywords. Looking at the results, apparently some random paranormal community or another had found the report on 173 and decided it was interesting. He could use this. He loaded the files on some of the SCPs he was cleared to access for inspiration and got to work writing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026created in the aftermath of WWII, from the remnants of defecting\u2026.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A few of the entries were completely unedited versions of real files on SCPs; some of them were copies of false data that had been given to people suspected of being spies. Different fake SCPs for different people would let him figure out who was a traitor leaking data and who just looked guilty. He didn't want to delete the real ones, it might draw suspicion, except\u2026 he stopped. His eyes fell on three digits, and his mouse moved over the delete button. He looked at the portrait on his desk, then back. He clicked, and got back to work; he had ideas for characters, so many ideas, and they all had to be written.</p>\n<p>He worked hard into the night, his fingers dancing over the keys in an irregular rhythm, pausing for a few minutes to wait for a burst of inspiration, then tapping like raindrops on a windowpane. After a few hours, the words started swimming in front of his eyes, but he pressed on like a man possessed by a Muse until he could write no more. He closed the lid of his laptop, the last thing he saw before he closed his eyes a group portrait of sixteen people. And even when he let sleep him, his characters appeared to him in his dreams, whispering ideas and plot hooks to his subconscious.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When he woke up the next day, he found himself watching his phone walk across his desk. He grabbed it and sat up, rubbing where his cheek had been resting against the metal imprint on his laptop for the past few hours, and read the screen with red eyes. He had a meeting in\u2026 an hour. Shit. And it was in room 307 with three people. <em>Shit.</em> He knew exactly what that meant. He splashed some cold water on his face, slapped his cheeks a few times, and read over his files on the security breach.</p>\n<p>Meeting with Senior Staff was never enjoyable. They always showed up in threes; It was the smallest number that could both prevent deadlock and allow debate on both sides of an issue, and they preferred to meet together as little as possible. So when Gnosis showed up to the meeting the next day regarding Incident Mike Echo Seven Alpha, he knew roughly what to expect. Three faces, none of whom he was familiar with, stared at him without a single hint of emotion as he entered the door. There was a smell of sterility and rubbing alcohol, and his eyes watered just a little. He took a seat.</p>\n<p>\"What made you think that the best approach to the worst leak since you started working Information Control was to publicize it?\" Dr. Myers, a serious-looking scientist whose balding hair contrasted with his younger features; he couldn't have been older than 40</p>\n<p>\"Sir, it was my professional judgment that shutting down the site posted by the defectors would only draw more attention, especially given that it would require purging it from search engine caches.\"</p>\n<p>\"How does that make a difference?

He'd obviously never worked in the field; a body shape like that never could have passed the field agent regimen.</p>\n<p>\"I do not believe, sir, that anybody else could have done any better.

Surely you don't intend on maintaining them yourself.\" Hefner again.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I do, sir.\" He shifted about uncomfortably in his chair; he knew that this would be the part that would be the hardest for them to swallow. But he had to keep this story going, for his own sake. He could have sworn Myers was writing something down on a notepad just out of his vision.</p>\n<p>\"So the containment for this leak is going to cause a drain on your resources for the forseeable future?\" Gregor looked amused, a grin spreading across his slightly overweight face.</p>\n<p>\"Unfortunately, yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"So why shouldn't we just have the information scrubbed the hard way, then reassign you to Secondary duty?\" The grin spread further; he looked about ready to bite his head off.</p>\n<p>\"With all due respect, sir, part of working in Information Control is the ability to react without explicit authorization from one's superiors.

Dismissed.\" Myers stood and left, followed by the other two.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, sirs.\" He quickly rose and exited, then returned to his quarters, trying to lose himself in the crowd of researchers, agents, and Secondary personnel that always flowed through the halls of the Sites. The gravity of what he'd done was catching up to him, and he needed sleep; he was starting to twitch and have thoughts that he thought he had suppressed. So he collapsed in his bed, not bothering to change out of his work clothes, and let sleep claim him. And in his dreams, the characters he had written came back to him, taunting him with his recollections.</p>\n<p>And for the next few days, in between other assignments, he worked on the project. Writing stories of love and loss, of happiness and sadness and the entire spectrum in between, of triumph and failure. He didn't publish them all right away; no, he published them over time, trying to build up an audience for his stories. At first, his performance didn't suffer; he contained information breaches well enough, and his supervisors let it slide. But he withdrew more and more into the fantasy of his own creation. Leaks grew in frequency, went unnoticed for longer, and contained more damaging information. And when his door was unlocked from the outside and forced open, he didn't make a sound, save the soft clicking of keypresses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Final Report on Incident Mike Echo Seven Alpha.</p>\n<p>Doctor Gnosis's plan to hide the leaked documents in plain sight has worked; there have been no signs of elevated suspicion regarding the leaked Foundation documents, and further leaks can be brought under the aegis of this one as an 'alternate reality game'. It is quite fortunate that many of the leaked documents are also fake; this gives us the opportunity to detect investigation via standard query-tagging procedure.</p>\n<p>However, one aspect of the created fiction is troubling. Two weeks before the Incident, a containment breach in Site \u2588\u2588 led to the death of several Foundation personnel that were good friends with Dr. Gnosis. Many of the invented personalities seem to resemble those of the deceased, and the fictional Foundation possesses the technology to selectively erase memories; it is therefore suggested that Dr. Gnosis be removed from the Incident team as soon as is reasonably possible to avoid escapism or other mental problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addendum</strong>: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, five days after the incident, Dr. Gnosis's access to the Mike Echo Seven Alpha project was stripped, and he was forced into psychiatric leave with mandatory counseling regarding the death of his friends. Initial attempts are promising in part due to the threat of mandatory retirement, but efforts must be made in order to prevent a relapse. The password to his account, codename 'T\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588', is unknown and cannot be reset without alerting the host of the information; however, the password for the accounts of the 'characters' have been recovered. Their personas have proven to be too popular to discontinue, and therefore have been assigned to [REDACTED], with stories to be written in their spare time as necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/incident-mike-echo-seven-alpha\">Incident Mike Echo Seven Alpha</a>\" by Gnosis, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Two weeks before the Incident, a containment breach in Site \u2588\u2588 led to the death of several Foundation personnel that were good friends with Dr. Gnosis. Many of the invented personalities seem to resemble those of the deceased, and the fictional Foundation possesses the technology to selectively erase memories; it is therefore suggested that Dr. Gnosis be removed from the Incident team as soon as is reasonably possible to avoid escapism or other mental problems.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Addendum**: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, five days after the incident, Dr. Gnosis's access to the Mike Echo Seven Alpha project was stripped, and he was forced into psychiatric leave with mandatory counseling regarding the death of his friends. Initial attempts are promising in part due to the threat of mandatory retirement, but efforts must be made in order to prevent a relapse. The password to his account, codename 'T\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588', is unknown and cannot be reset without alerting the host of the information; however, the password for the accounts of the 'characters' have been recovered. Their personas have proven to be too popular to discontinue, and therefore have been assigned to [REDACTED], with stories to be written in their spare time as necessary.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "featured", "metafiction", "spy-fiction", "tale", "the-administrator"], "title": "Incident Mike Echo Seven Alpha - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/incident-mike-echo-seven-alpha", "year": 2010}, "incident-report-086-0": {"created_at": "2010-05-20T18:55:00", "creator": "GwenWinterheart", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "GwenWinterheart", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gwenwinterheart", "comment": "Proposed replacement for the 086 article.", "date": "2010-05-20T18:55:00"}, {"author": "GwenWinterheart", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gwenwinterheart", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Door.jpg\".", "date": "2010-05-20T18:56:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

clean coats echoed through the corridors from some distance away.\u00a0\u00a0Greg took a step forward, then another.\u00a0\u00a0He stretched out his arm, brushed the bare metal knob with his bare skin, and flinched.\u00a0\u00a0Reached forward again, took firm hold of the doorknob.\u00a0\u00a0Felt an involuntary tremor through his hand and up his arm to his shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0A sense of purpose seized him, he jerked the knob and wrenched open the metal door.</p>\n<p>Inside the janitor's closet, there was a mop.\u00a0\u00a0There was a bucket of soapy water.\u00a0\u00a0There was an assortment of cleaning compounds.\u00a0\u00a0There was a small spider, which skittered out of view behind some boxes.</p>\n<p>And, on the floor, there was a letter addressed to a Dr. Gregory Hollinger.\u00a0\u00a0Still sealed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He picked it up, broke the seal sloppily with a finger.</p>\n<p>He read the letter inside, then read it a second time, then carefully folded it up and ripped it into a hundred tiny pieces and threw them all back into the closet, admiring the way they fluttered and danced as they fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>He closed the closet door and left the hallway, picking his way carefully through the danger signs and yellow tape he had set up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0SCP-086 can manifest as a portal to any relatively small contained space with a single opening.\u00a0\u00a0When SCP-086 is opened, an anomalous entity will be found inside.\u00a0\u00a0It has been confirmed by X-ray scans and cameras placed inside SCP-086 that these entities do not exist until the door is open.\u00a0\u00a0The entities produced are designed to frighten the last person who touched SCP-086\u2019s opening mechanism (in host sites which lack a distinct opening mechanism the entire item will exhibit this property).</p>\n<p>SCP-086-a is a non-corporeal entity which manifests as a floating, partially transparent \u201cdark patch.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0If SCP-086's host container is destroyed or is not opened for a period of two (2) to three (3) weeks, SCP-086-a will emerge and roam aimlessly until it encounters another suitable space to inhabit.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-086-a passes through all obstacles it encounters and causes vivid hallucinations in any sentient beings it passes through.</p>\n<p>SCP-086 was discovered in an anonymously delivered, unmarked cardboard box mailed to Researcher H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks later, SCP-086-a manifested and entered a janitorial closet in Site-19, which was later designated SCP-086.</p>\n<p>If SCP-086 is closed with an entity it has produced still inside, the entity will vanish and a new one will appear when the door is open.\u00a0\u00a0It does not have this effect with any other beings or objects.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-086 will not produce an entity or eliminate an existing one if the door is closed with a sentient being inside.\u00a0\u00a0However, SCP-086-a will migrate if a sentient being remains in SCP-086 for more than three (3) hours.\u00a0\u00a0Sentient entities produced by SCP-086 show extreme fear of SCP-086 and are highly averse to being returned to the closet.</p>\n<p>Thus far, all biological entities produced by SCP-086 have suffered from a major biological flaw, resulting in the entities' death within twenty-four (24) hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, Director, do you know what\u2019s going on with Greg?\u00a0\u00a0He hasn\u2019t reported in for over a

SCP-086 must be opened at least once weekly to prevent a migration event.\n\n> \n\n> During use, a variety of heavy weaponry and containment equipment is kept active and trained on SCP-086\u2019s entrance, in order to incapacitate any emergent threat.\u00a0\u00a0The physical task of opening SCP-086 should be given to gloved D-Class personnel after the researcher has touched SCP-086\u2019s handle with a bare hand.\u00a0\u00a0All testing of SCP-086 should be personally supervised by Researcher H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> Entities which emerge from SCP-086 and are not immediately terminated or returned should be classified SCP-086-x.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nGreg Hollinger stood on one side of a sterile hallway, staring nervously at a nondescript white door.\u00a0\u00a0The footsteps of determined men and women in clean coats echoed through the corridors from some distance away.\u00a0\u00a0Greg took a step forward, then another.\u00a0\u00a0He stretched out his arm, brushed the bare metal knob with his bare skin, and flinched.\u00a0\u00a0Reached forward again, took firm hold of the doorknob.\u00a0\u00a0Felt an involuntary tremor through his hand and up his arm to his shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0A sense of purpose seized him, he jerked the knob and wrenched open the metal door.\n\n\n\nInside the janitor's closet, there was a mop.\u00a0\u00a0There was a bucket of soapy water.\u00a0\u00a0There was an assortment of cleaning compounds.\u00a0\u00a0There was a small spider, which skittered out of view behind some boxes.\n\n\n\nAnd, on the floor, there was a letter addressed to a Dr. Gregory Hollinger.\u00a0\u00a0Still sealed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He picked it up, broke the seal sloppily with a finger.\n\n\n\nHe read the letter inside, then read it a second time, then carefully folded it up and ripped it into a hundred tiny pieces and threw them all back into the closet, admiring the way they fluttered and danced as they fell to the ground.\n\n\n\nHe closed the closet door and left the hallway, picking his way carefully through the danger signs and yellow tape he had set up.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n> **Description:**\u00a0\u00a0SCP-086 can manifest as a portal to any relatively small contained space with a single opening.\u00a0\u00a0When SCP-086 is opened, an anomalous entity will be found inside.\u00a0\u00a0It has been confirmed by X-ray scans and cameras placed inside SCP-086 that these entities do not exist until the door is open.\u00a0\u00a0The entities produced are designed to frighten the last person who touched SCP-086\u2019s opening mechanism (in host sites which lack a distinct opening mechanism the entire item will exhibit this property).\n\n> \n\n> SCP-086-a is a non-corporeal entity which manifests as a floating, partially transparent \u201cdark patch.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0If SCP-086's host container is destroyed or is not opened for a period of two (2) to three (3) weeks, SCP-086-a will emerge and roam aimlessly until it encounters another suitable space to inhabit.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-086-a passes through all obstacles it encounters and causes vivid hallucinations in any sentient beings it passes through.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-086 was discovered in an anonymously delivered, unmarked cardboard box mailed to Researcher H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks later, SCP-086-a manifested and entered a janitorial closet in Site-19, which was later designated SCP-086. \n\n> \n\n> If SCP-086 is closed with an entity it has produced still inside, the entity will vanish and a new one will appear when the door is open.\u00a0\u00a0It does not have this effect with any other beings or objects.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-086 will not produce an entity or eliminate an existing one if the door is closed with a sentient being inside.\u00a0\u00a0However, SCP-086-a will migrate if a sentient being remains in SCP-086 for more than three (3) hours.\u00a0\u00a0Sentient entities produced by SCP-086 show extreme fear of SCP-086 and are highly averse to being returned to the closet.\n\n> \n\n> Thus far, all biological entities produced by SCP-086 have suffered from a major biological flaw, resulting in the entities' death within twenty-four (24) hours.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Director, do you know what\u2019s going on with Greg?\u00a0\u00a0He hasn\u2019t reported in for over a week.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGreg?\u00a0\u00a0Oh, Dr. Gregory Hollinger?\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s been transferred off your project.\u00a0\u00a0Discovered some potential new SCP item.\u00a0\u00a0I believe he\u2019s been putting the paperwork together to get it classified, number 086 or something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I informed?\u00a0\u00a0You can\u2019t just transfer my immediate subordinates around willy-nilly, I need replacements.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t informed?\u00a0\u00a0You were mentioned several times in the paperwork.\u00a0\u00a0I thought you were involved in the initial discovery or something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll have to talk with Greg about this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, then.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know what you find out.\u201d\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n> **Addendum 086-1:** Brief log of anomalies produced by SCP-086.\n\n> \n\n> **Subject:** Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (first encounter with SCP item)\n\n> **Entity:**\u00a0A large colony of [REDACTED], apparently spelling out the message \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0Entity proved non-viable and began to exude [REDACTED] from its pores.\u00a0\u00a0Subject showed considerable distress.\u00a0\u00a0[REDACTED] disposed of along with SCP-086's host box.\n\n> \n\n> **Subject:**\u00a0D-Class Personnel\n\n> **Entity:**\u00a0A large creature made entirely of fist-sized, bloodshot eyes on tentacles connected to a small central mass.\u00a0\u00a0Subject screamed and retreated.\u00a0\u00a0Entity moved forward for several feet in a writhing motion before collapsing under its own weight.\u00a0\u00a0Autopsy showed no organs besides the eyes and a frail musculature.\u00a0\u00a0DNA matched no known animal.\n\n> \n\n> **Subject:**\u00a0Researcher H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> **Entity:**\u00a0A small sheet of paper with a number of addresses listed in shaky handwriting.\u00a0\u00a0Subject displayed extreme stress but claimed not to recognize the addresses. Subject later volunteered to take on SCP-086\u2019s study as a full-time project.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Ink\u2019 confirmed to be dried human blood matching subject\u2019s DNA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Subject:**\u00a0D-Class personnel (wearing latex gloves)\n\n> **Entity:**\u00a0A very realistic effigy of a hanged woman, constructed of actual human skin with cotton stuffing. Subject reported confusion.\u00a0\u00a0Researcher H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 identified the woman as his wife.\n\n> \n\n> **Subject:** Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \n\n> **Entity:**\u00a0A very convincing imitation of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s current supervisor, which informed the subject he had been demoted to D-class for gross incompetence and handed him a printed notice. \u00a0Entity collapsed of organ failure one hour later.\u00a0\u00a0Autopsy showed the entity lacked a digestive system.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nAgent Lawson stood outside the hallway and glared.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is this area blocked off?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cSCP-086 has taken up residence in the janitorial closet.\u00a0\u00a0It can\u2019t be safely moved, so I\u2019ve sectioned off this hallway.\n\n\n\n\u201cEighty-six?\u00a0\u00a0Never heard of it.\u00a0\u00a0Is it Keter?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, Euclid, but not safe enough that you can just walk by.\u00a0\u00a0Just added to the list this week.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer eyes narrowed.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf there was really a new Euclid I would have heard about it in the Site news system by now.\u00a0\u00a0What is it?\u201d\n\n\n\nGreg drummed his fingers nervously on a wall.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a non-corporeal entity, um, takes up residence in enclosed spaces and generates things whenever you open the door.\u00a0\u00a0Tries to scare you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI fail to see why I can\u2019t go down the hallway.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll have to go well out of my way to go around, I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s, um, regulations.\u00a0\u00a0In the containment procedure.\u00a0\u00a0You can look it up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI will, Dr. Hollinger, and I hope for your sake that you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe walked away.\u00a0\u00a0Greg sighed in relief and returned to the door, which sat slightly ajar.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs she gone?\u201d asked a small voice.\u00a0\u00a0Greg nodded happily.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n> **Incident 086-2:**\n\n> On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, during a standard test with Researcher H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as the subject SCP-086 produced a scrap of paper with the words [REDACTED] hand-printed with large blocky letters.\u00a0\u00a0May indicate an attempt by SCP-086 to communicate.\u00a0\u00a0Further research is in order.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\u201cWould you care to explain what this document I\u2019m holding is, exactly?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s an incident report file for SCP-086.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no SCP-086.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, there is, Gregory got the approval back just the other day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u00a0\u00a0There is no SCP-086.\u00a0\u00a0No proposals for the classification of such have been submitted.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Greg said--\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI suggest you find Dr. Hollinger and send him in for a psych evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Something extremely odd is going on and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll talk to him again.\u201d\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n> **Incident 086-4:** Video log \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588

Hollinger had the security cameras blocked off for most of the \u2018tests\u2019 he ran.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the status on the closet itself?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a full

up?\u00a0\u00a0Why?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUnknown, sir.\u00a0\u00a0He seemed relatively stable up until now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo exposure to some memetic thing?\u00a0\u00a0No traumatic

hallways, feet pounding a steady rhythm, like a heart-beat or a set of drum-sticks pounding inside his head.\u00a0\u00a0Turning corners automatically, trying not to notice the walls melting behind him.\u00a0\u00a0Was he lost?\n\n\n\n\u201cThis way, Daddy!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe sun winked at him through layers and layers of heavy glass.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Exit\u2019, promised the signs above the

That bubbling nausea that fills your throat, makes you feel as if you're about to throw up every time you burp or so much as breathe out your mouth. Holding the toilet, resting my head on the cool, cool porcelain, I really question why in the hell I don't make myself throw up and just get it over with.

I feel that slick, sour spit coat my throat, my belly tightening up as I push my head over the bowl and spit. For a split second before I explode, I realize this thing has not been cleaned in a while. Then I vomit. Hard. Mucus-rich and acidic, it pours out in a hard, jetting stream from my mouth and nose, burning my nasal passages like fire. It hits so hard, it feels like it should be coming out my eyes, too.</p>\n<p>I vomit again, and again, the third time bringing up just some thin, reeking slime, and I gasp a bit, getting my breath back before the next wave. I pitch forward again, eyes tearing as they squeeze shut, and I feel another hot jet of filth pour out. Opening my eyes, it seems\u2026different. A tarry black, and there are\u2026things bobbing in it. I don't have time to look too hard, before two more hard retches double me over the bowl. These are more pinkish, and I can definitely see some kind of meat in these. Hamburger, maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>More vomit, more oddness. I don't remember eating any kind of jelly, especially cherry. It's starting to hurt, a deep spike each time. God, how much can a person throw up? When did I eat noodles that long\u2026or that big? The goo in it is getting thicker too, and pink\u2026starting to feel at least a little better. Ugh\u2026when did I eat a balloon? My belly is feeling better now, really light. Jesus\u2026whatever that was is floating still\u2026almost looks like it's pulsing, or beating\u2026going to have to move to the sink, toilet's almost full. Feeling better now\u2026hungry, actually.

You need a car, preferably something late-model, with a strong body. Newer cars tend to be too light and not do enough damage. Next, you need to find a candidate. It has to be a pedestrian, and it's best to pick younger people, as they have more time left, but not always. You'll have to watch them, if it's late just drive slow and pretend to be lost, but if you have to, make a second sweep by going around the block. You have to do this on a black asphalt road with a clear yellow line. You can ONLY hit a candidate that does at least one of the following,:</p>\n<p>Crosses directly across the road at a run, without looking around.<br/>\nWalks for more than eight feet on the road itself without touching the sidewalk or curb.<br/>\nStops walking or sits on the yellow line for more than three seconds.<br/>\nTrips or falls on any pothole or uneven surface in the road and bleeds because of the fall.<br/>\nDrops a personal item (key chain, phone, etc.) that shatters, with all the pieces remaining between the yellow line and the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>If a candidate does any of these, it's an indicator that they are temporally detached from their \u201ctime\u201d. If you hit and kill them with your car before they reach the next cross street, you can swap your time for theirs. If you were going to die tomorrow, but hit a valid candidate who won't die for eight years, you now have their remaining time instead of yours. It's unclear what happens to the candidate's soul, but it's probably not good.</p>\n<p>There's a group, mostly old folks, who do this all the time. The founder says he's over two hundred years old, and he looks it. The name is like White Sunrise or something similar. They had a web page for a while, but it appears to be gone now. I remember browsing the forums once, and the name George Russell Weller was being discussed. He apparently screwed up an attempt, and was being kicked out.</p>\n<p>Just be careful out there. I've noticed a lot of older folks skimming around suburbs lately, watching kids rather closely.

Just little scraps of metal, sharpened and placed in a handle, a knife wasn't all that amazing. He admitted that, yes, for the most part they were given a somewhat overlooked position in life, but placed in the hands of someone with a violent disposition, or faced with an unhappy and carnivorous creature, they could take on near mythic qualities.

Crawling and sobbing, she held the knife out, waving it like a feeler as she pawed for the stairs. He chuckled, watching. Truly an overrated tool. Even if she'd seen a target, what could she do with it really? She shrieked briefly, almost tumbling in to the hole he'd bored in to the basement with.</p>\n<p>She'd even come down the stairs with the skinny little blade, the silly thing.

She'd found the body about the same moment he'd bitten out the light bulb, quickly skittering to slam the door before she'd made it up, the sudden darkness tumbling her silly, ill-equipped head back down to the floor. He watched, hooked in to the ceiling, as she flailed about helplessly. His eyes started to glaze with anticipation, the vertical slit of a maw trembling with amusement as he slowly started to lower down, hook by hook.</p>\n<p>He'd show her the folly of such inadequate little tools such as knives. He fell beside her, the lower eyepads recording her shock. He'd show her how much better a natural tool is.

Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.<br/>\n-Agent Carriontrooper</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Due to the increasing number of items discovered by the Foundation, this list is no longer open to new entries. A <a href=\"/log-of-extranormal-events-vol-ii\">second volume</a> of this log has been made available, and currently remains open to new additions.</p>\n<p>Lists of <a href=\"/log-of-anomalous-items\">Anomalous Items</a> and <a href=\"/log-of-unexplained-locations\">Unexplained Locations</a> have also been compiled.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Please add new entries to the bottom of the list, not the middle or the top.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A sperm whale estimated to be 2\u00a0km in length was observed breaching the ocean's surface, causing three nearby boats to capsize upon re-entry.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Foundation removed any details about the anomalous nature of the creature from local news sources. Witnesses on ferries and close enough beaches administered Class A amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A glowing humanoid figure manifested on a subway platform and was seen by several eyewitnesses and captured on the station's surveillance system. The humanoid approached the edge of the tracks while making vague hand gestures and promptly vanished.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Barcelona, Spain.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> A team of disguised agents and a portable holographic projection unit were brought to the location. The team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Time skips between 2.5 and 26 hours took place in Concord, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in Carson City, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Concord, North Carolina, USA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by a local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The entire population of Holyhead, Wales was found comatose in a field just outside of town. All individuals were unharmed, but possessed slight burns on their clothing. All individuals woke up 14 hours later with no recollection of the event.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Holyhead, Wales.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Population dosed with Class-B amnestics. A road accident involving a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged as a cover story. An emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population were given \u00a3150 per head as compensation. Since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behavior in the population.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a well-known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the \"true\" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Friendship, Oklahoma.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B amnestics. Close family members of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were questioned and given Class-A amnestics. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Several students attending \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Collegiate in Sandwich, New Hampshire, USA.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> The monitor was confiscated for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During an automobile accident, the body of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle. Because Mr. \u2588\u2588's expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Seymour, Connecticut.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics. Tissue tests indicate that Mr. \u2588\u2588 is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in a hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of \"glass breaking\" during the emesis.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Andranomadio Public Hospital, Antsirabe, Madagascar.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: \"Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!\" Backtracking reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 12/21/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A suspected associate of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. was observed entering an abandoned factory by Foundation operatives. The sound of bubbling water was heard from within the factory prior to two gunshots. Operatives found the suspect's body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found within the subject's jacket. No signs of the suspect's assailant were found.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/15/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-60.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2\u00a0km stretch of coastline at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the interior carcass revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with machinery components trapped in clear plastic.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/18/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Akaroa, New Zealand.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-108. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800\u00a0km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/11/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> North Atlantic Ocean.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Information suppressed and mass amnestic treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Every domesticated cat inside the city limits of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Norway traveled 10.9\u00a0km SE to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Sweden over period of 8 hours. Cats congregated in groupings of 13-25 in a field behind [DATA EXPUNGED] for 2 hours, then dispersed.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 25/09/2009<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Norway/Sweden border.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Cats returned of their own accord to their homes. Any footage of gathering confiscated for study. Witnesses processed, debriefed, and administered Class-B amnestic. Field searched for abnormalities, blood and urine samples taken from cats in affected areas. No anomalies found. Both \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the field will be under surveillance until 30/09/2014.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During a speech to a public committee, the mayor of Bonifay, FL began continuously chuckling at a pun made by a legislative observer for approximately 4.5 hours straight before collapsing into a nearby chair and passing out. He claims to have no memory of the event, nor did anyone else in the room during the speech. The only available evidence of its occurrence was captured entirely on camera.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Bonifay, Florida, USA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Any and all witnesses who videotaped the event, along with anyone who viewed the videotapes themselves were given Class-B amnestics, and all resulting videotapes were wiped clean. The mayor himself is under minor surveillance from select members of the Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description</strong>: At exactly 2pm, 24 instances of a semi-erotic calendar appeared in numerous Foundation sites. Inside the calendar, images of Dr. Elliot, Dr. Kiryu, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent Merlo, Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. Right, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. Marie, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Dr. Jack Bright. The Calendar displayed the name Double D-class, and despite the statements of personnel included in the calendar, shows signs of being planned and professionally made.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence</strong>: \u2588\u2588/01/14<br/>\n<strong>Location</strong>: Sites-5, 29, 82, 11, and 6<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken</strong>: Most instances were recovered by Foundation staff, several copies have been confiscated from staff since the incident.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Jack Bright was not inhabiting a female body at the time, indicating that either a prop was used or this is a mistake by the creator.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description</strong>: After Long Island citizen \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died of alcohol-damage related illness, a recliner chair in his home began ascending at speeds of exactly 3.6m/s before eventually accelerating to 16.3m/s. Attempts at stopping the ascent were futile, and the chair broke through any barriers placed in its way.

Interviews with those affected have provided a detailed, highly consistent account of the entire city being transported to the surface of a planet (believed to be Venus), protected by a dome of unknown design. (See Document E-41567-\u2588\u2588 for full account.) However, telephone records, security camera feeds and interviews with non-resident non-employees suggest that nothing unusual happened during the time period and that all those affected were present on Earth and went about their business as normal.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2011<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Pompano Beach, Florida, USA.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Affected individuals provided with amnestics after interview.

Of the 56 casualties observed, only 28 civilians were identified. Each civilian was identified twice, with one instance riding Train-A and the other instance riding Train-B. Examination shows that all electronic and time-keeping devices present on Train-B at the time of collision were 9 hours slow. All passengers are confirmed to have been traveling on the route of Train-B 9 hours before the event, though without incident. Temporal interference has been suggested, though the cause is currently unknown and the logical paradox the situation represents has been deemed unsolvable. Whether all civilians involved caught the same train as one another twice consecutively as the result of coincidence or the effect of causal manipulation is unknown. No passengers of either train survived the impact.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 train line, Victoria, Australia.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All Train-B passengers were removed from the scene and taken into Foundation custody, currently kept in Site-\u2588\u2588 cold storage.

Area is to be monitored for further activity until 8/9/20\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> For exactly one and a half hours, all staff at Site-97 spontaneously grew a second, far smaller version of their head on their right shoulder that did nothing but whisper cheese or dairy-related puns into their right ear. These heads could not be removed during the allotted time frame, and would only speak over any sort of audio distractions. After the one and a half hours passed, the heads all said in unison \"If you wanted more cheese puns, then that's just \"swiss\"-full thinking! Ha, get it?! It's a cheese pun!\" then proceeded to bud off from their original bodies and shrivel into piles of dust.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 03-02-2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Site-97, Alaska, USA.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Entire site cleaned of dust piles created by anomalously formed heads.

The subsequent weight of this added mass and loss of structural integrity quickly led to the collapse of the western roof of the building.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 05/06/2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Colorado, USA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Due to quarantine measures already in place in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the school was completely unoccupied and only two civilians witnessed the event, both of whom were administered amnestics. All video footage was recovered and replaced to match a cover story of unchecked mold growth and frequent rain leading to a roof collapse. The skeleton was found to have no signs of decay and was covered in fresh, recently-deceased mosasaurus tissue, and was moved to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for temporal-paleontological research and subsequent storage. The building is to be monitored until 05/31/2025 for future anomalous occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> One <em>Blatta orientalis</em> (Oriental Cockroach) grew to a length of 1.2 meters within a civilian residence. The specimen displayed frantic behavior before fleeing the home and impacted by a passing pickup truck. The residents of the house then contacted the local authorities while passersby began taking photographs of the insect.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 05/06/20\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Iowa, USA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Foundation agents arrived shortly after the call was made and administered appropriate amnestic dosages after confiscating evidence of the event. Despite the efforts of Foundation entomologists, the cockroach perished due to breathing difficulties. Roughly 22 minutes after the cessation of life, the insect returned to average size while unobserved. The body was monitored for potential anomalous properties before disposed of via Site-\u2588\u2588's industrial incinerator.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A charred humanoid entity was seen on CCTV records logged in workplaces and industrial areas. Frequently observed to lay in a fetal position next to an indescribable organic mass for approximately five minutes before rousing and subsequently stepping onto the mass. Audio and video footage afterward damaged/deleted; corporate management denied involvement.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> Unclear.<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Interrogation attempts unsuccessful. Foundation agents have been embedded within areas of such occurrences posed as civilians. All records containing the event have been confiscated and transferred to Site-\u2588\u2588 for further research. Amnestics have been administered accordingly along with regular information suppression tactics.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> On 21/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, A team of 31 researchers, sailing through the Drake passage on an expedition to Antarctica, sighted what seemed to be a surfacing submarine 10km away off the coast of Smith Island. The expedition team, confused as they hadn't been informed of any submarines in the area, attempted to contact via radio but to no avail. A look through binoculars indicated that it was a military submarine, of unknown design, displaying an unknown flag. Not long after, a bright light and thunderous roar were seen and heard as a supposed missile was launched from the distant submarine, and travelled in an easterly direction. The submarine sank back down under the waves and was not seen again. The expedition was called off subsequently.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 21/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> 6km NW of Smith Island, Antarctica.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> The 31 researchers were interrogated individually and administered Class-A amnestics after. A covert foundation-led search team were deployed to the region to search for the rogue submarine, but found nothing after 14 months of searching. The launched missile, an SLBM, reached space and successfully deployed its stages. A single projectile, supposedly a warhead, was detected entering the atmosphere near Bouvet Island, but didn't detonate. Warhead and missile debris were never recovered. The file of this event remains in Site-\u2588\u2588 awaiting further investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The sky visible from inside Site-19 became pale red for 5 seconds, during which the text \"SQUONKIPEDIA\" in bold white lettering rapidly moved across the sky.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 09/12/2019<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Site-19<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> None, due to all witnesses being Foundation personnel. The cause of this is under investigation.</p>\n<p><em>Note: No known organization or popular media element with the name \"Squonkipedia\" has been identified.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Event Description</strong> All doorways and windows to Site-25's northeastern guard tower converted into impermeable opaque barriers and communication with the tower was lost. The event immediately ended upon a drilling attempt successfully breaching the floor. For the duration of the event, muffled shouting and construction noises were heard emanating from the inside, although all personnel rescued from the tower report instead hearing an \"unearthly warbling\" emanating from the outside.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 08/05/2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Site-25<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Due to security concerns, the tower may not be closed for more than 24 hours. As subsequent investigations found no anomalous items or entities, no changes will be made to guard schedules. Further anomalous events relating to this location are to be reported immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> At 9:32am, an instrumental piece of music, lasting 3 minutes and 52 seconds, and with composition style resembling that of a national anthem, began playing from the geometric center of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Building of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 University, prompting every person within hearing range to interrupt their current activities, stand up with their hand over their heart, and passionately sing along in an unknown language for the duration of the piece, after which they proceeded to resume their activities as if nothing had happened.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 03/11/2019<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Bogot\u00e1, Colombia<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Security camera footage retrieved and destroyed, mock footage created to replace it. Witnesses interviewed. All witnesses involved retained clear memories of the event, but showed disinterest or outright aversion in discussing it. None of them seemed willing to mention the event unprompted, and when questioned about it either tried to deflect to other topic, claiming disinterest, or outright refused to discuss it. Amnestics proved ineffective in removing memories of the event. However, due to the unlikeliness of them deciding to discuss it on their own accord, and the destruction of the only footage of the event, amnestic treatment has been deemed unnecessary for the time being. Witnesses are to be placed on a 5-year observation period to detect any potential changes in their behavior and/or the self-containing nature of the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An as-yet unidentified woman, dressed in what witnesses described as \"steampunk-style\" clothing, was seen walking a live thylacine (<em>Thylacinus cynocephalus</em>) down a busy street. When approached, she was heard to warn the approaching person or persons away by saying, \"Careful, she bites,\" in a Boston accent. After walking the animal for twenty-five minutes, she and the animal entered a taxicab, which promptly drove away. It is worthy of note that the thylacine is known to have been extinct since 1936.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 4/8/2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> New York City, NY<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Cover story of a promotional event for a movie shoot circulated. Through questioning of eyewitnesses, the Foundation was able to trace the woman's starting point to another taxicab at the intersection of [REDACTED]. Neither of the cabs has been identified, despite considerable effort. The cabs in question have not been found to belong to any taxi company in the city. Descriptions of the drivers have not been helpful, largely due to the fact that eyewitnesses were captivated by the strangely-dressed woman and her pet.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A public telephone outside of an abandoned grocery store began to ring. A young woman picked up the receiver and heard a heavily-distorted voice say, \"Everything you thought you knew is wrong.\" When she asked what the voice meant, it answered by saying, \"The world is not what you think it is.\" Further questions did not elicit answers, only similar phrases. After nearly three minutes, the woman hung up the phone in frustration.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 6/8/2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Miami, FL<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Telephone in question examined and discovered not to be connected to any telephone lines. Investigation revealed that the telephone had not been connected since 2002 and is only still in place because of a dispute about who should be responsible for its removal. Interviews with the woman provided no useful details; woman was amnesticized. Telephone placed under observation for 5 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Every human (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth simultaneously lost consciousness for approximately one second. Recording devices left running during this period show that all affected people abruptly screamed for the entire duration of the event.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 7/9/2020, 3:23:42 GMT<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Published evidence of event removed and edited, hoax websites developed to paint event as conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A Western Rock Lobster (<em>Panulirus cygnus</em>) transmuted into a live human infant whilst being boiled alive.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 09/9/2019<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Geraldton, Western Australia.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics. A window at the Jefferson house had to be repaired. Autopsy revealed the DNA of the carcass was identical to that of an ordinary human. Remains of the infant were cremated and buried.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A team of seven archeologists attempted to open the sarcophagus of Cleopatra. Within the sarcophagus, no body was discovered; however, a single living bee had left the tomb after being opened and proceeded to escape. The location of the specimen is unknown at this time.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurence:</strong> 2/3/2018<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Alexandria, Egypt<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Archeologists amnesticized. The public perception of Cleopatra's tomb is to be maintained as lost or currently unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A woman got up from her table at a restaurant and walked directly toward the women's restroom in a straight line, passing through several other tables and diners in the process. Security footage of the event shows the woman appearing to wade as she passes through solid objects, as though walking through deep water.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 29/9/2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> New York City, New York<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Witnesses interviewed and amnesticized. Security footage copied for Foundation records, original files deleted. The woman was placed under observation for future anomalous abilities, to continue until 2025.</p>\n<p>Automated Message from the Records and Information Security Administration: <em>A potential cognitohazard has effected this text.

Monkeys lacked fur, with only small amounts of hair, had advanced technology, opposable thumbs, and spoke in a thus far untranslated language.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> The 12th Cycle, age of Tall ones and Blank things.<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Sub-strait 42A, on the largest landmass.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions taken:</strong> All buildings were amnesticized, but the intelligent monkeys could not be tracked due to interference from a monkey based organisation known as the 'SCP Foundation'.</p>\n<hr/></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A school basketball match between the Marymount School of New York and New Anglia international school. The only anomalous event related to this match was its location and date of occurrence.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 20/06/1969<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> West Crater, Lunar Surface<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions taken:</strong> Apollo 11 crew provided with Class-A amnestics. Footage of the landing edited and cut to remove all traces of the game. Students involved lost memory of the incident naturally.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> All of the dogs in a local dog park were replaced by Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches (<em>Gromphadorhina portentosa</em>). Roaches were all the same size as the dogs that were replaced, and the effect lasted for about five and a half minutes before the dogs reappeared unfazed.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 03/12/2020<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Dog park in Revere, Massachusetts.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All pet owners were given Class A Amnestics and all camera footage was seized by Foundation personnel.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Edward Jacobs, age 34, described as a tall and thin Caucasian man with short curly brown hair and pale green eyes, entered a single-occupancy bathroom in an antique store, but did not exit. The man who exited the bathroom was noticeably short and slightly overweight. His identification showed that he was Alex Wong, age 22. Mr. Wong was not in the bathroom at the time Mr. Jacobs entered. Witnesses could not recall ever having seen him before, but did not regard his presence as unusual.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 19-1-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> New York City, NY<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Alex Wong was detained and questioned. His testimony revealed nothing unusual, and amnestic treatment was deemed unnecessary. Cover story of a missing person enabled Foundation agents to obtain the owner's permission to search the entire store, even the areas customers are not permitted to enter. Edward Jacobs was not located and has been classified as a Person of Interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A young woman visiting an office building for a job interview discovered a male white rhinoceros wearing a security guard's hat. Staff in the building referred to the rhinoceros as \"Jake.\" The young woman made a short video and uploaded it to the popular video hosting site [REDACTED], where it was discovered by Foundation web crawlers, prompting an investigation.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 2-4-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Seattle, WA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> After being found to be non-anomalous, the rhinoceros was taken to a nearby zoo. The video was removed from the video hosting site. The young woman who made the video was interviewed, as were staff at the building. All staff assumed that the rhinoceros was a member of security staff and found nothing unusual about this. All involved were given class A amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A mannequin in a window display at a women's clothing store became a living woman. She maintained the pose the mannequin had been placed in, merely watching those nearby with mild interest. She remained in this state for 1 minute and 23 seconds before becoming a mannequin again.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3-5-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> New York City, New York<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Uploaded photos and videos of the event allowed to remain in place. A cover story regarding a movie promotion was circulated. Staff at the store were interviewed. No member of staff recognized the woman, although most claimed she looked familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> After drinking a full 1-liter bottle of a generic soft drink, a teenage boy was able to belch the entire first verse of the Swedish national anthem in a single breath.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3-10-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Chicago, Illinois, USA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> The boy and all present when the event occurred interviewed and amnesticized. No useful information was gained.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>No one had any Swedish ancestry, knowledge of Sweden beyond the most basic geographical information, or knowledge of the Swedish national anthem. When the song was played by one of the responding agents, none of those interviewed were able to recognize it. Yet another mystery we'll probably never be able to solve.</em> - Dr. Malkin</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Approximately all flags in Washington D. C. became the now-popular 'Gay Pride' flag. All instances of the US flag in the District disappeared, and were found the following day in the capitol building with a label reading 'Happy Gay Pride month! Sorry for borrowing these.' The object was scanned for fingerprints and video recordings were observed, the person responsible was unable to be located. The following occurred in 2019 on the same date to a similar effect, and the person responsible for the events was still unable to be traced.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 06-11-2009 / 06-11-2019<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Washington, District of Columbia<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> The President of the US, all American political figures, and all present were given Class-A Amnestics on both occasions. Flags were removed and replaced with the modern incarnation of the flag of the United States before amnestics were administered on both occasions.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>This happened to have occurred on both the Tenth and Twentieth anniversaries of the US's 'Gay Pride Month' holiday. Whoever did this sure likes the occasion. -Dr. Ypres</em></p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The words WONPON suddenly appeared in the night sky, seemingly made of out flames, for 15 minutes before disappearing. The source of the lights is currently unknown.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 7-03-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Rama's Bridge, Indian Ocean<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Significant clean-up efforts deemed unnecessary, as most witnesses mistook the event for fireworks. Any individuals found to be spreading information opposite of this were amnestied, and evidence supporting the idea of fireworks has been dispersed among the population.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A man sitting on a bench in a subway station was heard to say something about having forgotten his phone. This was presumably in response to a smartphone at the opposite end of the bench. The man remained sitting, but another man completely identical to him stepped out of his body, walked to the opposite end of the bench, retrieved the phone, and returned. When the second man sat down, he appeared to merge into the first.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 4-13-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Chicago, IL<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> As this event happened very late at night, few witnesses were present. All witnesses described the event accurately, but seemed oddly disinterested, as though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. As no useful information could be gained, witnesses were given low-level amnestic treatment. The man responsible for the event has been placed under Foundation surveillance until 2026.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An entry was submitted to the site which described an anomalous item which does not exist. The entry was submitted by a terminal which had ceased functioning several days prior to the entry's creation.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 5-23-2022<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Site-64<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> The terminal was removed from the SciPNET intranet connection and efforts to find the culprit are underway.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Show\u00a0entry</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Anomalous</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1 is contained within Room 37-C of Site-64.

The entities then proceeded to attack the staff before fleeing into the surrounding wilderness and disappearing.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 12-5-2020<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Blackfoot, ID<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All customers and staff present were interrogated and given amnestics, with the restaurant's manager going on record saying, \"It was Carl's boys, I just know it! They're always pulling crap like this!\" An investigation into the neighboring Carl's Jr. restaurant has since been launched.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An as-yet unidentified man removed his baseball cap, revealing a small purple cloud on top of his head, which had been completely concealed by the hat. The cloud floated away in what witnesses described as an unhurried manner. It has not been located.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 4-26-21<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Cincinnati, OH<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> As neither the man nor the cloud could be located by the time the Foundation arrived, and there was no way to determine who had seen the event, low-grade amnestics were dispersed over the entire area via aerosol.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Known person of interest POI-11705 manifested a Glock 19 pistol and began to float in a standing posture. POI passed through the bottom of an elevated freeway as if intangible, emerged out the top and began to travel along the freeway, firing his pistol in the air while still intersecting with the freeway. POI made an abrupt upward motion while \"dabbing\" before exploding into fireworks.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 5/10/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Los Angeles, CA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Class-A amnestics administered to witnesses. Cover story of an illegal firework show implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Shortly after one woman entered an elevator in an office building, 13 copies of the same woman exited the elevator. According to witnesses, the women were completely identical in every respect and all answered to the same name. Six minutes and 47 seconds later, all but one of the women demanifested, leaving nothing behind.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 5-19-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Austin, TX<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Witnesses interviewed and amnesticized. None of the witnesses regarded the event as unusual in any way, and seemed puzzled by interviewers' suggestions to the contrary.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> For 0.0000002 seconds, the entire population of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was teleported to Monrovia, Liberia, before being teleported back; no body was harmed and there were no follow up effects on either Monrovia or Ho Chi Minh.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 2-22-1979<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Ho Chi Minh City and Monrovia<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Due to the fact that it was a very short amount of time and that it was midnight in Vietnam, most of the civilians did not notice. Those who did were given amnestics; a cover up story was spread in Monrovia of chemical smog playing tricks on the mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An abandoned building became a pleasant, well-kept suburban home with obvious signs of habitation. Foundation investigation discovered that it was owned by a man named Edward Jacobs, age 32. He claimed to have lived there alone for 4 years, after his mother moved out to be closer to her ailing sister. When interviewed, neighbors corroborated his story. A search of public records discovered that no one with the last name Jacobs had ever lived in the area and there was no such person as Edward Jacobs.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 1-1-2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Suburb of Cleveland, OH<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> As the anomalous nature of Edward Jacobs's existence in the region appears to be largely unknown, he was allowed to continue living in his current location. His property has been placed under Foundation surveillance until 2026. At the time of writing, no further anomalous activity has been reported.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>One of the clerks at the local courthouse spoke kindly of Edward Jacobs, calling him \"a nice young man,\" even after showing us evidence that the property has been vacant since 2018. This kind of thing is above my pay grade.</em> - Agent Walters</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A group of male Eclectus parrots (<em>Eclectus roratus</em>) in a zoo were seen developing humanoid heads and reciting \"a song about bananas\". Security footage failed to capture the event, although the occurrence was corroborated by multiple witnesses. Anomalous group hallucination assumed.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 6/3/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Ann Arbor, MI<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> People known to be in the area of the bird enclosure were given low-strength amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An adult male western lowland gorilla <em>(gorilla gorilla gorilla)</em> entered a local playground and began to play on the equipment. Multiple children happily interacted with the gorilla as though it were another child, and were seen to be very friendly toward it. Nearby parents were reported to be disinterested in the gorilla's presence. After 7 minutes and 38 seconds, the gorilla entered a nearby public restroom, and did not emerge. No trace of the gorilla was found afterward.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 6/3/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Cincinnati, OH<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All witnesses, both children and adults, were interviewed. Children did not appear to find the gorilla's presence unusual. Adults were disbelieving of the event, saying such things as \"children have such imaginations.\" All witnesses were amnesticized, and the playground was placed under Foundation surveillance.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Two people ran in opposite directions, to see which one their dog would follow. Rather than following one or the other, the dog split into two identical dogs and followed both of them at once. When the two people returned to close proximity, the dogs merged back into one.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 6/6/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Buffalo, NY<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Video of the event had already been posted to social media by the time it was brought to the attention of the Foundation. The video was promptly removed and dismissed as a hoax. Witnesses were located and given amnestic treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The top three participants in a bodybuilding competition had their muscle mass decreased by roughly 55% each, as they stepped on the podium. The only noted side effects were excess skin, and mental distress.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 10/6/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Los Angeles, California, USA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Inspection of the locale, the podium, as well as all products (Tanning products, bodybuilding equipment, etc.) used by the competitors revealed no anomalies. Video recordings of the event were taken down, and all witnesses and competitors were administered amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Dancers onstage at a concert performed a series of elaborate movements which are anatomically impossible, including several that defied the laws of physics.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 21/6/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Miami, FL<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> As the event was being broadcast live to local TV stations, large-scale amnestic treatment was deemed useless. Fortunately for the Foundation, no members of the audience seemed to be aware of the anomalous nature of the dance, viewing it as some form of clever trickery. When interviewed, the dancers claimed to have learned the dance from an online video. However, the video in question could not be found. Investigation into the video is still ongoing, and the person responsible for making it has been classified as a Person of Interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During a record-breaking heat wave, a woman was heard to complain about how hot it was. An unidentified man immediately manifested in front of her and began to lecture her on how hot it was where he came from, frequently using the phrase \"You don't know what real heat is.\" After 2 minutes and 17 seconds, the man de-manifested.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 2/7/2021<br/>\n<strong>Location of Occurrence:</strong> Seattle, WA<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All witnesses were interviewed and amnesticized.

Investigation by the night watchman revealed the sound to have emanated from a display with a maritime theme, including paintings of the sea and various ocean vessels. The watchman also claimed to hear bells ringing and people talking in a language he was unable to identify.

Subway staff were interviewed, but as no one seems to have been aware of anything out of the ordinary involving Mr. Jacobsen, amnestic treatment was deemed unnecessary. The restroom where the event occurred has been closed under cover of requiring renovation due to structural damage and placed under Foundation investigation.

The woman and her doctor were interviewed and amnesticized. The script is currently being studied by Foundation linguists, in hopes of identifying and potentially translating it.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description</strong> A man was reported holding a cross and pointing it at a woman, screaming multiple prayers of exorcism in Latin. Upon saying the word \"Amen,\" the woman spontaneously combusted, and nimbostratus clouds began to appear over the town, completely blocking out the sun and causing it to rain blood for 24 hours.

When questioned, the girl said that \"The angels saved me.\" It appears that she was physically incapable of reporting any other information regarding the situation. The angels demanifested shortly after, leaving a note behind. So far, the note has yet to be deciphered, but one of the agents who read it were able to understand it fully, and brought the girl to their wife, who has been able to raise the child.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 11/09/22<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Oklahoma<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up actions taken:</strong> The farmer was amnesticized and the girl was allowed to live with Agent I\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's wife.

D-5810 was reported to seemingly be unaffected by the fire and to have maintained eye contact with all witnesses simultaneously before expiring due to smoke inhalation. Fire continued until remains were reduced to ashes.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 04/19/2023<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Site-322, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up actions taken:</strong> Remains properly disposed of. No further actions deemed necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> For ten (10) hours and twenty-eight (28) seconds, the town of Zurich, Indiana, became a legal canton of the Swiss Confederation (Switzerland). Inhabitants manifested Swiss passports, reportedly spoke English and Romansch. An Indiana National Guard Armory was replaced with a Swiss Army Depot, protected by a force of Swiss soldiers equipped with Swiss vehicles. A small border checkpoint welcomed \"Our American Friends and Neighbors.\" Foundation monitors reported the anomaly whilst observing a local Indiana television broadcast interviewing \"residents of our shared border with Switzerland.\" Upon cessation of event, all anomalies returned to normal, with no apparent memory of the event in Zurich, Indiana. Notably, however, population of the town had increased by approximately 2.5% - all individuals so manifested were non-anomalous, but claimed to be of Swiss ancestry. The event was not remarked upon nor reported elsewhere in the United States, and the Foundation has found no evidence of Swiss awareness of the event - at least none after cessation of anomaly.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Switzerland County, Indiana, United States<br/>\n<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Inhabitants of Zurich, Indiana issued amnestics.

A seemingly ordinary wooden door manifested in empty air, which he opened and walked past as though entering a room. Upon passing the door, he disappeared, as did the door when he pulled it closed. He was later found at his home, having apparently entered through the front door.<br/>\n<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 2023-05-29<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Cincinnati, OH<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Security footage siezed and replaced. Witnesses interviewed and amnesticized. Curiously, no one present seemed to find this unusual. It was generally agreed that he has done this before, but no one was able to specify when or how often it had happened in the past. The man has been placed under Foundation observation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/log-of-extranormal-events\">Log of Extranormal Events, Vol I</a>\" by carriontrooper, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.\n\n> -Agent Carriontrooper\n\n\n\nDue to the increasing number of items discovered by the Foundation, this list is no longer open to new entries. A [[[log-of-extranormal-events-vol-ii| second volume]]] of this log has been made available, and currently remains open to new additions.\n\n\n\nLists of [[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Items]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled. \n\n\n\n------\n\n\u00a0\n\n//**Note:** Please add new entries to the bottom of the list, not the middle or the top.//\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A sperm whale estimated to be 2 km in length was observed breaching the ocean's surface, causing three nearby boats to capsize upon re-entry. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation removed any details about the anomalous nature of the creature from local news sources. Witnesses on ferries and close enough beaches administered Class A amnestics.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A glowing humanoid figure manifested on a subway platform and was seen by several eyewitnesses and captured on the station's surveillance system. The humanoid approached the edge of the tracks while making vague hand gestures and promptly vanished. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Barcelona, Spain.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A team of disguised agents and a portable holographic projection unit were brought to the location. The team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and 26 hours took place in Concord, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in Carson City, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Concord, North Carolina, USA\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by a local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The entire population of Holyhead, Wales was found comatose in a field just outside of town. All individuals were unharmed, but possessed slight burns on their clothing. All individuals woke up 14 hours later with no recollection of the event. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Holyhead, Wales.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class-B amnestics. A road accident involving a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged as a cover story. An emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population were given \u00a3150 per head as compensation. Since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behavior in the population.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a well-known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the \"true\" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Friendship, Oklahoma.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B amnestics. Close family members of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were questioned and given Class-A amnestics. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Several students attending \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Collegiate in Sandwich, New Hampshire, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle. Because Mr. \u2588\u2588's expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Seymour, Connecticut.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics. Tissue tests indicate that Mr. \u2588\u2588 is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in a hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of \"glass breaking\" during the emesis.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Andranomadio Public Hospital, Antsirabe, Madagascar.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: \"Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!\" Backtracking reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 12/21/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Worldwide\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A suspected associate of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. was observed entering an abandoned factory by Foundation operatives. The sound of bubbling water was heard from within the factory prior to two gunshots. Operatives found the suspect's body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found within the subject's jacket. No signs of the suspect's assailant were found.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/15/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-60.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2 km stretch of coastline at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the interior carcass revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with machinery components trapped in clear plastic.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/18/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Akaroa, New Zealand.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-108. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800 km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/11/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed and mass amnestic treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Every domesticated cat inside the city limits of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Norway traveled 10.9 km SE to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Sweden over period of 8 hours. Cats congregated in groupings of 13-25 in a field behind [DATA EXPUNGED] for 2 hours, then dispersed.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 25/09/2009\n\n**Location:** Norway/Sweden border.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Cats returned of their own accord to their homes. Any footage of gathering confiscated for study. Witnesses processed, debriefed, and administered Class-B amnestic. Field searched for abnormalities, blood and urine samples taken from cats in affected areas. No anomalies found. Both \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the field will be under surveillance until 30/09/2014.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** During a speech to a public committee, the mayor of Bonifay, FL began continuously chuckling at a pun made by a legislative observer for approximately 4.5 hours straight before collapsing into a nearby chair and passing out. He claims to have no memory of the event, nor did anyone else in the room during the speech. The only available evidence of its occurrence was captured entirely on camera.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Bonifay, Florida, USA\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Any and all witnesses who videotaped the event, along with anyone who viewed the videotapes themselves were given Class-B amnestics, and all resulting videotapes were wiped clean. The mayor himself is under minor surveillance from select members of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n**Event Description**: At exactly 2pm, 24 instances of a semi-erotic calendar appeared in numerous Foundation sites. Inside the calendar, images of Dr. Elliot, Dr. Kiryu, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent Merlo, Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. Right, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. Marie, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Dr. Jack Bright.

Attempts at stopping the ascent were futile, and the chair broke through any barriers placed in its way. It has since then left the atmosphere and is believed to be orbiting Jupiter.\n\n**Date of Occurrence**: 2/15/201\u2588\n\n**Location**: Muttontown, New York.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Any footage of the incident was wiped and pulled off the internet. Class-A amnestics were given to witnesses. Foundation operatives in various space programs are advised to destroy any information of the chair if found.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Eighty-eight thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eight citizens of the state of New Jersey fractured their left scaphoid bones within a two-hour period; radiography showed that all fractures were identical down to a sub-millimeter level.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Various hospitals throughout New Jersey.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to radiography technicians.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Viewers of the popular late-night talk show \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported seeing two different episodes. Approximately 40% watched an episode featuring the famous actor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 and the musical guest \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, while the other 60% watched an episode with \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 with an appearance by stand-up comedian \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588. Neither one of these episodes was the one which had actually broadcast, and neither one has ever been filmed.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Various televisions throughout the USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All recordings of the anomalous episodes showed the actual broadcast episode in later viewings. Viewer's memories of the anomalous episodes seem to have completely faded by themselves by \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588 channel officials who had been contacted about the episodes were administered Class-C amnestics and their internal investigation into the matter aborted. Social networks mentioning the matter were intercepted and edited.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A parrot owned by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family was discovered to have the ability to sing the entirety of the song \"Crazy Train\" by John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne, including vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard.

Additional amnestics were distributed to women on menstrual periods during the event, due to extreme emotional distress rendering the aerosolized version ineffective.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All written text in the Theater Department at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 University spontaneously converted to Wingdings. Digital text remained unaffected until printed out. All affected text contained the phrase \"You don't need a script to pretend to be someone else, you're doing it right now! ( \u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\"\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2014\n\n**Location:** Staten Island, New York.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics were administered to all students and faculty present. Affected books were incinerated, and are currently being replaced.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A translucent digital clock approximately 3 km across appeared in the sky about 1.5 km above the ground. The anomaly counted down from 05:55, stopping short of 01:13 before disappearing completely.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2006\n\n**Location:** Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly was only witnessed by a single fishing trawler. Class-C amnestics issued to the entire crew.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A single specimen of //Dionaea muscipula//, better known as the Venus flytrap, expanded to approximately 2.5m tall and consumed a domesticated cat. The specimen expired shortly after and was reported by passing civilians.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics issued to witnesses. Specimen taken for future studying.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Ten minutes before opening to the general public, three visit team staff and a security officer at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Museum witnessed a //Scutigera coleoptrata// specimen, commonly known as a house centipede, emerge from a small drainage pipe in a storage closet. The specimen traveled approximately 1 m before entering a sink u-bend which had been opened for repairs.

All humans in the metropolitan area when the change occurred were not aware of the existence of color while the effect persisted. Those who entered the area of effect after the change occurred were not affected, but affected individuals treated them with fear and suspicion. When the change was reverted through unknown means, all individuals within the affected area lost their memories of the event, although those who had left the area of effect before the restoration of color retained their memories.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 3/21/2014 through 3/23/2014\n\n**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to individuals who retained memories of the event, and all records of the event destroyed.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All weights within the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&Son Gym assumed a red coloration for a period of five hours.

(*A*) \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588##**\".\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Birmingham, England, UK.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. All weights were taken in custody for further studying. Following the event, the objects displayed no apparent anomalous effect. However, closer inspections revealed that the words \"Brought to you by the Kobayashi Athletics\" were inscribed on the items. All weights were replaced by new ones. The establishment is to be kept under surveillance until 2016/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Two individuals were observed to spend seven hours attempting to move past each other in a narrow hallway before one collapsed from exhaustion, at which point the other decided to take a different route. There is no indication, either from recorded footage of the event or from the testimony of the involved parties, that this was intentional or involuntary.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts office of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Affected subjects were provided with appropriate medical care and amnestics were administered to all known witnesses. The hallway in question and the affected subjects have shown no anomalous properties before or since.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** During a public concert in the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Georgia, a large number of //Procyon lotor// (common raccoon) assembled behind the outdoor concert stage, and started constructing an object resembling a shrine out of materials they had collected from various places around the town, including branches, pine cones, fast-food wrappers, old newspaper, and a trash-can lid. After the shrine was constructed, the raccoons proceeded to make motions described by onlookers as \"bowing\" to the shrine, and then quickly scattered. Upon attempted destruction of the shrine by civilian Joseph \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a large and aggressive nursery of raccoons emerged, numbering more than 100 by most witness accounts. The nursery proceeded to assault Joseph \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, resulting in his death.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Brookhaven, Georgia, USA\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All those who witnessed the event were given Class-A amnestics.

Interviews with those affected have provided a detailed, highly consistent account of the entire city being transported to the surface of a planet (believed to be Venus), protected by a dome of unknown design. (See Document E-41567-\u2588\u2588 for full account.) However, telephone records, security camera feeds and interviews with non-resident non-employees suggest that nothing unusual happened during the time period and that all those affected were present on Earth and went about their business as normal.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2011\n\n**Location:** Pompano Beach, Florida, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Affected individuals provided with amnestics after interview. Foundation personnel involved in the event have been commended for controlling media coverage. Amnestic treatment has successfully removed memories of the event. Implementation of further surveillance is currently under debate.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Towards the end of a show, musician \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began sweating profusely. For 6 minutes, the sweat fell to the floor and pooled together, forming into various miniature trains. Following this, the trains rapidly evaporated.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 05/22/2015\n\n**Location:** Earth, Texas, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses (including the musician) were administered Class-A amnestics. No further action was required, and the show was generally well received.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Over an eight-minute period, six hundred and ninety-seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty-mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a \"smiley.\" At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/01\n\n**Location:** Faeto, Italy.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Water supplies and meteorological data throughout Apulia to be monitored over a six-month period.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of //Canis lupus familiaris// barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/03\n\n**Location:** Australia.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Fallopia, Agent [REDACTED]'s Basenji, taken for post-anomaly testing. No anomalous activity noted since.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** At approximately \u2588:26 AM local time, a train bound from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (hereafter Train-A) collided with an identical train moving along the same line from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (hereafter Train-B). Of the 56 casualties observed, only 28 civilians were identified. Each civilian was identified twice, with one instance riding Train-A and the other instance riding Train-B. Examination shows that all electronic and time-keeping devices present on Train-B at the time of collision were 9 hours slow. All passengers are confirmed to have been traveling on the route of Train-B 9 hours before the event, though without incident. Temporal interference has been suggested, though the cause is currently unknown and the logical paradox the situation represents has been deemed unsolvable. Whether all civilians involved caught the same train as one another twice consecutively as the result of coincidence or the effect of causal manipulation is unknown. No passengers of either train survived the impact.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 train line, Victoria, Australia.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All Train-B passengers were removed from the scene and taken into Foundation custody, currently kept in Site-\u2588\u2588 cold storage.

Records indicate that all calls came from a single number and further investigation indicates that the number is currently in use by an employee of the company who did call that day but was held up in the queue. At the 3-minute mark, all calls vanished completely from the queue.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Philippines, calls were documented to come from the employee's address in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Call records for the time frame when the calls occurred were expunged from the system and false records inputted during a routine system maintenance the next day. Class-B amnestics were administered to all parties involved while the employee was monitored for the next 3 months but no anomalous activity was noted.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** At roughly 2:30 PM, sixteen (16) city buses pulled up to a movie theater owned by a private company; all buses were packed full. All people aboard the buses (bus drivers included) as well as the owner of the movie theater shared the same first name: \"Greg\". Furthermore, the Gregs' all came to the location to see the same movie, \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\". Said movie had a Greg starring in the lead role. There was no convention of any sorts occurring at the time in the town, nor any in the world at that time that was summoning people with the name \"Greg\".\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 3/17/199\u2588\n\n**Location:** Greg's Theater, Unity, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Interviews with all 1267 Gregs' involved as well as their families found that this had not been a planned event, and that 97% of all people involved did not know anyone else that had attended prior to the event. No records indicate that there were any advertisements or events that would have sparked such an occurrence. All Gregs' and witnesses involved were given Class-A amnestics. A cover-up story involving a Greg convention was released, and no further incident occurred after cover-up was released. Theater was monitored for two years, but aside from a reduced crime rate for the first two weeks after the event no anomalous activity occurred.\n\n**Note:** //This was easily the most confusing case I've ever had to deal with.// -Agent Greg\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** At 8:30 AM local time, a 911 call was made regarding a construction worker whose neck had been broken. Ambulance arrived three minutes later, and OSWA arrived within twenty minutes, among which was an embedded Foundation agent.

Interviews with affected individuals revealed causes ranging from allergies to infections to sunlight as the source of sneezing. No link between individuals was obtained; most considered the event an amusing coincidence. MTF-Rho-13 (\"YouTube Celebs\") deployed an online cover-up story claiming the event was an out-of-season test run for a flash mob.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Forty-nine fresh human corpses appeared in the master bedroom of a home undergoing construction, during the 30 second duration between the installation of a door in the doorframe, and the opening of the door for the first time. All corpses were of the same individual (identified as former United States Senator Joseph McCarthy, 1908-1957) at different ages, ranging from an estimated 48 years old to a newborn with umbilical cord still attached.

A cesarean section was performed, and the subject's uterus was found to contain a small litter of Siamese kittens.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2/19/1992\n\n**Location:** Slaughter, Louisiana, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Reports of the event in the media suppressed as a hoax. \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and all medical personnel who witnessed the event administered Class-A amnestics. Kittens entered Foundation custody, and have shown a decreased rate of aging, currently possessing biology consistent with a three-year-old cat, despite being over twenty-five years of age as of 2017.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All writing utensils within the J. Edgar Hoover Building disappeared over a six-hour period.\u00a0\u00a0A search of the building the following morning found all missing items embedded point-first in the ceiling of a disused office in the basement, arranged in a long, disk-like shape.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 1993-9-10\n\n**Location:** J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C., Maryland, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Items were returned to their respective owners, and the event was written off as an elaborate prank by the janitorial staff. Members of the Unusual Incidents Unit headquartered within the building were instructed to monitor the building for further anomalies for a five-year period.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A family of three created a rudimentary religion after several cereal boxes developed human legs and arms, with the religion centered around the worship of these cereals. The family developed false names for these cereals based on their contents, such as //Narroct, Lord of the Beehive// (Honey-Nut Cheerios), //The Pirate and the Sea// (Captain Crunch) and //The Twins of Rock, Coco and Fruity// (Cocoa Pebbles and Fruity Pebbles respectively). The family members had no recollection of the event when the limbs demanifested after three days. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 9/16/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - 9/19/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Mountainair, New Mexico, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All cereal items belonging to the family were confiscated, and Class A amnestics were administered. The cereals have been sent to Site-551 due to potential anomaly.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Surveillance camera staff at the natural reserve near Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires City, Argentina, saw what appeared to be the same man in two different parts of the park at the same time, apparently mirroring each other's movements despite the lack of line of sight between the two. The individuals then disappeared into the brush. People in the reserve at that time talked about a weird man talking to himself about the '\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing Paraguayans\" before walking off-road.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 01/\u2588\u2588/2018\n\n**Location:** Natural reserve, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentine Republic.\n\n**Follow-up actions taken:** Surveillance tapes of the strange men confiscated, and surveillance staff administered Class-B amnestics. Two Foundation agents disguised as birdwatchers have been assigned to the park to watch for possible developments.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" hide=\":: [BACKDOOR UNLOCKED AND OPENED.

Three days after the event, all memory of the event occurring was instantly lost from all witnessing personnel. All written documentation regarding the event can only be accessed via extranormal means.\n\n> **Date of Occurrence:** 11/3/2018\n\n> **Location:** Dr. Hobbes's Office, Site-10, Japan\n\n> **Follow-up actions taken:** A Foundation maintained, anomalous backdoor has been created in order to view said records regarding the event.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** An intestinal tumor located in the body of Grover \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a 52-year-old man from Des Moines, Iowa, is found to contain an entire secondary brain, including medulla, pituitary gland, and\u00a0\u00a0part of a spinal cord. DNA from the brain does not match that of Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is currently believed to belong to a twelve year-old girl who vanished from Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1992.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 04/05/2010\n\n**Location:** Des Moines, Iowa\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Doctors involved with the surgery amnesticized. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died following the surgery. Despite several autopsies and examinations, no definitive cause of death has been determined. His cadaver, as well as the brain excised from his stomach, remain in cold storage.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** $237,981 manifested simultaneously, spread across various countries on flat surfaces at approximately $1.3 per square kilometer. This money changed to a different currency depending on the country it manifested within.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 5/9/2014\n\n**Location:**\u00a0\u00a0Worldwide.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None, due to the very obscure nature of the event, and that 87% of all the manifested money was made unusable from external forces.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The PA system in a Giant Eagle supermarket announced, \"Attention Giant Eagle shoppers: the ritual will now commence,\" whereupon all individuals within the store stopped what they were doing and hummed an intricate series of notes for approximately five minutes. After another tone, the humming ceased and all affected individuals resumed their business as though nothing had occurred.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 10/10/2014\n\n**Location:** Columbus, Ohio\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Event would not have come to Foundation attention if not for discovery of security footage during in-store theft investigation. Individuals affected during event have no memory thereof. As such, it has been determined that attempting to identify and interview each person visible on the tape is unfeasible. Videos confiscated, amnestics administered to store staff, and Foundation agents stationed at Giant Eagle supermarkets to monitor for future events or signs of PA system tampering.\n\n**Update:** As of 27/04/2016, surveillance of Giant Eagle stores has produced no further evidence of anomalous activity. Agents recalled.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Every human on earth simultaneously blinked. During the event \u2588\u2588\u2588 people disappeared.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 3/5/18\n\n**Location:** Earth.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Various cover up stories to explain missing persons have been enacted. Blinking resulted in minor containment breaches at various sites relating to SCPs pertaining to sight.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Between 16:00:04 UST and 19:53:02 UST, black hole Cygnus X-1 underwent a series of rapid fluctuations in registered x-ray flux density, up to 194.2% of the normal value. When converted into Morse Code, the fluctuations spelled out an expanded, 2018 updated version of the 1988 book //A Brief History of Time// by the recently deceased physicist Stephen William Hawking. Analysis shows the writing style of the updates to be consistent with that of the original author.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 3/14/18\n\n**Location:** Cygnus X-1\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Non-Foundation observers were administered Class-A amnestics, and the observation data in question was covered up. Cygnus X-1 is to be monitored for further anomalies. Whether to release the book under an appropriate cover story is currently under debate.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All water in the Samur River was converted to human blood for four days. All water which entered the river at its source was converted into blood, and all blood which flowed out of the river was converted into water. Blood collected directly from the river did not change. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2018-\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2018\n\n**Location:** Samur River, Russia and Azerbaijan\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics were dispersed aerially through the nearby village of\n\nSamur\u00e7ay following completion of event. DNA analysis of collected blood compared against the Foundation genetic database identified all blood as originating from one Joshua Havaldar, a 34-year-old Indian-American man living in San Francisco. He was unable to provide information on the event, but did report exhibiting symptoms consistent with hypovolemia in the preceding week. Mr. Havaldar was administered Class-A Amnestics following interview. Both the Samur River and Mr. Havaldar are currently under a standard five-year monitoring period.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A small canoe in the Mississippi River was consumed whole by a //Carcharocles megalodon//, along with its two occupants. //Carcharocles megalodon// has been extinct for 2.6 million years, and the river in question is much too shallow to contain a creature of that size.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 02/14/2018\n\n**Location:** Undisclosed location on the Mississippi River, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics were administered to witnesses, and a cover story was circulated claiming the canoe occupants were intoxicated and capsized their vessel accidentally. A task force was sent to locate and capture the anomalous entity, but all attempts to locate the specimen failed.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Unscheduled subway train passes through 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn at approximately 80mph. Eye witnesses describe the train as purple with Arabic lettering on the side. Train wasn't reported appearing anywhere else.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 07/03/2017\n\n**Location:** 36th Street, Brooklyn New York, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses administered Class-A amnestics, and footage of the event was confiscated.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** During a Toys R Us staff meeting, an employee later identified as William J. Horack stood, announced, \"Well, guess I won't need these anymore,\" and removed his lips with one hand. Afterward, he began to consume the remaining flesh around his mouth -- described by witnesses as having the appearance of \"pulled pork\" -- as the other employees returned to normal operations. Horack continued to autocannibalize over the course of the day, captured only intermittently by security cameras despite not leaving the meeting room. At 19:05, Horack had been reduced to skeletal remains, which then vanished. Eyewitnesses reported confusion that the event did not strike them at the time as being out of the ordinary.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 15/03/2018\n\n**Location:** Mayfield Heights, Ohio, USA\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Amnestics distributed to store employees and customers after interviews conducted. Investigation of security cameras revealed no fault. No personal information about William Horack could be attained, and all documentation involved in his three-year employment at Toys R Us appeared to be an intricate forgery. Lips retrieved from initial event location, determined to be faux lips made of wax.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Over the course of five days, the entire student population of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 Elementary School in Seven Hills, Ohio developed allergies to all nut-based food products.\u00a0\u00a0Faculty and individuals not attending \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 Elementary who enter the building were unaffected. The symptoms ceased if individuals were removed from the premises for sixty-two hours. Notably, a student at the school, Isaac \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, is currently comatose following a severe allergic reaction as a result of being force-fed a peanut butter sandwich.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 02/19-02/23/2018\n\n**Location:** Seven Hills, Ohio, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** School was shuttered, students were integrated into other elementary schools in the area. Isaac \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's condition has shown no improvements. Foundation medical staff are currently attempting to treat and revive him in an attempt to find a link between his current state and the anomaly within\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 Elementary.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All canned food sold at Miller's Supermarket in Craig, Iowa was found to contain one or more live specimens of //Lampropeltis triangulum// (milk snake) in place of their intended contents. X-ray imaging shows that prior to opening, the cans contained their intended contents, and only upon opening do the snakes appear.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 4/18/2017\n\n**Location:** Craig, Iowa, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly ceased within twelve hours of its first manifestation. amnestics were administered to all affected, dispatch logs recording emergency calls of the event were scrubbed.\u00a0\u00a0All milk snakes contained by the Foundation have yet to show anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All individuals with the name Jeffery Smith gathered in the same area and greeted one another before departing. All persons involved claimed their arrival was purely coincidental, and that they had simply been \"passing through the area\". \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 12/6/1993\n\n**Location:** New York City, New York, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Involved individuals were located and amnestized. Event was covered up as a stunt associated with a reality television show.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A collection of twenty billboards located in the southern region of Florida were anomalously painted over to display an advertisement for \"laundry and tan by dado\", an establishment located in Two Egg, Florida. The paint of \"laundry and tan by dado\" anomalously changes color.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2018\n\n**Location:** Two Egg, Florida, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Billboards were replaced with unaltered variations, and the event attributed to ordinary graffiti. Preliminary investigation of laundry and tan by dado initiated under [[[SCP-888-EX]]] designation.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** For three minutes all personnel aboard the USS \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began screaming the phrase \"remember fifty-five\" before briefly being confused and returning to normal operations.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** The USS \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which was located at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at the time.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** {{[FIELD LEFT BLANK]}}\n\n\n\n--**Event Description:** This event was transcribed for the Log of Extranormal Events. This event appeared on its own, and wasn't written by anyone.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 6/8/2018\n\n**Location:** The Log of Extranormal Events\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The Foundation will view this entry, and subsequently delete it. Then, they will write up an actual event description regarding the actual anomalous event.--\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** An event was transcribed onto the document known as \"The Log of Extranormal Events\" which described itself and how it came into being. Security footage of all locations capable of accessing the log show no personnel within a 1 meter radius of any device capable of editing the aforementioned log. Edit history of all computers shows that there was no edit.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 6/8/2018\n\n**Locations:** All computers capable of accessing the Log of Extranormal Events and all locations of physical copies.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The original text was marked as falsified within all copies of the Log of Extranormal Events and kept for reference. \n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Mascot costumes resembling familiar Disney characters spontaneously manifested onto all guests of Disneyland's \"Mickey's Toontown\" area. Each guest had also anomalously adopted the personality of the character depicted by their respective costume until the costumes demanifested at midnight local time, leaving guests in a wild, confused state.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** July 7, 2005.\n\n**Location:** Disneyworld, Florida, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses and guests were amnesticized.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Six corpses, visually and genetically identical to former U.S. President Barack Obama, were discovered in a submerged cave by cave divers. All six corpses were wearing animal costumes. Autopsies revealed that all six individuals drowned, and perished two weeks prior to their discovery.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** August 17th, 2017\n\n**Location:** A submerged cave in Quintana Roo, Mexico.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Corpses moved to Site-17, all witnesses amnesticized.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Twenty kakapo, representing approximately 24% of the extant members of the species, spontaneously combusted over the course of three minutes. Twenty kakapo chicks were found in the remains, genetically identical to the twenty deceased instances.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 9/04/2018\n\n**Location:** Codfish Island, New Zealand\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics administered to all witnesses, and a brood of mature cloned kakapo were released to account for the disparity. Genetic testing of the chicks found them to be a hybrid of a kakapo and an unidentified species of parrot.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** At least 1000 instances of plains zebra (Equus quagga) emerged from the opening of the volcanic cone of Shira, located on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Said instances descended Mt. Kilimanjaro and roamed the Kilimanjaro National Park for 2 hours before subsequently disappearing.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 02/23/1988\n\n**Location:** Kilimanjaro National Park, Tanzania\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All witnesses to the event were given Class-A amnestics. Members of the organization known as the \"Anomalous Zebra Collective\", or \"AZC\", who attempted to ride the zebras out of the Kilimanjaro National Park, were interviewed for information on the AZC before being given Class-A amnestics. Mt. Kilimanjaro has been put under constant surveillance in case of anomalous activity.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A door was opened.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** In a second.\n\n**Location:** Next door.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The door was welded shut. Personnel are to be reminded that the entity within the room does not exist. The door is never to be opened.

Samples of rainwater were collected, and meteorological analysis occurred during the next several rainstorms in Bald Knob; no anomalous properties were found.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All trains within the boundaries of New York disappeared for 3 seconds, before reappearing. All individuals were then teleported to their original destination, believing they waited and got off their stop as normal.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** New York City, New York, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All footage recording the event was wiped. Class-A amnestics were administered to all witnesses of the event.\n\n\n\n**Event Description** An anomalously formed electrical storm appears over \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High School for 3 minutes. During this time, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a local student, was struck by lightning an estimated 830 times. \n\n**Date of Occurence:** 10/3/2011\n\n**Location:** Dinosaur, Colorado, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses administered amnestics. Cover story involving a power line accident disseminated. \n\n\n\n**Event Description:** No episodes of the sitcom //Friends// were made beyond season three. Viewing any episodes aired after \"The One at the Beach\" when taking mnestics shows that every recording is a single shot of a couch within Monica's apartment, with the six central cast members sobbing loudly. Most vocalizations are incoherent, but \"please stop\" is heard repeatedly.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown, discovered by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on 10/12/2018\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** As //Friends// is too embedded in the cultural consciousness standard information suppression was deemed nonviable. Instead the Foundation took //Friends// down from all streaming services and is currently recreating seasons four through ten to replace anomalous episodes.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** An incorporeal mother and child wearing 19th century clothes were observed walking down a street. Several cars passed through the pair, although neither the vehicles nor entities were affected. Witnesses reported that the entities conversed with one another inaudibly, and made gestures towards unseen objects. They walked several hundred feet before entering a store front, upon which they both vanished. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 10/11/2019\n\n**Location:** Middleton, Pennsylvania\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** No agents were present for the event. The event was reported in local media with interviews, and has circulated on some internet paranormal sites with a short cell phone video. The video is of poor quality, and inconclusive to most viewers. Assigned agents have found the spectral phenomena to be non-recurring and of no threat to either the populace or Foundation security and secrecy. As such no further actions have been taken.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All personnel at Site-64 reported feeling a \"slight warm pressure\" for several seconds at 5:26 PM. This was corroborated by various pressure-sensitive anomalies, as well as thermometers and weight scales being triggered. Forensic teams discovered a tessellation of a small human fingerprint across every open surface within the site.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11/11/2019\n\n**Location:** Site-64, Oregon, USA. \n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Police and Foundation records are being searched for a match to the discovered fingerprint. Personnel who were at Site-64 may take amnestics to erase their memory of the event.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A shockwave suddenly propagated starting at the geological North pole and followed a path identical to the International Date Line down all the way to the geological South pole over approximately 12 hours, also causing tidal waves that dealt mild damage to islands close to the shockwave; no source could be determined.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11/13-14/2018\n\n**Location:** Arctic, Pacific, and Southern oceans, as well as Antarctica.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All known witnesses of the shockwave administered amnestic. Damage caused by tidal waves explained as an earthquake; restoration of Arctic and Antarctic ice is underway along with information about the cracked ice being suppressed.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All crosses in the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 levitated and reversed their orientation to be upside-down. Later analysis revealed variations of \"Hail Satan\" with various misspellings carved into the back of each cross with a short blade. These include \"Hale Satan\", \"Hale Satin\", and in one case, \"Hyyl Sytyn\". \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 07/31/2008\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Iowa, USA\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** As this event had no witnesses beyond one security camera in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family residence, no amnestics were given. The security footage was confiscated for use in Foundation training. The event has been given a cover story of teen vandalism.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A glowing yellow intangible cube manifested 15 centimeters above the floor of Site-06-3's main kitchen. The cube was tilted at a 13\u00ba angle, and maintained an internal temperature of -3\u00ba Celsius despite the surrounding air temperature. Further tests with D-class personnel began and showed no other anomalous properties. The cube spontaneously demanifested after 43 minutes.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 12/02/2018\n\n**Location:** Site-06-3, France.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None. It should be noted that three of the eight personnel who were in the main kitchen during the event have since developed skin cancer. It is currently unknown whether this has any connection to the anomalous event.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** For 24 hours, any person entering the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Laundromat would find themselves in a well-furnished Blockbuster video rental store. All reports stated that the titles of the films in the store did not correlate with any known films, some with titles in unknown languages. During the initial exploration of the anomaly, a letter was discovered at the front counter reading //\"I lost my job for this? They could have at least turned this place into an arcade or something.\"// After 24 hours had passed the spatial anomaly ceased all activity and the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Laundromat could be accessed once again with no signs of anomalous activity.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 08/12/2009\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Laundromat, Florida, USA. \n\n**Follow-Up Actions:** Due to the relatively new status of the building all individuals who witnessed the event were informed that the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Laundromat was not complete and was currently being renovated from what was formerly a Blockbuster store.\n\n**Note:** The building in which the anomaly occurred was formerly a Blockbuster store, which was classified as defunct several weeks prior to the current occupation of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Laundromat. The locations of the previous workers are currently unknown.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** During the 199\u2588 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the float featuring the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog was witnessed blinking and wagging its left hand's index finger. Anomalous behavior immediately ceased after 20 seconds of movement.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11-28-199\u2588\n\n**Location:** New York City, New York, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions:** Class A amnestics were given to everyone present on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Street, where the anomaly occurred. Original footage was archived, and mock footage has been created as a supplement.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex held in the main lobby of the Natural History Museum began emitting audio from the motion picture //Jurassic Park//. All 2 hours and 7 minutes of audio from the film was recorded, although all sounds attributed to the dinosaur characters were notably amplified. Very few witnessed the event due to the event occurring outside the museum's hours of operation.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** New York City, New York, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions:** Class-A amnestics were administered to the only two witnesses, two security guards.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** At the crater of the K\u012blauea volcano, a mass of confetti was launched 3 meters into the air, accompanied by the sound of a party horn. Confetti immediately turned to ash as it hit the ground. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 07-\u2588\u2588-2017\n\n**Location:** Island of Hawaii, Hawaii, USA\n\n**Follow-Up Actions:** A Class-A amnestic cloud was released over all cities surrounding the volcano. All recordings of the event have been censored and archived. \n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Foundation physicist Lloyd Darwell entered the 2nd-floor northern men's restroom at Site-35 at exactly 11:11:45, and exited two minutes earlier at 11:09:48. Darwell did not notice this at first and did not interact with his past self. The event was only later found due to a review of security footage to find information regarding an unrelated non-anomalous workplace incident. Custodian L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was the only other individual in the restroom during the incident and claims to have suffered a large migraine at roughly 11:10 before falling unconscious and later being awoken by another custodian.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 12/13/2019\n\n**Location:** Site-35, Canada.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** No personnel are allowed in the restroom until it is determined to either have no anomalous properties, or is contained and given a suitable replacement. Until then, male personnel must use a different restroom. As a reminder, restroom breaks are not to take more than five minutes, including time taken in locating a restroom and traveling to and from it.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A lightning bolt spontaneously solidified mid-strike. The object immediately toppled due to structural imbalance, and shattered upon contact with ground. Shattered portions of the object were not found during a patrol of the area, and are believed to have dispersed into non-anomalous electricity.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 7/29/2015\n\n**Location:** Altai Mountains, Siberia, Russia.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Due to extremely low population density, no civilians are thought to have witnessed the event directly. Captured footage from two border patrol stations was seized, and employees exposed to footage amnesticized.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A large mass of termites entered a furniture store and proceeded to consume every piece of furniture before exiting.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 1/3/2020\n\n**Location:** Unalaska, Alaska, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses were amnestised and the store was cleared of debris. The cover story of a large-scale robbery was implemented, and the area is being monitored for additional manifestations.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A chest freezer began producing irregularly shaped ice after being disconnected from its power supply. The ice produced took the shape of English words, spelling out the phrase \"Please help I am a freezer\". \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 1/13/2020\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New Hampshire, USA\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The freezer's owners were administered Class-A amnestics, and the freezer itself was confiscated under the guise of requiring repairs. Extensive testing failed to produce similar results, and the freezer was placed within Site-19's cafeteria.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The four heads on Mount Rushmore had changed to several different expressions before returning to normal state. The expressions had included winking, blowing a raspberry, one eyebrow raised, and a mouth into a screaming position.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 28/01/20\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses and guests given Class-A amnestics. All security footage of the event was destroyed. Cellphone(s) which has recorded and photographed the event had been destroyed and had their SIM card removed.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** CCTV footage shows a student absentmindedly tossing a water bottle from hand to hand. Upon overshooting and tossing the bottle behind them, as they attempted to grab the bottle, their arm was noted as extending to approx. twice its original length in order to properly catch the bottle. Body language suggests the sudden increase in length was both unintended and extremely painful.\n\n**Date of Occurrence** 2/4/20\n\n**Location:** Sandwich, Illinois, USA.\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Student recovered and arm amputated. Student (and any bystanders during the event) amnesticized, reintegrated into school under the guise of a serious sports wound, and footage erased.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** 37 Foundation custodians with some variation of the name \u201cHoward,\u201c either as a first name (18), surname (9), or middle name (10), retrocausactively developed a permanent food allergy to eggs and cephalopods. All affected persons in the current baseline reality have now possessed the allergy from an early age, ranging from 0 to 4 years.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 02/06/2020\n\n**Location:** Worldwide, although mostly centered in North America and Europe\n\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Allergen precautions have been increased in affected Foundation sites. As the affected employees believe they have always been affected, they are not to be informed of this event.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** At 22:20, all buses within an approximate 230 meters of the London bridge had their exteriors changed to a white coloration. Buses then began to change hue, slowly rotating through the observable color spectrum for 25 minutes before fading back to their original coloration. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 07/8/20\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** London, England.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Due to the time of occurrence, very few individuals were found to have observed the event. A video taken of the event has been largely regarded as a hoax by the population at large, without need for Foundation intervention. Area is to be monitored for further activity until 8/9/20\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** For exactly one and a half hours, all staff at Site-97 spontaneously grew a second, far smaller version of their head on their right shoulder that did nothing but whisper cheese or dairy-related puns into their right ear. These heads could not be removed during the allotted time frame, and would only speak over any sort of audio distractions. After the one and a half hours passed, the heads all said in unison \"If you wanted more cheese puns, then that's just \"swiss\"-full thinking! Ha, get it?! It's a cheese pun!\" then proceeded to bud off from their original bodies and shrivel into piles of dust. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 03-02-2020\n\n**Location:** Site-97, Alaska, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Entire site cleaned of dust piles created by anomalously formed heads. Cheese and dairy puns have been banned from Site-97 as staff used to be very fond of such jokes, which researchers suspect is what caused such an absurd event. Poster of claymation duo //Wallace and Gromit// has been removed due to the series' connections with cheese. Site-97 is currently under watch due to this event.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The pants worn by an unidentified man spontaneously burst into flames. Nearby patrons did not appear startled and instead simply collected available water and hurled it at the man's pants to quench the flames before returning to what they had been doing. Later investigation found that the man in question had been in the middle of a cell phone call with his wife, and had claimed to have been in a restaurant just prior to the event.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 3/6/2020\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Bar, New Caledonia\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Security camera footage from the bar on the night in question was reviewed, although no footage of the man in question could be found. A cover story involving a stunt for an online video series was circulated.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Two entities resembling humanoid fish were sighted at the base of a lighthouse. Said entities were observed attacking the base of the lighthouse with rudimentary stone weapons, while yelling in an unidentified language. A nearby civilian yelled out to the entities, who panicked and jumped into the ocean. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 3/9/1991\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island, Washington, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions:** Witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics. Damage to the lighthouse was determined to be superficial, and did not require repairing. Surveillance of the waters surrounding the lighthouse have proven inconclusive.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Five emaciated red humanoid figures were spotted at the chain convenience store in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Figures were observed by CCTV surveillance to pass through store aisles, becoming increasingly more distended. Ten minutes after their initial manifestation, entities vanished, and all items within the store were found to have vanished. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 8/14/20\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Diamond Bar, California, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Store employees and customers were treated with Class-A amnestics. Store was provided with two members of security who are to watch for additional manifestations until 2028.\n\n\n\n**Event Description** CCTV footage shows a two second flash of light being emitted from a single streetlight, eliminating all visibility. Following this, the street occupied by the streetlight underwent immediate congestion. Traffic eventually eased to average levels after three hours. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2/17/20\n\n**Location:** Palm Springs, Florida\n\n**Follow-Up Actions taken:** Area was to be monitored more closely following the event. No further actions are necessary at the moment.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Thirty percent of Bethlehem, Connecticut's population had their appearances altered to match that of former U.S. President James A. Garfield. Victim's memories were also altered to reflect this appearance change. The event was initially discovered when all employees at a local supermarket were discovered to all resemble James A. Garfield. \n\n**Date Of Occurrence:** 5/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** Bethlehem, Connecticut, USA.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** At this time, no follow up actions can be concluded by the local police or the Foundation. No further anomalous activity was reported in the area.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A subway-train spontaneously vanished shortly after derailment. Several months later, it was discovered by a group of paleontologists buried under several kilometers of rock. The train was severely damaged and no trace of the driver or 30 passengers were found. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/4/199\u2588\n\n**Location:** Toronto, Canada\n\n**Follow-Up Actions:** The paleontologists were administered Class-A amnestics, and the train was relocated to a Foundation holding facility. Families of victims were provided cover stories of a standard train derailment. Train debris and track were examined for anomalous properties, although none were present. \n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A subway train departed from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Station in Los Angeles, California at 8:00. At 8:11 the train vanished from the tunnel and reappeared at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Station in London, England at 8:16. Upon reappearance, the train's appearance had morphed to match that of a London Underground subway train. Agents embedded in both Los Angeles and London established communications to quickly take control of the situation by establishing a perimeter around the stations and getting all who had originally boarded the train into Foundation custody.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/ 2020\n\n**Location:** Los Angeles, California and London, England\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All who had been aboard the train were interviewed, amnesticized, and taken back to Los Angeles, whereupon they were released. When interviewed, the train operator reported nothing out of the ordinary that could have caused the event. Camera footage from both stations was scrubbed. The train was removed and taken into Foundation custody where it has been monitored and studied for further anomalous properties. As of 4/19/20, none have been shown. Foundation personnel are currently working with UIU agents and British Occult Service officials to keep both stations under a 5 year monitoring period.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** All known humans situated within the general vicinity of a suburb in Seattle, Washington temporarily lost bodily autonomy and invariably maintained their forward velocity for approximately 35 seconds. These bodies were unimpeded by obstructions, with individuals intangibly passing through nearby structures. After the event had subsided, all affected individuals regained autonomy and tangibility, leading to mass cases of suffocation, with exact casualties yet to be accurately determined. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 07/16/2006\n\n**Location:** Redmond, Washington, United States\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Widespread amnesticization efforts among affected individuals and families of victims were initiated. Heads of local groups of interest were queried for a potential explanation of the event's origins, to no avail. Notably, during this period, the networks of Microsoft, headquarters located in Redmond, Washington, encountered a brief outage.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A low-frequency pitch was reported emitting from all ground sewers within a city center. Occasional flashes of light were also observed by civilians. This frequency increased in pitch until all glass constructions within close proximity of sewer entrances suddenly shattered, causing an estimated $\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 USD in property damage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Date Of Occurrence:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015\n\n**Location:** Livingston, California, United States\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All witnesses were administered Class-B amnestics. Video evidence of the event has been confiscated by the Foundation. CCTV monitors were installed around area to ensure safety of citizens.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** An entire mosasaurus skeleton materialized roughly 8 feet above the floor of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Middle School, replacing all solid objects in space it occupied, though this was mostly ceiling tiles. The subsequent weight of this added mass and loss of structural integrity quickly led to the collapse of the western roof of the building.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 05/06/2020\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Colorado, USA\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Due to quarantine measures already in place in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the school was completely unoccupied and only two civilians witnessed the event, both of whom were administered amnestics. All video footage was recovered and replaced to match a cover story of unchecked mold growth and frequent rain leading to a roof collapse. The skeleton was found to have no signs of decay and was covered in fresh, recently-deceased mosasaurus tissue, and was moved to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for temporal-paleontological research and subsequent storage. The building is to be monitored until 05/31/2025 for future anomalous occurrences.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** One //Blatta orientalis// (Oriental Cockroach) grew to a length of 1.2 meters within a civilian residence. The specimen displayed frantic behavior before fleeing the home and impacted by a passing pickup truck. The residents of the house then contacted the local authorities while passersby began taking photographs of the insect. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 05/06/20\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Iowa, USA\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents arrived shortly after the call was made and administered appropriate amnestic dosages after confiscating evidence of the event. Despite the efforts of Foundation entomologists, the cockroach perished due to breathing difficulties. Roughly 22 minutes after the cessation of life, the insect returned to average size while unobserved. The body was monitored for potential anomalous properties before disposed of via Site-\u2588\u2588's industrial incinerator.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A charred humanoid entity was seen on CCTV records logged in workplaces and industrial areas. Frequently observed to lay in a fetal position next to an indescribable organic mass for approximately five minutes before rousing and subsequently stepping onto the mass. Audio and video footage afterward damaged/deleted; corporate management denied involvement. \n\n**Date of Occurrence:** Unclear.\n\n**Location:** Worldwide\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Interrogation attempts unsuccessful. Foundation agents have been embedded within areas of such occurrences posed as civilians. All records containing the event have been confiscated and transferred to Site-\u2588\u2588 for further research. Amnestics have been administered accordingly along with regular information suppression tactics.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** On 21/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, A team of 31 researchers, sailing through the Drake passage on an expedition to Antarctica, sighted what seemed to be a surfacing submarine 10km away off the coast of Smith Island. The expedition team, confused as they hadn't been informed of any submarines in the area, attempted to contact via radio but to no avail. A look through binoculars indicated that it was a military submarine, of unknown design, displaying an unknown flag. Not long after, a bright light and thunderous roar were seen and heard as a supposed missile was launched from the distant submarine, and travelled in an easterly direction. The submarine sank back down under the waves and was not seen again. The expedition was called off subsequently.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 21/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n**Location:** 6km NW of Smith Island, Antarctica.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** The 31 researchers were interrogated individually and administered Class-A amnestics after. A covert foundation-led search team were deployed to the region to search for the rogue submarine, but found nothing after 14 months of searching. The launched missile, an SLBM, reached space and successfully deployed its stages. A single projectile, supposedly a warhead, was detected entering the atmosphere near Bouvet Island, but didn't detonate. Warhead and missile debris were never recovered. The file of this event remains in Site-\u2588\u2588 awaiting further investigation.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** The sky visible from inside Site-19 became pale red for 5 seconds, during which the text \"SQUONKIPEDIA\" in bold white lettering rapidly moved across the sky.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 09/12/2019\n\n**Location:** Site-19\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None, due to all witnesses being Foundation personnel.

None of them seemed willing to mention the event unprompted, and when questioned about it either tried to deflect to other topic, claiming disinterest, or outright refused to discuss it. Amnestics proved ineffective in removing memories of the event. However, due to the unlikeliness of them deciding to discuss it on their own accord, and the destruction of the only footage of the event, amnestic treatment has been deemed unnecessary for the time being. Witnesses are to be placed on a 5-year observation period to detect any potential changes in their behavior and/or the self-containing nature of the event.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** An as-yet unidentified woman, dressed in what witnesses described as \"steampunk-style\" clothing, was seen walking a live thylacine (//Thylacinus cynocephalus//) down a busy street.\u00a0\u00a0When approached, she was heard to warn the approaching person or persons away by saying, \"Careful, she bites,\" in a Boston accent.\u00a0\u00a0After walking the animal for twenty-five minutes, she and the animal entered a taxicab, which promptly drove away.\u00a0\u00a0It is worthy of note that the thylacine is known to have been extinct since 1936.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 4/8/2020\n\n**Location:** New York City, NY\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Cover story of a promotional event for a movie shoot circulated.\u00a0\u00a0Through questioning of eyewitnesses, the Foundation was able to trace the woman's starting point to another taxicab at the intersection of [REDACTED].\u00a0\u00a0Neither of the cabs has been identified, despite considerable effort.\u00a0\u00a0The cabs in question have not been found to belong to any taxi company in the city.\u00a0\u00a0Descriptions of the drivers have not been helpful, largely due to the fact that eyewitnesses were captivated by the strangely-dressed woman and her pet.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** A public telephone outside of an abandoned grocery store began to ring.\u00a0\u00a0A young woman picked up the receiver and heard a heavily-distorted voice say, \"Everything you thought you knew is wrong.\"\u00a0\u00a0When she asked what the voice meant, it answered by saying, \"The world is not what you think it is.\"\u00a0\u00a0Further questions did not elicit answers, only similar phrases.\u00a0\u00a0After nearly three minutes, the woman hung up the phone in frustration.\n\n**Date of Occurrence:** 6/8/2020\n\n**Location:** Miami, FL\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Telephone in question examined and discovered not to be connected to any telephone lines.\u00a0\u00a0Investigation revealed that the telephone had not been connected since 2002 and is only still in place because of a dispute about who should be responsible for its removal.\u00a0\u00a0Interviews with the woman provided no useful details; woman was amnesticized.\u00a0\u00a0Telephone placed under observation for 5 years.\n\n\n\n**Event Description:** Every human (//Homo sapiens//) on Earth simultaneously lost consciousness for approximately one second.

The shuttle whirred softly, the lights of the tunnel slashing past windows that really had no reason to exist on a purely underground vehicle. He wondered what the tram was powered by: it was incredibly fast, though he couldn't say exactly how much so. It was taking him from Vancouver to a site he was pretty certain was under the Northern Canadian Rockies, coming up from somewhere South of Seattle; the trip took less than an hour from his end. In the corner of the hushed, fluorescent-lit car, another commuter sat with his head leaning against the window, a visible trickle of drool running out the corner of his mouth. Two Agents, Turing and Ueno, sat near the front, laughing together softly. Ersen wondered idly if Ueno had asked Turing out yet, and if he ever would. That took his thoughts somewhere he'd been trying to avoid, and Ersen stared at his laptop futilely for a few more minutes.\n<p>The tram came to a scheduled stop. A Foundation squad, clad in nondescript grey security uniforms without any identifying labels, silently checked every member of the tram and all the compartments. One of them ran a small, humming sensor of some kind around the chassis. Ersen blinked involuntarily as one of the squad members flashed a camera-like device in his face without comment. After a moment, the sergeant in charge of the squad nodded, and gave the order to clear the tram.</p>\n<p>Commuting was a nuisance. Ersen was almost looking forward to living on-site. In the long run it would be a good change. He wouldn't have to keep track of a 'real life' name and a 'Foundation' name. Plus, he'd get to work with some of the potentially infectious SCPs; it had a higher risk factor, but it was more in line with his training and interest. He pushed down a morbid thought, mentally laughing at himself for being \"emo\". Maybe he'd meet a girl he didn't have to lie to, living on-site. The thought didn't seem right, at the moment, but the scientist in his head drily pointed out that he'd get used to it.</p>\n<p>Finally, after what seemed an eternity, the tram slid to a halt at the site. Ersen left with the other commuters, submitted his laptop bag for the daily security check, and submitted himself for the daily strip-search and shower. Cleaned and freshly re-clothed in a Foundation uniform and lab coat, his personal effects save his laptop stowed in his locker, he mused for a little while on how normal the idea of getting stripped and probed every morning had become.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, coffee in hand, he flopped down his office chair. He took a moment to stare blankly at a face-down photo frame and shove it further back across his desk before checking his mail. His email account had several messages, mostly cruft about various research seminars he didn't really care about. There was an anonymous note from administration; he had to go for an interview about on-site habitation in\u2026 he checked his desk clock. Five minutes ago.</p>\n<p>As he rushed to the meeting room, cursing Agents and their lack of other priorities, his coffee sloshing painfully over his hand, Ersen decided today was another shitty fucking day.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until he'd closed the door on the 'meeting room' that he realised what kind of a meeting this was. One wall of the small white cubicle was a one-way mirror, reinforced with a semitransparent mesh of some plasticky stuff. SCP-protected, even. That was probably because of the stone carving sitting on the table in the middle of the room. Ersen looked around for a moment, unsure if he should sit at the table.</p>\n<p>\"Have a seat, Doctor. The face is quite harmless unless provoked.\" The voice, distorted by some kind of software, came from all directions. Ersen noted he could not actually identify where the door he'd come in from was. In the bright ambient light of the room, even the walls, floor, and ceiling were difficult to recognise. He found his eyes adjusting to the glare until it felt like all he could see was the chair, the table and carving, and the mirror. He wished this was an unfamiliar sensation.</p>\n<p>\"What's the occasion for all the pomp,\" Ersen inquired, keeping his voice as steady as possible. \"I thought this was about getting an apartment.\" He wasn't frightened, really, just annoyed. For the last few weeks he'd managed to lose himself in his research, and something in his gut told him he wasn't going to be allowed to shove his memories away for this.</p>\n<p>\"Living on-site comprises more than a simple apartment, Doctor Ersen, and we need to check for that. More to the point, however, your supervisors have requested a performance evaluation in light of recent events in your life.\" The voice was so dry it could have been a computer. For all Ersen knew, it was.</p>\n<p>\"Oh for fuck's sake. It's trivial. My work's been fine since\u2026 that. I've nearly cracked that fingernail SCP. Surely my work speaks for itself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doctor, please examine the SCP in front of you.\" Ersen did. It was a face with a sunburst effect around it, carved into some kind of stone, marble maybe. Looked Italian, and old. It had a wide, gaping mouth; Ersen was pretty sure he could see flecks of blood around it. \"You're right handed, yes? Please place your left hand inside the mouth of the SCP.\"</p>\n<p>Ersen hesitated. He was pretty confident there was no reason for them to try to trick him. He really had been doing good work, and he didn't think he'd stepped on anyone's toes. Sighing, he complied. The face didn't react.</p>\n<p>\"You are presently compelled to tell the truth. Should you attempt dishonesty, the SCP in front of you will remove your hand. At any point you may remove your hand without harm. However, be aware that this will reflect on your performance report.\"</p>\n<p>Great. A hand-chopping lie detector. Where the hell did they get this stuff? At least that mind-reading camera didn't dismember you. Ersen blinked once, slowly, then nodded. \"I will tell you the truth, then.\" After saying it, he panicked for a moment, wondering if the thing was meta enough to punish possible abstractions like that, but nothing happened. Good.</p>\n<p>There followed a dry battery of tests much like he'd expect from a normal lie detector. When were you born, where do you live, what's your office number; nothing interesting. Finally they got to the meat of the interview. Ersen's hand was tingling from the awkward position he was holding it in.</p>\n<p>\"How long have you worked for the Foundation?\"</p>\n<p>\"Good question, Voice. I suppose in practice, probably over fifteen years. I didn't realise I was doing SCP-related research when I worked for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans during my postgraduate work. I've been an active Foundation researcher for eleven years, though. Put me through med school.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is your security clearance?\"</p>\n<p>\"Level three.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you have any family outside the site?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just my wi\u2014\" Ersen stopped, realising he'd almost lost his hand. \"My ex-wife. I was divorced last week. Jesus. Are you trying to make me an amputee?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Doctor, calm down. I'm sure the SCP would have understood your mistake.\" The voice had a touch of amusement that faded almost instantly. \"What was the nature of your relationship to your wife, before the divorce?\"</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck, Voice? It was a marriage, what do you think?\"</p>\n<p>\"Please answer the question.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was married to her. I saw her most evenings after work. She thought I still worked for the hospital. Couple of months ago, she found out I didn't. I guess the Foundation didn't want to spend the cash to maintain my cover story.\" Ersen almost spit the words. \"Or maybe their story just wasn't good enough. She thought I was using the job to cover an affair. My supervisors refused clearance to inform her of what my real work was, so she divorced me. It sucked. I have a diary if you want to read the names of all the girls I like out loud in front of class, too.\" That one was carefully chosen: he really did have a diary.</p>\n<p>\"That won't be necessary, Doctor. How do you feel about your divorce?\"</p>\n<p>\"Angry, obviously.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please elaborate.\"</p>\n<p>Ersen snarled quickly at the mirror. \"Have you ever been married, Voice?\"</p>\n<p>\"Please stick to the topic at hand, Doctor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck you. I'm angry. When I entered the Foundation, I was led to understand it would have my back. There was a cover established for me at my old job. I could come and go from work at normal hours. Aside from a few twitches, there wasn't supposed to be anything different. I mean, sure, I'm autopsying the creature from the black fucking lagoon, but that's the only difference, right? I've toed the line, I've done my bit, I haven't acted on my concerns about this job, and as soon as I need help from the Foundation, it bails on me. How the fuck do you think I feel?\"</p>\n<p>\"Please elaborate on what you said about 'acting on concerns'.\"</p>\n<p>Ersen knew that would come up, but he didn't care anymore. Maybe they'd terminate him, maybe they'd dose him with Class A's until he forgot how to piss and turn him out on the street, it really didn't matter. \"Take a wild stab. I took the Hippocratic oath, you cocksucker. You think I'm happy putting D-classes into a sealed room with something that's going to make\u2026 make jam out of their bones or something?\" He was running out of clever phrases, that was bad. He tried to cool down. \"I do what I have to because I know the Foundation's goals are vital to the survival of humanity. Not because I like what the Foundation does.\"</p>\n<p>The Voice was silent for a moment. Ersen imagined a faceless interrogator in the dark room on the other side of the mirror, quietly flipping through his files, making notes. Circling decisions. Finally it spoke again.</p>\n<p>\"Would you consider it accurate to say you hate the Foundation?\"</p>\n<p>It was Ersen's turn to be silent for a moment. Finally, he shrugged. \"Yes, I think I would. I hate it, and what it has made me into.\"</p>\n<p>\"Under what situation do you see yourself betraying the Foundation?\" That was it. Not 'would you', but 'when would you'. Ersen wondered who'd carry out the termination. Maybe they'd feed him to that chocolate fountain\u2026 he'd been wondering what that thing tasted like.</p>\n<p>\"If I was offered a position by a similar group, capable of carrying out the same work but without the violence and sacrifice, I'd betray the Foundation in a heartbeat.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you betray the Foundation if it meant getting your ex-wife back?\"</p>\n<p>Ersen frowned, thinking. They'd blindsided him a bit, he hadn't really expected that, but now he realised he should have. \"No, I don't think I would.\" Admitting it out loud left him with a dry taste in his mouth and a strange feeling in his gut, like his organs were falling off a precipice. The Voice was silent for what seemed like a long time, although it may only have been a few seconds.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor, are you aware that your ex-wife was interrogated by Foundation agents one month prior to the events leading to your divorce?\"</p>\n<p>That was a surprise. Yes, he was. He remembered her coming home, fuzzy on how she'd spent her day. Needlemarks in her neck and arms. A migraine for two days. Other side effects: dizziness, cramps, consistent with repeated dosage of class-A amnestics in combination with Formula 3614-10, a truth serum he'd helped design. Of course he was aware.</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Under interrogation, your wife was informed of your employment. Would you like to know how she responded?\"</p>\n<p>\"You asswipe. You fucking asswipe. You fuck\u2026\" Ersen took his hand out of the SCP and stood up, looking for the concealed door. Some perverse part of his brain decided to focus on his hand being on pins-and-needles from the SCP's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor, this interrogation is not over.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, it is. What else do you want from me? You ruined my marriage, and you already know I'm not going to spill your secrets. Terminate me, pump me full of amnestics, I don't care. We're done.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doctor,\" the Voice, irritatingly, just sounded faintly amused again. \"I apologise for any misunderstanding. I had meant to offer you that information as a reward. The Foundation is willing, in light of this interview, to approve your request to live on-site. In addition, you will be promoted to probationary level 4 authorisation and given command of a small research group, under monitoring for future permanent promotion to level four.\"</p>\n<p>Ersen stopped, glaring at the mirror. \"I don't know who you are, but you're an ass.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dislike of Foundation supervisors is considered a tradition of the organisation.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do I want to know what she said?\"</p>\n<p>\"I honestly don't know, Doctor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine. Spill.\"</p>\n<p>\"Under interrogation, your wife was disturbed and frightened by your employment. It was clear you had maintained complete secrecy; she had absolutely no idea what you really did. Despite the administration of amnestics, she remained disconcerted. We believe this caused her prying into your work; although your cover was perfectly secure, she continued to pry in an obsessive manner. In order to preserve Foundation security and your ex-wife's mental health, we created a secondary cover, that you were cheating on her. Since discovering this, her mental health has returned to normal and she has shown no further obsession with uncovering your secrets.\"</p>\n<p>Ersen mulled silently over the news. Finally, wordlessly, he kicked the area where he was sure the door was. It swung open. On the other side, the hallway looked dark compared to the interrogation room. The Voice didn't try to stop him.</p>\n<p>Waiting on his computer was a memo with his new office number and a list of researchers under him.

The shuttle whirred softly, the lights of the tunnel slashing past windows that really had no reason to exist on a purely underground vehicle. He wondered what the tram was powered by: it was incredibly fast, though he couldn't say exactly how much so. It was taking him from Vancouver to a site he was pretty certain was under the Northern Canadian Rockies, coming up from somewhere South of Seattle; the trip took less than an hour from his end. In the corner of the hushed, fluorescent-lit car, another commuter sat with his head leaning against the window, a visible trickle of drool running out the corner of his mouth. Two Agents, Turing and Ueno, sat near the front, laughing together softly. Ersen wondered idly if Ueno had asked Turing out yet, and if he ever would. That took his thoughts somewhere he'd been trying to avoid, and Ersen stared at his laptop futilely for a few more minutes.\n\n\n\nThe tram came to a scheduled stop. A Foundation squad, clad in nondescript grey security uniforms without any identifying labels, silently checked every member of the tram and all the compartments. One of them ran a small, humming sensor of some kind around the chassis. Ersen blinked involuntarily as one of the squad members flashed a camera-like device in his face without comment. After a moment, the sergeant in charge of the squad nodded, and gave the order to clear the tram.\n\n\n\nCommuting was a nuisance. Ersen was almost looking forward to living on-site. In the long run it would be a good change. He wouldn't have to keep track of a 'real life' name and a 'Foundation' name. Plus, he'd get to work with some of the potentially infectious SCPs; it had a higher risk factor, but it was more in line with his training and interest. He pushed down a morbid thought, mentally laughing at himself for being \"emo\". Maybe he'd meet a girl he didn't have to lie to, living on-site. The thought didn't seem right, at the moment, but the scientist in his head drily pointed out that he'd get used to it.\n\n\n\nFinally, after what seemed an eternity, the tram slid to a halt at the site. Ersen left with the other commuters, submitted his laptop bag for the daily security check, and submitted himself for the daily strip-search and shower. Cleaned and freshly re-clothed in a Foundation uniform and lab coat, his personal effects save his laptop stowed in his locker, he mused for a little while on how normal the idea of getting stripped and probed every morning had become.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, coffee in hand, he flopped down his office chair. He took a moment to stare blankly at a face-down photo frame and shove it further back across his desk before checking his mail. His email account had several messages, mostly cruft about various research seminars he didn't really care about. There was an anonymous note from administration; he had to go for an interview about on-site habitation in... he checked his desk clock.

The man looked at her, his mustache twitching slightly. He pulled a file from under his arm, and dropped it on her desk. She looked down at the large, red stamp in the corner.</p>\n<p>Her head craned back up slowly, calculatingly. \"Termination orders? For who?\"</p>\n<p>\"You, of course,\" he replied, reaching into his suit pocket.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Timothy Burns got up from his desk and stretched, looking at the clock on the corner. He was surprised to see how late it'd gotten, especially since he was supposed to meet with\u2014</p>\n<p>'Oh, fuck me,' he thought, jumping around the desk and rushing toward the door. 'I can't believe I forgot about this\u2026'</p>\n<p>He dashed down the hallway, narrowly dodging two security guards eating cake, reaching for the doorknob and throwing it open.</p>\n<p>The office was empty, freshly painted with new carpeting. It reeked of redecorating. He leaned backwards, looking over the door at an empty spot where a placard had been. A tiny part of him leaped with joy at the prospect of having an excuse for being late. He closed the door and looked around, stopping a passing Junior Researcher.</p>\n<p>\"Can you tell me where Doctor Rights' office is at? I didn't realize she was having hers redecorated.\"</p>\n<p>The researcher looked up at him, setting down her fork on her plate. \"Who?\"</p>\n<p>\"Rights. Agatha Rights. She used to be in here,\" he said, gesturing toward the door. \"Now, I can't find her, and I'm late, and she's usually very easily irritated.\"</p>\n<p>The researched looked at him sympathetically. \"I'm sorry. I just can't help you.\"</p>\n<p>Burns sighed and turned, hurrying down the hallway. One of the sector supervisors secretaries should be able to help him. He passed through several hallways, glancing occasionally and looking for her name on one of the doors.</p>\n<p>He stopped, eventually, at the desk of a stern looking woman in her early forties. Burns gave a sigh of relief, smiling and nodding at the woman who, after she finished a bite of her dessert, looked up at him questioningly.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry to be a bother,\" said Burns \"but I'm looking for Doctor Rights. Her office is being redecorated, and I don't know where she relocated to.\"</p>\n<p>The secretary nodded, and reached for a large, white binder. \"A new researcher to the site?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>Burns cocked an eyebrow. \"No, she's been here for years, now. Rights. Senior Staff.\"</p>\n<p>The woman looked at him distrustfully, her finger running down the page. She eventually stopped, looking up at him smugly.</p>\n<p>\"There is no Doctor Rights on the Site-19 roster.\"</p>\n<p>Burns frowned.</p>\n<p>\"Are you sure?\"</p>\n<p>The woman spun the book around with the skill of one accustomed to such questions and laid it at the front of the desk. Burns looked down the list, frowning. It went straight from Rath, to Rapp, to Sharp.</p>\n<p>He turned away from the desk, muttering an absent minded thanks, as the wheels in his head began to turn. There was no way she had been transferred. Any transfer would have required some sort of approval, a transfer of records, probably a party in Agatha's case.</p>\n<p>In a few minutes, he'd returned to his office. As he walked in and turned, preparing to put his coat on the hook by the door, his eyes passed over his scheduling calendar. The day was blank.</p>\n<p>Something had happened, something had gotten loose, broken free. Something had happened to her.</p>\n<p>His mind whirled with the different possibilities. He ran through the SCPs he knew she was working on: the weird surgeon, the tiny pterodactyl, nothing that could cause this. A temporal anomaly? Probably not, as he wouldn't remember her at all then. Maybe it had something to do with\u2014</p>\n<p>A sharp knock on his door broke his reverie. He walked toward it cautiously, carefully turning the lock and peering out into the hallway.</p>\n<p>A slender, young woman with purple eyes looked back at him, smiling in her Foundation fatigues. \"Dr. Burns?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" he answered quietly.</p>\n<p>\"Your mail, sir,\" she said, holding up a pile of envelopes and memos. \"You should really come down to the mail room to get it, sometime.\"</p>\n<p>\"We have a mail room?\" asked Burns.</p>\n<p>She smiled, shrugging her shoulders.</p>\n<p>She made to slide the letters through the crack in the door. \"No!\" yelled Burns, starting her. He looked at the pile of mail in her hand and back at her. 'Of course,' he thought. 'A memetic.'</p>\n<p>\"How do I know you're legit?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>Apparently, she'd been there long enough to get used to this question. \"Listen,\" she said. \"I'm just going to put his down here.\" She gestured toward the floor. \"You can get it whenever you like.\"</p>\n<p>Burns eyes twitched through the crack. \"Fine. Fine, that's fine,\" he said, watching as she slowly lowered the pile of envelopes to the ground, took a slow step back, and turned away from the door, moving at a brisk gait back down the hallway.</p>\n<p>Burns opened the door and poked the stack of letters slowly with his foot before jerking it back again. He repeated this process a few times before carefully stepping over the letters into the hallway, watching them. He sidled down the hall, carefully keeping watch on them as he moved toward the corner.</p>\n<p>He took another, long hard stare at the pile of envelopes and dashed around the corner, running headlong into a hoard of butterflies.</p>\n<p>He nearly inhaled one before stumbling out of the swarm, leaning himself against a wall as he coughed. He felt a hand slapping him hard on the back, followed by a deep laughter.</p>\n<p>\"Burns, do try not to eat the SCPs,\" smirked Kondraki, laughing as the bald man standing next to him looked at Burns impassively.</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright, Doctor Burns?\" asked Dr. Gears.</p>\n<p>\"Gears!\" he cried, \"Thank God. Listen, I think something is wrong. I can't find Rights! Something has happened. No one I talk to remembers her at all!\"</p>\n<p>Gears set down his plate and walked closer to Burns. \"Are you alright, Doctor?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine! I'm perfectly fine! One minute, I'm scheduled to meet with her, and the next she's gone! I can't find her!\"</p>\n<p>Kondraki licked his fork and turned his head sideways. \"Who are you talking about, Burns?\"</p>\n<p>Burns felt the blood drain from his face. His eyes narrowed. \"They got to you.\"</p>\n<p>Gears turned and looked at Kondraki, who shrugged in return.</p>\n<p>\"They got to you two, too, didn't they?\" screamed Burns.</p>\n<p>Kondraki smiled. \"Too much stress, Burns? Did your imaginary friend run away?\"</p>\n<p>Burns felt himself backing away. This had to be a joke. It had to.</p>\n<p>\"This is because I put that Class-D's hand in her chair, isn't it?\" he yelled. \"I swear, I thought she'd notice before she sat down! Seriously, this is getting ridiculous!\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright, Doctor? Would you like a mild sedative?\" asked Gears.</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck is going on?!\" scream Burns, his eyes wide. \"What the hell is wrong with you people? What happened to Agatha?!\"</p>\n<p>Kondraki and Gears both took short steps toward Burns, who found himself backing away faster, eyes twitching. \"Don't touch me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm afraid I do not understand what the problem is, Doctor Burns.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, Burns, have you been dipping into company assets?\"</p>\n<p>Burns pulled away from them, twisting. \"Get BACK!\" he barked, sharply, feeling his way along the wall. He felt the cold, stainless steel of the cafeteria doors, and turned sharply, running into them, looking to escape whatever had managed to free itself and\u2014</p>\n<p>\"Burns? What's the problem?\"</p>\n<p>Burns was standing in a pile of confetti, looking across a nearly empty room at a woman in a smart, sharp business suit. She smiled, winningly, and waved at him.</p>\n<p>\"Agatha?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Burns! I wasn't sure you'd make it.\"</p>\n<p>Burns walked forward, half tempted to reach out and poke her to make sure she was there. \"Agatha?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Burns. You almost forgot to come to my party!\"</p>\n<p>\"Party? What\u2026 what party?\"</p>\n<p>\"My birthday, Burns. I sent you an invitation and everything.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I\u2026 I must not have gotten it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Here,\" she said. \"Have a piece of cake.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Burns walked out of the cafeteria, smiling and chewing. It really was very good cake. He saw Kondraki and Gears staring at him, waved cheerily, and continued eating. He was supposed to meet with\u2026 with somebody this afternoon. He'd have to check his calendar.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>O5-2 sat down in her chair, looking at the monitor, drumming her fingers softly on the chair's leather arm. With a few quick keystrokes, she completed the process. Agatha Rights was quite thoroughly expunged from the Foundation. She smiled, leaning back into the comfortably overstuffed chair. 'Weird way to get promoted,' she thought. 'Killing yourself.' She laughed. Only one thing left to do.</p>\n<p>She reached over for the plate and picked it up, happily sinking her fork through the creamy chocolate frosting.</p>\n<p>It really was very good cake.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/many-happy-regards\">Many Happy Regards</a>\" by TroyL, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

You are correct, however, in that it is considerably more probable that our allochronous equivalents //are// running a Project Turtledove of their own.\"\n\n\n\nKondraki got up from his chair. \"So that's it, then? Looks like a major security breach from an alternate timeline, but it's actually just us reading over our own shoulders. Nothing to worry about and we can leave now. Right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh... I'm, I'm sorry, Dr. Kondraki, but there's ... more.\"\n\n\n\nKondraki sat down again. \"For fuck's sake. Okay, Northrop. What else do you want to tell us about alternate timeline R-zayin-H-whatever?\"\n\n\n\nNorthrop closed his eyes, chose his next five words very carefully so as to avoid stammering, and then spoke.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think we're real.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n//to be continued//\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "cosmic-horror", "doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-gerald", "doctor-kondraki", "doctor-rights", "featured", "horror", "kain-pathos-crow", "metafiction", "tale"], "title": "Metafiction - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/metafiction", "year": 2010}, "meteor": {"created_at": "2010-05-14T19:18:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-14T19:18:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-15T00:46:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "A few a -> an, in to -> into, typoes, capitalization.", "date": "2010-06-01T22:19:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

What's more, the crater hadn't overflown, which meant the hell-rock had popped into another line of some kind, or a natural cave\u2026or god forbid, some kind of underground river.

He moved his hand a bit closer to the massive stone, thinking it was some vague trick of the current, when he finally noticed where most of the smoke was coming from. The billowing, black column of smoke wasn't issuing from the oil\u2026but from the top of the stone. Four great holes were belching the fumes to the sky from inside the stony orb.

Serial number nine four two\u2014\"</p>\n<p>The butt of the revolver cracked against his jaw, hard. Sergeant Allenby laughed bitterly as he spat out a broken tooth onto the packed dirt floor. \"If you break my jaw, I won't be able to tell you anything,\" he sneered.</p>\n<p>The man cocked the hammer of the revolver and placed the cold steel muzzle against the Marine's forehead. \"You will tell me everything!\" the man growled. \"Starting with how your little patrol managed to find this place!\"</p>\n<p>\"Sergeant Thomas Allenby, serial number\u2014\"</p>\n<p>The gun fired. Allenby screamed in pain, then laughed out loud, his voice shaky with pain and manic shock. \"FUCK!\" he screamed. \"The fucking LEG!? Are you crazy? Hit the femoral artery and you'll kill me in seconds, then you'll never get anything out of me!\"</p>\n<p>\"You will tell me what I want to know, or the next bullet goes in your brain!\" screamed the man.</p>\n<p>\"FUCK you!\" Allenby shouted. \"You fucked up! You shouldn't'a shot me! Now I know you're fucking bluffing! You can't kill me, I'm the only one who knows what you want to know, you slopehead gook motherfuck\u2014\"</p>\n<p>The revolver was cocked again. The muzzle was placed back against Allenby's forehead. The man took up the slack on the trigger. Allenby knew that he should be afraid, but pain, shock, and adrenaline were conspiring against him. All he could do was laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Dai Ta?!\" someone shouted. A newcomer. He was jabbering something in Vietnamese, too fast for Allenby to understand. The colonel chuckled in response. Something exchanged hands.</p>\n<p>\"It seems,\" smirked the colonel, \"That I have a reason to keep you alive a little longer.\" He thrust a manila envelope into Allenby's face. \"What is this?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I don't know,\" Allenby said, staring past the envelope into the colonel's eyes. \"I've never seen it before in my life.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lies!\" growled the colonel. \"It was in your backpack! And more\u2026\" He turned the envelope around. \"Do you see this? This is the symbol of your Central Intelligence Agency!\"</p>\n<p>Oh shit. For the first time since the Viet Cong had captured him, Allenby was afraid.</p>\n<p>\"I have\u2026 I don't know what you mean,\" Allenby protested.</p>\n<p>\"More lies! You are no soldier, you are an American spy!\" He struck Allenby across the face with the packet of papers in frustration. \"I ask you again. How did you find these tunnels?\"</p>\n<p>\"A map\u2026\" Allenby said, then immediately bit his tongue in frustration.</p>\n<p>\"A map\u2026 Ah\u2026 I see.\" The colonel laughed cruelly. \"Very clever of you Americans.\" He shuffled the papers together. \"Doubtless, if I line up this triangle with this\u2026\"</p>\n<p>His voice stopped abruptly. Allenby smiled.</p>\n<p>\"Sir?\" one of the guards asked.</p>\n<p>\"Tuan,\" the colonel said slowly, then something in Vietnamese. Probably, \"Come take a look at this.\"</p>\n<p>After that, things got a bit chaotic.</p>\n<p>Allenby didn't see what happened next. He could barely even hear it through the heavy cell door. He didn't have to. He already knew.</p>\n<p>He knew that the confused murmuring that turned into panicked shouts were the colonel and the guard forcing some poor sap to view The Image.</p>\n<p>He knew that the scratching sounds were an infected individual scratching The Image into a wall, with a knife or a key.</p>\n<p>He knew, when the screaming started, that the infection had gone terminal.</p>\n<p>It was half an hour after the dying started when the colonel burst back into the room. He was waving the packet of papers in Allenby's face. \"LOOK AT THIS!\" he screamed. \"LOOK AT THIS, PLEASE!\"</p>\n<p>Allenby just closed his eyes and smiled. \"Sergeant Allenby, ser\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"LOOK, DAMN YOU, LOOK!\" The colonel forced Allenby's eye open with his fingers and pushed the image into his face. \"LOOK, PLEASE, for the love of GOD!\"</p>\n<p>Allenby smirked. The smirk became a low giggle. \"You never noticed,\" he said, shaking his head. \"You never noticed\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Then the colonel did notice. Both Allenby's eyes were glass.</p>\n<p>Allenby heard the colonel go for his gun, heard him try to cock the revolver, but the man's palsied hands were shaking too hard for that. He heard the gun clatter to the floor.</p>\n<p>It took the man a long time to die. Allenby enjoyed hearing every moment of it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Some time had passed.</p>\n<p>The underground tunnel complex was now a charnel house. The dead and dying lay everywhere.</p>\n<p>Allenby staggered through the tunnels, the manila envelope with the two halves of The Image (carefully realigned to the \"safe\" configuration) tucked into his belt. He was using a discarded enemy AK-47 as a makeshift walking stick. Every once in a while, he paused to listen and to feel for air currents.</p>\n<p>It took him a long time to find the exit.</p>\n<p>He emerged from the stuffy dankness of the tunnels into the oppressive humidity of the Vietnamese jungle. He sighed happily, feeling the sun on his face.</p>\n<p>There was a rustling in the undergrowth. He turned. \"Nolan?\" he asked, expecting to hear the calm voice of his pick-up.</p>\n<p>Instead, there were two sharp clicks, like a typewriter. Two silenced .22 caliber bullets ended his life.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>\"\u2026 what is this?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I believe you already know what this is.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Looks like a bunch of lines.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"It does.

Serial number nine four two--\"\n\n\n\nThe butt of the revolver cracked against his jaw, hard. Sergeant Allenby laughed bitterly as he spat out a broken tooth onto the packed dirt floor. \"If you break my jaw, I won't be able to tell you anything,\" he sneered.\n\n\n\nThe man cocked the hammer of the revolver and placed the cold steel muzzle against the Marine's forehead. \"You will tell me everything!\" the man growled. \"Starting with how your little patrol managed to find this place!\"\n\n\n\n\"Sergeant Thomas Allenby, serial number--\"\n\n\n\nThe gun fired. Allenby screamed in pain, then laughed out loud, his voice shaky with pain and manic shock. \"FUCK!\" he screamed. \"The fucking LEG!? Are you crazy? Hit the femoral artery and you'll kill me in seconds, then you'll never get anything out of me!\"\n\n\n\n\"You will tell me what I want to know, or the next bullet goes in your brain!\" screamed the man.\n\n\n\n\"FUCK you!\" Allenby shouted. \"You fucked up! You shouldn't'a shot me! Now I know you're fucking bluffing! You can't kill me, I'm the only one who knows what you want to know, you slopehead gook motherfuck--\"\n\n\n\nThe revolver was cocked again. The muzzle was placed back against Allenby's forehead. The man took up the slack on the trigger. Allenby knew that he should be afraid, but pain, shock, and adrenaline were conspiring against him. All he could do was laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Dai Ta?!\" someone shouted. A newcomer. He was jabbering something in Vietnamese, too fast for Allenby to understand. The colonel chuckled in response. Something exchanged hands.\n\n\n\n\"It seems,\" smirked the colonel, \"That I have a reason to keep you alive a little longer.\" He thrust a manila envelope into Allenby's face. \"What is this?\" \n\n\n\n\"I. . . I don't know,\" Allenby said, staring past the envelope into the colonel's eyes. \"I've never seen it before in my life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lies!\" growled the colonel. \"It was in your backpack! And more. . .\" He turned the envelope around. \"Do you see this? This is the symbol of your Central Intelligence Agency!\"\n\n\n\nOh shit. For the first time since the Viet Cong had captured him, Allenby was afraid.\n\n\n\n\"I have. . . I don't know what you mean,\" Allenby protested.\n\n\n\n\"More lies! You are no soldier, you are an American spy!\" He struck Allenby across the face with the packet of papers in frustration. \"I ask you again. How did you find these tunnels?\"\n\n\n\n\"A map. . .\" Allenby said, then immediately bit his tongue in frustration. \n\n\n\n\"A map. . . Ah. . . I see.\" The colonel laughed cruelly. \"Very clever of you Americans.\" He shuffled the papers together. \"Doubtless, if I line up this triangle with this. . .\"\n\n\n\nHis voice stopped abruptly. Allenby smiled.\n\n\n\n\"Sir?\" one of the guards asked.\n\n\n\n\"Tuan,\" the colonel said slowly, then something in Vietnamese. Probably, \"Come take a look at this.\"\n\n\n\nAfter that, things got a bit chaotic.\n\n\n\nAllenby didn't see what happened next. He could barely even hear it through the heavy cell door. He didn't have to. He already knew.\n\n\n\nHe knew that the confused murmuring that turned into panicked shouts were the colonel and the guard forcing some poor sap to view The Image.\n\n\n\nHe knew that the scratching sounds were an infected individual scratching The Image into a wall, with a knife or a key.\n\n\n\nHe knew, when the screaming started, that the infection had gone terminal.\n\n\n\nIt was half an hour after the dying started when the colonel burst back into the room. He was waving the packet of papers in Allenby's face. \"LOOK AT THIS!\" he screamed. \"LOOK AT THIS, PLEASE!\"\n\n\n\nAllenby just closed his eyes and smiled. \"Sergeant Allenby, ser--\"\n\n\n\n\"LOOK, DAMN YOU, LOOK!\" The colonel forced Allenby's eye open with his fingers and pushed the image into his face. \"LOOK, PLEASE, for the love of GOD!\"\n\n\n\nAllenby smirked. The smirk became a low giggle. \"You never noticed,\" he said, shaking his head. \"You never noticed. . .\"\n\n\n\nThen the colonel did notice. Both Allenby's eyes were glass.\n\n\n\nAllenby heard the colonel go for his gun, heard him try to cock the revolver, but the man's palsied hands were shaking too hard for that. He heard the gun clatter to the floor. \n\n\n\nIt took the man a long time to die. Allenby enjoyed hearing every moment of it.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nSome time had passed. \n\n\n\nThe underground tunnel complex was now a charnel house. The dead and dying lay everywhere.\n\n\n\nAllenby staggered through the tunnels, the manila envelope with the two halves of The Image (carefully realigned to the \"safe\" configuration) tucked into his belt. He was using a discarded enemy AK-47 as a makeshift walking stick. Every once in a while, he paused to listen and to feel for air currents.\n\n\n\nIt took him a long time to find the exit.\n\n\n\nHe emerged from the stuffy dankness of the tunnels into the oppressive humidity of the Vietnamese jungle. He sighed happily, feeling the sun on his face.\n\n\n\nThere was a rustling in the undergrowth. He turned. \"Nolan?\" he asked, expecting to hear the calm voice of his pick-up.\n\n\n\nInstead, there were two sharp clicks, like a typewriter. Two silenced .22 caliber bullets ended his life.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n//\". . . what is this?\"//\n\n\n\n//\"I believe you already know what this is.\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Looks like a bunch of lines.\"//\n\n\n\n//\"It does. But if you place this plastic overlay over--\"//\n\n\n\n//\"WAIT! STOP!\"//\n\n\n\n//\". . . it's a fake. So you do know what this is.\"//\n\n\n\n//\". . .\"//\n\n\n\n//\"I do have to admit, your delivery method is diabolically clever. A blind operative, trained to compensate for his disability, used to handle a dangerous object that kills when seen. My higher-ups were fascinated by this. We may adapt this idea for our own purposes.\"//\n\n\n\n//\". . . damn you. . .\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Allow me to repeat the warning I gave you when you first assumed this position, Mister Schlesinger. Do not meddle with what you don't understand. Otherwise, there is a high probability you will find your tenure here short, and unpopular.\"//\n\n\n\n//\". . . damn it, you people don't get it, do you? We're fighting for the sake of the free world here! If the damned Reds take over Indochina, that'll collapse the entire Pacific. . .\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Ah, yes, your vaunted domino theory. I will be blunt, sir. An ideological conflict between two mere nations, even two as powerful as yours, is of no consequence to us. We have little interest in saving the ''free world'' at the cost of the actual world.\"//\n\n\n\n//\". . .\"//\n\n\n\n//\"Here is my ultimatum: cease and desist all of your efforts towards PROJECT OMEGA immediately. We want it all shut down and disavowed. MK Ultra. Groom Lake. Even that little project in Philadelphia. An auditor from our Foundation will come by in a few weeks to check on your progress. Good day.\"//\n\n\n\n<click>\n\n\n\n//\". . . holy shit. Miss Jones, could you please hop down to the corner store and buy me a carton of cigarettes and a fifth of bourbon, please. . . oh, and contact Building Security. I want a camera set up outside my office door. . . oh. To watch out for vandals. . .\"//\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"What have you got there?\" Crow asked. The young researcher looked up from his newspaper, where he was circling various stories with a red pen. So far, he seemed most interested in rumors of an artist's project gone bad. Apparently the statue had come to life and started killing people. . .\n\n\n\n\"Not much,\" Cog said. The young man hung up his trilby hat and jacket on the coat-tree. Unlike Crow, whose desk was a complete pigsty, his side of the small office they shared was clean and neat, almost mechanical in its precision. \"I took a trip up to Langley to give the CIA Director a message from The Administrator. I believe it went well.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you bring me back a souvenir?\" Crow asked, grinning. \n\n\n\n\"My travel budget included no allowances for personal purchases,\" Cog pointed out.\n\n\n\n\"You've got no heart,\" Crow sighed. \"Oh yeah.

The nurse had pressed the tip of the needle to his skin, and as it broke the flesh, every nerve in his body lit on fire. His wild, enraged backhand had caught her right across the jaw, the animalistic, pained bellows coming out of his mouth drowning out the noise of her neck snapping like so much dry cordwood. It had taken ten men to hold him down, and the sedatives had been another bonfire of agony coursing throughout his system.</p>\n<p>They never said it would be like this. When he\u2019d signed up for the enhancile treatments he was promised that he would be faster, stronger, invincible. He would be a god, no, a titan, striding through the battlefield, laying waste to anything that dared to cross his path. Day Four was spent having his contract explained to him. In all his frenzied daydreaming he had missed the part of the contract that said, in the finest small print military dollars could buy, \u2018Mark I Serum is still in alpha testing phase\u2019. In English that came out \u2018we fucked up and when we boosted your muscles, we also heightened your senses, to the point where every breath of air is burning pain\u2019. His gratitude had been overflowing, then, later; it had just been a rage fueled punch to a doctor\u2019s face, interrupting some bullshit explanation about how it wasn\u2019t their fault.</p>\n<p>In the middle of day five there had been talk: talk of \u2018testosterone overproduction\u2019, and \u2018exponential aggressiveness growth\u2019. Brian found he was beyond caring as his fists drove into the concrete, splinters puncturing, pain searing up his arms. Pain was good. He liked the pain now. It made all that beautiful red appear in front of his eyes. He could lose himself in it. Drown out the screaming, (and it was screaming now, someone was very frightened, maybe of him, and Brian laughed in his chest at the thought as the men in the other room went dead quiet) about \u2018mutagen coalescence\u2019 and how this was all Thomson\u2019s goddamn fault.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t cared. By day six, everything had gotten so very simple. He'd wanted food, so he'd hunted down a scientist and bit off a piece. His head felt different, like there was more bone there. The red fog never went away and his thoughts drifted across it as the soldiers poured into the room. The first few bullets lodged in his chest, the force absorbed by the spiny plates growing just under the skin. He had swung one massive hand, ridged with white protruding bone, and pulverized a helmet. The men at the end of the hall had screamed about backup and how \u2018firebreak\u2019 needed to be used. He ignored it, with all the men firing at him it had seemed unimportant, and the red whispered to him how good it would feel to just take the tattered remains of his skin off and let his muscles breathe. It was only when he ran out of soldiers that he looked around. The idea of retreat no longer had any place in his fury-soaked brain. He\u2019d run through the halls of the base and roared, daring them to challenge him. The beeping echoing was just another distraction. He ignored it.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of this, the slow inability to breathe and the soft fall into blackout from oxygen starvation was less surprising than the fact that he could still die.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Goddamn mess. The whole thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Look General, we said-\"</p>\n<p>\"You said it was goddamn safe! That we would have a working prototype in a year, and mass-production in two more!\"</p>\n<p>\"And we thought we were right! No one could have foreseen that, that THING being created!\"</p>\n<p>\"That's your fucking job isn't it?! To think ahead! Not to fuck up so badly we have to pump halon into the goddamn vents! And don't tell me that's nothing to worry about! You were five seconds from dying yourself you little shit!\"</p>\n<p>\"We'll figure a way to explain this all away. We'll be fine-\"</p>\n<p>\"No. There is no 'We'.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026You're not seriously suggest-\"</p>\n<p>\"It's either I throw you to the dogs, or we all get nine-millimeter retirements.

The nurse had pressed the tip of the needle to his skin, and as it broke the flesh, every nerve in his body lit on fire. His wild, enraged backhand had caught her right across the jaw, the animalistic, pained bellows coming out of his mouth drowning out the noise of her neck snapping like so much dry cordwood. It had taken ten men to hold him down, and the sedatives had been another bonfire of agony coursing throughout his system.\n\n\n\nThey never said it would be like this. When he\u2019d signed up for the enhancile treatments he was promised that he would be faster, stronger, invincible. He would be a god, no, a titan, striding through the battlefield, laying waste to anything that dared to cross his path. Day Four was spent having his contract explained to him. In all his frenzied daydreaming he had missed the part of the contract that said, in the finest small print military dollars could buy, \u2018Mark I Serum is still in alpha testing phase\u2019. In English that came out \u2018we fucked up and when we boosted your muscles, we also heightened your senses, to the point where every breath of air is burning pain\u2019. His gratitude had been overflowing, then, later; it had just been a rage fueled punch to a doctor\u2019s face, interrupting some bullshit explanation about how it wasn\u2019t their fault.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of day five there had been talk: talk of \u2018testosterone overproduction\u2019, and \u2018exponential aggressiveness growth\u2019. Brian found he was beyond caring as his fists drove into the concrete, splinters puncturing, pain searing up his arms. Pain was good. He liked the pain now. It made all that beautiful red appear in front of his eyes. He could lose himself in it. Drown out the screaming, (and it was screaming now, someone was very frightened, maybe of him, and Brian laughed in his chest at the thought as the men in the other room went dead quiet) about \u2018mutagen coalescence\u2019 and how this was all Thomson\u2019s goddamn fault.\n\n\n\nHe hadn\u2019t cared. By day six, everything had gotten so very simple. He'd wanted food, so he'd hunted down a scientist and bit off a piece. His head felt different, like there was more bone there. The red fog never went away and his thoughts drifted across it as the soldiers poured into the room. The first few bullets lodged in his chest, the force absorbed by the spiny plates growing just under the skin. He had swung one massive hand, ridged with white protruding bone, and pulverized a helmet. The men at the end of the hall had screamed about backup and how \u2018firebreak\u2019 needed to be used. He ignored it, with all the men firing at him it had seemed unimportant, and the red whispered to him how good it would feel to just take the tattered remains of his skin off and let his muscles breathe. It was only when he ran out of soldiers that he looked around. The idea of retreat no longer had any place in his fury-soaked brain. He\u2019d run through the halls of the base and roared, daring them to challenge him. The beeping echoing was just another distraction. He ignored it.\n\n\n\nAs a consequence of this, the slow inability to breathe and the soft fall into blackout from oxygen starvation was less surprising than the fact that he could still die.\n\n----------\n\n\"Goddamn mess. The whole thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Look General, we said-\"\n\n\n\n\"You said it was goddamn safe! That we would have a working prototype in a year, and mass-production in two more!\"\n\n\n\n\"And we thought we were right! No one could have foreseen that, that THING being created!\"\n\n\n\n\"That's your fucking job isn't it?! To think ahead! Not to fuck up so badly we have to pump halon into the goddamn vents! And don't tell me that's nothing to worry about! You were five seconds from dying yourself you little shit!\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll figure a way to explain this all away. We'll be fine-\"\n\n\n\n\"No. There is no 'We'.\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026You're not seriously suggest-\"\n\n\n\n\"It's either I throw you to the dogs, or we all get nine-millimeter retirements. I'm gonna have a hard enough time spinning this towards the equipment and specimens saved, rather than the dozens of personnel dead.\"\n\n\n\n\"I-\"\n\n\n\n\"You knew the risks when you signed up for the job. And I'm not going to die because you tried to be God. Good bye Doctor.\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026Well. I guess I'll see you in hell then?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not if that thing is waiting for you there.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "On The Third Day - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-the-third-day", "year": 2010}, "one-bad-mother": {"created_at": "2010-02-06T17:22:00", "creator": "DrEverettMann", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-06T17:22:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-06T17:23:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-06T17:27:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-10T02:27:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "fixed spelling (except on the intentionally bad phonetic accents, of course)", "date": "2010-02-10T13:19:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-01T02:57:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-01T03:00:00"}, {"author": "Fred423", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fred423", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-01T04:37:00"}, {"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 6", "date": "2010-04-02T04:04:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 4", "date": "2010-04-02T04:27:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 5", "date": "2010-04-02T04:27:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

They had wheedled and pleaded for the best accommodations for 542 they could from the Foundations. It had been worth it.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann purposely did not look at Dr. Kald. He glanced at the clock on the wall, and at the old-fashioned radio (really an MP3 player with Chirurg's favorite songs loaded into it), and occasionally at the set of medical encyclopedias lining the walls. He looked everywhere in the room except at the door to Chirurg's bedroom (he looked away bashfully) and at the other doctor (he looked away pointedly). Kald just glared at Mann.</p>\n<p>They had both fallen for the old doctor. His wit, his charm, his large collection of organs\u2026 What wasn't there to love? So they had both done their best to woo the SCP, maintaining as much secrecy as they could (though surely the Foundation must be aware of their torrid affair). They had spent many fascinating hours with Herr Chirurg, drinking the finest wines, speaking of philosophy and art, and performing impromptu surgery on each other. It was bliss.</p>\n<p>The only wrinkle was the presence of the other. Each wanted Chirurg for himself. Sharing was inconceivable. And tonight, they each secretly hoped, Chirurg would make his decision, and they could finally know if they had his love.</p>\n<p>Finally, the door opened, and Chirurg stepped out. The two doctors savored his stooped gait, the delicate artistry of his scars, and the grace of his fingers as they caressed the doorknob.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, my darlings,\" the old surgeon said, a fond smile on his lips. \"Tonight is a very important night for us. I have an announcement to make.\"</p>\n<p>The two doctors held their breath. Surely their time had come at last. They both were certain that the other\u2026 the interloper would get their comeuppance at last.</p>\n<p>\"This is not a decision I come to lightly. It has taken a great deal of thought and soul-searching. However, I believe that I have come to a decision that is right for me. That is right for\u2026 us.\" Chirurg paused and cleared his throat, like a patriarch making a declaration before the entire family. \"I have decided\u2026 we should have a child.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald blinked. \"Vas?\"</p>\n<p>\"Er, could you repeat that?\" Dr. Mann said, unsure that he'd heard correctly.</p>\n<p>\"A child. A baby. My darlings, I think it is time we started a family.\" He sighed, long and heavy, his distended ribcage slowly expanding and contracting. \"I have been so long without my dear Isabella, but I think she would want me to move on after all this time. She was good to me, but that was long ago, and it is time to think of the future.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah. Well,\" Dr. Mann said. \"That's\u2026 a large step, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ich\u2026Ich mean, I yam honurrd, but\u2026 how?\" Dr. Kald said.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, I thought you might ask that. It will be difficult, but we can do anything through the healing power of Science!\" Chirurg said. \"Now, let us consummate our love through microsurgery and genetic engineering.\"</p>\n<p>\"To the laboratory!\" Dr. Mann said, his heart engaged by the old surgeon's enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\"Vith all doo chaste,\" Dr. Kald said, momentarily forgetting his rival in the warm presence of his darling.</p>\n<p>Within moments, the microsurgery tools were set-up, the genetic samples unfrozen, and the mysterious beakers and flasks of colorful fluids were bubbling merrily. Dr. Mann and Dr. Kald were happily splicing away at DNA.</p>\n<p>\"Now, we will take fifteen chromosomes from my darling Everett, fifteen from my beloved Josef, fifteen from myself, and one from my lost Isabella.\" Chirurg began the delicate process of combining the DNA into one complete set. It was a delicate process, requiring a steady, unwavering hand. His thin, multi-jointed digits went to work with a will, slowly wending their way into the very stuff of life, until he had completed his chromosomal work.</p>\n<p>\"Gentlemen,\" he said to his beloveds, \"We have combined our genetic material successfully. Now we must raise it to gestation.\"</p>\n<p>\"Chow shall ve prosheed?\" Dr. Kald asked.</p>\n<p>\"An artificial womb? A surrogate?\" Dr. Mann suggested.</p>\n<p>\"No, no, that would spoil the magic of it,\" Chirurg said. \"It must be one of us.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah\u2026 perchaps Dr. Mann vud like ze honor?\" Dr. Kald suggested.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann shook his head. \"No, no, I couldn't. You should do it, Dr. Kald. I insist.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, I know my little darlings are so eager to make each other happy. But there can only be one womb. So\u2026 I will flip a coin. Heads, Mann, tails Kald.\" Chirurg reached into his pocket, pulled out an old, tarnished Deutschmark, and flipped it upward. The three of them watched as it spun, catching the light, and then landed with a sharp ringing.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Mann walked out with a certain heaviness of heart, saddened that he would not, after all, have Chirurg to himself. However, at least he had the consolation that he wouldn't be the one to carry the child. He had too much to do. He didn't have time to be a working mother.</p>\n<p>He was so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn't notice the dark shape sneaking up behind him, not until he felt the sharp jab of the needle as it slid expertly into the meat of his buttocks. He started to turn, but then the world turned to cotton balls, and he thought it best to lay down and close his eyes.</p>\n<p>When he woke up, there was a soreness around his lower regions, but given certain of his experiments, he thought nothing of it, and kept on with his day. It was over a month before the morning sickness began, and he realized what had been done to him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc1\"><span>Month 1</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Kald was relaxing with the perfectly preserved body of a six-year-old when he heard a skittering in his room. He looked around, but didn't see anything. He shrugged, and began a new incision.</p>\n<p>\"Hello,\" said a voice. Dr. Kald looked around. It had sounded like Dr. Rights, but she was no where in sight.</p>\n<p>\"Bastard,\" said another voice. It sounded like Agent Yoric. But still, he didn't see anyone. He held his scalpel a bit tighter, for possible use as a weapon.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, there was a pain in his leg. \"Zum donnerwetter!\" he said, spinning around. Then he fell as the leg collapsed from under him. He saw a crab scuttling away. Then another moved at him from the side. He lashed out with the scalpel, but it only bounced off the crab's carapace, and it scored a tiny cut on his wrist. His hand went limp. Others moved in, and he found himself quickly disabled with surgical precision.</p>\n<p>\"That's good, my little friends,\" Dr. Mann said, stepping into Dr. Kald's field of view. \"That's right where I want him\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald could only seethe inwardly as Dr. Mann began the transplant.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Month 2</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Mann was sitting in his lab, happily reading the latest copy of Resurrectionist's Monthly (much better than that rubbish in the Gravedigger Times) when he heard an odd hissing sound. He looked around, trying to locate it. It seemed to him that it was coming from somewhere overhead. He started to walk over to his office to call maintenance when he detected an odd odor. Then he noticed his nose feeling a bit numb, and realized something was wrong. He was halfway to the door before he collapsed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald walked in with a scalpel and a smile.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>Month 3</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Kald was writing a report on his latest research. It had been going well enough, though he was starting to grow bored of it. There was hardly any dissection or vivisection at all involved in the work. He sometimes thought his talents were being squandered. He licked the tip of his finger as he flipped the page. He paused. There was something off with the taste. He looked at the paper, seeing if perhaps he'd spilled something on it, or on his desk. Yes, there seemed to be some discoloration. He wondered what it might be, and whether it might have something to do with the purple kangaroo that had inexplicably shown up his lab.</p>\n<p>As Dr. Kald explored better living through chemistry, Dr. Mann (showing some extra weight) made his way into the lab with a grim look and the autoscalpel humming.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Month 4</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Mann was enjoying a good bath. The bubbles were just the right consistency and color (a sort of lime green) and he had his rubber ducky, Rinaldo, with its round doctor's reflector on its forehead. He began singing some of the better songs of the BeeGees, enjoying the bathroom's acoustics. Then he removed his snood for some basic mustache care. First he washed out the wax, letting the curls go from his whiskers, and then wetted them thoroughly. This accomplished, he took the bottle of mustache shampoo and opened the lid. As he did, there was an outrush of escaping gas. \"Oh, bother,\" he said, as he passed into unconsciousness.</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald stepped into the bathroom, a determined look in his eye.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc5\"><span>Month 5</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Kald was sitting in his room, waiting for something to happen. He'd known for weeks that Mann was coming sometime. It was inevitable. His only chance was to be prepared. He'd hardly stirred from his room for a week, waiting, just waiting for Mann to make his move.</p>\n<p>There was a knock at the door. Dr. Kald narrowed his beady eyes. \"Wer da?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Delivery,\" said the voice on the other side. It didn't sound like Mann\u2026</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald opened the door to find nothing but a large baby carriage. He looked around. There was no one in the hallway. He wondered if Mann could really think he was that foolish.</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, he had his gasmask on, as well as gloves and a heavy coat. He wasn't about to let Mann drug him again.</p>\n<p>He swept back the blanket on the pram to uncover what sort of mechanism powered the trap.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann, in swaddling clothes and a pacifier, kicked out, taking Dr. Kald in the chin and knocking him straight out.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann began to prep for surgery.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Month 6</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Mann whistled as he pulled on the rubber gloves. It was time for a routine dissection. It was so fascinating to find out just how an SCP had killed someone. Had their kidneys liquefied? Their blood spontaneously released its oxygen? Or had their nervous system vanished entirely? It was always a delightful puzzle.</p>\n<p>The corpse today seemed a little bloated, though he'd been told the man had died very recently. Bloating normally took several days. However, there was some clear distension in the belly region. Dr. Mann made a note of it, and then looked over the corpse's other features, marking down the lividity of the face, the color of the fingernails, the way the corpse's eyes kept spinning several inches out of their sockets. Finally, he got ready to make the incision.</p>\n<p>As the skin slid open, a large boxing glove on a spring shot out, hitting Dr. Mann square in the face and knocking him onto his back.</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald waddled into the morgue, glaring at the body of his rival.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Month 7</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Kald walked down the hallway, wondering why he'd been summoned by Dr. Clef. He didn't want to leave the safety of his room, but he wanted even less to miss a meeting with the senior doctor.</p>\n<p>He opened the door, and found himself in the dark. He stepped forward a few feet, and then the lights came on.</p>\n<p>He was standing on a bullseye painted on the floor. Around him, there was an odd collection of machinery and assorted contraptions. Ramps, conveyer belts, slides\u2026 It went on and on.</p>\n<p>A marble dropped into a chute, where it slid down to a spiraling tube. Gravity propelled it down to an escalator, which deposited it onto a conveyor belt. This in turn fed it onto a miniature Ferris wheel, which brought it onto the top of a ramp. The marble slid down until it landed on a small metal dish. The sound of this awoke a mouse, which began running on a wheel. The wheel cranked a small pulley, which turned on a treadmill. A dog tied to the treadmill began to run. After a moment, it began to pant. A CO2 sensor turned on, triggering the start of an engine. The engine turned a belt which spun a fan, which blew a balloon over to the other side of the room. The balloon reached a lit Bunsen burner, and popped. The force of the pop knocked over a delicately balanced book, which then knocked over another book, and another. The books (a set of encyclopedias, from what Dr. Kald could see) fell like dominoes, continuing on a long shelf that seemed to end just over Dr. Kald's head. He peered up to see what was at the end of it. It was large, round, and, he suddenly realized, precariously balanced. He realized it was a bowling ball only as it started to fall, and it was too late to move.</p>\n<p>Under the blanket of Dr. Kald's concussion, Dr. Mann worked.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span>Month 8</span></h4>\n<p>Dr. Mann was walking down the hallway when a very pregnant Dr. Kald hit him over the head with a clipboard. He turned with a triumphant grin. \"I thought you might try that, so I protected my skull with a layer of carbon steel and foam!\"</p>\n<p>\"Did hyu protect zese?\" Dr. Kald snarled as he kicked Dr. Mann in the crotch.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Britannia!\" he cried in pain, collapsing to his knees.</p>\n<p>Dr. Kald kicked him again in his chest. \"Hyu blasted Englisches Schwein!\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann rolled with the kick, regaining his feet. \"Big-nosed child-botherer!\" he shouted as he aimed a punch at Dr. Kald.</p>\n<p>\"Hoossy!\" Dr. Kald said, grabbing Dr. Mann's mustache.</p>\n<p>\"Home wrecker!\" Dr. Mann said, grabbing Dr. Kald's hair.</p>\n<p>\"What is this?\" said Chirurg softly, looking out the window of his chamber door.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Chirurg!\" Dr. Mann said, suddenly releasing his grip on Dr. Kald's hair.</p>\n<p>\"Ve vere just\u2026\" Dr. Kald began.</p>\n<p>\"I could see what you were doing,\" said Chirurg. \"And it makes me very sad.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Mann and Dr. Kald looked at each other, abashed.</p>\n<p>\"But I know what is wrong,\" Chirurg continued. \"It is obvious. Come inside.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Herr Chirurg,\" the two doctors said. They entered Chirurg's antechamber together. Chirurg bade them sit, and then made tea for them.</p>\n<p>\"It is clear what is causing this strife,\" their paranormal paramour said. \"Obviously, you both want to carry our child. I should have thought of this before. I should have known it would cause strife.\"</p>\n<p>\"Er\u2026\" Dr. Mann tried to think of a delicate way of explaining that Chirurg was wrong, but failed.</p>\n<p>\"But don't worry,\" Chirurg said with a smile. \"Papa has a solution. Trust in me.\" He held up a scalpel. The both of them realized that they were feeling more tired. It seemed they weren't the only ones who could play with soporifics\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span>Month 9</span></h4>\n<p>\"Oh god!\" Dr. Mann screamed.</p>\n<p>\"I haff never known zuch pain!\" said Dr. Kald.</p>\n<p>\"Push!\" shouted Dr. Geier, from her position at their feet.</p>\n<p>Herr Chirurg held their hand, looking proud and just a little bit worried as the delivery went on. After several fevered moments, there was a final push.</p>\n<p>The infant (which looked human if you squinted right) was placed in their arms for the first time.</p>\n<p>\"Hold it oop ay lizzle higher,\" said Dr. Kald.</p>\n<p>\"Move the bottle a bit,\" said Dr. Mann. \"He can't drink properly like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"You two make a lovely mother,\" said Dr. Chirurg, admiring his handiwork. It had taken a great deal of work to get two heads to function on one body. The body had to have sufficient bloodflow to support two brains, and sufficient oxygen introduced into the blood.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n++++ The Conception\n\n\n\nDr. Kald and Dr. Mann waited in the main chamber of 542's new accommodations, sitting in the lush chairs they had arranged for their charge.\n\n\n\nIt had taken them months to get access to 542, months yet to be made co-chairs of his case.\u00a0\u00a0They had wheedled and pleaded for the best accommodations for 542 they could from the Foundations.\u00a0\u00a0It had been worth it.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann purposely did not look at Dr. Kald.\u00a0\u00a0He glanced at the clock on the wall, and at the old-fashioned radio (really an MP3 player with Chirurg's favorite songs loaded into it), and occasionally at the set of medical encyclopedias lining the walls.\u00a0\u00a0He looked everywhere in the room except at the door to Chirurg's bedroom (he looked away bashfully) and at the other doctor (he looked away pointedly).\u00a0\u00a0Kald just glared at Mann.\n\n\n\nThey had both fallen for the old doctor.\u00a0\u00a0His wit, his charm, his large collection of organs...\u00a0\u00a0What wasn't there to love?\u00a0\u00a0So they had both done their best to woo the SCP, maintaining as much secrecy as they could (though surely the Foundation must be aware of their torrid affair).\u00a0\u00a0They had spent many fascinating hours with Herr Chirurg, drinking the finest wines, speaking of philosophy and art, and performing impromptu surgery on each other.\u00a0\u00a0It was bliss.\n\n\n\nThe only wrinkle was the presence of the other.\u00a0\u00a0Each wanted Chirurg for himself.\u00a0\u00a0Sharing was inconceivable.\u00a0\u00a0And tonight, they each secretly hoped, Chirurg would make his decision, and they could finally know if they had his love.\n\n\n\nFinally, the door opened, and Chirurg stepped out.\u00a0\u00a0The two doctors savored his stooped gait, the delicate artistry of his scars, and the grace of his fingers as they caressed the doorknob.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, my darlings,\" the old surgeon said, a fond smile on his lips.\u00a0\u00a0\"Tonight is a very important night for us.\u00a0\u00a0I have an announcement to make.\"\n\n\n\nThe two doctors held their breath.\u00a0\u00a0Surely their time had come at last.\u00a0\u00a0They both were certain that the other...\u00a0\u00a0the interloper would get their comeuppance at last.\n\n\n\n\"This is not a decision I come to lightly.\u00a0\u00a0It has taken a great deal of thought and soul-searching.\u00a0\u00a0However, I believe that I have come to a decision that is right for me.\u00a0\u00a0That is right for... us.\"\u00a0\u00a0Chirurg paused and cleared his throat, like a patriarch making a declaration before the entire family.\u00a0\u00a0\"I have decided... we should have a child.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Kald blinked.\u00a0\u00a0\"Vas?\"\n\n\n\n\"Er, could you repeat that?\" Dr. Mann said, unsure that he'd heard correctly.\n\n\n\n\"A child.\u00a0\u00a0A baby.\u00a0\u00a0My darlings, I think it is time we started a family.\"\u00a0\u00a0He sighed, long and heavy, his distended ribcage slowly expanding and contracting.\u00a0\u00a0\"I have been so long without my dear Isabella, but I think she would want me to move on after all this time.\u00a0\u00a0She was good to me, but that was long ago, and it is time to think of the future.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah.\u00a0\u00a0Well,\" Dr. Mann said.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's... a large step, isn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ich\u2026Ich mean, I yam honurrd, but\u2026 how?\" Dr. Kald said.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, I thought you might ask that.\u00a0\u00a0It will be difficult, but we can do anything through the healing power of Science!\" Chirurg said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, let us consummate our love through microsurgery and genetic engineering.\"\n\n\n\n\"To the laboratory!\" Dr. Mann said, his heart engaged by the old surgeon's enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n\"Vith all doo chaste,\" Dr. Kald said, momentarily forgetting his rival in the warm presence of his darling.\n\n\n\nWithin moments, the microsurgery tools were set-up, the genetic samples unfrozen, and the mysterious beakers and flasks of colorful fluids were bubbling merrily.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann and Dr. Kald were happily splicing away at DNA.\n\n\n\n\"Now, we will take fifteen chromosomes from my darling Everett, fifteen from my beloved Josef, fifteen from myself, and one from my lost Isabella.\"\u00a0\u00a0Chirurg began the delicate process of combining the DNA into one complete set.\u00a0\u00a0It was a delicate process, requiring a steady, unwavering hand.\u00a0\u00a0His thin, multi-jointed digits went to work with a will, slowly wending their way into the very stuff of life, until he had completed his chromosomal work.\n\n\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said to his beloveds, \"We have combined our genetic material successfully.\u00a0\u00a0Now we must raise it to gestation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Chow shall ve prosheed?\" Dr. Kald asked.\n\n\n\n\"An artificial womb?\u00a0\u00a0A surrogate?\" Dr. Mann suggested.\n\n\n\n\"No, no, that would spoil the magic of it,\" Chirurg said.\u00a0\u00a0\"It must be one of us.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah\u2026 perchaps Dr. Mann vud like ze honor?\" Dr. Kald suggested.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann shook his head.\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, I couldn't.\u00a0\u00a0You should do it, Dr. Kald.\u00a0\u00a0I insist.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, I know my little darlings are so eager to make each other happy.\u00a0\u00a0But there can only be one womb.\u00a0\u00a0So... I will flip a coin.\u00a0\u00a0Heads, Mann, tails Kald.\"\u00a0\u00a0Chirurg reached into his pocket, pulled out an old, tarnished Deutschmark, and flipped it upward.\u00a0\u00a0The three of them watched as it spun, catching the light, and then landed with a sharp ringing.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDr. Mann walked out with a certain heaviness of heart, saddened that he would not, after all, have Chirurg to himself.\u00a0\u00a0However, at least he had the consolation that he wouldn't be the one to carry the child.\u00a0\u00a0He had too much to do.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't have time to be a working mother.\n\n\n\nHe was so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn't notice the dark shape sneaking up behind him, not until he felt the sharp jab of the needle as it slid expertly into the meat of his buttocks.\u00a0\u00a0He started to turn, but then the world turned to cotton balls, and he thought it best to lay down and close his eyes.\n\n\n\nWhen he woke up, there was a soreness around his lower regions, but given certain of his experiments, he thought nothing of it, and kept on with his day.\u00a0\u00a0It was over a month before the morning sickness began, and he realized what had been done to him.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 1\n\n\n\nDr. Kald was relaxing with the perfectly preserved body of a six-year-old when he heard a skittering in his room.\u00a0\u00a0He looked around, but didn't see anything.\u00a0\u00a0He shrugged, and began a new incision.\n\n\n\n\"Hello,\" said a voice.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Kald looked around.\u00a0\u00a0It had sounded like Dr. Rights, but she was no where in sight.\n\n\n\n\"Bastard,\" said another voice.\u00a0\u00a0It sounded like Agent Yoric.\u00a0\u00a0But still, he didn't see anyone.\u00a0\u00a0He held his scalpel a bit tighter, for possible use as a weapon.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, there was a pain in his leg.\u00a0\u00a0\"Zum donnerwetter!\" he said, spinning around.\u00a0\u00a0Then he fell as the leg collapsed from under him.\u00a0\u00a0He saw a crab scuttling away.\u00a0\u00a0Then another moved at him from the side.\u00a0\u00a0He lashed out with the scalpel, but it only bounced off the crab's carapace, and it scored a tiny cut on his wrist.\u00a0\u00a0His hand went limp.\u00a0\u00a0Others moved in, and he found himself quickly disabled with surgical precision.\n\n\n\n\"That's good, my little friends,\" Dr. Mann said, stepping into Dr. Kald's field of view.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's right where I want him...\"\n\n\n\nDr. Kald could only seethe inwardly as Dr. Mann began the transplant.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 2\n\n\n\nDr. Mann was sitting in his lab, happily reading the latest copy of Resurrectionist's Monthly (much better than that rubbish in the Gravedigger Times) when he heard an odd hissing sound.\u00a0\u00a0He looked around, trying to locate it.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to him that it was coming from somewhere overhead.\u00a0\u00a0He started to walk over to his office to call maintenance when he detected an odd odor.\u00a0\u00a0Then he noticed his nose feeling a bit numb, and realized something was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0He was halfway to the door before he collapsed.\n\n\n\nDr. Kald walked in with a scalpel and a smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 3\n\n\n\nDr. Kald was writing a report on his latest research.\u00a0\u00a0It had been going well enough, though he was starting to grow bored of it.\u00a0\u00a0There was hardly any dissection or vivisection at all involved in the work.\u00a0\u00a0He sometimes thought his talents were being squandered.\u00a0\u00a0He licked the tip of his finger as he flipped the page.\u00a0\u00a0He paused.\u00a0\u00a0There was something off with the taste.\u00a0\u00a0He looked at the paper, seeing if perhaps he'd spilled something on it, or on his desk.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, there seemed to be some discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0He wondered what it might be, and whether it might have something to do with the purple kangaroo that had inexplicably shown up his lab.\n\n\n\nAs Dr. Kald explored better living through chemistry, Dr. Mann (showing some extra weight) made his way into the lab with a grim look and the autoscalpel humming.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 4\n\n\n\nDr. Mann was enjoying a good bath.\u00a0\u00a0The bubbles were just the right consistency and color (a sort of lime green) and he had his rubber ducky, Rinaldo, with its round doctor's reflector on its forehead.\u00a0\u00a0He began singing some of the better songs of the BeeGees, enjoying the bathroom's acoustics.\u00a0\u00a0Then he removed his snood for some basic mustache care.\u00a0\u00a0First he washed out the wax, letting the curls go from his whiskers, and then wetted them thoroughly.\u00a0\u00a0This accomplished, he took the bottle of mustache shampoo and opened the lid.\u00a0\u00a0As he did, there was an outrush of escaping gas.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, bother,\" he said, as he passed into unconsciousness.\n\n\n\nDr. Kald stepped into the bathroom, a determined look in his eye.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 5\n\n\n\nDr. Kald was sitting in his room, waiting for something to happen.\u00a0\u00a0He'd known for weeks that Mann was coming sometime.\u00a0\u00a0It was inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0His only chance was to be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0He'd hardly stirred from his room for a week, waiting, just waiting for Mann to make his move.\n\n\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Kald narrowed his beady eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\"Wer da?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"Delivery,\" said the voice on the other side.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't sound like Mann...\n\n\n\nDr. Kald opened the door to find nothing but a large baby carriage.\u00a0\u00a0He looked around.\u00a0\u00a0There was no one in the hallway.\u00a0\u00a0He wondered if Mann could really think he was that foolish.\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, he had his gasmask on, as well as gloves and a heavy coat.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't about to let Mann drug him again.\n\n\n\nHe swept back the blanket on the pram to uncover what sort of mechanism powered the trap.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann, in swaddling clothes and a pacifier, kicked out, taking Dr. Kald in the chin and knocking him straight out.\n\n\n\nDr. Mann began to prep for surgery.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 6\n\n\n\nDr. Mann whistled as he pulled on the rubber gloves.\u00a0\u00a0It was time for a routine dissection.\u00a0\u00a0It was so fascinating to find out just how an SCP had killed someone.\u00a0\u00a0Had their kidneys liquefied?\u00a0\u00a0Their blood spontaneously released its oxygen?\u00a0\u00a0Or had their nervous system vanished entirely?\u00a0\u00a0It was always a delightful puzzle.\n\n\n\nThe corpse today seemed a little bloated, though he'd been told the man had died very recently.\u00a0\u00a0Bloating normally took several days.\u00a0\u00a0However, there was some clear distension in the belly region.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Mann made a note of it, and then looked over the corpse's other features, marking down the lividity of the face, the color of the fingernails, the way the corpse's eyes kept spinning several inches out of their sockets.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, he got ready to make the incision.\n\n\n\nAs the skin slid open, a large boxing glove on a spring shot out, hitting Dr. Mann square in the face and knocking him onto his back.\n\n\n\nDr. Kald waddled into the morgue, glaring at the body of his rival.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 7\n\n\n\nDr. Kald walked down the hallway, wondering why he'd been summoned by Dr. Clef.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't want to leave the safety of his room, but he wanted even less to miss a meeting with the senior doctor.\n\n\n\nHe opened the door, and found himself in the dark.\u00a0\u00a0He stepped forward a few feet, and then the lights came on.\n\n\n\nHe was standing on a bullseye painted on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0Around him, there was an odd collection of machinery and assorted contraptions.\u00a0\u00a0Ramps, conveyer belts, slides...\u00a0\u00a0It went on and on.\n\n\n\nA marble dropped into a chute, where it slid down to a spiraling tube.\u00a0\u00a0Gravity propelled it down to an escalator, which deposited it onto a conveyor belt.\u00a0\u00a0This in turn fed it onto a miniature Ferris wheel, which brought it onto the top of a ramp.\u00a0\u00a0The marble slid down until it landed on a small metal dish.\u00a0\u00a0The sound of this awoke a mouse, which began running on a wheel.\u00a0\u00a0The wheel cranked a small pulley, which turned on a treadmill.\u00a0\u00a0A dog tied to the treadmill began to run.\u00a0\u00a0After a moment, it began to pant.\u00a0\u00a0A CO2 sensor turned on, triggering the start of an engine.\u00a0\u00a0The engine turned a belt which spun a fan, which blew a balloon over to the other side of the room.\u00a0\u00a0The balloon reached a lit Bunsen burner, and popped.\u00a0\u00a0The force of the pop knocked over a delicately balanced book, which then knocked over another book, and another.\u00a0\u00a0The books (a set of encyclopedias, from what Dr. Kald could see) fell like dominoes, continuing on a long shelf that seemed to end just over Dr. Kald's head.\u00a0\u00a0He peered up to see what was at the end of it.\u00a0\u00a0It was large, round, and, he suddenly realized, precariously balanced.\u00a0\u00a0He realized it was a bowling ball only as it started to fall, and it was too late to move.\n\n\n\nUnder the blanket of Dr. Kald's concussion, Dr. Mann worked.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 8\n\n\n\nDr. Mann was walking down the hallway when a very pregnant Dr. Kald hit him over the head with a clipboard.\u00a0\u00a0He turned with a triumphant grin.\u00a0\u00a0\"I thought you might try that, so I protected my skull with a layer of carbon steel and foam!\"\n\n\n\n\"Did hyu protect zese?\" Dr. Kald snarled as he kicked Dr. Mann in the crotch.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Britannia!\" he cried in pain, collapsing to his knees.\n\n\n\nDr. Kald kicked him again in his chest.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hyu blasted Englisches Schwein!\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann rolled with the kick, regaining his feet.\u00a0\u00a0\"Big-nosed child-botherer!\" he shouted as he aimed a punch at Dr. Kald.\n\n\n\n\"Hoossy!\" Dr. Kald said, grabbing Dr. Mann's mustache.\n\n\n\n\"Home wrecker!\" Dr. Mann said, grabbing Dr. Kald's hair.\n\n\n\n\"What is this?\" said Chirurg softly, looking out the window of his chamber door.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Chirurg!\" Dr. Mann said, suddenly releasing his grip on Dr. Kald's hair.\n\n\n\n\"Ve vere just...\" Dr. Kald began.\n\n\n\n\"I could see what you were doing,\" said Chirurg.\u00a0\u00a0\"And it makes me very sad.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mann and Dr. Kald looked at each other, abashed.\n\n\n\n\"But I know what is wrong,\" Chirurg continued.\u00a0\u00a0\"It is obvious.\u00a0\u00a0Come inside.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Herr Chirurg,\" the two doctors said.\u00a0\u00a0They entered Chirurg's antechamber together.\u00a0\u00a0Chirurg bade them sit, and then made tea for them.\n\n\n\n\"It is clear what is causing this strife,\" their paranormal paramour said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Obviously, you both want to carry our child.\u00a0\u00a0I should have thought of this before.\u00a0\u00a0I should have known it would cause strife.\"\n\n\n\n\"Er...\" Dr. Mann tried to think of a delicate way of explaining that Chirurg was wrong, but failed.\n\n\n\n\"But don't worry,\" Chirurg said with a smile.\u00a0\u00a0\"Papa has a solution.\u00a0\u00a0Trust in me.\"\u00a0\u00a0He held up a scalpel.\u00a0\u00a0The both of them realized that they were feeling more tired.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed they weren't the only ones who could play with soporifics...\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ Month 9\n\n\n\n\"Oh god!\" Dr. Mann screamed.\n\n\n\n\"I haff never known zuch pain!\" said Dr. Kald.\n\n\n\n\"Push!\" shouted Dr. Geier, from her position at their feet.\n\n\n\nHerr Chirurg held their hand, looking proud and just a little bit worried as the delivery went on.\u00a0\u00a0After several fevered moments, there was a final push.\n\n\n\nThe infant (which looked human if you squinted right) was placed in their arms for the first time.\n\n\n\n\"Hold it oop ay lizzle higher,\" said Dr. Kald.\n\n\n\n\"Move the bottle a bit,\" said Dr. Mann.\u00a0\u00a0\"He can't drink properly like that.\"\n\n\n\n\"You two make a lovely mother,\" said Dr. Chirurg, admiring his handiwork.\u00a0\u00a0It had taken a great deal of work to get two heads to function on one body.\u00a0\u00a0The body had to have sufficient bloodflow to support two brains, and sufficient oxygen introduced into the blood.\u00a0\u00a0But it had been worth it to make his darlings happy, and to give him the family he had longed for.\u00a0\u00a0He beamed.\n\n\n\nThe infant fell asleep, safe in its mothers' arms.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDr. Agatha Rights\n\n\n\nX:/Foundation/Personnel/Rights/Work/Boring Stuff/Extremely Normal Files/Nothing to See Here/Fiction/Slash/SCPs+Staff/Chirurg/One Bad

If your next sentence doesn't start with a verb, you're talking too much.\"\n\nI raised the gun to the leprechaun's face again. \"Now, Youngblood, what do you do?\"\n\n\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\n\n\"Wrong!\" I shouted, and pulled the trigger, discharging the blank with a loud bang.\n\n\n\nThis time, the leprechaun jumped.\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"So, twelve legs with claws, four legs with pincers, and a pair of pincers... erm, normal, mouth pincers that is, which... deliver an electrical current that disrupts the prey's heartbeat.\"\n\n\n\n\"You call that normal?\"\n\n\n\n\"You know what I mean.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'd know what you meant if you weren't talking like some kind of drunk pixie.\"\n\n\n\nI had to credit him.

I can respect that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d James nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I respect his decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>Said entity had devoured Oates without pause, but it had lasted about eight seconds when it encountered James. It had swallowed the man in a mass of slithering sinew and fanged orifices\u2026 and then began to expel high-speed projectile organs as it collapsed in on itself. It was as if someone had activated a gigantic blender from inside it- chunks of squid-creature had rained down for quite some time afterwards.</p>\n<p>Corporal McSteward glanced at her traveling companion. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot mellower than your reports suggest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are very different circumstances when compared to my usual excursions,\u201d James said flatly, still painted with cephalopod innards.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Corporal McSteward muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can compensate for that.\u201d James sheathed his sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cI must have lost it during the evacuation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The nearest town was several miles away, but at least that limited the project\u2019s exposure. A forced march through the scrubland was fatiguing at best and torturous at worst, but the weather and terrain didn\u2019t bother James. She got the feeling nothing did.</p>\n<p>The things had crawled out of the base camp\u2019s walls, coming from shadow, coming from the areas where peripheral vision failed even trained soldiers. Bullets did nothing, and flesh and Kevlar offered little resistance to their grasping tentacles and rending teeth. And neither did bravery, as Oates found out to his cost.</p>\n<p>She suppressed a shudder. James had already killed seven- that was reassuring- but it meant there\u2019d likely be far more out there. Freakish beings of all shapes and sizes, exploring the wilderness and heading towards civilian areas.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre there any potential survivors unaccounted for?\u201d That same disinterested tone, as if exchanging small talk and not discussing the potential of an apocalyptic surge of otherworldly <em>things</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw Hill reach the Jeep but I don\u2019t know where he got to,\u201d McSteward sighed. \u201cI think they got to him first. Him, Oates, the whole goddamned regiment. I think it\u2019s just you and me now James.\u201d</p>\n<p>The base camp\u2019s armoured division had proved just as fragile as the infantry; metal panels and engine parts were twisted and torn as easily as the bodies had been. Hill had reached a car in time, but as the corporal arrived he\u2019d been racing towards the horizon as the other vehicles burned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still do not understand why you call me James. That is not my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a pun.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cThe whole oh-seven thing, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just sounds like something Fleming cooked up\u2026\u201d she trailed off. There was little point in trying to explain.</p>\n<p>076-2 was definitely part of the project, she just didn\u2019t understand how he fit in exactly, or how he\u2019d even got there. It wasn\u2019t like the military could\u2019ve just picked him up on lease. But if he hadn\u2019t been there\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cMcSteward! Corporal! <em>Corporal!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked up towards the voice. In the distance was a crumpled Jeep, crushed between two jutting stones. A figure was stumbling over the tufts of grass and uneven rocks- but making good time regardless, eagerly closing the distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHill?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured it out! I figured it out,\u201d he repeated, finally reaching her and panting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d The corporal beamed, flooded with relief. \u201cAnd you managed to crash the Jeep,\u201d she added, slightly reproachfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cForget about the damn car! I\u2019ve worked it all out\u2026. uh\u2026 Corporal.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grabbed him by the shoulders. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Private?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m saying this isn\u2019t actually happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>She paused, but only for a moment. <em>\u201cWhat?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a large-scale psychological affecter-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you mean, dammit, but that doesn\u2019t make any sense! If this is memetic, or neurological, or any kind of psychosomatic threat\u2026 how did it completely beat our conditioning? We\u2019ve been facing that kind of thing for years!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you were expe-\u201d</p>\n<p>076-2 cleaved the man in twain. It was a very clean cut.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</em> she screamed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was one of them. Look.\u201d</p>\n<p>McSteward stared at the body. It wasn\u2019t Hill, it was another of the tentacled creatures. How could she have been so na\u00efve-</p>\n<p>No. <em>Think</em> for a second.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a clean cut. Hill was on the floor but he was unmarked. The sword hadn\u2019t actually hit, no matter what her mind was telling her. She\u2019d automatically expected a clean cut because it was 076-2 doing the cutting, but from that angle? With an overarm, vertical sweep? Impossible, whether Hill was a freakish abomination or not. The sheer forces required would\u2019ve practically made the target explode.</p>\n<p>Hill was right, this wasn\u2019t happening. She\u2019d corrected herself, and the illusion had failed to compensate for her realisation.</p>\n<p>076-2 was shifting in and out of focus, shivering like static on an old television. One moment the sword was slick with Hill\u2019s bodily fluids, the next it was spotless. A katana, a broadsword, a saif, distorting between forms. One moment 076-2 was there, the next\u2026 nothing but a warped silhouette.</p>\n<p>But the leer always remained, an unmoving smirk in the chaotic facade.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not 076-2.\u201d The corporal took a step back.</p>\n<p>He grinned. \u201cWhat, aren\u2019t you desperate to bring us home and show us off to your superiors? We were so looking forward to meeting them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about you come clean.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cFine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The grin expanded and carried on expanding. His eyes retreated back into his skull until they were pinpricks of puckered flesh glaring from out of a mass of wrinkles. The clothes unravelled into translucent spines, wetly pulsing and vibrating. The face degenerated into razor-edged bone and twitching viscera, the body became a conglomerate of engorged tentacles and jagged teeth.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe are not the ohseven. We would all love to know what you\u2019re GOING TO <strong>DO ABOUT IT</strong></em></p>\n<p>She shot it. It shrieked in a pitch no human could hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cEver wonder,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cwhy a soldier would have the slightest knowledge of 076-2 in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>The thing writhed around in agony, spitting blood and threats in a dead language.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd \u2018lost\u2019 my gun? You bought that?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shot it again. And again.</p>\n<p>When the magazine finally ran dry the \u201ccorporal\u201d produced her combat knife and hacked away at the spasmodic heap of gore until both her hands were numb.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Incident \u2588\u2588 Report Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>Corporal McSteward of the Adjutant General\u2019s Corps (Royal Military Police) of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Base, cover identity of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, brought in the body of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study.</p>\n<p>Further investigation into the British military\u2019s acquirement of subject required.

I can respect that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d James nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I respect his decision.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaid entity had devoured Oates without pause, but it had lasted about eight seconds when it encountered James. It had swallowed the man in a mass of slithering sinew and fanged orifices\u2026 and then began to expel high-speed projectile organs as it collapsed in on itself. It was as if someone had activated a gigantic blender from inside it- chunks of squid-creature had rained down for quite some time afterwards.\n\n\n\nCorporal McSteward glanced at her traveling companion. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot mellower than your reports suggest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are very different circumstances when compared to my usual excursions,\u201d James said flatly, still painted with cephalopod innards.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Corporal McSteward muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a gun.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can compensate for that.\u201d James sheathed his sword.\n\n\n\n\u201cI must have lost it during the evacuation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe nearest town was several miles away, but at least that limited the project\u2019s exposure. A forced march through the scrubland was fatiguing at best and torturous at worst, but the weather and terrain didn\u2019t bother James. She got the feeling nothing did.\n\n\n\nThe things had crawled out of the base camp\u2019s walls, coming from shadow, coming from the areas where peripheral vision failed even trained soldiers. Bullets did nothing, and flesh and Kevlar offered little resistance to their grasping tentacles and rending teeth. And neither did bravery, as Oates found out to his cost.\n\n\n\nShe suppressed a shudder. James had already killed seven- that was reassuring- but it meant there\u2019d likely be far more out there. Freakish beings of all shapes and sizes, exploring the wilderness and heading towards civilian areas.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre there any potential survivors unaccounted for?\u201d That same disinterested tone, as if exchanging small talk and not discussing the potential of an apocalyptic surge of otherworldly //things//.\n\n\n\n\u201cI saw Hill reach the Jeep but I don\u2019t know where he got to,\u201d McSteward sighed. \u201cI think they got to him first. Him, Oates, the whole goddamned regiment. I think it\u2019s just you and me now James.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe base camp\u2019s armoured division had proved just as fragile as the infantry; metal panels and engine parts were twisted and torn as easily as the bodies had been. Hill had reached a car in time, but as the corporal arrived he\u2019d been racing towards the horizon as the other vehicles burned.\n\n\n\n\u201cI still do not understand why you call me James. That is not my name.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust a pun.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cThe whole oh-seven thing, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt just sounds like something Fleming cooked up\u2026\u201d she trailed off. There was little point in trying to explain.\n\n\n\n076-2 was definitely part of the project, she just didn\u2019t understand how he fit in exactly, or how he\u2019d even got there. It wasn\u2019t like the military could\u2019ve just picked him up on lease. But if he hadn\u2019t been there\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cMcSteward! Corporal! //Corporal!//\u201d\n\n\n\nShe looked up towards the voice. In the distance was a crumpled Jeep, crushed between two jutting stones. A figure was stumbling over the tufts of grass and uneven rocks- but making good time regardless, eagerly closing the distance.\n\n\n\n\u201cHill?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI figured it out! I figured it out,\u201d he repeated, finally reaching her and panting.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d The corporal beamed, flooded with relief. \u201cAnd you managed to crash the Jeep,\u201d she added, slightly reproachfully.\n\n\n\n\u201cForget about the damn car! I\u2019ve worked it all out\u2026. uh\u2026 Corporal.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe grabbed him by the shoulders. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Private?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying this isn\u2019t actually happening.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe paused, but only for a moment. //\u201cWhat?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a large-scale psychological affecter-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI know what you mean, dammit, but that doesn\u2019t make any sense! If this is memetic, or neurological, or any kind of psychosomatic threat\u2026 how did it completely beat our conditioning? We\u2019ve been facing that kind of thing for years!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because you were expe-\u201d\n\n\n\n076-2 cleaved the man in twain. It was a very clean cut.\n\n\n\n//\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d// she screamed.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was one of them. Look.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcSteward stared at the body. It wasn\u2019t Hill, it was another of the tentacled creatures. How could she have been so na\u00efve-\n\n\n\nNo. //Think// for a second.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a clean cut. Hill was on the floor but he was unmarked. The sword hadn\u2019t actually hit, no matter what her mind was telling her. She\u2019d automatically expected a clean cut because it was 076-2 doing the cutting, but from that angle? With an overarm, vertical sweep? Impossible, whether Hill was a freakish abomination or not. The sheer forces required would\u2019ve practically made the target explode.\n\n\n\nHill was right, this wasn\u2019t happening. She\u2019d corrected herself, and the illusion had failed to compensate for her realisation.\n\n\n\n076-2 was shifting in and out of focus, shivering like static on an old television. One moment the sword was slick with Hill\u2019s bodily fluids, the next it was spotless. A katana, a broadsword, a saif, distorting between forms. One moment 076-2 was there, the next\u2026 nothing but a warped silhouette. \n\n\n\nBut the leer always remained, an unmoving smirk in the chaotic facade.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not 076-2.\u201d The corporal took a step back. \n\n\n\nHe grinned. \u201cWhat, aren\u2019t you desperate to bring us home and show us off to your superiors? We were so looking forward to meeting them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow about you come clean.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cFine.\u201d//\n\n\n\nThe grin expanded and carried on expanding. His eyes retreated back into his skull until they were pinpricks of puckered flesh glaring from out of a mass of wrinkles. The clothes unravelled into translucent spines, wetly pulsing and vibrating. The face degenerated into razor-edged bone and twitching viscera, the body became a conglomerate of engorged tentacles and jagged teeth. \n\n\n\n//\u201cWe are not the ohseven. We would all love to know what you\u2019re GOING TO **DO ABOUT IT**//\n\n\n\nShe shot it. It shrieked in a pitch no human could hear. \n\n\n\n\u201cEver wonder,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cwhy a soldier would have the slightest knowledge of 076-2 in the first place?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe thing writhed around in agony, spitting blood and threats in a dead language. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd \u2018lost\u2019 my gun? You bought that?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe shot it again. And again.\n\n\n\nWhen the magazine finally ran dry the \u201ccorporal\u201d produced her combat knife and hacked away at the spasmodic heap of gore until both her hands were numb.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> **Incident \u2588\u2588 Report Summary:**\n\n> \n\n> Corporal McSteward of the Adjutant General\u2019s Corps (Royal Military Police) of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Base, cover identity of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, brought in the body of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study.\n\n> \n\n> Further investigation into the British military\u2019s acquirement of subject required.

You've suffered enough, y'know?</p>\n<p>So, where was I? Oh yeah, skinnin' people alive. Hard as hell. That bit was made up by the papers. Sounds a hell of a lot more exciting. Nah, he cut their throats first, then skinned 'em. Anyway, twenty years back, there was another case kinda like this, back east. There's a few folks who've talked about it, but they don't think there's a connection, on account the guy there was caught. But check this out: The fucker said he needed to eat the skin to live. How does he end up dyin'? Malnutrition, even though he gets three meals a day.</p>\n<p>So, we look into it, an' the guy had a kid, who moved out here. Yeah, yer neighbor. So, we come in, do some checkin' up, an' once we did, it came pretty clear he did it. Unfortunately, looks like he got wind of us, an' skipped out, with a last little screw you in the bargain. So, we got guys tearin' up his place to figure out where he went. Oh, we'll find him, don't worry. He's sloppy. He'll screw up eventually.</p>\n<p>Anyway, get comfy. We got someone comin' here who's gonna make you forget everythin' that happened. Tomorrow mornin', this'll seem like it was just a botched robbery. We'll even set you up t'look like a hero, saved yer family. How's that?</p>\n<p>By the way, how's rent around here?

AR-15 automatic rifle (his mind supplies automatically), standard issue for new Agents or emergency armament, fairly new, pretty battered.

How\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cFifty-five, Jim.\u201d The voice comes from his left. Jim snaps his head around to stare, wildly, at the source. Ragged brown hair, a crumpled lab coat. It's Madeline, Dr. Madeline Vogler, of all people, sitting beside him on the park bench and cleaning her own gun with the same swift, automatic movements. She hasn't looked up.</p>\n<p><em>\u201dWhat?\u201d</em> he squeaks. \u201cMadeline, what are you doing?

What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh-fifty-five.\u201d She cuts him off dully, glancing up from her work. Her gray eyes are dull, bruised with tiredness, and the fine lines on her brow were never that deep. The lab coat is a half-shredded montage of stains, and the name embroidered above the breast pocket isn\u2019t hers. \u201cRemember agreeing that something wasn\u2019t round?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh.</em> He nearly chokes. <a href=\"/scp-055\">SCP-055</a> certainly isn\u2019t round; Madeline and her team had confirmed it. It took them months, and many rounds of negation, but they learned a few important facts. The thing can\u2019t be remembered, not even indirectly, except for what it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t alive. It isn\u2019t safe \u2014 oh, God, it\u2019s not safe! And it isn\u2019t contained\u2026</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t contained any more.

How long has it been since he\u2019s formed a lasting memory \u2014 since he was doing something that didn\u2019t involve 055?</p>\n<p>Too long, he thinks. Madeline is a gaunt, ravaged shadow; he\u2019s not much better, he decides, looking down to take in his own frame. It takes a while to lose that much sleep. Some of the scars \u2014 new scars \u2014 must have taken weeks to heal.</p>\n<p>And when did he learn to shoot a gun, least of all this gun? Now that he allows himself to look at it closely, warily accepting that he\u2019s familiar with such things, he can tell that even by Foundation standards it is not a normal weapon. The firing mechanism has been replaced with a jerry-rigged tangle of circuitry, fiberglass, crystals, and something like flower petals. There's something else at the base of the trigger; he squints at it, decides that it isn't important, and passes over it. The magazine is entirely too heavy and too blue, and it sloshes.</p>\n<p>He forces himself to nod, finally answering Madeline\u2019s question. \u201cWhat are we doing here?

On this bench, of all places?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't remember \u2014 \u201d and her eyes snap shut, pain flickering across her face \u2014 \u201cbut you said that I'd said that you'd\u2026 Never mind. You said we had to shoot something, and that we\u2019d know what, when it was time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> said? What about Agent Segel?\u201d But the moment the name leaves his mouth, he knows. Madeline's look of bemused grief only confirms it. \u201cShe didn't make it, did she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Nobody did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChen? Alex? Araya?\u201d Madeline only shakes her head. \u201c<em>Kyle?</em> At least tell me Kyle's okay? <em>Damn!\u201d</em> He knows his voice is rising in anguish, and his eyes are blurring. His entire team \u2014 the entire staff of the Site? <em>All</em> of them?</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody.\u201d Madeline's eyes are suspiciously bright, too, but she hasn't taken them off her work. \u201cJim, we can't talk about it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and let me explain!\u201d Her fingers clench somewhere inside her gun. \u201cWe have to finish what we're doing and be ready when it gets here. I'm going to forget everything again in another minute or two, and you'll have to tell me, all right? There's no one else left to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>That does quiet him. He looks back down at the half-disassembled gun in his lap. It needs to be put back together, now that he\u2019s cleaned it. His hands seem to know what to do; he starts sliding the pieces into each other.</p>\n<p>She lets out a breath, going back to her own work. \u201cOkay. We\u2019re in the park on the other side of Springfield from the Site. We don\u2019t want to go back there; I don\u2019t know why. There\u2019s nobody else in town, maybe nobody in the state. We\u2019ve got supplies to last a few weeks stashed in the bushes next to you. We have to keep these guns in good condition, make sure the crystals don\u2019t tarnish and the petals stay alive, spend as much time on this bench as we can, and always be ready to attack.

Long enough. My oldest scars are at least that old, and I haven\u2019t got anything newer than a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim\u2019s own body bears out her assessment: he\u2019s got a few new aches, but nothing pressing. He considers them, looking up into the sky as he works. Their bench sits at the edge of an open athletic field, with summer-lush woods behind, but there are no birds. A football lies abandoned, one end crumpled inward, a few yards away. \u201cHow long will we be waiting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as we need to.\u201d She finishes reassembling her gun and hefts it briefly. There is something brittle and flinty in her movements. \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another pause. Jim stills his hands, resting them on his knees. The park\u2019s stillness is a lead weight against his temples. \u201cAnd we\u2019re the last ones?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe. As far as we know.\u201d Madeline won\u2019t meet his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen this could be futile. 055 could already have won.\u201d</p>\n<p>Madeline whips around to glare at him, her whole posture suddenly lit with desperate ferocity. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she snaps. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that! We can\u2019t think like that! We don\u2019t know anything else we can be doing \u2014 for Christ\u2019s sake, Jim, we can\u2019t remember ten minutes ago. We could be the last thing keeping the world alive, for all you know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d He pulls his head back as if struck, raising his hands. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll stay. As long as we need to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as we need to.\u201d She gives a firm, sharp nod, a peck from a raptor beak. Jim doesn\u2019t dare contradict her.</p>\n<p>Then she nods again, softer, and suddenly uncertain. Again, barely moving her head, staring around herself in sudden confusion. \u201cJim? What the \u2014 What are we doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim\u2019s throat clenches tight, stopping his voice and breath. She\u2019s forgotten again. Just as he will, in another few minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201c055, Madeline.

There was something we had to keep them away from. It was a chaotic time for everyone, I've learned. The reins had slipped out of our hands, and the idiots once off their leashes were much harder to steer. So, they went for Gaillipoli. They went because it would make a clear route to Russia, and the Turks who owned the peninsula rallied to keep it. We were caught in the middle, trying to keep anyone from finding us in our underground bunker, there underneath a rock that they called the \"Sphinx.\" It was a biohazard containment site.</p>\n<p>\"I only had to spend one day there, before that little cut got so bad that they pulled me back out.

HQ was trying to get through, but it was a war zone. What were we supposed to do? We had a few guns and bombs we'd gotten from an agent with the Turks. Our orders were to keep ourselves hidden at all costs. Things were crazy back then. We'd lost two of our best researchers when they defected to Germany, and when the gas started spraying out in panicked clouds over the trenches, it was all we could do to keep it explained.

We were in the 6th Dublins. They got put in the trenches then they got put on top afterward. I didn't find out 'till later, of course.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hadn't taken sides in that battle. There was something we had to keep them away from. It was a chaotic time for everyone, I've learned. The reins had slipped out of our hands, and the idiots once off their leashes were much harder to steer. So, they went for Gaillipoli. They went because it would make a clear route to Russia, and the Turks who owned the peninsula rallied to keep it. We were caught in the middle, trying to keep anyone from finding us in our underground bunker, there underneath a rock that they called the \"Sphinx.\" It was a biohazard containment site.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I only had to spend one day there, before that little cut got so bad that they pulled me back out. I was lucky, of course. We weren't near the heavy fighting. That's when I met the nurse. She really did look just like you.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We didn't have much to work with. HQ was trying to get through, but it was a war zone. What were we supposed to do? We had a few guns and bombs we'd gotten from an agent with the Turks. Our orders were to keep ourselves hidden at all costs. Things were crazy back then. We'd lost two of our best researchers when they defected to Germany, and when the gas started spraying out in panicked clouds over the trenches, it was all we could do to keep it explained. One small site out of many, we were.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She seemed to know what was happening. At least, she seemed... confident. Took off my leg at the knee, opened up the bottom half and took something out, something that looked like a mouse with fur made of fucking veins, veins and little squirming things with fishhooks and, and she stabbed me with something when I tried to scream, and... and... and then I woke up.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He paused, and then seemed to relax, eyes unfocused. I took his bowl.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Bad dream,\" I said.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What was I supposed to do? Back there, with shells falling like glass and nails every day and people dying at your doorstep because that's what you had to do...no matter what, that was what you had to do...\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All we had was a little food and a couple guns and a couple shells and one Petri dish, and when it broke it changed things in us so what am I supposed to do? The others didn't live like I did, like I keep doing. I knew that I couldn't leave him, not with that thing inside, and HQ still couldn't get through with pickup, and he couldn't... I couldn't let him remember either because that might give us away. When they got to us two days later, he was so fucked up in the head that he couldn't remember who he was because that's what I had to do, and that scar, and... and no matter what...\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After HQ finally got itself picked up and decided who should win and what should happen to the assholes who tried to leave us, they tried to fix him up, but I had done too much. He didn't know what was real and what wasn't, and he doesn't, and I do, and I can't tell him because he already knows even if he...\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No matter what.\n\n\n\nSix months to a year.\n\n\n\nSix months to a year.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Sailing To Gallipoli - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sailing-to-gallipoli", "year": 2010}, "scp-001-o5": {"created_at": "2010-08-04T06:53:00", "creator": "AdminBright", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-04T06:53:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-04T06:55:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-04T06:55:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-05T06:04:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-05T06:06:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-05T06:13:00"}, {"author": "SimpleCadence", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/simplecadence", "comment": "very minor spelling edits", "date": "2010-08-06T10:18:00"}, {"author": "SimpleCadence", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/simplecadence", "comment": "and another", "date": "2010-08-06T10:20:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-19T03:06:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T06:32:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T06:53:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T06:56:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T07:01:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T07:02:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T07:12:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-04T07:31:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Added a the, it's -> its, some times -> sometimes, capitalization, waves -> wave, typoes.", "date": "2011-04-04T12:09:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "they - They", "date": "2011-04-04T12:44:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "Added tags: factory.

And, yes, I am who you think I am. Let's not make any more of this than it is. You know my number, and I know enough about you to make a duplicate that even your mother wouldn't be able to tell apart from the real you. No, that's not a threat, just a fact.</p>\n<p>Now, as to my business here, it seems you have stumbled upon something above your clearance. Well, no, stumbled is not the right word. Dug up? Perhaps. And you are getting to the point where further digging would end in some fairly lethal gunshot wounds. This would be a sad state of affairs, as you are otherwise quite a good researcher. Therefore, you are getting something very few people in the Foundation ever get\u2026 an explanation.</p>\n<p>Yes, we were alerted when you first started digging into SCP-001. Every researcher who's been around for a while looks into it. Most are satisfied when they uncover the angel with the flaming sword, it's buried under enough levels. But then you started looking into The Factory, and that is when I knew you wouldn't stop. So, here it is, plain and simple.</p>\n<p>The Factory is SCP-001.</p>\n<p>But it will never be written up. It was a choice I made early on in the creation of the Foundation, and a choice I still stand by. You researchers are far too curious. I'm not sure which scares me worse. That we'll never understand the Factory\u2026 or that we one day will. Ah well, I'm sure you're eager to learn more.</p>\n<p>The Factory was built in 1835. Back then it was known as The Anderson Factory, named after James Anderson, a rather well-to-do industrialist. It was built in, well, we'll just say America, and was the largest factory yet designed, a good mile across at its widest, three stories tall throughout, with a special seven story tower by the front gate that Anderson lived in. It was designed to be the ultimate factory, capable of taking care of everything, including the housing of workers. People could be born, work, live, and die, without ever leaving the confines of the Factory. And work they did, on everything from cattle raising and slaughtering, to textiles, to everything else under the sun.</p>\n<p>Now, no one knows whether James Anderson was actually a Satan worshiper. It's just as likely that he followed some kind of Pagan gods. What is known is that he was VERY exact in the building of his factory, and in the placement of his machinery within it. Survivors claim the floor was engraved with arcane symbols, that were only visible when blood flowed across them\u2026 But then the survivors claimed a lot of things. What is known is that Anderson made his money on the blood and sweat, and sometimes body parts of the lower class. His journals indicate he thought of them as less than human, being put on this Earth only to serve his will.</p>\n<p>Of course, at that time, no one knew about his predilections, and so people flocked to the Factory. A place to both work and live at the same time? Well, of course people wanted in! Never mind the harsh hours, working conditions, sadistic security force, and all the rest. Factory workers were forced to work 16 hour days, work only shutting down on Sundays, between sunrise and sunset. Workers were not given individual rooms, instead sharing rooms with eight other people, sleeping in shifts of three. Medical attention was unheard of. If you were injured in the course of your duties, which most people were, you were expected to just keep working. Anyone too injured to work was dragged off by the security, never to be heard from again.</p>\n<p>For forty years, the Anderson Factory cranked out all sorts of things for people. Meat, clothes, weapons. Never mind that the beef might be mixed with human. Don't care that the weapons were forged in blood. No attention need be paid that the clothes were dyed with\u2026well, you get the idea. Rumors leaked out, but the products were so good, why bother? Until someone got out.</p>\n<p>I never met the brave soul who managed to escape, but she managed to meet with President Grant, and, in 1875, he enlisted my aid. At the time I was\u2026 well, it doesn't matter. We'll say I was military, kind of, and that my people were the same. A hundred and fifty good men and some few women, who were often given jobs that weren't supposed to be common knowledge. We'd been cleaning out some Confederate holdouts, and some of the worse things we found down South. So, we did some research, didn't like what we saw, and went in, loaded for bear.</p>\n<p>I don't actually remember much about the night it all went down. Most of it blends together in my head. I get flashes, sometimes, of the people chained to the line, living next to dead, and damned hard to tell which was which. Children working underneath machines, the majority of the flesh scoured from their bones by the great wheels and cogs. And the other things\u2026</p>\n<p>No, I'm all right. I haven't thought about that night for a very long time. The security force wasn't much of a problem. But then Anderson's creations showed up. He'd been taking the injured workers and, well, experimenting on them. Men, if you could call them men, with multiple arms, sewn together, some of them combined with animals, horrible monstrosities out of mankind's worst nightmares. They kept coming, wave after wave of not quite living creatures. I lost a lot of good people that night. And then we found Anderson's breeding pits, girls as young as eight, chained to the walls, forced to be nothing more than-</p>\n<p>I'm sorry. Even today, more than a century later, the memory makes me see red. When we finally found Anderson cowering in his office, we hung him from his tower window, with his own entrails. As he died, he laughed, saying it didn't matter, we could kill him, but his factory, The Factory, would go on. He was still laughing 24 hours later when we finally cut him down, had him drawn and quartered, and then burned the remains. The entire time he uttered blasphemies that I don't like to think about.</p>\n<p>We spent a week cleaning that place out, freeing the workers, putting down the things we found in the basements and many lightless rooms. We pulled out things that were useful, stocked them in a house near the gate, tried to make sense of everything. A hundred and fifty of us went into that hell pit that night, and only ninety-three came out. By the end of that week, we were down to seventy-one.</p>\n<p>But the things we found in there, my god. Well, you've been with the Foundation a while, they wouldn't seem as amazing to you, but we found toy guns that shot real bullets. A yo-yo that would flay the skin from anyone it touched, hammers that only worked on human flesh. A breed of skeletal horse that ran faster than anything we'd ever seen. Cloaks that seemed woven from the night itself, and let men access a shadowy dimension that\u2026 I get away from myself. We found tools, both wondrous and horrible. And we were faced with a choice.</p>\n<p>I gathered my highest ranking, well, we'll call them officers, to me, and we tried to figure out what we would do. They all had opinions. The Chaplain, he had gone a little crazed. Thought all these objects must be miracles sent from god, holy relics to be worshipped. Marshall and his little toady Dawkins thought there was a fortune to be made here, making and selling these things to the highest bidder. The Injun we all called Bass, due to his deep speaking voice, he called these things an abomination, and declared that we should hunt down and destroy everything we could find. And Smith thought we should take this stuff back to the president. The only one without an opinion was the old man, but he never said much of anything anyways. We argued for hours, days, trying to work it out. Me, I thought we were sitting on a gold mine, all right. But that we could use these things, these objects, to hunt down some of the scary things we'd run into down South, the other monsters this world had to offer, and use this factory for good, as a place to contain these things, find a way to make them work for our fellow man, or at least protect our fellow man from having to deal with them.</p>\n<p>I'm sure you can figure out what happened. The Chaplain snuck away in the night with his devotees, taking a couple of small items with him. Marshall we kicked out when we found him\u2026 abusing his authority. He promised he'd get revenge, and that little Dawkins shit led the rest of their group off with some of the juicier items. Bass and his people tried to light the whole damn thing on fire, then just left when it didn't work. And Smith left, to report back to the president. I did manage to get him to promise me he'd tell Grant the Factory had been destroyed. I had big plans for that place.</p>\n<p>A'course, it was kinda hard to follow through on big plans when you only have 12 other people to work with. But it was a start.</p>\n<p>And it worked, for a while. We had these amazing toys, and finding people to work with us was easy. Back then, going off the grid was as simple as leaving town. We knew what we wanted, we knew what we could be.</p>\n<p>Leventhal set out getting us backing. A simple invention here, some well invested money there, it all worked out. White and Jones set out getting us\u2026 other backing. In our previous work we'd found out some interesting things about people. Some secrets that powerful men didn't want getting out. And, with our new position helping keep secrets, we got more people asking us to deal with their secrets. Blackmail is a dirty word, but it works. Bright, Argent and Lumineux got to work cataloging the items. Light and Bright's wife, the nurse, they made sure we kept ourselves healthy. Heh. No, it's just, remembering Light. She had such unusual ideas about hygiene, for the time. Brilliant woman. Czov, Fleischer and Carnoff dealt with training the troops. Tesla and Tamlin were in charge of figuring out how to take advantage of the items, without making it obvious.</p>\n<p>We were amazing. The city we built around the Factory, which we took to calling Site Alpha, was self supporting. Agents, researchers, operatives of all sorts\u2026 not by those names, of course, but those positions. We expanded.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>I'm sorry, I am an old man. I know I do not look it, but the body lies. The mind\u2026 doesn't always remember right. And sometimes I get lost in my memories. Things get confused. But, the long and simple of it is this: We used the Factory. It always seemed to have more empty rooms to store things in. Back then, that was the word for them, things. No Skips then, no. We thought we had the Factory tamed. That's one of the reasons I refuse to quit this job. If there's anything I can do here, it's remind people that we will NEVER tame these things. Contain them, yes, but as we saw with Able, tame them? Never.</p>\n<p>After a decade or so, we were pretty organized. The 13 original of us were being called by numbers, not names. We knew how to make things work. And, if a thing or two vanished inside of the Factory, still? And the occasional D-class? What? Yes, we had D-class back then. Disposables. That's where the D comes from. Had to have someone to test things on, Tesla and Tamlin were both very firm about that. But, yes, sometimes we lost people who didn't matter. Adam\u2026 sorry, Dr. Bright, was fond of saying it was the Factory taking its toll. You can't get something for nothing.</p>\n<p>1911 was when it all went wrong. Things\u2026 we called them faeries. An entire race of things, living beside us. They could look the same as you or I. The only obvious difference was an allergy to Iron. Yes, that's why we called them faeries. No, you haven't heard of them. Why? Because it's the one time the Foundation wiped out an entire race of things. Root and branch. And I'm the one who did it.</p>\n<p>We'd been hunting them for some time. We'd run into them a time or two before, come out on top. So, when a certain royal asked us for help, of course we were eager to get them in our debt. We've always loved having people in our debt. We sent a team to help out, take care of what we thought was a hunting party. The next time we saw them, their heads were on poles, attached to the saddles of the creatures the Faeries rode, when they attacked the Factory.</p>\n<p>It was horrible.</p>\n<p>Three words, but they convey so much. I have never\u2026 I'm sorry, please, give me a moment. I've never told this part to anyone. You should consider yourself lucky. And, if you ever tell anyone any of what I am about to impart on you, I will not just kill you, but everyone who shares your DNA, in the worst ways possible. You'll think Procedure 110-Montauk is a walk in the park compared to what I do to you.</p>\n<p>We lost. The things came, and they destroyed us. Rode over our emplacements, slaughtered our people, shrugged off our weapons like they were nothing. I watched my thirteen go down, left and right, just trying to hold the Factory. And I? I, their leader, their friend, their father figure? Godfather to the Bright's four young children. Confidant, sometimes lover, always the confessor? I ran. I ran like a scared little school boy, deep into the dark guts of the Factory. I was chased by the things, always just one step ahead. I could hear them behind me, feel their breath upon my neck, and \u2026</p>\n<p>I came to a door I'd never seen before. A bronze door, covered in Arabic script of some sort. I've never been one for languages, especially not the curvy bullshit the musselmen use. But I didn't care. They were coming for me, and I threw the door open and dived through it. Everything inside\u2026 was different. There was a feeling of peace, that nothing could hurt me here. The light was this dark red, but still felt right. My ears were filled with the steady thrumming of a gigantic heartbeat. And, in front of me, were the remains of Anderson. It spoke to me then, but I'll be damned if I could tell you exactly what it said. What it told me was more meaning, than exact. It offered me hope. It told me\u2026 it told me that each of the things we had used from the Factory, no matter what we did with them, fed it. Helped it grow. But, if the Faeries took the Factory, they would destroy it, and we couldn't have that. It offered me\u2026 a deal. It could remove this event. Make it have never happened. All I needed to give it was\u2026 us.</p>\n<p>I didn't want to. I knew it was a bad idea. But then, I saw them again, my family, my friends, dead. Dead by the hands of those bastards\u2026 I agreed. It smiled. And I found myself once more upon the ramparts, watching the horde of Faeries crest the hill. My Foundation alive once more. In my hands was a weapon. I won't bore you with the details, but we slaughtered them. And, with these new weapons, continued to slaughter them, everywhere they lived, everywhere they bred. My fellow O5s questioned my decision, thinking we should save some, in case we might ever need them\u2026 I overruled them.</p>\n<p>We moved away from the Factory. Shut it down. Moved our things out of there. We changed the name from things to Special Containment Protocols, focusing on containing them, not\u2026 anything else. The others were curious, but understood I had my reasons. I boarded up the Factory. Locked it shut. Buried it under a ton of rubble, saying it was too dangerous. I thought\u2026 thought I'd gotten away with it. Until I found a thing on my desk. One of the old toy guns that shot real bullets. And it had the Factory label on it.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I've sent people in, from time to time, to see what it might be doing. Last time I sent people in to look, there was nothing there. We keep finding Factory items out there. I can't help but think of how many more we don't find. The people who use them, and keep it hidden. I think back to the body telling me how each item used gave energy to the Factory. I never asked it 'energy for what?' I don't think I want to know.</p>\n<p>What do we give it? D-class, mostly. Where DID you think all those bodies went? There's a place. Bodies are left, and they vanish. Everyone thinks I'm a genius for figuring it out. Sometimes\u2026 sometimes I have to feed it other things. Researchers. Agents. They never know it's coming. It just reaches out and takes them.</p>\n<p>But, in the end, we're doing more good by being here. Whatever the Factory wants, whatever it IS\u2026 We're doing good here. I have to believe that.</p>\n<p>And now you know. Are you happy? I didn't think so. Why tell you? I'm getting old, Everett. Should I die, someone will have to keep feeding it. Maybe you'll be different. Maybe you'll figure out how to stand up to it.</p>\n<p>\u2026 But I doubt it.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-001-o5\">SCP-001:O5</a>\" by AdminBright, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

And, yes, I am who you think I am. Let's not make any more of this than it is. You know my number, and I know enough about you to make a duplicate that even your mother wouldn't be able to tell apart from the real you. No, that's not a threat, just a fact.\n\n\n\nNow, as to my business here, it seems you have stumbled upon something above your clearance. Well, no, stumbled is not the right word. Dug up? Perhaps. And you are getting to the point where further digging would end in some fairly lethal gunshot wounds. This would be a sad state of affairs, as you are otherwise quite a good researcher. Therefore, you are getting something very few people in the Foundation ever get... an explanation.\n\n\n\nYes, we were alerted when you first started digging into SCP-001. Every researcher who's been around for a while looks into it. Most are satisfied when they uncover the angel with the flaming sword, it's buried under enough levels. But then you started looking into The Factory, and that is when I knew you wouldn't stop. So, here it is, plain and simple.\n\n\n\nThe Factory is SCP-001.\n\n\n\nBut it will never be written up. It was a choice I made early on in the creation of the Foundation, and a choice I still stand by. You researchers are far too curious. I'm not sure which scares me worse. That we'll never understand the Factory... or that we one day will. Ah well, I'm sure you're eager to learn more.\n\n\n\nThe Factory was built in 1835. Back then it was known as The Anderson Factory, named after James Anderson, a rather well-to-do industrialist. It was built in, well, we'll just say America, and was the largest factory yet designed, a good mile across at its widest, three stories tall throughout, with a special seven story tower by the front gate that Anderson lived in. It was designed to be the ultimate factory, capable of taking care of everything, including the housing of workers.\u00a0\u00a0People could be born, work, live, and die, without ever leaving the confines of the Factory. And work they did, on everything from cattle raising and slaughtering, to textiles, to everything else under the sun.\n\n\n\nNow, no one knows whether James Anderson was actually a Satan worshiper. It's just as likely that he followed some kind of Pagan gods. What is known is that he was VERY exact in the building of his factory, and in the placement of his machinery within it. Survivors claim the floor was engraved with arcane symbols, that were only visible when blood flowed across them... But then the survivors claimed a lot of things. What is known is that Anderson made his money on the blood and sweat, and sometimes body parts of the lower class. His journals indicate he thought of them as less than human, being put on this Earth only to serve his will. \n\n\n\nOf course, at that time, no one knew about his predilections, and so people flocked to the Factory. A place to both work and live at the same time? Well, of course people wanted in! Never mind the harsh hours, working conditions, sadistic security force, and all the rest. Factory workers were forced to work 16 hour days, work only shutting down on Sundays, between sunrise and sunset. Workers were not given individual rooms, instead sharing rooms with eight other people, sleeping in shifts of three. Medical attention was unheard of. If you were injured in the course of your duties, which most people were, you were expected to just keep working. Anyone too injured to work was dragged off by the security, never to be heard from again.\n\n\n\nFor forty years, the Anderson Factory cranked out all sorts of things for people. Meat, clothes, weapons. Never mind that the beef might be mixed with human. Don't care that the weapons were forged in blood. No attention need be paid that the clothes were dyed with...well, you get the idea. Rumors leaked out, but the products were so good, why bother? Until someone got out.\n\n\n\nI never met the brave soul who managed to escape, but she managed to meet with President Grant, and, in 1875, he enlisted my aid. At the time I was... well, it doesn't matter. We'll say I was military, kind of, and that my people were the same. A hundred and fifty good men and some few women, who were often given jobs that weren't supposed to be common knowledge. We'd been cleaning out some Confederate holdouts, and some of the worse things we found down South.\u00a0\u00a0So, we did some research, didn't like what we saw, and went in, loaded for bear.\n\n\n\nI don't actually remember much about the night it all went down. Most of it blends together in my head. I get flashes, sometimes, of the people chained to the line, living next to dead, and damned hard to tell which was which. Children working underneath machines, the majority of the flesh scoured from their bones by the great wheels and cogs. And the other things...\n\n\n\nNo, I'm all right. I haven't thought about that night for a very long time. The security force wasn't much of a problem. But then Anderson's creations showed up. He'd been taking the injured workers and, well, experimenting on them. Men, if you could call them men, with multiple arms, sewn together, some of them combined with animals, horrible monstrosities out of mankind's worst nightmares. They kept coming, wave after wave of not quite living creatures. I lost a lot of good people that night. And then we found Anderson's breeding pits, girls as young as eight, chained to the walls, forced to be nothing more than-\n\n\n\nI'm sorry. Even today, more than a century later, the memory makes me see red. When we finally found Anderson cowering in his office, we hung him from his tower window, with his own entrails. As he died, he laughed, saying it didn't matter, we could kill him, but his factory, The Factory, would go on. He was still laughing 24 hours later when we finally cut him down, had him drawn and quartered, and then burned the remains. The entire time he uttered blasphemies that I don't like to think about.\n\n\n\nWe spent a week cleaning that place out, freeing the workers, putting down the things we found in the basements and many lightless rooms. We pulled out things that were useful, stocked them in a house near the gate, tried to make sense of everything. A hundred and fifty of us went into that hell pit that night, and only ninety-three came out. By the end of that week, we were down to seventy-one. \n\n\n\nBut the things we found in there, my god. Well, you've been with the Foundation a while, they wouldn't seem as amazing to you, but we found toy guns that shot real bullets. A yo-yo that would flay the skin from anyone it touched, hammers that only worked on human flesh. A breed of skeletal horse that ran faster than anything we'd ever seen. Cloaks that seemed woven from the night itself, and let men access a shadowy dimension that... I get away from myself. We found tools, both wondrous and horrible. And we were faced with a choice.\n\n\n\nI gathered my highest ranking, well, we'll call them officers, to me, and we tried to figure out what we would do. They all had opinions. The Chaplain, he had gone a little crazed. Thought all these objects must be miracles sent from god, holy relics to be worshipped. Marshall and his little toady Dawkins thought there was a fortune to be made here, making and selling these things to the highest bidder. The Injun we all called Bass, due to his deep speaking voice, he called these things an abomination, and declared that we should hunt down and destroy everything we could find. And Smith thought we should take this stuff back to the president. The only one without an opinion was the old man, but he never said much of anything anyways. We argued for hours, days, trying to work it out. Me, I thought we were sitting on a gold mine, all right. But that we could use these things, these objects, to hunt down some of the scary things we'd run into down South, the other monsters this world had to offer, and use this factory for good, as a place to contain these things, find a way to make them work for our fellow man, or at least protect our fellow man from having to deal with them.\n\n\n\nI'm sure you can figure out what happened. The Chaplain snuck away in the night with his devotees, taking a couple of small items with him. Marshall we kicked out when we found him... abusing his authority. He promised he'd get revenge, and that little Dawkins shit led the rest of their group off with some of the juicier items. Bass and his people tried to light the whole damn thing on fire, then just left when it didn't work. And Smith left, to report back to the president. I did manage to get him to promise me he'd tell Grant the Factory had been destroyed. I had big plans for that place.\n\n\n\nA'course, it was kinda hard to follow through on big plans when you only have 12 other people to work with. But it was a start.\n\n\n\nAnd it worked, for a while. We had these amazing toys, and finding people to work with us was easy. Back then, going off the grid was as simple as leaving town. We knew what we wanted, we knew what we could be. \n\n\n\nLeventhal set out getting us backing. A simple invention here, some well invested money there, it all worked out. White and Jones set out getting us... other backing. In our previous work we'd found out some interesting things about people. Some secrets that powerful men didn't want getting out. And, with our new position helping keep secrets, we got more people asking us to deal with their secrets. Blackmail is a dirty word, but it works. Bright, Argent and Lumineux got to work cataloging the items. Light and Bright's wife, the nurse, they made sure we kept ourselves healthy. Heh. No, it's just, remembering Light. She had such unusual ideas about hygiene, for the time. Brilliant woman. Czov, Fleischer and Carnoff dealt with training the troops. Tesla and Tamlin were in charge of figuring out how to take advantage of the items, without making it obvious.\n\n\n\nWe were amazing. The city we built around the Factory, which we took to calling Site Alpha, was self supporting. Agents, researchers, operatives of all sorts... not by those names, of course, but those positions. We expanded.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nI'm sorry, I am an old man. I know I do not look it, but the body lies. The mind... doesn't always remember right. And sometimes I get lost in my memories. Things get confused. But, the long and simple of it is this: We used the Factory. It always seemed to have more empty rooms to store things in. Back then, that was the word for them, things. No Skips then, no. We thought we had the Factory tamed. That's one of the reasons I refuse to quit this job. If there's anything I can do here, it's remind people\u00a0\u00a0that we will NEVER tame these things. Contain them, yes, but as we saw with Able, tame them? Never.\n\n\n\nAfter a decade or so, we were pretty organized. The 13 original of us were being called by numbers, not names. We knew how to make things work. And, if a thing or two vanished inside of the Factory, still? And the occasional D-class? What? Yes, we had D-class back then. Disposables. That's where the D comes from. Had to have someone to test things on, Tesla and Tamlin were both very firm about that. But, yes, sometimes we lost people who didn't matter. Adam... sorry, Dr. Bright, was fond of saying it was the Factory taking its toll. You can't get something for nothing.\n\n\n\n1911 was when it all went wrong. Things... we called them faeries. An entire race of things, living beside us. They could look the same as you or I. The only obvious difference was an allergy to Iron. Yes, that's why we called them faeries. No, you haven't heard of them. Why? Because it's the one time the Foundation wiped out an entire race of things. Root and branch. And I'm the one who did it.\n\n\n\nWe'd been hunting them for some time. We'd run into them a time or two before, come out on top. So, when a certain royal asked us for help, of course we were eager to get them in our debt. We've always loved having people in our debt. We sent a team to help out, take care of what we thought was a hunting party. The next time we saw them, their heads were on poles, attached to the saddles of the creatures the Faeries rode, when they attacked the Factory.\n\n\n\nIt was horrible.\n\n\n\nThree words, but they convey so much. I have never... I'm sorry, please, give me a moment. I've never told this part to anyone. You should consider yourself lucky. And, if you ever tell anyone any of what I am about to impart on you, I will not just kill you, but everyone who shares your DNA, in the worst ways possible. You'll think Procedure 110-Montauk is a walk in the park compared to what I do to you.\n\n\n\nWe lost. The things came, and they destroyed us. Rode over our emplacements, slaughtered our people, shrugged off our weapons like they were nothing. I watched my thirteen go down, left and right, just trying to hold the Factory. And I? I, their leader, their friend, their father figure? Godfather to the Bright's four young children. Confidant, sometimes lover, always the confessor? I ran. I ran like a scared little school boy, deep into the dark guts of the Factory. I was chased by the things, always just one step ahead. I could hear them behind me, feel their breath upon my neck, and ...\n\n\n\nI came to a door I'd never seen before. A bronze door, covered in Arabic script of some sort.

I have to believe that. \n\n\n\nAnd now you know. Are you happy? I didn't think so. Why tell you? I'm getting old, Everett. Should I die, someone will have to keep feeding it. Maybe you'll be different. Maybe you'll figure out how to stand up to it.\n\n\n\n... But I doubt it.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["001-proposal", "_licensebox", "bleak", "doctor-mann", "factory", "faerie", "fantasy", "featured", "historical", "horror", "tale"], "title": "SCP-001:O5 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-001-o5", "year": 2010}, "scp-9005-2": {"created_at": "2010-09-01T04:07:00", "creator": "agatharights", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-01T04:07:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-01T04:07:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "sp", "date": "2010-09-02T01:08:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:52:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Nothing special about that, just a vague, nauseous rumble in her stomach that had her going to the bathroom every hour or so to empty her bladder.

One of the girls had stopped drawing, and was quietly sitting, singing wordlessly to herself the same gentle, repeating tune, while the other was scribbling in the last few details with the remaining nub of her crayon.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd SCP-9005-1 only has this effect with the original recording?\u201d Gears asked, and she nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve conducted additional testing with recordings of the original, as well as vocal or synthesized versions, with no effect.

Once puberty starts for the individual they are rendered immune, and no children under the age of three have been exposed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Doctor Gears was silent, and Evelyn held her breath. Finally, he spoke again.<br/>\n\u201cAnd do the effects fade with separation from SCP-9005-1?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sir, they seem to be permanent once started.\u201d He nodded, was quiet for a few more moments, writing down a short note\u2026and then without a word, he left. Evelyn sighed in relief. No response was a good response, when it came from Doctor Gears. Turning to the observation window, she looked at the girls.</p>\n<p>They stood, longingly staring at the ceiling and walls where they couldn\u2019t reach, singing to themselves for a few minutes more before going quiet and sitting down, looking tired and listless.</p>\n<p>Evelyn\u2019s stomach gurgled, and she cursed softly, heading to the ladies\u2019 room. No more coffee, she swore.</p>\n<p>It was later that week she discovered her pregnancy, and in what seemed, to Evelyn, to be no time at all, she was off on maternity leave, singing a little pink bundle of colic to sleep every night. She never thought, in her sleepless state, about the tune, a soft upbeat melody, that she hummed to her daughter to calm her.</p>\n<p>It was, after all, just a song that had gotten stuck in her head.</p>\n<p>And it calmed little Emily Weston down.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Years Later</strong></p>\n<p>Evelyn missed her family, but she tried not to think about it too much. She still got to see her daughter, every other weekend, and it seemed unfair that it was all the time the courts ruled she could have, but she would take what she could get. Besides, her ex-husband was a kind man, and an excellent father, and his wife a wonderful and attentive mother. More than Evelyn, who would become obsessed and lost in her work at times, could say.</p>\n<p>Still, she missed her little girl, Emily, the sweet child, especially now that she\u2019d missed the past month of visits because of work. Emily was her life when she had weekends off, though, even if the little girl was plagued with nightmares and demanded, often times loudly, to be sung to sleep at night, her mother always obliged.</p>\n<p>But now\u2026now she was trapped in work. Evelyn sighed deeply as she poured over pages of reports on a new SCP, designation 8776. She swore, she\u2019d never figure out how this damn numbering system worked.</p>\n<p>Looking up at the clock, hoping that it was almost time to go, she couldn\u2019t stop a small yelp from escaping as she found Gears standing in her office, stock still and silent as a ghost. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Doctor Weston.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Hello Doctor Gears.\u201d She said, rubbing her face. How embarrassing. \u201cWhat can I do you for, Sir?\u201d He took a seat and held out a file to her, one emblazoned with the numbers 9005 in bold stencil. She cautiously took the file, for a second wondering if this was some mistake she had made years ago when she had been part of the 9005 team. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are decommissioning SCP-9005-1 officially, and it was proposed that, as the original lead researcher, you would prefer to look over all the data to make sure that there is nothing missed, in your opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded. A formality then, as she opened the folder and started to skim. The effect had never faded away from the children, it seemed, and she frowned at that. Even if those children had just been subjects, bound by a force beyond their control, she still felt bad for them, and she skimmed along further, not truly reading but thinking about children and Emily. She would be about the right age now\u2026</p>\n<p>Then, she stopped, and stared.</p>\n<p>Doctor Gears, inhumanly perceptive as it was, stood. \u201cDoctor Weston, is something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t answer, instead she dropped the file, letting the paper\u2019s scatter, and was power walking out the door of her office as she pulled out her cell phone. Doctor Gears took the time to carefully reorganize the papers and place them back in the file. He did not give chase, at least.</p>\n<p><em>\u201dHello, Bob Weston speaking.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201dBobby!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201dEvelyn? Hey, I was just about to call you. I know that you\u2019ve been busy, lately, but\u2026I wanted you to come see Emily this week, rather than next, if you can make it. There\u2019s something\u2026important that we need to talk about.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Evelyn\u2019s face went pale as she kept walking hastily towards the garage, flashing her badge at the guard and running to her car.</p>\n<p><em>\u201dWhat? What is it? Is there something wrong with Emily?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201dMaybe it\u2019s better to talk in person. It is a really recent development, and they psychologist says that it\u2019s too soon to tell if there\u2019s anything wrong, developmentally-\u201c</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201dI\u2019ll be there in an hour.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201dEve, what\u2019s wro-?\u201d</em> She hung up, started her car, and peeled off, thanking God that she didn\u2019t live that far away, and what distance between the base and town was all unmarked, rarely patrolled country highway.</p>\n<p>Doctor Gears, satisfied with the papers all in order again, proceeded to read quickly through the file, finding the page and paragraph she had stopped upon. If one looked closely, one could almost swear that he frowned. Almost. But not quite. It may have been a mild myoclonic twitch, or a trick of the light, most likely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While initial testing using the melody from SCP-9005-1 yielded no effects, later testing showed that repeated exposure to just the melody from SCP-9005-1 through other means (vocal, instrumental, or otherwise) could result in SCP-9005-2 developing, albeit at a much decreased rate. The decreased effects took place between one to two years after exposure, and did not develop until the subject developed the proper physical coordination capable of manipulating the environment-</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He closed the file, and picked up the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecure Task Forces. I need a small team to go to Doctor Weston\u2019s home, as well as the home of her ex-husband. Yes, the address should be in her file.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evelyn prayed, hard, as she charged in through the door of her ex-husband\u2019s home, looking around. Bob blinked at her, startled, before raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cEve, are you okay? You look like you\u2019ve seen a gho-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s wrong with Emily!\u201d She barked, stepping right up to his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa! Whoa\u2026calm down. She\u2019s just\u2026developed some weird behavior, that\u2019s all. She hasn\u2019t been talking a lot, lately, and started drawing on her walls. The doctor said that it\u2019s probably just kid stuff, but he wants her to come back in a few months to make sure she isn\u2019t autistic or-\u201c Evelyn didn\u2019t wait for an answer, and ran up the stairs two by two to Emily\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmily!\u201d She shouted, pushing the door open\u2026and freezing. Emily had been hard at work, it seemed. The little girl had even managed, through piles of toys and boxes and drawers, to reach her ceiling. The mural that covered every square inch of space in the room was made of a variety of materials. She saw crayons, paints, pens, pencils, even makeup cases scattered about, and yet it was horrifically detailed.</p>\n<p>But there was not Emily.</p>\n<p>She stepped into the room, cautiously, to the center, and looked around, an immense sense of deja-vu overcoming her. She knew this scene, and from the center of the room, every surface had been painted to give the perfect illusion that she was standing in the middle of it. If it weren\u2019t for the open door, she thought, she would have never believed she was in a child\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>It was beautiful, there was no denying that. A forest of violet trees with brilliant blue leaves was to one way, a bit in the distance but not too far at all, each branch in perfect clarity. Gray-violet grasses and red flowers were painted and scrawled upon the floor and the walls, a wide field punctuated with crimson bushes and green fruits hanging off a large navy-blue tree, that had been painted up and up onto the ceiling, it\u2019s branches framing the light fixture, which the girl had painted into a red-orange sun. And the sky, oh the sky! Three moons, all different hues, to every side, and the sky itself was brilliant sunset hues of pink and yellow, with white clouds, and a black thunderhead far off in the distance over snow-capped mountains.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmily!\u201d She cried out. She\u2019d never seen a drawing this extensive. She heard a faint rustling, and the giggle of a little girl, and without thinking she reached for the door, swinging it shut to reveal the girl behind it.</p>\n<p>Except there was nobody behind the door.</p>\n<p>And Evelyn felt the overwhelming sense that she had just done something terribly wrong.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The effects of SCP-9005-1 seem to be culminating in manipulating SCP-9005-2 to complete a complete round-eye view of what is best described as \u201cotherworldly scenery\u201d. Once the illusion is complete, when viewed from the center of whatever space SCP-9005-2 had been manipulating, it appears to be in every single direction a perfect picture of the landscape, as if one were truly in the picture itself. The dangers of the effect are not fully explored, as once the illusion is perfected, individuals who view it in it\u2019s entirety without any breaks in the scenery inexplicably cease to exist.<br/>\nRadio contact with vanished individual can be maintained for no more than thirty seconds, during which individuals equipped with transmitters describe their setting as a beautiful alien world, rather than just an image.<br/>\nIt is believed to be safe to assume that the full extent of SCP-9005-1\u2019s effects are, in fact, to transport individuals to a particular place. No testing conducted had revealed if this is its place of origin or simply a random location.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She stepped back, and the door vanished from sight, hidden in the perfectly painted scene. Evelyn held her breath, wondering if, perhaps, she should not have skimmed, she should have actually read the report in its entirety. Then, she heard it, and turned on her heel. Singing, soft voices singing, and reedy instruments, in the distance. It was music, and she knew that music well. It was SCP-9005-1, clear as she\u2019d ever heard it, although this time punctuated with the voices of children and other sounds.</p>\n<p>She stepped forwards, cautiously, moving to touch the wall, and jerked back when there was none there, and the grayish grasses crunched under her shoes. The earth, reddish and clay-like, crumbled under her footsteps, and when she bent down to pick a brilliant scarlet flower, she found that it was as real as the door had been moments ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Evelyn jerked up, and found Emily\u2019s smiling face peering out from the grass.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby!\u201d She shouted, moving to scoop the small child up in her arms, before something moving too fast to be seen as anything but a blur knocked her away. She sailed through the air just a short meter, but it felt like it took forever to hit the ground, the wind knocked out of her. A wince, and she opened her eyes to see bare feet, and slowly, painfully, sit up to look at her attacker.</p>\n<p>The young girl couldn\u2019t have been more than nine or ten, but she was tall. Tall and thin, ethereal in appearance, like somebody had stretched her out. She looked down at Evelyn with cold, pale eyes, and Evelyn gasped.</p>\n<p>\u201cSubject Twelve.\u201d She breathed out, wheezing. The thin, naked young girl stared down at Evelyn impassively. The face was recognizable, after all, she had spent hours and hours looking over the children\u2019s files, looking at their faces. But the girl was pale, so pale that she could see the veins under her skin, and so tall and thin that she, for a second, had to think to realize that she wasn\u2019t a teenager yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cMomma!\u201d Emily gasped, stunned and staring at her mother, hands and clothes smeared with paint.</p>\n<p>\u201cB-baby-!\u201d Evelyn tried to gasp out again, but Subject Twelve\u2019s foot, curiously elongated, crashed down on her, filling her vision. There was a tremendous crunch, and the fleeting thought that, this child, this tall thin child\u2026could not possibly have weighed enough or have been strong enough to hurt her like this.</p>\n<p>Then she thought no more. Ever.</p>\n<p>Emily, meanwhile, started to cry, as the red clay earth guzzled her mother\u2019s dark blood, before the other girl, the older, elfin one, picked her up gently and soothed her with a few hummed bars of song that erased all the pain from the toddler\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh\u2026don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mommy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no..it wasn\u2019t your momma. Just a monster who looked like her. Do you understand?\u201d Emily stared at the older girl, and nodded, sniffing a little bit. \u201c\u2026Ready to go back to singing with the others?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-okay.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Addendum 877-5<br/>\nDoctor Weston\u2019s residence and the residence of family destroyed, as well as all video and vocal recordings of any member of the Weston family using SCP-9005-1.<br/>\nDoctor Weston\u2019s Status: Missing.

Nothing special about that, just a vague, nauseous rumble in her stomach that had her going to the bathroom every hour or so to empty her bladder. Of course, it might as well have been too much coffee, too, she knew that she tended to overdo the caffeine when a new SCP came in that she was assigned to.\n\n\n\nThe thought, of her mild flu skipped over her mind, though, as she looked over the containment room with a small frown.

She would be about the right age now\u2026\n\n\n\nThen, she stopped, and stared.\n\n\n\nDoctor Gears, inhumanly perceptive as it was, stood. \u201cDoctor Weston, is something wrong?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer, instead she dropped the file, letting the paper\u2019s scatter, and was power walking out the door of her office as she pulled out her cell phone. Doctor Gears took the time to carefully reorganize the papers and place them back in the file. He did not give chase, at least.\n\n\n\n//\u201dHello, Bob Weston speaking.\u201d//\n\n\n\n//\u201dBobby!\u201d//\n\n\n\n//\u201dEvelyn? Hey, I was just about to call you. I know that you\u2019ve been busy, lately, but\u2026I wanted you to come see Emily this week, rather than next, if you can make it. There\u2019s something\u2026important that we need to talk about.\u201d//\n\n\n\nEvelyn\u2019s face went pale as she kept walking hastily towards the garage, flashing her badge at the guard and running to her car.\n\n\n\n//\u201dWhat? What is it? Is there something wrong with Emily?\u201d//\n\n\n\n//\u201dMaybe it\u2019s better to talk in person. It is a really recent development, and they psychologist says that it\u2019s too soon to tell if there\u2019s anything wrong, developmentally-\u201c//\n\n\n\n//\u201dI\u2019ll be there in an hour.\u201d// \n\n\n\n//\u201dEve, what\u2019s wro-?\u201d// She hung up, started her car, and peeled off, thanking God that she didn\u2019t live that far away, and what distance between the base and town was all unmarked, rarely patrolled country highway.\n\n\n\nDoctor Gears, satisfied with the papers all in order again, proceeded to read quickly through the file, finding the page and paragraph she had stopped upon. If one looked closely, one could almost swear that he frowned. Almost. But not quite. It may have been a mild myoclonic twitch, or a trick of the light, most likely.\n\n\n\n> While initial testing using the melody from SCP-9005-1 yielded no effects, later testing showed that repeated exposure to just the melody from SCP-9005-1 through other means (vocal, instrumental, or otherwise) could result in SCP-9005-2 developing, albeit at a much decreased rate. The decreased effects took place between one to two years after exposure, and did not develop until the subject developed the proper physical coordination capable of manipulating the environment-\n\n\n\nHe closed the file, and picked up the phone.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecure Task Forces. I need a small team to go to Doctor Weston\u2019s home, as well as the home of her ex-husband. Yes, the address should be in her file.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvelyn prayed, hard, as she charged in through the door of her ex-husband\u2019s home, looking around. Bob blinked at her, startled, before raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cEve, are you okay? You look like you\u2019ve seen a gho-\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cTell me, what\u2019s wrong with Emily!\u201d She barked, stepping right up to his face.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoa! Whoa\u2026calm down. She\u2019s just\u2026developed some weird behavior, that\u2019s all. She hasn\u2019t been talking a lot, lately, and started drawing on her walls. The doctor said that it\u2019s probably just kid stuff, but he wants her to come back in a few months to make sure she isn\u2019t autistic or-\u201c Evelyn didn\u2019t wait for an answer, and ran up the stairs two by two to Emily\u2019s room.\n\n\n\n\u201cEmily!\u201d She shouted, pushing the door open\u2026and freezing. Emily had been hard at work, it seemed. The little girl had even managed, through piles of toys and boxes and drawers, to reach her ceiling. The mural that covered every square inch of space in the room was made of a variety of materials. She saw crayons, paints, pens, pencils, even makeup cases scattered about, and yet it was horrifically detailed.\n\n\n\nBut there was not Emily.\n\n\n\nShe stepped into the room, cautiously, to the center, and looked around, an immense sense of deja-vu overcoming her. She knew this scene, and from the center of the room, every surface had been painted to give the perfect illusion that she was standing in the middle of it. If it weren\u2019t for the open door, she thought, she would have never believed she was in a child\u2019s room.\n\n\n\nIt was beautiful, there was no denying that. A forest of violet trees with brilliant blue leaves was to one way, a bit in the distance but not too far at all, each branch in perfect clarity. Gray-violet grasses and red flowers were painted and scrawled upon the floor and the walls, a wide field punctuated with crimson bushes and green fruits hanging off a large navy-blue tree, that had been painted up and up onto the ceiling, it\u2019s branches framing the light fixture, which the girl had painted into a red-orange sun. And the sky, oh the sky! Three moons, all different hues, to every side, and the sky itself was brilliant sunset hues of pink and yellow, with white clouds, and a black thunderhead far off in the distance over snow-capped mountains.\n\n\n\n\u201cEmily!\u201d She cried out. She\u2019d never seen a drawing this extensive. She heard a faint rustling, and the giggle of a little girl, and without thinking she reached for the door, swinging it shut to reveal the girl behind it.\n\n\n\nExcept there was nobody behind the door.\n\n\n\nAnd Evelyn felt the overwhelming sense that she had just done something terribly wrong.\n\n\n\n> The effects of SCP-9005-1 seem to be culminating in manipulating SCP-9005-2 to complete a complete round-eye view of what is best described as \u201cotherworldly scenery\u201d. Once the illusion is complete, when viewed from the center of whatever space SCP-9005-2 had been manipulating, it appears to be in every single direction a perfect picture of the landscape, as if one were truly in the picture itself. The dangers of the effect are not fully explored, as once the illusion is perfected, individuals who view it in it\u2019s entirety without any breaks in the scenery inexplicably cease to exist.\n\n> Radio contact with vanished individual can be maintained for no more than thirty seconds, during which individuals equipped with transmitters describe their setting as a beautiful alien world, rather than just an image.\n\n> It is believed to be safe to assume that the full extent of SCP-9005-1\u2019s effects are, in fact, to transport individuals to a particular place. No testing conducted had revealed if this is its place of origin or simply a random location.\n\n\n\nShe stepped back, and the door vanished from sight, hidden in the perfectly painted scene. Evelyn held her breath, wondering if, perhaps, she should not have skimmed, she should have actually read the report in its entirety. Then, she heard it, and turned on her heel. Singing, soft voices singing, and reedy instruments, in the distance. It was music, and she knew that music well. It was SCP-9005-1, clear as she\u2019d ever heard it, although this time punctuated with the voices of children and other sounds.\n\n\n\nShe stepped forwards, cautiously, moving to touch the wall, and jerked back when there was none there, and the grayish grasses crunched under her shoes. The earth, reddish and clay-like, crumbled under her footsteps, and when she bent down to pick a brilliant scarlet flower, she found that it was as real as the door had been moments ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cMommy!\u201d Evelyn jerked up, and found Emily\u2019s smiling face peering out from the grass.\n\n\n\n\u201cBaby!\u201d She shouted, moving to scoop the small child up in her arms, before something moving too fast to be seen as anything but a blur knocked her away. She sailed through the air just a short meter, but it felt like it took forever to hit the ground, the wind knocked out of her. A wince, and she opened her eyes to see bare feet, and slowly, painfully, sit up to look at her attacker.\n\n\n\nThe young girl couldn\u2019t have been more than nine or ten, but she was tall. Tall and thin, ethereal in appearance, like somebody had stretched her out. She looked down at Evelyn with cold, pale eyes, and Evelyn gasped.\n\n\n\n\u201cSubject Twelve.\u201d She breathed out, wheezing. The thin, naked young girl stared down at Evelyn impassively. The face was recognizable, after all, she had spent hours and hours looking over the children\u2019s files, looking at their faces. But the girl was pale, so pale that she could see the veins under her skin, and so tall and thin that she, for a second, had to think to realize that she wasn\u2019t a teenager yet.\n\n\n\n\u201cMomma!\u201d Emily gasped, stunned and staring at her mother, hands and clothes smeared with paint.\n\n\n\n\u201cB-baby-!\u201d Evelyn tried to gasp out again, but Subject Twelve\u2019s foot, curiously elongated, crashed down on her, filling her vision. There was a tremendous crunch, and\u00a0\u00a0the fleeting thought that, this child, this tall thin child\u2026could not possibly have weighed enough or have been strong enough to hurt her like this.\n\n\n\nThen she thought no more. Ever.\n\n\n\nEmily, meanwhile, started to cry, as the red clay earth guzzled her mother\u2019s dark blood, before the other girl, the older, elfin one, picked her up gently and soothed her with a few hummed bars of song that erased all the pain from the toddler\u2019s head.\n\n\n\n\u201cShh\u2026don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mommy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no..it wasn\u2019t your momma. Just a monster who looked like her. Do you understand?\u201d Emily stared at the older girl, and nodded, sniffing a little bit. \u201c\u2026Ready to go back to singing with the others?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cO-okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n> Addendum 877-5\n\n> Doctor Weston\u2019s residence and the residence of family destroyed, as well as all video and vocal recordings of any member of the Weston family using SCP-9005-1.\n\n> Doctor Weston\u2019s Status: Missing. Presumed Dead.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["personal-log-of-dr-gears", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-gears", "tale"], "title": "SCP-9005-2 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9005-2", "year": 2010}, "scp-foundation-the-movie": {"created_at": "2010-09-30T03:48:00", "creator": "Edrobot", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Edrobot", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/edrobot", "comment": "Inital Post", "date": "2010-09-30T03:48:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-30T04:07:00"}, {"author": "Enma Ai", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/enma-ai", "comment": "076 is called \"Able\", not \"Abel\".", "date": "2010-09-30T04:35:00"}, {"author": "Edrobot", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/edrobot", "comment": "Minor format change", "date": "2010-09-30T15:38:00"}, {"author": "Enma Ai", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/enma-ai", "comment": "Ukulele, not Ukalale.", "date": "2010-10-28T17:51:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:26:00"}, {"author": "FPST", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fpst", "comment": "fixed some spelling errors", "date": "2011-01-15T07:27:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "You successfully renamed the page: \"scp-foundation:the-movie\" to \"scp-foundation-the-movie\".", "date": "2011-04-25T11:47:00"}, {"author": "Inglonias", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/inglonias", "comment": "Minor change.

Now everyone thinks that the leaked documents are part of some sort of Alternate Reality Game for a horrible Uwe Boll movie.

How did you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a talk with our legal department to help me with the cover story. They forged some paperwork saying that they had signed over their \u2018Digital Likenesses\u2019 to Boll at some point, and got \u201cPopular Science\u201d to do an article about the technology the movie was supposedly made with. Plus, I sent everyone large checks to get them to stay quiet about it. You know how celebrities are. And even if they do say something, Boll and Friedberg would be the ones to blame, not us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d The O5 looked unpulsed. \u201cI also understand you\u2019ve taken some\u2026 \u2018liberties\u2019 with the source material.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was understandable; If I stuck too close to the truth our entire operation would be compromised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I was more concerned about the portrayal of yourself and your fellow co-workers. We\u2019ve received a number of complaints\u2026 Dr. Rights, for instance, is upset that you\u2019ve made her a into one-dimensional love interest, Dr. Bright was upset that you\u2019ve made him out to be a complete idiot that can\u2019t fend for himself that constantly makes fart jokes, Yoric insists that he looks nothing like Tommy Wiseau, and Delivery Agent Roadrunner is accusing you of slander. Which is understandable, as his only scene involves him yelling obscenities at the elderly, punting a baby into a wood chipper, insulting all major religious and world leaders by name, selling out the Foundation to the Chaos Insurgency for pocket change, and then being gruesomely dismembered at the hands of SCP-682.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Edison chuckled. \u201cOh yeah, I remember that scene. God, that was fun to write\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway\u2026 Dr. Iceberg has put out a bounty on your life, Dr. Aeish says you pronounced his name wrong on at least seven dozen occasions, Dr. Gerald hates how you\u2019ve made his poor driving skills into a running gag, Able would like to have a very violent word with you about your casting choices, Dr. Gears thinks that your characterization of himself was spot on but is repulsed by everything else in the movie, and Dr. Clef thinks you portrayed him as a sexist, chain-smoking alcoholic bigot with a hair-trigger temper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty accurate description.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that he insists you owe him royalties.\u201d The O5 nonchalantly shuffled a large stack of papers. \u201cOh, and absolutely everyone hates the fact that you cast Brad Pitt as yourself, and made him the most blatant Mary-Sue possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Edison shrugged. \u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s show business for ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>The O5 sighed. \u201cPersonally, I ought to terminate you for gross disrespect and neglect of the rules.

Text below the logo says \u201cThanksgiving Day\u201d*}}\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s one way to handle an information leak...\u201d O5-\u2588 turned away from the screen. \u201cHow on earth did you pull this off?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEh, no big deal.\u201d Dr. Edison smugly replied, \u201cI just wrote up a script, sent a crack team of mercenaries to track down and kidnap Uwe Boll and Friedberg, told them who was going to be in it, and gave them an hour each with SCP-721. Now everyone thinks that the leaked documents are part of some sort of Alternate Reality Game for a horrible Uwe Boll movie. With any luck, Marshall, Carter and Dark will also be more hesitant about doing business, what with their name being associated with that wisecracking Lex Luthor ripoff.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMay I remind you that bringing civilians here was a serious breach in security...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, that guy has less credibility than a neo-nazi at a bar-mitzvah. If \u2018Zhee best fucking genius in zee business\u2019 ever said anything, he\u2019d lose whatever shred of credibility he still has.\u201d\n\n\n\nO5-\u2588 gave Dr. Edison an unamused look. \n\n\n\n\u201c...Yeah yeah, I gave them both A-Class Amnesics.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Edison nervously tugged at his collar. \u201cUm, I mean, do you think I\u2019m an idiot or something?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut what about the actors? How did you-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI had a talk with our legal department to help me with the cover story. They forged some paperwork saying that they had signed over their \u2018Digital Likenesses\u2019 to Boll at some point, and got \u201cPopular Science\u201d to do an article about the technology the movie was supposedly made with. Plus, I sent everyone large checks to get them to stay quiet about it. You know how celebrities are. And even if they do say something, Boll and Friedberg would be the ones to blame, not us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d The O5 looked unpulsed. \u201cI also understand you\u2019ve taken some... \u2018liberties\u2019 with the source material.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was understandable; If I stuck too close to the truth our entire operation would be compromised.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cActually, I was more concerned about the portrayal of yourself and your fellow co-workers. We\u2019ve received a number of complaints... Dr. Rights, for instance, is upset that you\u2019ve made her a into one-dimensional love interest, Dr. Bright was upset that you\u2019ve made him out to be a complete idiot that can\u2019t fend for himself that constantly makes fart jokes, Yoric insists that he looks nothing like Tommy Wiseau, and Delivery Agent Roadrunner is accusing you of slander. Which is understandable, as his only scene involves him yelling obscenities at the elderly, punting a baby into a wood chipper, insulting all major religious and world leaders by name, selling out the Foundation to the Chaos Insurgency for pocket change, and then being gruesomely dismembered at the hands of SCP-682.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Edison chuckled. \u201cOh yeah, I remember that scene. God, that was fun to write...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnyway... Dr. Iceberg has put out a bounty on your life, Dr. Aeish says you pronounced his name wrong on at least seven dozen occasions, Dr. Gerald hates how you\u2019ve made his poor driving skills into a running gag, Able would like to have a very violent word with you about your casting choices, Dr. Gears thinks that your characterization of himself was spot on but is repulsed by everything else in the movie, and Dr. Clef thinks you portrayed him as a sexist, chain-smoking alcoholic bigot with a hair-trigger temper.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty accurate description.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem is that he insists you owe him royalties.\u201d The O5 nonchalantly shuffled a large stack of papers. \u201cOh, and absolutely everyone hates the fact that you cast Brad Pitt as yourself, and made him the most blatant Mary-Sue possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Edison shrugged. \u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s show business for ya.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe O5 sighed. \u201cPersonally, I ought to terminate you for gross disrespect and neglect of the rules. However, since you did defuse a potentially catastrophic situation with minimal casualties, I\u2019m willing to let you keep your current position, on the condition that you transfer to Keter Duty in our Antarctic base at Site-\u2588\u2588 until people stop demanding your head on a stick.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I have some sort of choice?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCertainly. You could always [DATA EXPUNGED]\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...Right.

That's not to say the person themselves (even though it's safe to say they do undergo a profound change), but who they are to you, and how they stand in your memory. Evil men can become saints and vice versa the moment they give up their last breath. Paul was neither, yet he's still\u2026changed, with his passing.

If it weren't for Paul, I'd probably have passed by life unnoticed, with no great change of character after death's call. I've always wished for some kind of\u2026excitement in life. Now that I have it, I'd give anything I have to make it go away.</p>\n<p>Paul was a fellow cube-slave, a office worker of zero ambition and even less presence. He was short, slightly overweight, had a nervous laugh, and slowly advancing (receding?) baldness. I think he was around thirty or forty, but I couldn't be sure, and he always seemed to have a slight\u2026agelessness about him. As if he was born in suit and tie, already fortified with a head full of PowerPoint and team meeting schedules. You could probably pass him a hundred times a day, and wouldn't be able to recall the color of his limited hair at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>We were office friends, the special kind of hazy, organic relationship that develops around those who are somewhat trapped together, but don't want to commit to actual friendship. We worked and went to lunch in the same area, so we ended up bumping into each other enough to force some kind of rapport. I think he also had a crush on me, which was flattering. I'm not pretty, so any attention is at least a bit of a ego stroke, even if the giver is about as plain as tofu.</p>\n<p>We would talk, sit at the same table at lunch, walk to our cars, all very easy and non-committal. He told me about his dog, his interest in movies, various tv shows. I'd tell him about my two cats, my rather insane mother, and my ongoing car problems. He was painfully lonely, and I think I may have been one of the few friends of any persuasion he had, if not the only one. I felt very humanitarian\u2026instead of donating a dollar a day to Africa, I was donating time to Paul.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Looking back, it started with the dream. Paul was sitting at the lunch table, and had a massive bandage around his arm. He'd been even more closed off then normal for the last few days, and had even missed the day before, which was very odd. The worst thing was, almost nobody had noticed. One coworker, who sat a few desks down from Paul, actually said \u201cWho's Paul?\u201d when I mentioned his absence. I felt a twitch of actual, genuine concern when I sat down across from him.</p>\n<p>My first question was about his arm, but he passed it off as nothing, saying he just had an accident. After a little prodding, I got him to tell me what had happened. Paul said he'd been sleeping badly. Always prone to fits of insomnia, he said that lately it had been worse. He'd wake up from strange dreams, panting, and find the bed soaked with sweat. He said he also had the weird feeling that someone had been in the room just moments ago. By the time he'd gone and checked all the doors and windows, he couldn't get to sleep again. He'd laughed then, saying the joke would be on the thief, that he'd probably end up losing money anyway.</p>\n<p>I laughed too. Paul could be funny, and smart, and almost charming at times, but it always got buried in a big, smothering wave of gray blandness. He didn't seem bland then. He looked\u2026nervous. He blinked, looking around, then leaned in a bit. He smiled nervously, and said what had happened was rather embarrassing. In the middle of the night, he'd woken up from a horrible dream, and found himself unable to move. He said it was like a weight on his chest, pinning him down. He'd also seen something across the room. He paused, seeming to decide whether or not to go on, then sighed and shook his head. He said that there was a thing standing in the doorway to the hall. He said it looked like it had a cloak, but it seemed to move like it was alive, and its head was like a insect, long and narrow, with a cluster of eyes on each side.</p>\n<p>I looked at him, dumbfounded. Here was a man whose greatest imaginative moment was suggesting a blue background on the monthly expense pie chart instead of white. He must have seen my shock, because Paul laughed again, loudly, causing a few people to turn. He waved his good hand, saying for me to relax. He said it was sleep paralysis, uncommon but not unnatural. Paul said when you sleep, your body sort of \u201cswitches off\u201d to keep you from flailing around and hurting yourself. Sometimes, if you wake up suddenly, your body stays in that mode, and you feel pinned. He said you can even have very, very vivid dreams when you're like this, which explains what he called the bug-monk.</p>\n<p>I asked him if this happened to him a lot, but he said no, not since he was little. He went on, saying that he thinks he blacked out for a moment, or went back to sleep, because he woke up again with a sudden, sharp pain in his chest. He'd shouted, tried to get up, missed the edge of the bed, and managed to bash his arm off the edge of the nightstand, giving himself a nasty bruise and gash. I prodded him about seeing a doctor, but he said no, he's just wrapped it with some gauze and medical tape and gone back to bed. Lunch had wrapped up by then, so he'd gotten up, nodding apologetically, and quietly gone back to his cube. I sat for a bit, looking at my untouched lunch, and just thought.</p>\n<p>Work kept me busy for the next few weeks, and I didn't see much of Paul except for the once-weekly carpool and an occasional wave in the hall. Whats more, one of my idiotic cats had gotten out and went missing for several days, so I was very preoccupied. I say that, now\u2026but really, I wasn't. What Paul had said was so\u2026weird, so out of character, that I just wasn't able to process it. So, I didn't. Have I not said that Paul was insanely easy to forget? Looking back, I see now what I should have seen\u2026his weight loss, the baggy eyes, unkempt hair\u2026</p>\n<p>It was a Friday, and I had been working late. I don't mind the office at night when I'm engrossed, but as soon as I lift my head, I realize how very\u2026empty things seem. Unless you've been in a huge office after hours, there's no good way to describe it. It's like there's an\u2026energy. Something stuck to the walls, the desks, all the hustle, bustle and human exertion leaves a\u2026residue. I'm wandering. It's enough to say that, when Paul came up behind me and said hi, I nearly screamed.</p>\n<p>I spun around to say hi, and I literally gasped. He looked like a shadow of himself. He'd lost weight, but in all the wrong places, and his skin looked baggy and poorly fitted. His eyes were red and hollow, and when he smiled, his gums looked raw. He seemed to be wheezing a bit, as if he'd jogged a short space and was catching his breath. I blinked and shook my head, trying to recover, and offered him a seat. When he sat, his joints cracked and popped like a box of corn flaked being stomped.</p>\n<p>I asked if he was all right, but he just stared at the floor like he didn't hear me. I asked again, and he slowly shook his head. He said he hadn't been feeling well, and wheezed out a slow, painful sigh. I started to ask if it was something bad, but Paul waved it off, saying it was probably just a flu. I just watched him, stunned. He must have lost forty pounds, and his clothes fit him like a sack. He suddenly looked me in the eye, a rare feat for Paul, and asked if I remembered about his dream. It took me a minute to remember what he was talking about, and seeing me think, he started to rise, saying \u201cI shouldn't have come\u201d. I put a hand on his arm, telling him to stop\u2026and I felt the ridges on his arm.</p>\n<p>I pulled my hand away, stammering something, but Paul looked down and sighed. He sat back down, and put his head in his hands. He said he was sorry for saying anything, but that he really didn't have anyone to talk to. He started to ramble, waving his hands and speaking with a tone that was equal parts hopeless, tired, and hysterical. Paul said that there was something wrong with him. He said it was the dream, that he didn't think it was actually a dream. He'd found little pinpricks all over his body the day after the dream, and he'd peed blood. I started to ask if he'd been checked for cancer, but he kept on as if I wasn't there.</p>\n<p>He said he'd felt something, inside. Something not right. He got up and started to pace, going out to the hall and back in to my cube, rambling. He said something about growth, and something trying to take over. Mid-way through his monologue, he stopped, cried for about thirty seconds, then started back as if nothing happened. I was starting to get very afraid. Paul always seemed like someone prone to depression, and I was scared that he'd had a breakdown or something. For a moment, I saw my face on the news with the word \u201cMissing:\u201d underneath. He suddenly shouted, saying he wasn't going to let it out, and rolled up his sleeve, saying he'd found a way to fix it.</p>\n<p>I stared and had to put my hand over my mouth to keep from screaming. His arm was a horror show. A deep, winding gash stretched from his wrist to his elbow along the underside of his arm, looking nearly a quarter inch wide in places. Blood was crusted all around it, and what looked like\u2026pus, or some other fluid. What was worst, though, was the stitches. He'd taken some kind of heavy gauge thread and stitched the cut shut. It was a bad job, the stitching jumping around randomly, in places pulling the skin into tight, painful angles. I looked up at him, horrified, and he pulled his sleeve back down, turning away. He said \u201cI shouldn't have come\u201d again, then rushed out of my cube and down the hall. I should have done something\u2026but I just got my things and left.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Paul wasn't at work the next day. I felt sick. I was pretty sure I'd just witnessed the end result of a suicide attempt, but I had no idea what to do. I thought about trying to get help, but I couldn't think of who to call, and it felt\u2026inappropriate. I hardly knew him, and it didn't feel right. I was sure he'd get help, or\u2026something. I justified myself not calling a thousand ways, and when I heard, finally, that he'd called in sick, I just moved on, filing it under someone else's problem. I wish I could say that I did everything I could, that I tried my best, but I didn't. I just\u2026moved on. It was so unsettling, and weird, and just\u2026wrong, that I just pushed it away.</p>\n<p>It was nearly two weeks later that I finally checked. He had stopped calling in, and the carpool just cruised past his house. It looked bad. The lawn was unmowed, the car just sitting in the driveway, several newspapers on the porch. I asked around work, but the very few people who even knew who Paul was had no real idea about him. They just shrugged and assumed he was sick. I went each day with visions of him dead in the bathtub, or coming in and shooting everyone. It was when I drove by and saw his door hanging open that I finally did something.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I was heading home, and as I went past Paul's house, I saw the front door hanging open. It was late, and it was just standing, wide open. I slowed down, looking, and I saw one of his shoes sitting on the porch. Like he'd run out of it, or kicked it off. I sat, looking, and almost before I decided to, I pulled in to his driveway. I sat in the car, gripping the wheel, looking at the door. If he was fine, it'd be a monstrous invasion of privacy\u2026for all I knew he had a girl in there, and had slipped off his shoe in a mad bout of passion. He might have just been hot, and was letting the house cool off. There might be a robber inside, and dropped his shoe on the way out with a load.</p>\n<p>I had the window down, and the evening was very quiet, just a few insects buzzing. I was just about to put the car back in gear when I heard the sound. It was a short, sharp sound, like someone yelling after banging their shin. I looked to the open doorway, listening, and after a few seconds it happened again. I rummaged in my purse, grabbed out a little can of mace I'd gotten from my mother, and started over to the house before I could really think about what I was doing. By the time I decided this was a terrible idea, I was already through the doorway, mace in hand.</p>\n<p>It was dark inside. I mean pitch black. The only real light was from the doorway, the streetlights leaking in to the living room. The smell hit me first, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw why. Old, half-eaten food was out everywhere, balanced on plates and the arms of furniture. Craning my neck a bit, I could see in to the kitchen, and the fridge door was hanging open, the light burned out or broken, more dead food rotting there as well. I heard the sound again, louder, and it seemed to come from the back of the house. I started to thread my way to the hall, trying not to be afraid.</p>\n<p>Mid-way down the hall, I looked in to what seemed to be a office. Papers were tossed everywhere, and the little window on the wall was\u2026black. I looked in a bit more, then stepped back. A garbage bag had been taped over the glass. Looking back in to the living room, I could see all the windows had been covered. I tried the light switch, but nothing happened. All the lights and windows were useless. I started to shake, softly, and called \u201cPaul?\u201d. There was nothing for a bit, then start sudden yelp again. It was coming from the next door in the hall.</p>\n<p>I inched down more, screaming at myself inside to just run, just leave. But, I felt responsible. I was the only person who could have helped him, and now, if he was hurt, or sick\u2026or worse, it was my fault. I had to try something. I started to push on the door, but jumped back as I heard a sudden, deep, muffled moaning from behind it. It kept on, sounding like someone sobbing in to a pillow, sounding so hopeless and lost. I slowly pushed open the door, and stepped in to what I now saw was the bathroom. The curtain was pulled down, and lay on the floor. In the shower, naked, with the door open, was Paul.</p>\n<p>He was curled in the corner, blood smeared on the floors and walls. His body looked as if he'd been attacked with a machete. Deep, gaping cuts and sores stood out all over. Pieces of flesh looked as if they'd been torn or lopped off, and his skin looked\u2026thin and sagging. His feet were misshapen, and it looked as if his spine had somehow swollen and twisted in his back. When he moved, everything flexed and opened, but only let out tiny trickles of blood and yellowed pus.</p>\n<p>He was stitched shut. Every cut and sore had some kind of thread trying to close it. String, yarn, twine, shoelaces, even wire, all of it was stitched in to his skin. It had grown over or ripped free in places, and the threads were all sodden and dripping with ooze and blood. From each of the cuts, too, there seemed to be some kind of\u2026growth coming out. Stiff hair-like things, or hard, sharp, black points. From a deep gash on his back a long, thin patch of what looked like red plastic hung, flapping with each movement. His skull looked broken and twisted. His ears and eyes had been sewn shut. His nostrils were closed with thick, dripping bands of copper wire. He howled that muffled, moaning cry again, and as I looked at his face, I saw why.</p>\n<p>Paul was forcing a sharpened shoelace through his lips.</p>\n<p>I screamed, and I fell back against the wall, watching him lace his mouth shut, and I threw my mace at him. I was hysterical, scrambling along the floor. I looked back once, and saw him lean back, his mouth sealed shut. His lips were moving, as if his tongue was trying to push through them. I ran outside, knocking over his coffee table on the way, and threw up in his yard. I got in my car, peeled out, and called 911 when I was six blocks away.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Paul is dead, in the eyes of the law. I was investigated for a while, but he was labeled a suicide and quietly buried. Nobody came to claim the body. I didn't go to the funeral. I took a week off from work, and got pumped for information as soon as I got back. I didn't really say anything. I drifted in a haze, just trying to forget. But I can't. I never will.</p>\n<p>You see, there's a issue with Paul's death. It was never made public, but they never actually recovered a body. Yes, they recovered a great deal of tissue and flesh from Paul's house, but not nearly enough to make up a corpse. It was mostly skin, some fat, a little muscle, nothing more. I was discounted mainly because I had a alibi, and that I'm not strong enough to skin and butcher a fully grown man. Whatever happened to Paul didn't end when the police charged in.</p>\n<p>I don't know what happened to him. I've read about insect physiology, and watched science fiction, but I still will not even attempt to explain. Paul is dead. However, I don't think that means as much as it should. When I'm finished with this, I'm going to go take a shower, go to bed, and polish off a full bottle of both vodka and Vicodin.</p>\n<p>Last night, I woke in the dark, groggy and feeling drugged. I looked to my window, and saw a shape there for a few seconds. It moved away, but I saw it. Narrow head. Wide black eyes.</p>\n<p>But it still has Paul's face.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/stitches\">Stitches</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

He blinked, looking around, then leaned in a bit. He smiled nervously, and said what had happened was rather embarrassing. In the middle of the night, he'd woken up from a horrible dream, and found himself unable to move. He said it was like a weight on his chest, pinning him down. He'd also seen something across the room. He paused, seeming to decide whether or not to go on, then sighed and shook his head. He said that there was a thing standing in the doorway to the hall. He said it looked like it had a cloak, but it seemed to move like it was alive, and its head was like a insect, long and narrow, with a cluster of eyes on each side.\n\n\n\nI looked at him, dumbfounded. Here was a man whose greatest imaginative moment was suggesting a blue background on the monthly expense pie chart instead of white. He must have seen my shock, because Paul laughed again, loudly, causing a few people to turn. He waved his good hand, saying for me to relax. He said it was sleep paralysis, uncommon but not unnatural. Paul said when you sleep, your body sort of \u201cswitches off\u201d to keep you from flailing around and hurting yourself. Sometimes, if you wake up suddenly, your body stays in that mode, and you feel pinned. He said you can even have very, very vivid dreams when you're like this, which explains what he called the bug-monk.\n\n\n\nI asked him if this happened to him a lot, but he said no, not since he was little. He went on, saying that he thinks he blacked out for a moment, or went back to sleep, because he woke up again with a sudden, sharp pain in his chest. He'd shouted, tried to get up, missed the edge of the bed, and managed to bash his arm off the edge of the nightstand, giving himself a nasty bruise and gash. I prodded him about seeing a doctor, but he said no, he's just wrapped it with some gauze and medical tape and gone back to bed. Lunch had wrapped up by then, so he'd gotten up, nodding apologetically, and quietly gone back to his cube. I sat for a bit, looking at my untouched lunch, and just thought.\n\n\n\nWork kept me busy for the next few weeks, and I didn't see much of Paul except for the once-weekly carpool and an occasional wave in the hall. Whats more, one of my idiotic cats had gotten out and went missing for several days, so I was very preoccupied. I say that, now...but really, I wasn't. What Paul had said was so...weird, so out of character, that I just wasn't able to process it. So, I didn't. Have I not said that Paul was insanely easy to forget? Looking back, I see now what I should have seen...his weight loss, the baggy eyes, unkempt hair...\n\n\n\nIt was a Friday, and I had been working late. I don't mind the office at night when I'm engrossed, but as soon as I lift my head, I realize how very...empty things seem. Unless you've been in a huge office after hours, there's no good way to describe it. It's like there's an...energy. Something stuck to the walls, the desks, all the hustle, bustle and human exertion leaves a...residue. I'm wandering. It's enough to say that, when Paul came up behind me and said hi, I nearly screamed.\n\n\n\nI spun around to say hi, and I literally gasped. He looked like a shadow of himself. He'd lost weight, but in all the wrong places, and his skin looked baggy and poorly fitted. His eyes were red and hollow, and when he smiled, his gums looked raw. He seemed to be wheezing a bit, as if he'd jogged a short space and was catching his breath. I blinked and shook my head, trying to recover, and offered him a seat. When he sat, his joints cracked and popped like a box of corn flaked being stomped.\n\n\n\nI asked if he was all right, but he just stared at the floor like he didn't hear me. I asked again, and he slowly shook his head. He said he hadn't been feeling well, and wheezed out a slow, painful sigh. I started to ask if it was something bad, but Paul waved it off, saying it was probably just a flu. I just watched him, stunned. He must have lost forty pounds, and his clothes fit him like a sack. He suddenly looked me in the eye, a rare feat for Paul, and asked if I remembered about his dream. It took me a minute to remember what he was talking about, and seeing me think, he started to rise, saying \u201cI shouldn't have come\u201d. I put a hand on his arm, telling him to stop...and I felt the ridges on his arm.\n\n\n\nI pulled my hand away, stammering something, but Paul looked down and sighed. He sat back down, and put his head in his hands. He said he was sorry for saying anything, but that he really didn't have anyone to talk to. He started to ramble, waving his hands and speaking with a tone that was equal parts hopeless, tired, and hysterical. Paul said that there was something wrong with him. He said it was the dream, that he didn't think it was actually a dream. He'd found little pinpricks all over his body the day after the dream, and he'd peed blood. I started to ask if he'd been checked for cancer, but he kept on as if I wasn't there.\n\n\n\nHe said he'd felt something, inside. Something not right. He got up and started to pace, going out to the hall and back in to my cube, rambling. He said something about growth, and something trying to take over. Mid-way through his monologue, he stopped, cried for about thirty seconds, then started back as if nothing happened. I was starting to get very afraid. Paul always seemed like someone prone to depression, and I was scared that he'd had a breakdown or something. For a moment, I saw my face on the news with the word \u201cMissing:\u201d underneath. He suddenly shouted, saying he wasn't going to let it out, and rolled up his sleeve, saying he'd found a way to fix it.\n\n\n\nI stared and had to put my hand over my mouth to keep from screaming. His arm was a horror show. A deep, winding gash stretched from his wrist to his elbow along the underside of his arm, looking nearly a quarter inch wide in places. Blood was crusted all around it, and what looked like...pus, or some other fluid. What was worst, though, was the stitches. He'd taken some kind of heavy gauge thread and stitched the cut shut. It was a bad job, the stitching jumping around randomly, in places pulling the skin into tight, painful angles. I looked up at him, horrified, and he pulled his sleeve back down, turning away. He said \u201cI shouldn't have come\u201d again, then rushed out of my cube and down the hall. I should have done something...but I just got my things and left.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nPaul wasn't at work the next day. I felt sick. I was pretty sure I'd just witnessed the end result of a suicide attempt, but I had no idea what to do. I thought about trying to get help, but I couldn't think of who to call, and it felt...inappropriate. I hardly knew him, and it didn't feel right. I was sure he'd get help, or...something. I justified myself not calling a thousand ways, and when I heard, finally, that he'd called in sick, I just moved on, filing it under someone else's problem. I wish I could say that I did everything I could, that I tried my best, but I didn't. I just...moved on. It was so unsettling, and weird, and just...wrong, that I just pushed it away.\n\n\n\nIt was nearly two weeks later that I finally checked. He had stopped calling in, and the carpool just cruised past his house. It looked bad. The lawn was unmowed, the car just sitting in the driveway, several newspapers on the porch. I asked around work, but the very few people who even knew who Paul was had no real idea about him. They just shrugged and assumed he was sick. I went each day with visions of him dead in the bathtub, or coming in and shooting everyone. It was when I drove by and saw his door hanging open that I finally did something.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nI was heading home, and as I went past Paul's house, I saw the front door hanging open. It was late, and it was just standing, wide open. I slowed down, looking, and I saw one of his shoes sitting on the porch. Like he'd run out of it, or kicked it off. I sat, looking, and almost before I decided to, I pulled in to his driveway. I sat in the car, gripping the wheel, looking at the door. If he was fine, it'd be a monstrous invasion of privacy...for all I knew he had a girl in there, and had slipped off his shoe in a mad bout of passion. He might have just been hot, and was letting the house cool off. There might be a robber inside, and dropped his shoe on the way out with a load.\n\n\n\nI had the window down, and the evening was very quiet, just a few insects buzzing. I was just about to put the car back in gear when I heard the sound. It was a short, sharp sound, like someone yelling after banging their shin. I looked to the open doorway, listening, and after a few seconds it happened again. I rummaged in my purse, grabbed out a little can of mace I'd gotten from my mother, and started over to the house before I could really think about what I was doing. By the time I decided this was a terrible idea, I was already through the doorway, mace in hand.\n\n\n\nIt was dark inside. I mean pitch black. The only real light was from the doorway, the streetlights leaking in to the living room. The smell hit me first, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw why. Old, half-eaten food was out everywhere, balanced on plates and the arms of furniture. Craning my neck a bit, I could see in to the kitchen, and the fridge door was hanging open, the light burned out or broken, more dead food rotting there as well. I heard the sound again, louder, and it seemed to come from the back of the house. I started to thread my way to the hall, trying not to be afraid. \n\n\n\nMid-way down the hall, I looked in to what seemed to be a office. Papers were tossed everywhere, and the little window on the wall was...black. I looked in a bit more, then stepped back. A garbage bag had been taped over the glass. Looking back in to the living room, I could see all the windows had been covered. I tried the light switch, but nothing happened. All the lights and windows were useless. I started to shake, softly, and called \u201cPaul?\u201d. There was nothing for a bit, then start sudden yelp again. It was coming from the next door in the hall.\n\n\n\nI inched down more, screaming at myself inside to just run, just leave. But, I felt responsible. I was the only person who could have helped him, and now, if he was hurt, or sick...or worse, it was my fault. I had to try something. I started to push on the door, but jumped back as I heard a sudden, deep, muffled moaning from behind it. It kept on, sounding like someone sobbing in to a pillow, sounding so hopeless and lost. I slowly pushed open the door, and stepped in to what I now saw was the bathroom. The curtain was pulled down, and lay on the floor. In the shower, naked, with the door open, was Paul.\n\n\n\nHe was curled in the corner, blood smeared on the floors and walls. His body looked as if he'd been attacked with a machete. Deep, gaping cuts and sores stood out all over. Pieces of flesh looked as if they'd been torn or lopped off, and his skin looked...thin and sagging. His feet were misshapen, and it looked as if his spine had somehow swollen and twisted in his back. When he moved, everything flexed and opened, but only let out tiny trickles of blood and yellowed pus.\n\n\n\nHe was stitched shut. Every cut and sore had some kind of thread trying to close it. String, yarn, twine, shoelaces, even wire, all of it was stitched in to his skin. It had grown over or ripped free in places, and the threads were all sodden and dripping with ooze and blood. From each of the cuts, too, there seemed to be some kind of...growth coming out. Stiff hair-like things, or hard, sharp, black points. From a deep gash on his back a long, thin patch of what looked like red plastic hung, flapping with each movement. His skull looked broken and twisted. His ears and eyes had been sewn shut. His nostrils were closed with thick, dripping bands of copper wire. He howled that muffled, moaning cry again, and as I looked at his face, I saw why.\n\n\n\nPaul was forcing a sharpened shoelace through his lips.\n\n\n\nI screamed, and I fell back against the wall, watching him lace his mouth shut, and I threw my mace at him. I was hysterical, scrambling along the floor. I looked back once, and saw him lean back, his mouth sealed shut. His lips were moving, as if his tongue was trying to push through them. I ran outside, knocking over his coffee table on the way, and threw up in his yard. I got in my car, peeled out, and called 911 when I was six blocks away.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nPaul is dead, in the eyes of the law. I was investigated for a while, but he was labeled a suicide and quietly buried. Nobody came to claim the body. I didn't go to the funeral. I took a week off from work, and got pumped for information as soon as I got back. I didn't really say anything. I drifted in a haze, just trying to forget. But I can't. I never will.\n\n\n\nYou see, there's a issue with Paul's death. It was never made public, but they never actually recovered a body. Yes, they recovered a great deal of tissue and flesh from Paul's house, but not nearly enough to make up a corpse. It was mostly skin, some fat, a little muscle, nothing more. I was discounted mainly because I had a alibi, and that I'm not strong enough to skin and butcher a fully grown man. Whatever happened to Paul didn't end when the police charged in.\n\n\n\nI don't know what happened to him. I've read about insect physiology, and watched science fiction, but I still will not even attempt to explain. Paul is dead. However, I don't think that means as much as it should. When I'm finished with this, I'm going to go take a shower, go to bed, and polish off a full bottle of both vodka and Vicodin.\n\n\n\nLast night, I woke in the dark, groggy and feeling drugged. I looked to my window, and saw a shape there for a few seconds. It moved away, but I saw it. Narrow head. Wide black eyes.\n\n\n\nBut it still has Paul's face.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "creepypasta", "tale"], "title": "Stitches - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/stitches", "year": 2010}, "story-to-be-named-later": {"created_at": "2010-07-09T05:38:00", "creator": "AdminBright", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-07-09T05:38:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-07-09T05:40:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "rating module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:17:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

God damn it Pete, if you're going to be my minion, you gotta do what I tell you! My FACE Pete!</p>\n<p><em>Camera angle tilts upwards, revealing subject X-1. Subjects face is covered in inexpertly applied white make up, with heavy mascara around the eyes, and black lipstick. Subject is thin to the point of emaciation, with long, greasy, dyed black, hair. Subject is dressed in black knee-high leather boots with a five-inch platform heel, black pants covered in chains, a black silk shirt, and a black cloak, with red undertones. X-1 looks at the camera, and smiles.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: There, there, much better\u2026 now hit record\u2026 RECORD, Pete god damn it man, why did I even make you my minion? Hit the red but-<br/>\n<em>There is a jump in the film. Camera is now centered on Subject X-1.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: -make sure it's fucking record- Shit! Ahem. Good evening, dear mortals, and welcome. For I am Azarael Astoroth, Archduke of the Seventh Layer, and soon, you shall all KNEEL before me! For, in my deals with the devil, I have gained life everlasting! And not only am I now a totally awesome and wicked vampire\u2026</p>\n<p><em>X-1 gestures around himself, in an attempt to indicate the fading twilight he stands in.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: But I can stand in sunlight without fucking sparkling! That's right! I may have gone into the grave, but I came back, with a thirst for your blood! And I shall rule you all, all of you! Especially you, Mark Olsen! That's right, I bet you're all sad and shit now, oh no, big bad vampire gonna come for me, I'm gonna drink your fucking blood! In fact, I'm gonna go do that, right now! Come on Pete! No, ignore the old man, come with me!</p>\n<p><em>Subjects begin moving, out of the shaded spot they were in, and down a wooded path. Subject X-2 is slower than subject X-1, despite X-1's continued exhortations for him to keep up. Subjects approach a modest ranch in what appears to be a well-to-do suburb on the edge of the woods. X-1 begins making what are best described as 'spooky' sounds, outside the rear window.</em><br/>\n<em>Subject X-3, identified as Mark Olsen, comes out the back door, holding a baseball bat. Subject is broad, and well muscled, dressed in only boxers and a varsity jacket. Subject appears enraged.</em></p>\n<p>X-3: What the fuck dude, what the fuck? You gay little faggots wanna fuck with me some more, huh? You wanna go? Come on! I'll fucking kill you limp wristed pansies!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>X-3 takes a swing at X-1. X-1 places his hand in the way. There is a crunch, as X-1's fingers break. X-1 laughs.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: You cannot kill the undead, you punk!</p>\n<p><em>X-3 stares in apparent shock, then drops his bat. X-1 bends his fingers back into place with a clicking sound.</em></p>\n<p>X-3: Chad? Chad, you're dead man, you're dead! They fucking buried you man!<br/>\nX-1: And now I am back. And you\u2026 you are going to pay!</p>\n<p><em>X-1 throws himself at X-3. There is a tangle of limbs, with X-3 maintaining the upper hand until X-1 begins to bite him. X-3 begins screaming, as X-1 devours him alive, ripping off huge gobs of flesh with both hands and teeth. The camera view drops to the ground, and for roughly ten minutes, it tapes the forest, while the sound of crying and animalisitic growling can be heard.<br/>\nThe video cuts again.<br/>\nWe now see a very bloody X-1, standing at the back door of another house. He is trying wipe his face clean of the blood.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: Stay focused on my face Pete! Ahem. AHAHAAHAH! Now you mortals see what happens if you mess with me!</p>\n<p><em>X-1 shakes his finger at the camera. The finger drops off. He scowls and picks it back up. The tape cuts, and when it comes back, we see the finger has been put back on with electrical tape.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: You see what can be done, with my great powers! I am a lord of the undead\u2026and now, now I claim my bride!</p>\n<p><em>X-1 turns to the door, and opens it. He sneaks down a long hallway and goes down approximately 13 stairs. At the bottom of the stairs is a small room, a couch, and a television. On the couch a pale, thin girl, dressed all in black. She is identified as Alison Hargreaves, X-4. She turns her head at the sound of X-1, and then falls off the couch.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: Dame Lilian, I have returned for you my love!<br/>\nX-4: Cha- Azrael! You came back!<br/>\nX-1: I told you it would work my queen! And now, I shall make you mine!

She scoots away from him.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: I just had to take care of someone who had taken something of mine.<br/>\nX-4: You killed someone? No, we weren't supposed to do\u2026 Who did you kill? It was Mark, wasn't it?<br/>\nX-1: It does not matter my love, he can not make you eternal, he-</p>\n<p><em>X-4 throws a lamp at X-1, striking him in the chest.</em></p>\n<p>X-4: I LOVE HIM! You ASSHOLE! Undead and you still can't get it that\u2026<br/>\nX-1: I CAN MAKE YOU IMMORTAL, my love.</p>\n<p><em>X-4 pauses, and lowers the statue she had picked up.</em></p>\n<p>X-4: Then do it. But know that, for eternity, I will hate you.</p>\n<p><em>X-1 approaches the girl, and turns her back to him. We see his mouth open, unhinging like a snake. Five sets of needle-like teeth emerge from his lips, and he sinks them into X-4. A loud slurping sound can be heard on the audio. X-4 screams and slumps against him. X-1 lowers her to the floor, and gazes down at her, before speaking softly.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: I did love you. More than he did.</p>\n<p><em>There is a loud pounding from off-screen.</em></p>\n<p>X-1: Shit, someones at the door. Pete! You watch her, I'll get the door.</p>\n<p><em>X-1 storms off-screen. The camera remains on X-4 for a moment, before it is set down. A hooded shape walks on-screen, Subject X-2. He speaks in a low mutter.</em></p>\n<p>X-2: Face.</p>\n<p><em>X-2 bends over X-4, his hood falling back. X-2 is in an extreme state of decomposition, the flesh rotting from his head, his skull showing through in places.</em></p>\n<p>X-2: Face.</p>\n<p><em>X-2 widens his jaw, revealing all his teeth are needle-like. He begins to chew the flesh from X-4's face, ripping gobbets of flesh from her throat with his clawed hands.</em></p>\n<p>X-2: Face.</p>\n<p><em>The low battery light flashes, and the tape ends.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/story-to-be-named-later\">Story To Be Named Later</a>\" by AdminBright, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

God damn it Pete, if you're going to be my minion, you gotta do what I tell you! My FACE Pete!\n\n> \n\n> //Camera angle tilts upwards, revealing subject X-1. Subjects face is covered in inexpertly applied white make up, with heavy mascara around the eyes, and black lipstick. Subject is thin to the point of emaciation, with long, greasy, dyed black, hair. Subject is dressed in black knee-high leather boots with a five-inch platform heel, black pants covered in chains, a black silk shirt, and a black cloak, with red undertones. X-1 looks at the camera, and smiles.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: There, there, much better... now hit record... RECORD, Pete god damn it man, why did I even make you my minion? Hit the red but-\n\n>\n\n> //There is a jump in the film. Camera is now centered on Subject X-1.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: -make sure it's fucking record- Shit! Ahem. Good evening, dear mortals, and welcome. For I am Azarael Astoroth, Archduke of the Seventh Layer, and soon, you shall all KNEEL before me! For, in my deals with the devil, I have gained life everlasting! And not only am I now a totally awesome and wicked vampire...\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 gestures around himself, in an attempt to indicate the fading twilight he stands in.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: But I can stand in sunlight without fucking sparkling! That's right! I may have gone into the grave, but I came back, with a thirst for your blood! And I shall rule you all, all of you! Especially you, Mark Olsen! That's right, I bet you're all sad and shit now, oh no, big bad vampire gonna come for me, I'm gonna drink your fucking blood! In fact, I'm gonna go do that, right now! Come on Pete! No, ignore the old man, come with me!\n\n> \n\n> //Subjects begin moving, out of the shaded spot they were in, and down a wooded path. Subject X-2 is slower than subject X-1, despite X-1's continued exhortations for him to keep up. Subjects approach a modest ranch in what appears to be a well-to-do suburb on the edge of the woods. X-1 begins making what are best described as 'spooky' sounds, outside the rear window.//\n\n> //Subject X-3, identified as Mark Olsen, comes out the back door, holding a baseball bat. Subject is broad, and well muscled, dressed in only boxers and a varsity jacket. Subject appears enraged.//\n\n> \n\n> X-3: What the fuck dude, what the fuck? You gay little faggots wanna fuck with me some more, huh? You wanna go? Come on! I'll fucking kill you limp wristed pansies!\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> //X-3 takes a swing at X-1. X-1 places his hand in the way. There is a crunch, as X-1's fingers break. X-1 laughs.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: You cannot kill the undead, you punk!\n\n> \n\n> //X-3 stares in apparent shock, then drops his bat. X-1 bends his fingers back into place with a clicking sound.//\n\n> \n\n> X-3: Chad? Chad, you're dead man, you're dead! They fucking buried you man!\n\n> X-1: And now I am back. And you... you are going to pay!\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 throws himself at X-3. There is a tangle of limbs, with X-3 maintaining the upper hand until X-1 begins to bite him. X-3 begins screaming, as X-1 devours him alive, ripping off huge gobs of flesh with both hands and teeth. The camera view drops to the ground, and for roughly ten minutes, it tapes the forest, while the sound of crying and animalisitic growling can be heard.\n\n> The video cuts again.\n\n> We now see a very bloody X-1, standing at the back door of another house. He is trying wipe his face clean of the blood.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: Stay focused on my face Pete! Ahem. AHAHAAHAH! Now you mortals see what happens if you mess with me!\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 shakes his finger at the camera. The finger drops off. He scowls and picks it back up. The tape cuts, and when it comes back, we see the finger has been put back on with electrical tape.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: You see what can be done, with my great powers! I am a lord of the undead...and now, now I claim my bride!\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 turns to the door, and opens it. He sneaks down a long hallway and goes down approximately 13 stairs. At the bottom of the stairs is a small room, a couch, and a television. On the couch a pale, thin girl, dressed all in black. She is identified as Alison Hargreaves, X-4. She turns her head at the sound of X-1, and then falls off the couch.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: Dame Lilian, I have returned for you my love!\n\n> X-4: Cha- Azrael! You came back!\n\n> X-1: I told you it would work my queen! And now, I shall make you mine! For ours is a love that shall span the ages and-\n\n> X-4: You're covered in blood.\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 moves closer to X-4. She scoots away from him.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: I just had to take care of someone who had taken something of mine.\n\n> X-4: You killed someone? No, we weren't supposed to do... Who did you kill? It was Mark, wasn't it?\n\n> X-1: It does not matter my love, he can not make you eternal, he-\n\n> \n\n> //X-4 throws a lamp at X-1, striking him in the chest.//\n\n> \n\n> X-4: I LOVE HIM! You ASSHOLE! Undead and you still can't get it that...\n\n> X-1: I CAN MAKE YOU IMMORTAL, my love.\n\n> \n\n> //X-4 pauses, and lowers the statue she had picked up.//\n\n> \n\n> X-4: Then do it. But know that, for eternity, I will hate you.\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 approaches the girl, and turns her back to him. We see his mouth open, unhinging like a snake. Five sets of needle-like teeth emerge from his lips, and he sinks them into X-4. A loud slurping sound can be heard on the audio. X-4 screams and slumps against him. X-1 lowers her to the floor, and gazes down at her, before speaking softly.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: I did love you. More than he did.\n\n> \n\n> //There is a loud pounding from off-screen.//\n\n> \n\n> X-1: Shit, someones at the door. Pete! You watch her, I'll get the door.\n\n> \n\n> //X-1 storms off-screen. The camera remains on X-4 for a moment, before it is set down. A hooded shape walks on-screen, Subject X-2. He speaks in a low mutter.//\n\n> \n\n> X-2: Face.\n\n> \n\n> //X-2 bends over X-4, his hood falling back. X-2 is in an extreme state of decomposition, the flesh rotting from his head, his skull showing through in places.//\n\n> \n\n> X-2: Face.\n\n> \n\n> //X-2 widens his jaw, revealing all his teeth are needle-like. He begins to chew the flesh from X-4's face, ripping gobbets of flesh from her throat with his clawed hands.//\n\n> \n\n> X-2: Face.\n\n> \n\n> //The low battery light flashes, and the tape ends.//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Story To Be Named Later - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/story-to-be-named-later", "year": 2010}, "stratagem": {"created_at": "2010-01-23T18:09:00", "creator": "Djoric", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2010-01-23T18:09:00"}, {"author": "Cherry Pict", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cherry-pict", "comment": "fishmawngor", "date": "2010-06-04T05:31:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

He wasn\u2019t in the mood for socializing with large numbers of people. The researcher took a bite of patchily-cooked chicken sandwich.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey there, Breaker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaker looked up to see Dr. Ryan Melbourne standing on the opposite side of the table, holding a tray of similar low-grade foodstuffs. Melbourne was tall and lanky, around thirty years of age, with a bushy head of sandy hair, a scar on his chin, and a good tan from his recent Caribbean vacation. He had rolled up his shirt sleeves, revealing the tattoo of Chinese lettering on the inside of his right arm. The phrase translated into English as \u201cWere you expecting something profound?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Breaker said flatly as the younger doctor sat down. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you around recently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, the department\u2019s been in a fuss all week. The supervisor\u2019s worried about a memetic hazard outbreak, so she\u2019s been having us checked four times a day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened? And why did I not hear about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThree researchers all acted exactly the same during the monthly psychological review. Started singing a bastardized version of \u201cThe Immigrant Song\u201d with a <em>very</em> interesting use of the word \u2018defenestrate\u2019, among other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who were the researchers?\u201d Breaker could see where this story was going.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrs. Jameson, Ulrich, and Ferrier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaker slapped the table and laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it! I saw that one coming a mile away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle they haven\u2019t been demoted to D-class by now. They can\u2019t go a week without getting Supervisor Bricket\u2019s panties in a bunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue that.\u201d Melbourne swallowed a forkful of macaroni. \u201cMoving to a completely different subject, I have fifty bucks riding on a bet and I need an answer from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaker sighed. Melbourne\u2019s gambling habit was the bane of everyone who knew him, as he would inevitably ask them for a bailout. Unfortunately, the doctor could see no applicable escape routes from the cafeteria.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said, dreading what came next.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that 008 broke containment. Widespread infection, no chance of containment. What do you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaker didn\u2019t expect something so\u2026 serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cLock down the facility, switch to backup generators. Use drones to recon the situation outside. If it\u2019s truly an XC or XK-class scenario, we fall back to basics: our facilities can be easily defended; we have food, weapons, water, and medical supplies already. If we\u2019re in for the long haul, we\u2019ll ration and improvise as necessary. If there are any SCPs that would cause a danger to us or a drain on limited resources, we destroy them. All the others we use to our advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melbourne smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the book, but I\u2019ll count that as a zombie plan. And they said you didn\u2019t have one. That\u2019s fifty bucks in my pocket right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA zombie plan? That\u2019s what you call it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr SCP-008 contingency plan, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t care, actually.\u201d Breaker went back to his sandwich.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on. Ask me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d He glared at the other researcher. \u201cWhat\u2019s your zombie plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong! Ask me something different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaker stroked his chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026you\u2019re stuck in a room with 173.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe not blinking is the first order of business. So long as I can keep one eye open, I\u2019ll run backwards out the emergency exit and do it fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough. That\u2019s really the only thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy turn. 705 takes over the break room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding? They wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against my five-year-old nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSend him in; it would be hilarious. Maybe we can introduce them to 387 afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the administration hear that one. 239 wakes up and decides she\u2019s not too fond of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlee to Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaker gave Melbourne a \u201cyou\u2019re not taking this seriously, I take it?\u201d look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re the serious one, not me. 055 breaks containment.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever. We don\u2019t even <em>have</em> a fifty-five, I don\u2019t think. Mass outbreak of 217.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melbourne crossed his arms and put on an irked face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to say something stupid like 'Wait for Rights to have another kid,' right? Well, you\u2019re wrong, and your idea is stupid. Pick something that we haven\u2019t already dealt with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. How do you like this one? Video of 597 gets on the internet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Melbourne\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cDo you even know what you suggest?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn straight I am! Look, most hormone-crazed guys only know the philosophy of \u201cmoar boobs\u201d. The revelation that there is such a thing as \u201ctoo much boobs\u201d would send the \u2018net into spiraling anarchy followed by implosion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 You know what, I\u2019m not going to say anything.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>\n<p>\u201c804 starts spinning out of control,\u201d Breaker said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry to remember my Boy Scout training? Either that or smash it with a rock, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re supposed to be having fun with this and you are definitely not having fun with this. Look, here\u2019s how you do it: 231-7 gives birth, coinciding with 682 breaking containment, 076-2 turning against the Foundation, and something super-bad coming out of 354. The combined sum of these causes a containment breach on almost every other Keter-level item we have.\u201d</p>\n<p>With Melbourne\u2019s trump card played, Breaker was quiet. Nearly half a minute passed, the researcher not moving more than a twitch. Then, a smug smile spread across his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling like that again, Breaker.\u201d Melbourne pointed his fork at him. \u201cGood things do not happen when you have that smile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the easiest one yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow so? Suicide\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill easy. First, I activate the emergency termination protocol for the D-class barracks, then I run in there and apply 447 on each and every dead body in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melbourne\u2019s expression was priceless.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em> is that supposed to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, since things really couldn\u2019t get any worse, the normally catastrophic effect of letting 447 near so many dead bodies will cancel everything else out.\u201d Breaker stood up, taking his empty tray with him. \u201cOr it\u2019d just destroy the universe. Either way it\u2019d be an improvement, and I believe that is game over, my friend.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>|<a href=\"/the-s-c-plastics-hub\">Hub</a>|</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/stratagem\">Stratagem</a>\" by Djoric, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Started singing a bastardized version of \u201cThe Immigrant Song\u201d with a //very// interesting use of the word \u2018defenestrate\u2019, among other things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who were the researchers?\u201d Breaker could see where this story was going.\n\n\n\n\u201cDrs. Jameson, Ulrich, and Ferrier.\u201d\n\n\n\nBreaker slapped the table and laughed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew it! I saw that one coming a mile away.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle they haven\u2019t been demoted to D-class by now. They can\u2019t go a week without getting Supervisor Bricket\u2019s panties in a bunch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTrue that.\u201d Melbourne swallowed a forkful of macaroni. \u201cMoving to a completely different subject, I have fifty bucks riding on a bet and I need an answer from you.\u201d\n\n\n\nBreaker sighed. Melbourne\u2019s gambling habit was the bane of everyone who knew him, as he would inevitably ask them for a bailout. Unfortunately, the doctor could see no applicable escape routes from the cafeteria. \n\n\n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said, dreading what came next.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that 008 broke containment. Widespread infection, no chance of containment. What do you do?\u201d\n\n\n\nBreaker didn\u2019t expect something so\u2026 serious.\n\n\n\n\u201cLock down the facility, switch to backup generators. Use drones to recon the situation outside. If it\u2019s truly an XC or XK-class scenario, we fall back to basics: our facilities can be easily defended; we have food, weapons, water, and medical supplies already. If we\u2019re in for the long haul, we\u2019ll ration and improvise as necessary. If there are any SCPs that would cause a danger to us or a drain on limited resources, we destroy them. All the others we use to our advantage.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelbourne smiled.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the book, but I\u2019ll count that as a zombie plan. And they said you didn\u2019t have one. That\u2019s fifty bucks in my pocket right there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA zombie plan? That\u2019s what you call it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOr SCP-008 contingency plan, if you want.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care, actually.\u201d Breaker went back to his sandwich.\n\n\n\n\u201cAw, come on. Ask me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d He glared at the other researcher. \u201cWhat\u2019s your zombie plan?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong! Ask me something different.\u201d\n\n\n\nBreaker stroked his chin.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026you\u2019re stuck in a room with 173.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe not blinking is the first order of business. So long as I can keep one eye open, I\u2019ll run backwards out the emergency exit and do it fast.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFair enough. That\u2019s really the only thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy turn. 705 takes over the break room.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you kidding? They wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against my five-year-old nephew.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSend him in; it would be hilarious. Maybe we can introduce them to 387 afterwards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let the administration hear that one. 239 wakes up and decides she\u2019s not too fond of us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFlee to Canada.\u201d\n\n\n\nBreaker gave Melbourne a \u201cyou\u2019re not taking this seriously, I take it?\u201d look.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re the serious one, not me. 055 breaks containment.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cWhat?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever. We don\u2019t even //have// a fifty-five, I don\u2019t think. Mass outbreak of 217.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelbourne crossed his arms and put on an irked face.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to say something stupid like 'Wait for Rights to have another kid,' right? Well, you\u2019re wrong, and your idea is stupid. Pick something that we haven\u2019t already dealt with.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. How do you like this one? Video of 597 gets on the internet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Melbourne\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cDo you even know what you suggest?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDamn straight I am! Look, most hormone-crazed guys only know the philosophy of \u201cmoar boobs\u201d. The revelation that there is such a thing as \u201ctoo much boobs\u201d would send the \u2018net into spiraling anarchy followed by implosion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 You know what, I\u2019m not going to say anything.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere was an awkward pause.\n\n\n\n\u201c804 starts spinning out of control,\u201d Breaker said.\n\n\n\n\u201cTry to remember my Boy Scout training? Either that or smash it with a rock, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re supposed to be having fun with this and you are definitely not having fun with this. Look, here\u2019s how you do it: 231-7 gives birth, coinciding with 682 breaking containment, 076-2 turning against the Foundation, and something super-bad coming out of 354. The combined sum of these causes a containment breach on almost every other Keter-level item we have.\u201d \n\n\n\nWith Melbourne\u2019s trump card played, Breaker was quiet.\u00a0\u00a0Nearly half a minute passed, the researcher not moving more than a twitch. Then, a smug smile spread across his face.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re smiling like that again, Breaker.\u201d Melbourne pointed his fork at him. \u201cGood things do not happen when you have that smile.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the easiest one yet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow so? Suicide\u2019s against the rules.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cStill easy. First, I activate the emergency termination protocol for the D-class barracks, then I run in there and apply 447 on each and every dead body in there.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelbourne\u2019s expression was priceless.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the //fuck// is that supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, since things really couldn\u2019t get any worse, the normally catastrophic effect of letting 447 near so many dead bodies will cancel everything else out.\u201d Breaker stood up, taking his empty tray with him. \u201cOr it\u2019d just destroy the universe. Either way it\u2019d be an improvement, and I believe that is game over, my friend.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**|[[[the-s-c-plastics-hub|Hub]]]|**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["the-s-c-plastics-hub", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "black-comedy", "comedy", "featured", "s&c-plastics", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Stratagem - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/stratagem", "year": 2010}, "swimmer": {"created_at": "2010-01-18T13:54:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-01-18T13:54:00"}, {"author": "Agent Kramer", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agent-kramer", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-23T04:07:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-27T02:38:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

That wonderful time of year when big yellow buses rumble down suburban streets, when schoolyards are alive with the shriek and laughter of children, when highschools are bustling with students either eager to learn or eager to get it over with. It seems picturesque, yes?</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s not the case in the small town of Sycamore Corner.</p>\n<p>Sycamore Corner is located in (dare I say it) middle of fuckall NOWHERE, Maine. No real roads going in, no roads going out. Industry? Wood. Did I mention that middle of fuckall NOWHERE, Maine, is home to a hell of a lot of trees? It\u2026 yeah, there are trees. Most of the businesses are woodbased. Wood flooring, firewood, wood sculpture, wood shoes\u2026 hell, we even have some crazy batshit lady who sells wood clothing. But yeah, wood. Lots of it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Sycamore Center isn\u2019t like other towns, especially in September. See, that\u2019s when school starts, and honestly the weirdest time is when school starts. Sycamore Center has but one school, and almost every time school is starting people forget about it. It\u2019s called Sycamore Center Preparatory, and it\u2019s this really big old looking school. On the outside it is a really old, really tall building. It\u2019s hard to believe that people forget it\u2019s there, but whatever. Inside, it\u2019s all white. Every wall, every floor is white. It\u2019s like being in a really creepy hospital.</p>\n<p>The teachers are really really off, too. Once, I took a picture of my \u2018bioethics\u2019 teacher, Mr. Alto. His head turned into a giant angry fuzzy spider. And he\u2019s always ranting about green classes or something and how we should just shoot them in the head if they even look at us. And Ms. Lefts or Rights or some other direction was always hitting on the boys during sex ed (and some of the girls, too)\u2026 I mean, that\u2019s not bad thing or anything, but it\u2019s really damn distracting when you want to LEARN. Don\u2019t even get me started on Principal Gears. I am absolutely certain that he\u2019s at least a cyborg, perhaps even just a plain old robot.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t have yellow school buses here. We have these big black buses operated typically by people in orange jumpsuits, always swearing at us and telling us to shut up. You never see the same person for more than a month, either.</p>\n<p>The first day of school started off normally, at least for us. How normal can you get here? The bus rumbled up and all the students got in. Sycamore Center Preparatory was the only school in town, so we all had to go there. I kind of felt bad for the little bitties. They had no clue what they were getting into, and they got Mr. Konny. Mr. Konny is\u2026 well, frightening. I still have nightmares about him and his butterfly habitat. And don\u2019t even start me on his friend Mr. Kain. He likes us to THINK that Mr. Kain is a fully animated robot in a very convincing dog suit. After I stepped in one of Mr. Kain's 'presents', I don't think that's the case.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it was my last year and I planned on getting the hell out of middle of FUCKALL NOWHERE, Maine. There\u2019s a lot of that here, you know. Once you\u2019re away from the beach, it\u2019s just nothing. I was planning on applying to big name universities because, you know, my grades were like the highest in the town. Not saying much, given the population of about 200, but it was impressive to me. I was planning on Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Wellesley, the whole nine yards. That is, until I was called into Mr. Gears\u2019 office.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gears\u2019 office was white like the rest of the school. It had a poster that was probably trying to be uplifting, but only made me even more anxious. It read \u2018There is no canon\u2019 and had a picture of some kind of horse made of vines or something\u2026 Anyway, I sat there uncomfortably waiting for him to decide to come in. I think principals do that sort of thing on purpose, you know. Making you sit there uncomfortably, sweating, trying to figure out what you did so that you blurt out random things they probably weren\u2019t going to yell at you for.</p>\n<p>Finally, after what felt like forever (though according to my watch was just five minutes), Mr. Gears strode in, holding a file with a funny symbol on it. He sat down across from me and dropped the file in front of me. I tentatively opened it to see my name, my most recent school picture (wow, I need something to treat this acne and dammit we don\u2019t have an orthodontist anywhere in town my teeth are sooooo crooked), and every single paper I\u2019ve ever written, from when I was in kindergarten to now. Every report card, every certificate, every newspaper article that even mentioned me. My life was in that file.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Gears\u2026\u201d I finally started, \u201cW-what is this all about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Gears just sat there, stoic as always.

That wonderful time of year when big yellow buses rumble down suburban streets, when schoolyards are alive with the shriek and laughter of children, when highschools are bustling with students either eager to learn or eager to get it over with. It seems picturesque, yes?\n\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s not the case in the small town of Sycamore Corner.\n\n\n\nSycamore Corner is located in (dare I say it) middle of fuckall NOWHERE, Maine. No real roads going in, no roads going out. Industry? Wood. Did I mention that middle of fuckall NOWHERE, Maine, is home to a hell of a lot of trees? It\u2026 yeah, there are trees. Most of the businesses are woodbased. Wood flooring, firewood, wood sculpture, wood shoes\u2026 hell, we even have some crazy batshit lady who sells wood clothing. But yeah, wood. Lots of it.\n\n\n\nAnyway, Sycamore Center isn\u2019t like other towns, especially in September. See, that\u2019s when school starts, and honestly the weirdest time is when school starts. Sycamore Center has but one school, and almost every time school is starting people forget about it. It\u2019s called Sycamore Center Preparatory, and it\u2019s this really big old looking school. On the outside it is a really old, really tall building. It\u2019s hard to believe that people forget it\u2019s there, but whatever. Inside, it\u2019s all white. Every wall, every floor is white. It\u2019s like being in a really creepy hospital.\n\n\n\nThe teachers are really really off, too. Once, I took a picture of my \u2018bioethics\u2019 teacher, Mr. Alto. His head turned into a giant angry fuzzy spider. And he\u2019s always ranting about green classes or something and how we should just shoot them in the head if they even look at us. And Ms. Lefts or Rights or some other direction was always hitting on the boys during sex ed (and some of the girls, too)\u2026 I mean, that\u2019s not bad thing or anything, but it\u2019s really damn distracting when you want to LEARN. Don\u2019t even get me started on Principal Gears. I am absolutely certain that he\u2019s at least a cyborg, perhaps even just a plain old robot.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t have yellow school buses here. We have these big black buses operated typically by people in orange jumpsuits, always swearing at us and telling us to shut up. You never see the same person for more than a month, either.\n\n\n\nThe first day of school started off normally, at least for us. How normal can you get here? The bus rumbled up and all the students got in. Sycamore Center Preparatory was the only school in town, so we all had to go there. I kind of felt bad for the little bitties. They had no clue what they were getting into, and they got Mr. Konny. Mr. Konny is\u2026 well, frightening. I still have nightmares about him and his butterfly habitat. And don\u2019t even start me on his friend Mr. Kain. He likes us to THINK that Mr. Kain is a fully animated robot in a very convincing dog suit. After I stepped in one of Mr. Kain's 'presents', I don't think that's the case.\n\n\n\nAnyway, it was my last year and I planned on getting the hell out of middle of FUCKALL NOWHERE, Maine. There\u2019s a lot of that here, you know. Once you\u2019re away from the beach, it\u2019s just nothing. I was planning on applying to big name universities because, you know, my grades were like the highest in the town. Not saying much, given the population of about 200, but it was impressive to me. I was planning on Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Wellesley, the whole nine yards. That is, until I was called into Mr. Gears\u2019 office.\n\n\n\nMr. Gears\u2019 office was white like the rest of the school. It had a poster that was probably trying to be uplifting, but only made me even more anxious. It read \u2018There is no canon\u2019 and had a picture of some kind of horse made of vines or something\u2026 Anyway, I sat there uncomfortably waiting for him to decide to come in. I think principals do that sort of thing on purpose, you know. Making you sit there uncomfortably, sweating, trying to figure out what you did so that you blurt out random things they probably weren\u2019t going to yell at you for.\n\n\n\nFinally, after what felt like forever (though according to my watch was just five minutes), Mr. Gears strode in, holding a file with a funny symbol on it. He sat down across from me and dropped the file in front of me. I tentatively opened it to see my name, my most recent school picture (wow, I need something to treat this acne and dammit we don\u2019t have an orthodontist anywhere in town my teeth are sooooo crooked), and every single paper I\u2019ve ever written, from when I was in kindergarten to now. Every report card, every certificate, every newspaper article that even mentioned me. My life was in that file.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Gears\u2026\u201d I finally started, \u201cW-what is this all about?\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Gears just sat there, stoic as always. He said in his typical monotone, \u201cYou interest us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou interest us, and we want you in our ranks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRanks? Wh-what are you\u2014\u201c I didn\u2019t get to finish that sentence. I felt something in my neck, then the world started to spin around me.\n\n\n\nBefore I collapsed, I distinctly heard Mr. Gears saying, \u201cWelcome to the Foundation.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-kondraki", "doctor-rights", "first-person", "kain-pathos-crow", "school", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Sycamore Center Preparatory - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sycamore-center-preparatory", "year": 2010}, "taking-stock": {"created_at": "2010-08-05T07:58:00", "creator": "Arlecchino", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "New Story!", "date": "2010-08-05T07:58:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "rating module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:18:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

The moon is full and bright, of course, and white as the bleached teeth in a broken skull.\n<p>He does not know yet, as he tugs at the lapels of his corduroy coat and adjusts his left ear bud petulantly, that he is the last living man. Certainly, he thinks, in a world so vast there must be others. Pockets, perhaps, of civilization remaining even untouched by the myriad otherworldly taints that have left him bereft of company. On optimistic days he keeps a weather eye on the horizons and glances curiously down side streets in hopes of spotting someone, anyone\u2026 There is no one.</p>\n<p>It's a cool October evening, and he chuckles as he sees the usual assortment of flapping bedsheet ghosts hanging from well manicured ornamental trees, and winks conspiratorially at a grinning jack o lantern. The soft guitar of his music blends neatly with the hiss of wind, and the sound of harsh laughter somewhere to his right. Grinning to himself, he takes a left, toward the park.</p>\n<p>This is not the first such evening walk he's taken, casting away the protection of his fortified home and meandering in the twilight, dodging the dangers of what the world has become, but it is the latest he's yet dared to do so. Already the distant streets echo with the occasional crash and shatter of the night's early merriment. The last man quickens his step and checks the small pistol in his pocket. One bullet, as always. He'd have no use for more than one, not anymore.</p>\n<p>The last man pauses by the buckled gates at the park's entrance to remove his crucifix, hanging it by the chain from a strangely tilted wrought iron fencepost. He makes a note to retrieve it on the way back, and delves into the deeper dusk of the park.</p>\n<p>Under his feet crunch leaves and gravel and what he suspects was once bone as he idly ambles down a path leading to the tennis courts. It's a good night. At a certain point he pauses, reaching to his throat to ensure that he's left his crucifix behind, then plunges forward into a small clearing where the air is filled with a strange clicking rumble and the smell of grease and the battery acid tinge of electricity. He winces as one of the buttons of his jacket frees itself from the material with a gunshot crack and flies into the darkness, its edge nicking his cheek in passing. He'd forgotten about that one.</p>\n<p>Deeper still down the path, and his nose fills with a cloying sweet scent, floral and subtly entrancing. Lovely. He inhales deeply and quickens his pace as the slithery sound of lace rustles the leaves to his either side, and turns up the volume on his music before the soft singing can reach his ears. Laconic, he pulls a fistful of now worthless bills from a pocket and lets the wind carry them back like leaves over his shoulder, a tip for a performance he'd have died if he'd heard.</p>\n<p>Coming around the circle, now, back toward the park's entrance, a barely glimpsed movement in the distance makes him pause. He steps into the bright glow of a streetlamp and leans against its post to wait.</p>\n<p>He doesn't have to wait long. Soon enough they round the corner, eyes flashing, and stop at the edge of the circle of light. The last man nods to them, friendly, because they cannot reach him.

The moon is full and bright, of course, and white as the bleached teeth in a broken skull. \n\n\n\nHe does not know yet, as he tugs at the lapels of his corduroy coat and adjusts his left ear bud petulantly, that he is the last living man. Certainly, he thinks, in a world so vast there must be others. Pockets, perhaps, of civilization remaining even untouched by the myriad otherworldly taints that have left him bereft of company. On optimistic days he keeps a weather eye on the horizons and glances curiously down side streets in hopes of spotting someone, anyone... There is no one.\n\n\n\nIt's a cool October evening, and he chuckles as he sees the usual assortment of flapping bedsheet ghosts hanging from well manicured ornamental trees, and winks conspiratorially at a grinning jack o lantern. The soft guitar of his music blends neatly with the hiss of wind, and the sound of harsh laughter somewhere to his right. Grinning to himself, he takes a left, toward the park.\n\n\n\nThis is not the first such evening walk he's taken, casting away the protection of his fortified home and meandering in the twilight, dodging the dangers of what the world has become, but it is the latest he's yet dared to do so. Already the distant streets echo with the occasional crash and shatter of the night's early merriment. The last man quickens his step and checks the small pistol in his pocket. One bullet, as always. He'd have no use for more than one, not anymore.\n\n\n\nThe last man pauses by the buckled gates at the park's entrance to remove his crucifix, hanging it by the chain from a strangely tilted wrought iron fencepost. He makes a note to retrieve it on the way back, and delves into the deeper dusk of the park. \n\n\n\nUnder his feet crunch leaves and gravel and what he suspects was once bone as he idly ambles down a path leading to the tennis courts. It's a good night. At a certain point he pauses, reaching to his throat to ensure that he's left his crucifix behind, then plunges forward into a small clearing where the air is filled with a strange clicking rumble and the smell of grease and the battery acid tinge of electricity. He winces as one of the buttons of his jacket frees itself from the material with a gunshot crack and flies into the darkness, its edge nicking his cheek in passing. He'd forgotten about that one. \n\n\n\nDeeper still down the path, and his nose fills with a cloying sweet scent, floral and subtly entrancing. Lovely. He inhales deeply and quickens his pace as the slithery sound of lace rustles the leaves to his either side, and turns up the volume on his music before the soft singing can reach his ears. Laconic, he pulls a fistful of now worthless bills from a pocket and lets the wind carry them back like leaves over his shoulder, a tip for a performance he'd have died if he'd heard.\n\n\n\nComing around the circle, now, back toward the park's entrance, a barely glimpsed movement in the distance makes him pause. He steps into the bright glow of a streetlamp and leans against its post to wait.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't have to wait long. Soon enough they round the corner, eyes flashing, and stop at the edge of the circle of light. The last man nods to them, friendly, because they cannot reach him. The older one, dressed for the chill he cannot feel in a fuzzy down vest and cowboy hat, smiles wryly. \"Good evening.\". The younger, female, who by looks was once his daughter, simply hisses in anger and crouches to throw a pebble at the light. \"Evening.\" says the last man, pleasantly, and he smiles at her as he puts his pistol to his temple. She shrinks back, making a face, denied the prospect of a meal, and tugs at her elder's coat, pulling him away. \n\n\n\nWhen they've gone, the last man shrugs, pocketing his gun, and strolls out of the park, pausing to retrieve his crucifix and put it on. He heads home, flush with the exhilaration of danger, already planning his route for the next night's walk. There are so few things the last man living has left to make him feel alive.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Tempting Fate - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tempting-fate", "year": 2010}, "thank-you-for-your-time": {"created_at": "2010-08-07T04:57:00", "creator": "DrEverettMann", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-07T04:57:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-08-08T06:43:00"}, {"author": "Asthix", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/asthix", "comment": "Various punctuation and grammar fixes", "date": "2011-05-09T00:51:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 1", "date": "2011-05-09T02:24:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-05-09T02:25:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-05-09T03:49:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2011-05-09T04:12:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

He'd never been in such an elegant club before, and felt terribly out of place. His clothing was rumpled, his long black hair mussed, and his eyes red.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you for meeting me on such short notice,\" he said as he sat down.</p>\n<p>\"No trouble at all, sir. Thank you for your time,\" said the suave man in the business suit, as he shook Braddock's hand. He smiled broadly, showing off perfect teeth. He was in stark contrast with the researcher, not a single hair on his wavy blond coiffure out of place.</p>\n<p>\"I've\u2026 thought about your offer,\" said Braddock.</p>\n<p>\"And?\" The other man raised a neat, trimmed eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"Well\u2026\" Braddock trailed off. \"I think I'd like more information. Your e-mail was, well, a bit vague.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" the man said. \"Now, we're not asking a lot. Certainly nothing your\u2026 employer will miss. Just a few knick-knacks. Odds and ends. We'd be willing to pay handsomely.\"</p>\n<p>\"I think I could do that,\" Braddock said slowly. \"I need money awfully badly, Mister..?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it's best if we keep things on a first-name basis, Jim,\" the man said smoothly. \"Call me Jeremy.\"</p>\n<p>Braddock nodded. He was already feeling much more at ease. \"All right, Jeremy. Ah, did you bring any money with you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, of course. Just a little up front, to help with those little costs.\" Jeremy handed Braddock an envelope. \"My\u2026 associates understand how sometimes, the cards just aren't with you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, thank you so much,\" Braddock said, nearly crying.</p>\n<p>\"There, there,\" Jeremy said, patting him on the shoulder. \"Now it's time for drinks. What's your pleasure? I'm buying.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Braddock made his way to the familiar table. This was his fourth visit. The second time he'd brought something with him.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Jim, glad you could join me. Please, sit.\" Jeremy stood to shake his hand. \"Tell me, how are the races?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not bad. I won a hundred dollars yesterday,\" Braddock said as he sat down, failing to mention that he'd lost twice that in other bets.</p>\n<p>\"Glad to hear it, glad to hear it. Now, what have you got for us this time?\" Jeremy leaned forward in his seat expectantly.</p>\n<p>Braddock looked around nervously.</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry, Jim. We're among friends.\" Jeremy touched Braddock's hand reassuringly.</p>\n<p>\"All right.\" Braddock reached into his suitcase. He pulled out a leather jacket. \"I reported this destroyed this morning. I was supposed to put it in the incinerator. But don't worry. I got a substitute. No one knows it's gone.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's great, Jim. Very clever,\" said Jeremy. \"Now, what does it do?\"</p>\n<p>\"Wearing this lets you breathe underwater,\" he explained. \"Just make sure it's zipped up all the way.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's great, Jim,\" said Jeremy. \"I know someone who'd just love something like this.\" Jeremy put it into a much fancier leather briefcase. \"And here's your money, as promised.\" He pulled out the now-familiar envelope. Braddock took it from his hands eagerly, and took a swift intake of breath when he looked inside.</p>\n<p>\"This means a lot to me,\" Braddock said as they shook hands again.</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Jeremy said. \"I know.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It had been eight years since Braddock had met Jeremy, and he'd changed a great deal in that time. He had a higher-paying position in the Foundation now, and his graying hair lent him an air of authority he'd lacked. And yet, the money still seemed to slip away. At least he had a good, steady, secondary source of money.</p>\n<p>\"Jim!\" Jeremy gave him a warm handshake. He looked the same as he had eight years ago.</p>\n<p>They sat down at the club's bar. Braddock pulled out his latest acquisition.</p>\n<p>It was a black sleep mask, kept sealed in a plastic baggy.</p>\n<p>\"Looks interesting,\" Jeremy said. \"What does this one do?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah. Yes.\" Braddock coughed. \"When worn, the wearer experiences extremely, well, erotic dreams. Full sensory perception. But of rather\u2026 kinky sorts of sex.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" Jeremy's blue eyes lit up with humor. \"Have you tried it out?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 Yes. Once.\" Braddock's cheesed flushed. \"I\u2026 found it more disorienting than anything else. But the D-Cla\u2014 That is, the test subjects found it rather addictive after a time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm. Yes, I think this will do nicely. Well done, Jim.\" Jeremy took the plastic baggy from Braddock and placed it into a velvet-lined box.</p>\n<p>\"I should warn you. If it's used long enough, the subjects\u2026 Well, they die.\" Braddock looked even more embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\"How extraordinary. What of?\" Jeremy asked.</p>\n<p>\"Er, auto-erotic asphyxiation,\" Braddock said, his blush crawling up his face.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'll be sure that it doesn't get put into the, ah, wrong hands,\" Jeremy said.</p>\n<p>\"Getting it wasn't easy,\" said Braddock, a trifle glumly. \"They wanted to test it. I had to make it look like it was destroyed in an accident.\"</p>\n<p>\"Now, Jim,\" Jeremy said, a finger raised, \"you know as well as I do that the old trinkets of yesterday just aren't in as demand with my clients as they used to be. I just couldn't pay you as much for those as I could in the old days.\"</p>\n<p>Braddock winced. He couldn't afford to take a cut in payment. Not at this point. Not with his debts. \"Right. Right.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, you're a pro, Jim. I'm sure you can handle just about anything, right?\" Jeremy gave him one of those brilliant smiles.</p>\n<p>\"Right,\" Braddock said, his confidence returning. There were times he almost felt like a secret agent, going undercover. Just call him 005.</p>\n<p>\"Here's your payment. I think you'll find it's more than sufficient.\" Jeremy handed him the customary envelope.</p>\n<p>Braddock didn't bother opening it. Jeremy had never once failed to pay him enough once satisfied. Not in the entire time Braddock had known him.</p>\n<p>They shook hands, and Braddock hurried out. There was just time to place a bet.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Braddock walked into the club, escorted by a frightened young woman with mousy brown hair. He cooed reassuring words to her, and she calmed down. Certainly, these days Braddock presented a rather harmless front, with his balding pate and prematurely lined face. Not even forty, and he was already starting to look old. He'd always hoped he'd age gracefully, like his father. No such luck.</p>\n<p>Ah well. No use griping about the inevitable. \"Right this way, my dear,\" he said, in a fatherly tone.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Jim, there you are. And who's this enchanting specimen?\" Jeremy asked.</p>\n<p>\"This is Renee,\" Braddock said. \"She's the girl I told you about.\" Renee was an amazing discovery. By chance, he'd found the order for her capture, and managed to find her before the MTF did. It had been a risk, but Jeremy had been so blasted picky these days.</p>\n<p>He didn't seem disappointed today, however. \"Enchant\u00e9,\" he said, bowing gallantly, taking her hand lightly.</p>\n<p>Renee blushed, and smiled shyly. She looked more relaxed than she'd been since Braddock had found her the day before. \"Thank you,\" she said softly.</p>\n<p>\"Renee has a special gift,\" Braddock said. \"She can regenerate parts of herself. Quite quickly, too, I'm given to understand.\" That was an understatement. In the incident that had brought her to the Foundation's attention, she'd lost her arm in a car accident. It had grown back by the time they got her to the hospital. The official story was that the paramedics had simply made a mistake, but Braddock knew better. He'd even been able to experiment a little, with Renee's permission. Just a few tests, with full anesthesia.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Mr. Carter's going to love you,\" Jeremy said. He turned back to Braddock. \"And here you go, Jim. Come back in a week. I think you've earned a bonus.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's going on, Doctor?\" Renee asked, suddenly suspicious.</p>\n<p>\"Just a little business between us,\" Jeremy said smoothly. \"Nothing to worry about.\" He stood, and held out his arm to her. \"Why don't we just go arrange transportation for you? Jim, order whatever you like, and put it on my tab. I'll see you next week.\"</p>\n<p>Braddock nodded as he watched them leave. He felt a little\u2026 troubled by the affair. He'd given them plenty of objects in the past fifteen years, some of them almost alive, but this was the first time he'd ever sold a <em>person</em>.</p>\n<p>Well, she was better off in their hands than in the Foundation's. Probably. Anyway, what was he supposed to do? His funds were going dry. He just needed a little more, so he could make that big win\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Braddock stumbled into the club, wheezing for breath. He cursed his body, letting itself become so old, so young. \"Jeremy! Where are you?\"</p>\n<p>The club was deserted. The lights were turned off, the decor removed. Even the furniture was gone. All except for one familiar table. Jeremy seemed to be the sole occupant of the building. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked politely.</p>\n<p>\"They know!\" Braddock said, miserably. \"I don't know how, but they found out!\"</p>\n<p>\"I was afraid something like this would happen,\" Jeremy said. He was as smooth as ever, but there was something\u2026 distant about him. \"You shouldn't have tried siphoning that money from their accounts.\"</p>\n<p>Braddock did a double take. \"How did you know about that?\"</p>\n<p>\"We've watched your finances for a long time, Jim. How do you think we found you?\" he asked. \"Knew about your debts? When we saw all that money appear in your account, well, it had to come from somewhere. Where else could you have gotten it?\"</p>\n<p>\"What am I going to do?\" Braddock asked. \"Jeremy, you've got to help me.\"</p>\n<p>Jeremy sighed, and placed a hand on Braddock's shoulder. However, rather than reassure, it simply pushed him down. He felt the strength leave his legs, and he collapsed to his knees. \"I'm afraid not, Jim. You've become a liability to us. You're just no use to us now. At this point, you're just a loose end. I'll leave it to your friends to clean you up. I'm sure you gave them a nice, clear trail to follow.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jeremy! You can't do this,\" Braddock whimpered, unable to rise. \"Jeremy!\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, Jim. But hey, thanks for your time.\" He turned away, paused, and turned back. \"Oh, and Jim? It's Mister Marshall. Good day.\"</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/thank-you-for-your-time\">Thank You For Your Time</a>\" by DrEverettMann, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

like this.\"\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy put it into a much fancier leather briefcase.\u00a0\u00a0\"And here's your money, as promised.\"\u00a0\u00a0He pulled out the now-familiar envelope.\u00a0\u00a0Braddock took it from his hands eagerly, and took a swift intake of breath when he looked inside.\n\n\n\n\"This means a lot to me,\" Braddock said as they shook hands again.\n\n\n\n\"I know,\" Jeremy said.\u00a0\u00a0\"I know.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nIt had been eight years since Braddock had met Jeremy, and he'd changed a great deal in that time.\u00a0\u00a0He had a higher-paying position in the Foundation now, and his graying hair lent him an air of authority he'd lacked.\u00a0\u00a0And yet, the money still seemed to slip away.\u00a0\u00a0At least he had a good, steady, secondary source of money.\n\n\n\n\"Jim!\" Jeremy gave him a warm handshake.\u00a0\u00a0He looked the same as he had eight years ago.\n\n\n\nThey sat down at the club's bar.\u00a0\u00a0Braddock pulled out his latest acquisition.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was a black sleep mask, kept sealed in a plastic baggy.\n\n\n\n\"Looks interesting,\" Jeremy said.\u00a0\u00a0\"What does this one do?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah.\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\"\u00a0\u00a0Braddock coughed.\u00a0\u00a0\"When worn, the wearer experiences extremely, well, erotic dreams.\u00a0\u00a0Full sensory perception.\u00a0\u00a0But of rather... kinky sorts of sex.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see.\"\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy's blue eyes lit up with humor.\u00a0\u00a0\"Have you tried it out?\"\n\n\n\n\"I...\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0\u00a0Once.\"\u00a0\u00a0Braddock's cheesed flushed.\u00a0\u00a0\"I... found it more disorienting than anything else.\u00a0\u00a0But the D-Cla--\u00a0\u00a0That is, the test subjects found it rather addictive after a time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I think this will do nicely.\u00a0\u00a0Well done, Jim.\"\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy took the plastic baggy from Braddock and placed it into a velvet-lined box.\n\n\n\n\"I should warn you.\u00a0\u00a0If it's used long enough, the subjects...\u00a0\u00a0Well, they die.\"\u00a0\u00a0Braddock looked even more embarrassed.\n\n\n\n\"How extraordinary.\u00a0\u00a0What of?\"\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy asked.\n\n\n\n\"Er, auto-erotic asphyxiation,\" Braddock said, his blush crawling up his face.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I'll be sure that it doesn't get put into the, ah, wrong hands,\" Jeremy said.\n\n\n\n\"Getting it wasn't easy,\" said Braddock, a trifle glumly.\u00a0\u00a0\"They wanted to test it.\u00a0\u00a0I had to make it look like it was destroyed in an accident.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now, Jim,\" Jeremy said, a finger raised, \"you know as well as I do that the old trinkets of yesterday just aren't in as demand with my clients as they used to be.\u00a0\u00a0I just couldn't pay you as much for those as I could in the old days.\"\n\n\n\nBraddock winced.\u00a0\u00a0He couldn't afford to take a cut in payment.\u00a0\u00a0Not at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Not with his debts.\u00a0\u00a0\"Right.\u00a0\u00a0Right.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, you're a pro, Jim.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you can handle just about anything, right?\" Jeremy gave him one of those brilliant smiles.\n\n\n\n\"Right,\" Braddock said, his confidence returning.\u00a0\u00a0There were times he almost felt like a secret agent, going undercover.\u00a0\u00a0Just call him 005.\n\n\n\n\"Here's your payment.\u00a0\u00a0I think you'll find it's more than sufficient.\"\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy handed him the customary envelope.\n\n\n\nBraddock didn't bother opening it.\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy had never once failed to pay him enough once satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0Not in the entire time Braddock had known him.\n\n\n\nThey shook hands, and Braddock hurried out.\u00a0\u00a0There was just time to place a bet.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBraddock walked into the club, escorted by a frightened young woman with mousy brown hair.\u00a0\u00a0He cooed reassuring words to her, and she calmed down.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, these days Braddock presented a rather harmless front, with his balding pate and prematurely lined face.\u00a0\u00a0Not even forty, and he was already starting to look old.\u00a0\u00a0He'd always hoped he'd age gracefully, like his father.\u00a0\u00a0No such luck.\n\n\n\nAh well.\u00a0\u00a0No use griping about the inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0\"Right this way, my dear,\" he said, in a fatherly tone.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, Jim, there you are.\u00a0\u00a0And who's this enchanting specimen?\" Jeremy asked.\n\n\n\n\"This is Renee,\" Braddock said.\u00a0\u00a0\"She's the girl I told you about.\"\u00a0\u00a0Renee was an amazing discovery.\u00a0\u00a0By chance, he'd found the order for her capture, and managed to find her before the MTF did.\u00a0\u00a0It had been a risk, but Jeremy had been so blasted picky these days.\n\n\n\nHe didn't seem disappointed today, however.\u00a0\u00a0\"Enchant\u00e9,\" he said, bowing gallantly, taking her hand lightly.\n\n\n\nRenee blushed, and smiled shyly.\u00a0\u00a0She looked more relaxed than she'd been since Braddock had found her the day before.\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you,\" she said softly.\n\n\n\n\"Renee has a special gift,\" Braddock said.\u00a0\u00a0\"She can regenerate parts of herself.\u00a0\u00a0Quite quickly, too, I'm given to understand.\"\u00a0\u00a0That was an understatement.\u00a0\u00a0In the incident that had brought her to the Foundation's attention, she'd lost her arm in a car accident.\u00a0\u00a0It had grown back by the time they got her to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The official story was that the paramedics had simply made a mistake, but Braddock knew better.\u00a0\u00a0He'd even been able to experiment a little, with Renee's permission.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few tests, with full anesthesia.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Carter's going to love you,\" Jeremy said.\u00a0\u00a0He turned back to Braddock.\u00a0\u00a0\"And here you go, Jim.\u00a0\u00a0Come back in a week.\u00a0\u00a0I think you've earned a bonus.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's going on, Doctor?\" Renee asked, suddenly suspicious.\n\n\n\n\"Just a little business between us,\" Jeremy said smoothly.\u00a0\u00a0\"Nothing to worry about.\"\u00a0\u00a0He stood, and held out his arm to her.\u00a0\u00a0\"Why don't we just go arrange transportation for you?\u00a0\u00a0Jim, order whatever you like, and put it on my tab.\u00a0\u00a0I'll see you next week.\"\n\n\n\nBraddock nodded as he watched them leave.\u00a0\u00a0He felt a little... troubled by the affair.\u00a0\u00a0He'd given them plenty of objects in the past fifteen years, some of them almost alive, but this was the first time he'd ever sold a //person//.\n\n\n\nWell, she was better off in their hands than in the Foundation's.\u00a0\u00a0Probably.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, what was he supposed to do?\u00a0\u00a0His funds were going dry.\u00a0\u00a0He just needed a little more, so he could make that big win...\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBraddock stumbled into the club, wheezing for breath.\u00a0\u00a0He cursed his body, letting itself become so old, so young.\u00a0\u00a0\"Jeremy!\u00a0\u00a0Where are you?\"\n\n\n\nThe club was deserted.\u00a0\u00a0The lights were turned off, the decor removed.\u00a0\u00a0Even the furniture was gone.\u00a0\u00a0All except for one familiar table.\u00a0\u00a0Jeremy seemed to be the sole occupant of the building.\u00a0\u00a0\"What can I do for you?\" he asked politely.\n\n\n\n\"They know!\" Braddock said, miserably.\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know how, but they found out!\"\n\n\n\n\"I was afraid something like this would happen,\" Jeremy said.\u00a0\u00a0He was as smooth as ever, but there was something... distant about him.\u00a0\u00a0\"You shouldn't have tried siphoning that money from their accounts.\"\n\n\n\nBraddock did a double take.\u00a0\u00a0\"How did you know about that?\"\n\n\n\n\"We've watched your finances for a long time, Jim.\u00a0\u00a0How do you think we found you?\" he asked.\u00a0\u00a0\"Knew about your debts?\u00a0\u00a0When we saw all that money appear in your account, well, it had to come from somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0Where else could you have gotten it?\"\n\n\n\n\"What am I going to do?\" Braddock asked.\u00a0\u00a0\"Jeremy, you've got to help me.\"\n\n\n\nJeremy sighed, and placed a hand on Braddock's shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0However, rather than reassure, it simply pushed him down.\u00a0\u00a0He felt the strength leave his legs, and he collapsed to his knees.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm afraid not, Jim.\u00a0\u00a0You've become a liability to us.\u00a0\u00a0You're just no use to us now.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, you're just a loose end.\u00a0\u00a0I'll leave it to your friends to clean you up.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you gave them a nice, clear trail to follow.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jeremy!\u00a0\u00a0You can't do this,\" Braddock whimpered, unable to rise.\u00a0\u00a0\"Jeremy!\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, Jim.\u00a0\u00a0But hey, thanks for your time.\"\u00a0\u00a0He turned away, paused, and turned back.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, and Jim?\u00a0\u00a0It's Mister Marshall.\u00a0\u00a0Good day.\"\n\n[[include <a

It made an obnoxious clacking sound when Dr. Johannes Sorts shifted his weight, the noise echoing through the unnecessarily large concrete room. Row upon row of harsh florescent lights buzzed overhead, the sound only momentarily drowned out when Dr. Sorts shifted his weight back again. Clack.</p>\n<p>Agent Schaffer cast an irritated glance over the top of a manila folder. He closed it and clasped his hands atop the blank cover, leaning forward across the scarred and pitted old cafeteria table between himself and the doctor. Apart from the comfortable padded folding chair he occupied, the doctor and the table were the only other things in the stadium sized chamber.</p>\n<p>\"You do, of course, know where we are and why we are here?\" Schaffer asked, the first he had spoken since security had escorted the twitchy little doctor into the room.</p>\n<p>Dr. Sorts rolled his eyes in open contempt but cast his gaze towards the unfinished floor and mumbled, \"I'm not stupid. I also know you stuck me in this chair to make me feel uncomfortable. I know what this room was used for before it was re-purposed to contain th\u2014that\u2026 goddamn thing.\"</p>\n<p>Schaffer watched the doctor very carefully, noting the difficulty with which the other man spoke. He opened the folder again, noting that the enclosed psychological profile had indicated a marked increase in the subject's paranoia in the past months. \"Doctor, that was the only other chair in the room. We did not bring it in here to torment you. It's not like we entertain guests here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, t-two chairs in the room, and you got the good one. Call it what you will,\" Sorts grumbled, shifting his weight again to send a clacking sound to bounce about the distant walls. \"The floors in here are rough and dirty, only worn smooth in tracks where the forklifts moved the pallets around. How much manpower did it take to yank up all the old shelves that used to be in this storage room just so it could be a glorified lobby for you\u2026 I mean that\u2026 that fu\u2014goddamn thing\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like to trade seats?\" the agent offered calmly.</p>\n<p>\"I think I'm fine where I am, annoying you with this unbalanced chair.\" Sorts squirmed back and forth until his chair made a squealing noise on the concrete.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor Sorts, you are a level 2 researcher. Given that you lack the clearance, could you explain exactly how you learned about me?\"</p>\n<p>Sorts gripped the edge of the table with pudgy hands and finally met the Agent's eyes with a contemptuous glare. \"Don't talk like that. You and I both know wh-what\u2026\" The doctor licked his dry lips and swallowed before continuing. \"You and I both know what we're talking about. But I'm the only person who can speak honestly here. You lack the capability.\"</p>\n<p>\"You didn't answer my question. This is a grave security breach. Given your own specialized research into memetics, you understand the severity of this leak and how your very knowledge of me is a dangerous liability.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what, you're going to terminate me?\" Sorts screeched. \"The only person who can deal with\u2026 <em>that goddamn thing?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Your open discussion of\u2026\" Agent Schaffer paused to consider his words carefully. \"\u2026this matter caused a memetic containment breach that infected the entire breakroom at site 19.\"</p>\n<p>\"Memetics is bullshit!\" Sorts interjected. \"A meme is when I say 'Knock, knock' and you say 'Who's there?' It's not a virus, it's not a weapon. It's not a compulsion. The other researchers in the breakroom are not sick\u2014any more than they already were, anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doctor\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Sorts laughed. \"Meme is a fucking stupid word to fancy up the concept of a running joke, one of the more irritating concepts that mouth-breathing crap-flinger Richard Dawkins has inflicted upon an undeserving world. I hate the very word. 'Mmmmeeeeeeem.' I pronounce it 'maim' every time I can because I hate it so much.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought it was pronounced that way.\" Schaffer frowned.</p>\n<p>\"You thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight!\" Sorts laughed, then rubbed his forehead. \"Oh god. There I go. That's an obscure one, I don't expect you'd know the reference. But see? A meme is only as good as the amount of people that understand its context. Context is the key to unlocking these things. I learned about <em>that goddamn thing</em> by paying attention to the context. I talked to the people who were rotated out of working containment in here. I noticed the peculiar pattern in their speech. I deduced the rest.\"</p>\n<p>Schaffer raised his eyebrows. \"You'd never seen me before now?\"</p>\n<p>Sorts just narrowed his eyes. \"I know enough about <em>that goddamn thing</em> to know this is a ridiculous waste of resources. Where is it right now? That old supply closet over there? The one that has a fancy electric lock and the old faded 'fertilizer' sign that was obviously recently added? All the other doors in this room are either sealed off or specifically go somewhere. Seriously pathetic misdirection there.\"</p>\n<p>Schaffer had heard enough, he stood up from his seat and gestured to the aforementioned door. \"Yes, that's where they keep me. Would you like a look at the room? Perhaps, since you have learned so much about me, you can offer some insight into future containment procedures.\"</p>\n<p>The two men strode towards the old closet, which Schaffer opened with a wave of his unique key card. Schaffer picked up a clipboard from the reverse side of the door and read the introductory language that had been carefully prepared to make otherwise straightforward containment procedures sensible.</p>\n<p>Schaffer cleared his throat and recited the lines he had spoken only a few times before, when he was first assigned to security for this containment chamber and during scheduled testing:</p>\n<p><em>\"Hello, I am SCP-426. I must be introduced this way in order to prevent ambiguity. I am an ordinary toaster, able to toast bread when supplied with electricity. However, when any human being mentions me, they inadvertently refer to me in the first person. Despite all attempts, there is yet to be a way to speak or write about me in the third person.\"</em></p>\n<p>Sorts made a derisive sound and waved towards the object sitting on the middle of a shelf in the otherwise empty closet. \"That goddamn thing. That goddamn thing is a <em>goddamn toaster.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"No one else has ever been able to refer to me in that way before, Doctor Sorts. How did you do it? Your file said you had a talent for defusing memetic effects.\"</p>\n<p>\"That goddamn toaster is not a meme! <em>It's a goddamn toaster!</em>\" Sorts snatched the containment papers from Schaffer's hands and read through them with a scowl. \"We have no cultural references to that goddamn toaster. People who never heard about that goddamn toaster refer to\u2026 to it as if it was themselves. Memetics has absolutely no application here. Maybe I'm the normal one and you are all just goddamn idiots.\"</p>\n<p>\"I notice that you have great difficulty referring to me. When you do, you only do so to damn me\u2026 to speak of me derisively. Do you suppose that it is your intense dislike of me that allows you to avoid my effect?\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't say <em>that goddamn toaster</em> had no effect on me. Sure, it's hard for me - that's me, as in Johannes, I can use that word properly - to talk about <em>that goddamn toaster</em> any way I want. Clearly the mere concept of <em>that goddamn toaster</em> has the property of defining itself in the psyche of the individual who thinks of it. It's a glitch in logic. Where you can only refer to <em>that goddamn toaster</em> as yourself, I choose to refer to it as th\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I get the picture, Doctor Sorts. Are you aware of my secondary properties?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't care about your goddamn properties! Secondary, tertiary or otherwise!\" Sorts flipped through the attached test logs. \"You're doing a piss poor job of containing <em>that goddamn toaster</em> though, I tell you what. I could keep this goddamn thing in a box under my desk and do a better job. I sure wouldn't start thinking of myself as a goddamn toaster. I'm not replacing my concept of self with it.\"</p>\n<p>Schaffer hadn't thought much of the pudgy doctor before he started ranting, and he had to fight to keep his voice level when he replied. \"Doctor, please calm down, you're becoming very agitated. This presents a unique opportunity for us to work together, to do some tests regarding our interactions and your ability to avoid my effect.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to work with a goddamn toaster!\" Sorts hung the clipboard back up on the door and reached for the handle.</p>\n<p>Schaffer put a hand on the Doctor's arm. \"I meant me. I want you to work with me.\"</p>\n<p>Sorts whirled upon the agent with a furious grunt, shoving the larger man square in the chest with all his might. \"<em>That goddamn toaster</em> should just stay locked up! I'm clearly not immune to the influence of <em>that goddamn toaster.</em> I don't want to have anything to do with \u2026 with that goddamn\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Schaffer stumbled backwards for a moment but regained control of the situation as his training took over. He redirected the smaller man's momentum and whirled the doctor face first into one of the closet's bare walls with a metallic clack. \"That's quite enough, Doctor Sorts. You don't really have a choice in the matter.\" The agent leaned in and growled with a sharp twist of the doctor's arm, \"Do you really want to do this?\"</p>\n<p>Sorts rolled his eyes back up at Schaffer over his shoulder. \"Alright, alright.\" His words were slurred by the way his lips were rammed against the dirty wall. \"I'm sorry. I get the picture.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. I'm going to let you go now and you're going to deal with me like a rational adult.\" Schaffer released the doctor and took a step back, running his hands down the front of his black uniform. Something tickled the back of his mind, perhaps it was the way Sorts' eyes cleared of panic too quickly, or perhaps it was the absence of a familiar weight at his hip.</p>\n<p>Sorts whirled around, revealing the pistol he had yanked out of the agent's belt on his short trip to kiss the wall.

I mean that... that fu--goddamn thing...\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you like to trade seats?\" the agent offered calmly.\n\n\n\n\"I think I'm fine where I am, annoying you with this unbalanced chair.\" Sorts squirmed back and forth until his chair made a squealing noise on the concrete.\n\n\n\n\"Doctor Sorts, you are a level 2 researcher.\u00a0\u00a0Given that you lack the clearance, could you explain exactly how you learned about me?\"\n\n\n\nSorts gripped the edge of the table with pudgy hands and finally met the Agent's eyes with a contemptuous glare. \"Don't talk like that.\u00a0\u00a0You and I both know wh-what...\" The doctor licked his dry lips and swallowed before continuing. \"You and I both know what we're talking about.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm the only person who can speak honestly here.\u00a0\u00a0You lack the capability.\"\n\n\n\n\"You didn't answer my question.\u00a0\u00a0This is a grave security breach.\u00a0\u00a0Given your own specialized research into memetics, you understand the severity of this leak and how your very knowledge of me is a dangerous liability.\"\n\n\n\n\"So what, you're going to terminate me?\" Sorts screeched. \"The only person who can deal with... //that goddamn thing?//\"\n\n\n\n\"Your open discussion of...\" Agent Schaffer paused to consider his words carefully. \"...this matter caused a memetic containment breach that infected the entire breakroom at site 19.\"\n\n\n\n\"Memetics is bullshit!\" Sorts interjected. \"A meme is when I say 'Knock, knock' and you say 'Who's there?'\u00a0\u00a0It's not a virus, it's not a weapon.\u00a0\u00a0It's not a compulsion.\u00a0\u00a0The other researchers in the breakroom are not sick--any more than they already were, anyway.\"\n\n\n\n\"Doctor...\"\n\n\n\nSorts laughed. \"Meme is a fucking stupid word to fancy up the concept of a running joke, one of the more irritating concepts that mouth-breathing crap-flinger Richard Dawkins has inflicted upon an undeserving world.\u00a0\u00a0I hate the very word. 'Mmmmeeeeeeem.'\u00a0\u00a0I pronounce it 'maim' every time I can because I hate it so much.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thought it was pronounced that way.\" Schaffer frowned.\n\n\n\n\"You thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight!\" Sorts laughed, then rubbed his forehead. \"Oh god.\u00a0\u00a0There I go.\u00a0\u00a0That's an obscure one, I don't expect you'd know the reference.\u00a0\u00a0But see?\u00a0\u00a0A meme is only as good as the amount of people that understand its context.\u00a0\u00a0Context is the key to unlocking these things.\u00a0\u00a0I learned about //that goddamn thing// by paying attention to the context.\u00a0\u00a0I talked to the people who were rotated out of working containment in here.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed the peculiar pattern in their speech.\u00a0\u00a0I deduced the rest.\"\n\n\n\nSchaffer raised his eyebrows. \"You'd never seen me before now?\"\n\n\n\nSorts just narrowed his eyes. \"I know enough about //that goddamn thing// to know this is a ridiculous waste of resources.\u00a0\u00a0Where is it right now?\u00a0\u00a0That old supply closet over there?\u00a0\u00a0The one that has a fancy electric lock and the old faded 'fertilizer' sign that was obviously recently added?\u00a0\u00a0All the other doors in this room are either sealed off or specifically go somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0Seriously pathetic misdirection there.\"\n\n\n\nSchaffer had heard enough, he stood up from his seat and gestured to the aforementioned door. \"Yes, that's where they keep me.\u00a0\u00a0Would you like a look at the room?\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps, since you have learned so much about me, you can offer some insight into future containment procedures.\"\n\n\n\nThe two men strode towards the old closet, which Schaffer opened with a wave of his unique key card.\u00a0\u00a0Schaffer picked up a clipboard from the reverse side of the door and read the introductory language that had been carefully prepared to make otherwise straightforward containment procedures sensible.\n\n\n\nSchaffer cleared his throat and recited the lines he had spoken only a few times before, when he was first assigned to security for this containment chamber and during scheduled testing:\n\n\n\n//\"Hello, I am SCP-426. I must be introduced this way in order to prevent ambiguity. I am an ordinary toaster, able to toast bread when supplied with electricity. However, when any human being mentions me, they inadvertently refer to me in the first person. Despite all attempts, there is yet to be a way to speak or write about me in the third person.\"//\n\n\n\nSorts made a derisive sound and waved towards the object sitting on the middle of a shelf in the otherwise empty closet. \"That goddamn thing.\u00a0\u00a0That goddamn thing is a //goddamn toaster.//\"\n\n\n\n\"No one else has ever been able to refer to me in that way before, Doctor Sorts.\u00a0\u00a0How did you do it?\u00a0\u00a0Your file said you had a talent for defusing memetic effects.\"\n\n\n\n\"That goddamn toaster is not a meme!\u00a0\u00a0//It's a goddamn toaster!//\" Sorts snatched the containment papers from Schaffer's hands and read through them with a scowl. \"We have no cultural references to that goddamn toaster.\u00a0\u00a0People who never heard about that goddamn toaster refer to... to it as if it was themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Memetics has absolutely no application here.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I'm the normal one and you are all just goddamn idiots.\"\n\n\n\n\"I notice that you have great difficulty referring to me.\u00a0\u00a0When you do, you only do so to damn me... to speak of me derisively.\u00a0\u00a0Do you suppose that it is your intense dislike of me that allows you to avoid my effect?\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't say //that goddamn toaster// had no effect on me.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, it's hard for me - that's me, as in Johannes, I can use that word properly - to talk about //that goddamn toaster// any way I want.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly the mere concept of //that goddamn toaster// has the property of defining itself in the psyche of the individual who thinks of it.\u00a0\u00a0It's a glitch in logic.\u00a0\u00a0Where you can only refer to //that goddamn toaster// as yourself, I choose to refer to it as th--\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, I get the picture, Doctor Sorts.\u00a0\u00a0Are you aware of my secondary properties?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't care about your goddamn properties! Secondary, tertiary or otherwise!\" Sorts flipped through the attached test logs. \"You're doing a piss poor job of containing //that goddamn toaster// though, I tell you what.\u00a0\u00a0I could keep this goddamn thing in a box under my desk and do a better job.\u00a0\u00a0I sure wouldn't start thinking of myself as a goddamn toaster.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not replacing my concept of self with it.\"\n\n\n\nSchaffer hadn't thought much of the pudgy doctor before he started ranting, and he had to fight to keep his voice level when he replied. \"Doctor, please calm down, you're becoming very agitated.\u00a0\u00a0This presents a unique opportunity for us to work together, to do some tests regarding our interactions and your ability to avoid my effect.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to work with a goddamn toaster!\" Sorts hung the clipboard back up on the door and reached for the handle.\n\n\n\nSchaffer put a hand on the Doctor's arm. \"I meant me.\u00a0\u00a0I want you to work with me.\"\n\n\n\nSorts whirled upon the agent with a furious grunt, shoving the larger man square in the chest with all his might. \"//That goddamn toaster// should just stay locked up!\u00a0\u00a0I'm clearly not immune to the influence of //that goddamn toaster.//\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to have anything to do with ... with that goddamn...\"\n\n\n\nSchaffer stumbled backwards for a moment but regained control of the situation as his training took over.\u00a0\u00a0He redirected the smaller man's momentum and whirled the doctor face first into one of the closet's bare walls with a metallic clack. \"That's quite enough, Doctor Sorts.\u00a0\u00a0You don't really have a choice in the matter.\" The agent leaned in and growled with a sharp twist of the doctor's arm, \"Do you really want to do this?\"\n\n\n\nSorts rolled his eyes back up at Schaffer over his shoulder. \"Alright, alright.\" His words were slurred by the way his lips were rammed against the dirty wall. \"I'm sorry.\u00a0\u00a0I get the picture.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to let you go now and you're going to deal with me like a rational adult.\"\u00a0\u00a0Schaffer released the doctor and took a step back, running his hands down the front of his black uniform.\u00a0\u00a0Something tickled the back of his mind, perhaps it was the way Sorts' eyes cleared of panic too quickly, or perhaps it was the absence of a familiar weight at his hip.\n\n\n\nSorts whirled around, revealing the pistol he had yanked out of the agent's belt on his short trip to kiss the wall.\u00a0\u00a0Schaffer stepped forward and put out his hands but the doctor slid away, keeping himself out of reach.\u00a0\u00a0Sorts held the pistol low, aiming at the agent's unprotected groin and legs.\n\n\n\n\"Doctor Sorts, that is my sidearm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Listen to you!\u00a0\u00a0It can't have a sidearm.\u00a0\u00a0//It's a goddamn toaster!//\" Beads of sweat were thick on the doctor's brow. \"You're talking crazy because you can't tell the difference between you and a stupid inanimate object.\u00a0\u00a0//That goddamn toaster// needs to stay in here and it would be better if everyone forgot about it.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you do not stand down and return my sidearm immediately-\"\n\n\n\nThe toaster hit the ground after two shots, and the doctor kicked it into the corner of the closet for good measure.\u00a0\u00a0After using Schaffer's key card to lock the door to the goddamn toaster's containment chamber behind him, Sorts dropped the pistol into the pocket of his coat and wiped his brow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTaking a deep breath, he strode out of the empty storehouse, past the ever-present security cameras, and returned to his office to file a report on the incident.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "absurdism", "doctor-sorts", "featured", "science-fiction", "surrealism", "tale"], "title": "That Goddamn Thing -

There was a single car waiting for him. A large red button on the control panel read, \"Press this.\"</p>\n<p>He did so, and the sleek silver conveyance whispered up the side of the mountain. The view out of the diamond-glass windows was spectacular: the vermillion hues of the setting sun reflecting off the hair-thin lines of the orbital elevator leading to Sunlight One, the world's first permanent launching station to the deep space colonies. A zeppelin ghosted past the mountainside, one of the new superheavy models that could convey two thousand passengers across the Atlantic in comfort. It was the dawn of a new age.</p>\n<p>But it was the past that he had come here to meet, not the future.</p>\n<p>He disembarked the monorail, then followed the instructions from the e-mail up the craggy mountain path, to where a waterfall cascaded down into a clear alpine pool. There was an old man standing on a ledge overlooking the falls, looking down at a brass plate, now encased in diamond-glass to protect it from the elements. His hair was white, and his back hunched with age, but the eyes that turned to regard Jack were still as stark and intelligent as the day they had first met.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Alto,\" Jack said.</p>\n<p>\"Alto\u2026 Alto Clef. Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time,\" Clef scoffed. He laughed, a long, hard laugh, and then he coughed hard into a handkerchief, hacking and wheezing. The white cloth came away speckled with blood. \"New body? Looks good on you.\"</p>\n<p>Jack Bright nodded in reply, then came to stand next to his old friend. He looked down at the plaque. \"At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891,\" he read.</p>\n<p>\"Funny, huh? The man didn't even exist, and here they've put a memorial to him. Reichenbach Falls, the setting of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's last great swan song. The final tale of Sherlock Holmes\u2026 until his fans and editors made him write more stories, the whining fucks.\" He pointed down at the churning white water, far below. \"Imagine, Holmes and Moriarty, the master detective and the Napoleon of crime, struggling to the last breath, clawing and pummeling each other as they plummet to their dooms. Such a fitting end for two great men.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that supposed to mean something?\" Bright asked. He put his hand in his coat pocket, felt the small-caliber handgun he'd secreted there. The note had said to come unarmed, but he hadn't survived this long by being stupid.</p>\n<p>Clef reached into his coat pocket. He pulled out a grubby piece of pink paper and handed it to Jack. The younger man read it carefully, then nodded. \"How long do you have?\"</p>\n<p>\"Two months at most,\" Clef said.</p>\n<p>\"We still have several doses of Five Hundred left,\" Jack said. \"I could authorize to have one lost and recovered by the GOC. As a favor to an old friend.\"</p>\n<p>\"I think not,\" Clef replied sternly. \"There comes a time when a man realizes it's time to die. For me\u2026 that realization came last week. That was when I got a report that young Kroger took down a Tier 4 Type Green on his lonesome. Took it down in a way I never would have thought of: smart as hell. That kid wasn't even born yet when I started this job. And then it hit me: I've done all I can. All I can do from now on is take up space and get in the way of the younger kids who will carry the work forward.\" He smiled. \"So. Time to die.\"</p>\n<p>\"I sense\u2026 a personal indictment\u2026 in those words,\" Bright replied slowly.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Clef said.</p>\n<p>\"You think that I, being immortal, will hold the Foundation back, and stop it from moving forward.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am afraid,\" Clef said, \"of what it will imply when the most powerful and influential member of the Foundation is an SCP himself. I worry that\u2026 not now\u2026 not a hundred years from now\u2026 but someday, you will have lived so long and become so strange that you are no longer human. And by then, you may be too powerful to stop. So that threat must be nipped in the bud now.\"</p>\n<p>\"What if I never become a threat?\"</p>\n<p>\"You will,\" Clef said firmly. \"No one who lives as long as you will can stay human.\"</p>\n<p>\"And so you've come to try to kill me,\" Jack Bright concluded.</p>\n<p>\"I've come here to kill you,\" Clef corrected. \"Not to try.\"</p>\n<p>\"And how did you plan to do that? They've been trying to kill me for over a hundred years. I don't think even you've found a way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't. Kroger did,\" Clef smiled. \"Like I said. The young man's smart as hell.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see\u2026 and your plan?\"</p>\n<p>Clef told him. He explained, step by step, Kroger's plan for killing Jack Bright. He left out no details. He told him exactly how and why it would work, why the plan was foolproof, and in the end, Bright had to admit that Clef was right. This plan would work. It would kill him.</p>\n<p>\"It's a good plan,\" he said. \"But there's one problem with it.\"</p>\n<p>\"And what's tha\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Before Clef could finish his sentence, Jack drew his gun and shot him, twice in the chest, once in the head. A perfect Mozambique.</p>\n<p>The old man slumped and plummeted off the ledge into the water. Jack put his gun back in his coat. \"Bye, Alto,\" he said. He turned and walked back to the monorail, wiping his face. It was certainly spray from the waterfall, but although Reichenbach Falls was freshwater, it still tasted a bit like seaspray.</p>\n<p>He was on his way down the monorail when the implications of Clef's words hit him.</p>\n<p><em>\"I didn't. Kroger did.\"</em></p>\n<p>Someone else knew how to kill Jack Bright.</p>\n<p>The realization chilled his borrowed heart. He gripped the armrest on the monorail seat hard, in a white knuckle grip.</p>\n<p>No\u2026 not just someone else. If he knew Clef, possibly the entire GOC knew how to kill Jack Bright. An entire worldwide organization with the backing of the goddamn United Nations, thousands of highly trained agents dedicated to finding and killing him\u2026</p>\n<p>Suddenly he was very aware of just how vulnerable he was in this monorail car. This small, enclosed space, bound to the monorail tracks\u2026 a perfect killing ground.</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes and waited for the killing blow.</p>\n<p>It never came.</p>\n<p>Instead, the monorail made its way down to the bottom of the mountain, and the doors opened. His driver was waiting there for him, with his armored limousine. \"Director Bright?\" Lyn put his hand on Jack's shoulder, concerned at the Director's pale face and trembling hands. \"Are you all right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Jack said.

There was a single car waiting for him. A large red button on the control panel read, \"Press this.\"\n\n\n\nHe did so, and the sleek silver conveyance whispered up the side of the mountain. The view out of the diamond-glass windows was spectacular: the vermillion hues of the setting sun reflecting off the hair-thin lines of the orbital elevator leading to Sunlight One, the world's first permanent launching station to the deep space colonies. A zeppelin ghosted past the mountainside, one of the new superheavy models that could convey two thousand passengers across the Atlantic in comfort. It was the dawn of a new age.\n\n\n\nBut it was the past that he had come here to meet, not the future.\n\n\n\nHe disembarked the monorail, then followed the instructions from the e-mail up the craggy mountain path, to where a waterfall cascaded down into a clear alpine pool. There was an old man standing on a ledge overlooking the falls, looking down at a brass plate, now encased in diamond-glass to protect it from the elements. His hair was white, and his back hunched with age, but the eyes that turned to regard Jack were still as stark and intelligent as the day they had first met.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Alto,\" Jack said.\n\n\n\n\"Alto. . . Alto Clef. Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time,\" Clef scoffed. He laughed, a long, hard laugh, and then he coughed hard into a handkerchief, hacking and wheezing. The white cloth came away speckled with blood. \"New body? Looks good on you.\"\n\n\n\nJack Bright nodded in reply, then came to stand next to his old friend. He looked down at the plaque. \"At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891,\" he read.\n\n\n\n\"Funny, huh? The man didn't even exist, and here they've put a memorial to him. Reichenbach Falls, the setting of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's last great swan song. The final tale of Sherlock Holmes. . . until his fans and editors made him write more stories, the whining fucks.\" He pointed down at the churning white water, far below. \"Imagine, Holmes and Moriarty, the master detective and the Napoleon of crime, struggling to the last breath, clawing and pummeling each other as they plummet to their dooms. Such a fitting end for two great men.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that supposed to mean something?\" Bright asked. He put his hand in his coat pocket, felt the small-caliber handgun he'd secreted there. The note had said to come unarmed, but he hadn't survived this long by being stupid.\n\n\n\nClef reached into his coat pocket. He pulled out a grubby piece of pink paper and handed it to Jack. The younger man read it carefully, then nodded. \"How long do you have?\"\n\n\n\n\"Two months at most,\" Clef said.\n\n\n\n\"We still have several doses of Five Hundred left,\" Jack said. \"I could authorize to have one lost and recovered by the GOC. As a favor to an old friend.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think not,\" Clef replied sternly. \"There comes a time when a man realizes it's time to die. For me. . . that realization came last week. That was when I got a report that young Kroger took down a Tier 4 Type Green on his lonesome. Took it down in a way I never would have thought of: smart as hell. That kid wasn't even born yet when I started this job. And then it hit me: I've done all I can. All I can do from now on is take up space and get in the way of the younger kids who will carry the work forward.\" He smiled. \"So. Time to die.\"\n\n\n\n\"I sense. . . a personal indictment. . . in those words,\" Bright replied slowly.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Clef said.\n\n\n\n\"You think that I, being immortal, will hold the Foundation back, and stop it from moving forward.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am afraid,\" Clef said, \"of what it will imply when the most powerful and influential member of the Foundation is an SCP himself. I worry that. . . not now. . . not a hundred years from now. . . but someday, you will have lived so long and become so strange that you are no longer human. And by then, you may be too powerful to stop. So that threat must be nipped in the bud now.\"\n\n\n\n\"What if I never become a threat?\"\n\n\n\n\"You will,\" Clef said firmly. \"No one who lives as long as you will can stay human.\"\n\n\n\n\"And so you've come to try to kill me,\" Jack Bright concluded.\n\n\n\n\"I've come here to kill you,\" Clef corrected. \"Not to try.\"\n\n\n\n\"And how did you plan to do that? They've been trying to kill me for over a hundred years. I don't think even you've found a way.\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't. Kroger did,\" Clef smiled. \"Like I said. The young man's smart as hell.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. . . and your plan?\"\n\n\n\nClef told him. He explained, step by step, Kroger's plan for killing Jack Bright. He left out no details. He told him exactly how and why it would work, why the plan was foolproof, and in the end, Bright had to admit that Clef was right. This plan would work. It would kill him.\n\n\n\n\"It's a good plan,\" he said. \"But there's one problem with it.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what's tha--\"\n\n\n\nBefore Clef could finish his sentence, Jack drew his gun and shot him, twice in the chest, once in the head. A perfect Mozambique. \n\n\n\nThe old man slumped and plummeted off the ledge into the water. Jack put his gun back in his coat. \"Bye, Alto,\" he said. He turned and walked back to the monorail, wiping his face. It was certainly spray from the waterfall, but although Reichenbach Falls was freshwater, it still tasted a bit like seaspray.\n\n\n\nHe was on his way down the monorail when the implications of Clef's words hit him.\n\n\n\n//\"I didn't. Kroger did.\"//\n\n\n\nSomeone else knew how to kill Jack Bright.\n\n\n\nThe realization chilled his borrowed heart. He gripped the armrest on the monorail seat hard, in a white knuckle grip.\n\n\n\nNo. . . not just someone else. If he knew Clef, possibly the entire GOC knew how to kill Jack Bright. An entire worldwide organization with the backing of the goddamn United Nations, thousands of highly trained agents dedicated to finding and killing him. . . \n\n\n\nSuddenly he was very aware of just how vulnerable he was in this monorail car. This small, enclosed space, bound to the monorail tracks. . . a perfect killing ground. \n\n\n\nHe closed his eyes and waited for the killing blow.\n\n\n\nIt never came. \n\n\n\nInstead, the monorail made its way down to the bottom of the mountain, and the doors opened. His driver was waiting there for him, with his armored limousine. \"Director Bright?\" Lyn put his hand on Jack's shoulder, concerned at the Director's pale face and trembling hands. \"Are you all right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Jack said. He looked up at the mountainside, at the distant cascade of falling water. \"Perfectly fine.\" As the driver pulled away, something else occurred to Jack Bright, something that made him laugh out loud at the bitter irony of it all.\n\n\n\nJack Bright also knew how to kill SCP-963.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n//Somewhere else. . .//\n\n\n\n\"Mister Kroger?\" the man in the black uniform asked. \n\n\n\n\"Speaking,\" Kroger said.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" the man in the black uniform said. He handed Kroger a card. It was pure white, except for a single, swirling symbol on the front in stark black ink. Kroger understood.\n\n\n\n\"Mister Treble Clef?\" the man in the black uniform asked.\n\n\n\n\"Speaking,\" Clef replied.\n\n\n\n\"Better.\" The man in the black uniform nodded. \"I have a request. . .\"\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "action", "doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "spy-fiction", "tale"], "title": ". . . the best and the wisest man whom I have ever known. - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-best-and-the-wisest", "year": 2010}, "the-death-of-alto-clef-etc": {"created_at": "2010-04-06T18:18:00", "creator": "DrEverettMann", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-06T18:18:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-06T18:27:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-02T17:13:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "5/5.", "date": "2010-05-06T02:03:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "removed old contest voting thingy.", "date": "2010-08-08T00:16:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

He\u2019d always found Rights very agreeable, if not the brightest bulb on the chandelier. At the very least, he felt sorry enough to sit at her bedside with a small sigh and take his time prepping the weapon. It really was regretful, he sighed, that it would come to this. Of all the people to ever get out of the foundation, Rights seemed like a good candidate to be able to stay out.</p>\n<p>She had chutzpah.</p>\n<p>Hell, anybody who left the Foundation without the Foundation\u2019s express approval or a full memory wipe had chutzpah to spare.</p>\n<p>And very good friends to smuggle herself out.</p>\n<p>He absently hummed to himself as he screwed the suppressor onto the barrel of the gun, checking it over and re-checking it, before glancing back at Rights. She was still asleep, brow furrowed in fitful dreams. He paused, and wondered what life must have been like for her outside of the foundation, raising her little monster.</p>\n<p>The years had taken their toll on both of them, it seemed. In forms of grey hair and deep lines and arthritic hands. He mused over what sort of strange traits the years and years of exposure to SCPs had awakened in her.</p>\n<p>He had to do this quietly.</p>\n<p>After all, even he wasn\u2019t bullheaded enough to consider going up against even a low-level reality bender head-on anymore, if there was a choice. Especially one that knew him. He was getting far too old for that.</p>\n<p>For too old indeed, he thought as he stood, feeling his joints creak a little.</p>\n<p>Old, but still the best.</p>\n<p>He leveled the weapon to her temple, and pulled the trigger with a dulled pop, like a car door slamming. She twitched once, the reflex tossing the blanket off her, and then went still permanently.</p>\n<p>Clef took the time to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And rearrange the blankets back around her.</p>\n<p>After waiting a few seconds and listening to make sure nobody else awoken or was listening in, and then he crept back to the hallway, moving slow and checking the rooms as he passed them. Bathroom. An empty guest room. Work studio. Nursery\u2026</p>\n<p>He slipped into the nursery and glanced over the edge of the crib. The tot was fast asleep, thumb in mouth, holding on tight to a handmade quilt, entirely unaware. Clef sighed. This was too easy, but he\u2019d rather too easy than too hard any day. He reached into the crib with the weapon, and with another dull pop, the porcelain head of the doll burst into fragments.</p>\n<p>And he reeled back.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t the target.</p>\n<p>He reached into the crib, and his fears were confirmed. A doll, just a doll. It may have looked like a toddler in the dim light, but it was just a doll. He pulled the quilt off, and froze. A small black box with a post-it note on it sat there, amidst the broken doll and baby clothes.</p>\n<p>He picked it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef,<br/>\nI knew you\u2019d come for me,<br/>\nI never did get to say goodbye.<br/>\n-Hugs and Kisses<br/>\nThe former Dr. Rights\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a long moment of shocked silence, followed by intense cussing.</p>\n<p>The man sat in his car across the street, window rolled down, and glanced up quietly as he heard Clef\u2019s voice carrying, and rolled up the window. This was going to be loud.</p>\n<p>Clef paused as he heard a noise, just a faint, high-pitched pinging, and glanced down. On the little black box, a red circle lit up. Followed by another. And another.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on-\u201c</p>\n<p>The man smirked slightly as the explosion rocked the car, before frowning when the child sleeping in the backseat stirred and let out a wail. \u201cOh, oh\u2026hey, hey girl.\u201d He murmured as he climbed into the backseat with her, offering a soft smile and taking the little girl\u2019s hand, his middle-eastern skin so much darker than hers, pale as porcelain. Even this young, Bijhan could see the resemblance to her mother. \u201cShh, shh, shh\u2026don\u2019t you worry, Ophie. Lets get you to your new home\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked up at him with such pale, pale eyes with no shine to them at all, glassy and inhuman, and sniffled.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-decoy\">The Decoy</a>\" by agatharights, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

He\u2019d always found Rights very agreeable, if not the brightest bulb on the chandelier. At the very least, he felt sorry enough to sit at her bedside with a small sigh and take his time prepping the weapon. It really was regretful, he sighed, that it would come to this. Of all the people to ever get out of the foundation, Rights seemed like a good candidate to be able to stay out.\n\n\n\nShe had chutzpah.\n\n\n\nHell, anybody who left the Foundation without the Foundation\u2019s express approval or a full memory wipe had chutzpah to spare.\n\n\n\nAnd very good friends to smuggle herself out.\n\n\n\nHe absently hummed to himself as he screwed the suppressor onto the barrel of the gun, checking it over and re-checking it, before glancing back at Rights. She was still asleep, brow furrowed in fitful dreams. He paused, and wondered what life must have been like for her outside of the foundation, raising her little monster.\n\n\n\nThe years had taken their toll on both of them, it seemed. In forms of grey hair and deep lines and arthritic hands. He mused over what sort of strange traits the years and years of exposure to SCPs had awakened in her.\n\n\n\nHe had to do this quietly.\n\n\n\nAfter all, even he wasn\u2019t bullheaded enough to consider going up against even a low-level reality bender head-on anymore, if there was a choice. Especially one that knew him. He was getting far too old for that.\n\n\n\nFor too old indeed, he thought as he stood, feeling his joints creak a little.\n\n\n\nOld, but still the best.\n\n\n\nHe leveled the weapon to her temple, and pulled the trigger with a dulled pop, like a car door slamming. She twitched once, the reflex tossing the blanket off her, and then went still permanently.\n\n\n\nClef took the time to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And rearrange the blankets back around her.\n\n\n\nAfter waiting a few seconds and listening to make sure nobody else awoken or was listening in, and then he crept back to the hallway, moving slow and checking the rooms as he passed them. Bathroom. An empty guest room. Work studio. Nursery\u2026\n\n\n\nHe slipped into the nursery and glanced over the edge of the crib. The tot was fast asleep, thumb in mouth, holding on tight to a handmade quilt, entirely unaware. Clef sighed. This was too easy, but he\u2019d rather too easy than too hard any day. He reached into the crib with the weapon, and with another dull pop, the porcelain head of the doll burst into fragments.\n\n\n\nAnd he reeled back.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the target.\n\n\n\nHe reached into the crib, and his fears were confirmed. A doll, just a doll. It may have looked like a toddler in the dim light, but it was just a doll. He pulled the quilt off, and froze. A small black box with a post-it note on it sat there, amidst the broken doll and baby clothes.\n\n\n\nHe picked it up.\n\n\n\n\u201cClef,\n\nI knew you\u2019d come for me,\n\nI never did get to say goodbye.\n\n-Hugs and Kisses\n\nThe former Dr. Rights\u201d\n\n\n\nThere was a long moment of shocked silence, followed by intense cussing.\n\n\n\nThe man sat in his car across the street, window rolled down, and glanced up quietly as he heard Clef\u2019s voice carrying, and rolled up the window. This was going to be loud.\n\n\n\nClef paused as he heard a noise, just a faint, high-pitched pinging, and glanced down. On the little black box, a red circle lit up. Followed by another. And another.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, come on-\u201c\n\n\n\nThe man smirked slightly as the explosion rocked the car, before frowning when the child sleeping in the backseat stirred and let out a wail. \u201cOh, oh\u2026hey, hey girl.\u201d He murmured as he climbed into the backseat with her, offering a soft smile and taking the little girl\u2019s hand, his middle-eastern skin so much darker than hers, pale as porcelain. Even this young, Bijhan could see the resemblance to her mother. \u201cShh, shh, shh\u2026don\u2019t you worry, Ophie. Lets get you to your new home\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nShe looked up at him with such pale, pale eyes with no shine to them at all, glassy and inhuman, and sniffled.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-rights", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "The Decoy - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-decoy", "year": 2010}, "the-designer": {"created_at": "2010-06-10T03:18:00", "creator": "Arlecchino", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "NEW STORY", "date": "2010-06-10T03:18:00"}, {"author": "Arlecchino", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/arlecchino", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-12T04:26:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Somewhere, in the vast impenetrable body of their World and their God\u2026 metal ground to a halt. It was a horrifying noise that set the entire city on edge. It was not particularly loud, no, nor was it high pitched or rumbling or annoying.</p>\n<p>But it meant bad things to come. Very bad, indeed. Although nobody spoke about it, the beats of the gears and their world were slowing down year after year, after beating steadily for millennia. Everyone was horrified. The smaller mechanics, for which they used to modify themselves over time, were unaffected, but the great gears, including the massive golden mountain on which their city was built, were turning a little slower, and sometimes unevenly.</p>\n<p>The high priestess even halted her studies on ectogenesis in an attempt to consult with the God, although the great God and World never answered. So she organized a group to set out in adventure, to seek out the source of this slowing, this unevenness.</p>\n<p>They chose a group of children, as of yet unchanged by the gears and mechanics that would become part of their bodies come puberty, or when young legs were inevitably crushed between gears in a moment of carelessness. After all, children were small and fast, and expendable, capable of getting into the smallest places.</p>\n<p>There were five of them.</p>\n<p>They set off through the gardens, first, the ever-shifting irrigated gears, each one almost as large as their city alone, where earth- real earth- filtered in from somewhere above, unseen by gears, and where crystalline growths provided brilliant golden light that made the brass, turning walls of the world glow. They collected food to carry with them in their knapsacks of spun, silken silver, and left for places unknown to the city.</p>\n<p>One of them found a way to climb the gears up, seeking out where the earth and water that filtered into the gardens came from, suspecting that perhaps the earth had jammed a gear, or the water had rusted somewhere (although he knew the World and God never rusted). He was a tall child, with dusky hair and pale eyes, who dreamed of one day becoming such as the high priestess, a being of pure metal and energy, instead of his fleshy, tainted birth-body.</p>\n<p>Another set off northwards, where magnetized needles always swung to point, deciding that perhaps somewhere the God and World had become a simpler metal, one that could be swayed by magnetism, and that the source of the northern magnetic field could be obstructing it. She was a smart girl, with dark hair and eyes and a strong ambition to perhaps be a priestess herself someday.</p>\n<p>The third left the group when they encountered a place so dark that no light could be seen, and had become separated from the group- as he was always a little hard of hearing and clumsy, a poor trait amidst the World and God, where the clicking and groaning of a gear was one of the only ways to tell if one was going to trap and pin you. He wandered into the darkness, afraid and disoriented, until he emerged to the west, although he didn\u2019t know that direction.</p>\n<p>The last two decided that it was a poor idea to split up, being siblings, twins, an extreme rarity, and being very much connected on a deep, needy level. They found a tunnel that lead down, down, spiraling down into a staircase of pistons and tubing amidst the churning cogs. And they continued as such, down, down, into darkness and towards a light more pure and white than any they had seen before in the distance.</p>\n<p>Many years passed before they returned.</p>\n<p>And in those years, the high priestess found that their God would no longer convert the children who reached adulthood, to her utter horror. Gears ground to a halt in some places, while others spun wildly or broke lose, now and then. She feared that her five had truly been sent to their deaths, and wept tearlessly for them, her crystalline diopter eyes having no fluid in them.</p>\n<p>Their city was ruined, their population diminished. The gardens swelled with fruit unseen before, and sometimes whole plants or strange dead creatures fell from above with the earth and water. A flood had ravaged the city streets, one year, and another year random storms of static and lightening flashed through a neighborhood, burning flesh and stopping gears where they stood, and causing many of the eternally-glowing crystals to shatter and fall dark.</p>\n<p>And then he came.</p>\n<p>A tall man, with skin tanned darker than any the city had seen, an earthy bonze, his hair golden as the gears and pale eyes harsh and squinting to see in the dim light of the city. His flesh was windburned and lined with hard work and scars, and he carried with him heavy boots laden with dirt and a staff of wood- and a device made of a dark blackened metal, which he used to dispatch a priest who had gone mad and attempted to attack him, bursting his copper-plated skull and scattering wired brains everywhere.</p>\n<p>He spoke of another World above, one that was not the God and World, where earth covered everything and plant life grew abundant, and people who never changed into machinations lived and worked, and had believed the world below them populated by monsters and demons that had been locked away to squander out of the view of the sun, a massive light so brilliant it illuminated the entirety of the World. A World that was much bigger than the God and World, that lead all the way to a place, land where the God and World was nowhere below, and nowhere near.</p>\n<p>The high priestess claimed blasphemy and had him chased from the city, but in her ticking heart, winding down, she knew and feared he spoke the truth.</p>\n<p>Shortly after he left, the woman arrived, her dark hair elaborately braided, her dark eyes smart and sharp with intense knowledge.

She spoke little, and wore only scraps of clothing underneath crude scrapped armor made out of curious shells and a heavy cloak, constantly complaining of the cold. In all, she was quite benign compared to the others, peacefully accepting food and watching the priestess distrustfully. One could have even thought she was entirely unmodified until, in a moment of carelessness, another set of arms reached out from under the cloak to adjust her armor.</p>\n<p>It was not until pressured that she spoke of a world below, where she, and she truly, had found the source of the God and World\u2019s ails. Water poured in on all sides of this world, salty and rich, bringing creatures and refuse plants with it. Above, a layer of crystals so pure and white and brilliant it was impossible to see the God and World, and in the swampy, still waters down below, pillars supported the God\u2019s weight and rocky spires and masses of soggy land that collected around either of these formed small islands.</p>\n<p>And it was there that the natives of this land, curious and intelligent, but still shy, and very very strange if medically skilled, had led her to the source of the god\u2019s problems.

The woman responded with a confused stare, before removing her cloak, revealing the extra set of arms was not where her strangeness ended, as another set of eyes rested above her ears, and her skull arced back in such a way that there would have been two minds crammed into it. Her back was hunched, slightly, but she smiled, and explained that they were both here. There was nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>And the high priestess finally relented, and simply howled her frustrations. The woman left before the priestess could collect herself enough to reach a decision, and the mechanical woman, the leader of her people\u2026retired to her private labs and collapsed.

Somewhere, in the vast impenetrable body of their World and their God\u2026 metal ground to a halt. It was a horrifying noise that set the entire city on edge. It was not particularly loud, no, nor was it high pitched or rumbling or annoying.\n\n\n\nBut it meant bad things to come. Very bad, indeed. Although nobody spoke about it, the beats of the gears and their world were slowing down year after year, after beating steadily for millennia. Everyone was horrified. The smaller mechanics, for which they used to modify themselves over time, were unaffected, but the great gears, including the massive golden mountain on which their city was built, were turning a little slower, and sometimes unevenly.\n\n\n\nThe high priestess even halted her studies on ectogenesis in an attempt to consult with the God, although the great God and World never answered. So she organized a group to set out in adventure, to seek out the source of this slowing, this unevenness. \n\n\n\nThey chose a group of children, as of yet unchanged by the gears and mechanics that would become part of their bodies come puberty, or when young legs were inevitably crushed between gears in a moment of carelessness. After all, children were small and fast, and expendable, capable of getting into the smallest places.\n\n\n\nThere were five of them.\n\n\n\nThey set off through the gardens, first, the ever-shifting irrigated gears, each one almost as large as their city alone, where earth- real earth- filtered in from somewhere above, unseen by gears, and where crystalline growths provided brilliant golden light that made the brass, turning walls of the world glow. They collected food to carry with them in their knapsacks of spun, silken silver, and left for places unknown to the city.\n\n\n\nOne of them found a way to climb the gears up, seeking out where the earth and water that filtered into the gardens came from, suspecting that perhaps the earth had jammed a gear, or the water had rusted somewhere (although he knew the World and God never rusted). He was a tall child, with dusky hair and pale eyes, who dreamed of one day becoming such as the high priestess, a being of pure metal and energy, instead of his fleshy, tainted birth-body.\n\n\n\nAnother set off northwards, where magnetized needles always swung to point, deciding that perhaps somewhere the God and World had become a simpler metal, one that could be swayed by magnetism, and that the source of the northern magnetic field could be obstructing it. She was a smart girl, with dark hair and eyes and a strong ambition to perhaps be a priestess herself someday.\n\n\n\nThe third left the group when they encountered a place so dark that no light could be seen, and had become separated from the group- as he was always a little hard of hearing and clumsy, a poor trait amidst the World and God, where the clicking and groaning of a gear was one of the only ways to tell if one was going to trap and pin you. He wandered into the darkness, afraid and disoriented, until he emerged to the west, although he didn\u2019t know that direction.\n\n\n\nThe last two decided that it was a poor idea to split up, being siblings, twins, an extreme rarity, and being very much connected on a deep, needy level. They found a tunnel that lead down, down, spiraling down into a staircase of pistons and tubing amidst the churning cogs. And they continued as such, down, down, into darkness and towards a light more pure and white than any they had seen before in the distance.\n\n\n\nMany years passed before they returned.\n\n\n\nAnd in those years, the high priestess found that their God would no longer convert the children who reached adulthood, to her utter horror. Gears ground to a halt in some places, while others spun wildly or broke lose, now and then. She feared that her five had truly been sent to their deaths, and wept tearlessly for them, her crystalline diopter eyes having no fluid in them.\n\n\n\nTheir city was ruined, their population diminished. The gardens swelled with fruit unseen before, and sometimes whole plants or strange dead creatures fell from above with the earth and water. A flood had ravaged the city streets, one year, and another year random storms of static and lightening flashed through a neighborhood, burning flesh and stopping gears where they stood, and causing many of the eternally-glowing crystals to shatter and fall dark.\n\n\n\nAnd then he came.\n\n\n\nA tall man, with skin tanned darker than any the city had seen, an earthy bonze, his hair golden as the gears and pale eyes harsh and squinting to see in the dim light of the city. His flesh was windburned and lined with hard work and scars, and he carried with him heavy boots laden with dirt and a staff of wood- and a device made of a dark blackened metal, which he used to dispatch a priest who had gone mad and attempted to attack him, bursting his copper-plated skull and scattering wired brains everywhere.\n\n\n\nHe spoke of another World above, one that was not the God and World, where earth covered everything and plant life grew abundant, and people who never changed into machinations lived and worked, and had believed the world below them populated by monsters and demons that had been locked away to squander out of the view of the sun, a massive light so brilliant it illuminated the entirety of the World. A World that was much bigger than the God and World, that lead all the way to a place, land where the God and World was nowhere below, and nowhere near.\n\n\n\nThe high priestess claimed blasphemy and had him chased from the city, but in her ticking heart, winding down, she knew and feared he spoke the truth.\n\n\n\nShortly after he left, the woman arrived, her dark hair elaborately braided, her dark eyes smart and sharp with intense knowledge. At first the priestess thought that she had been changed and was to accept her as one of their own, but her shined skin was not metal, but some sort of material that was both hard and flexible and did not break, shattering the points of spears when the guards tried to force her out. Her insides, visible through opalescent and translucent panels here and there, were formed of electricity and wires, such small unmoving mechanics sickening to the priestess.\n\n\n\nShe spoke of another World to the north, where the unmodified and newly modified lived together in synchronicity, where the entire horizon was blanketed with frozen water in many different forms- both white and granular and sheer, where the sky was endless and black and the sun- an eternal light- rose only once per year and set once per year. And of people who knew such horrible things about the God and World.\n\n\n\nThe high priestess screamed blasphemy, and bade her to take her leave. The woman refused, and took up residence in an abandoned home, working with information projected of pure light and silver-and-white technology unseen.\n\n\n\nFrom the west came another. His skin was burned and scarred heavily, his hair fallen out, his teeth rotten, but his body muscular and strong. He carried a knife made out of white bone and a sack of dead creatures he called fish, preserved in glass jars, nothing the city had seen before. He heard nothing, but could still read and speak just fine, although he reacted to any movement near him with an animal shout and a swing of the knife.\n\n\n\nHe gibbered and claimed to have come from a World of water, endless water, where small groups of people and other creatures clung to life on drifting cities and small floating homes. And of creatures, some so massive they could swallow a thousand people whole, and others that were small and so vicious a dozen of them would strip one to the bone in seconds. The water was bottomless, he claimed, and he spoke of seeing the World and God from the outside, and that it was not endless, that it ended where the endless water dropped into falls so high that the people spoke that there was no bottom to it.\n\n\n\nThe high priestess relaxed the city\u2019s vast discomfort by claiming that the boy must have gone crazy in his long years of isolation, and bade that he be rejoined with the God and World, although the metallic woman with dark hair and eyes shielded him with a bubble of pure light and energy before they could herd him into the crushing gears, and they let the two of them be out of fear.\n\n\n\nThen the fourth arrived, quite surprisingly alone and detached.

Mansell looked into the room one last time, his eyes already red from the dust and tears that now streaked his cheeks. The smell of vomit lingered on his clothes with the blood and rot. He felt the clicking and whirring, the turning and buzzing of the device as its cranks and gears began to merge and shift, meshing regretfully. He had, he knew, just completed a monster.\n<p>He walked outdoors, his body feeling oddly out of sorts. He chalked it up to the surroundings. Trying to ignore the persistently echoing click as he walked, he went back outside to rejoin his unit and help bury the dead.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The tests had gone remarkably well.</p>\n<p>Dr. Sankt was pleased. Very, very pleased. Ever since they\u2019d brought him the first specimen, all screaming and grinding, his work had consumed him. The platoon to first discover the ruins had been searching fruitlessly for another of the Fuehrer\u2019s missing artifacts. In spite of the Bloody Spear and the Vestments of the Christ, the tiny madman was dissatisfied and sent squad after squad deep into the deserts of northern Africa, searching. At one time, Sankt had viewed these as futile quests by an arrogant man.</p>\n<p>But that was before. Before the clockwork man, who had once simply been a creature of flawed flesh, was brought to him. He was one of two to return; the other had, regretfully, been damaged beyond repair by the harsh desert sand. But the other\u2026</p>\n<p>Sankt didn't have the kind of clearance necessary to know the circumstances which brought the young man to his current state, only that he had been on one of the Fuehrer's missions. The young man had been given to him when the metal began to push through his body and the gears began to tear through his flesh, twisting and flaying. It was, Sankt thought, almost beautiful to watch.</p>\n<p>Sankt stripped away the remains of its skin with more delicacy than was required, placing each piece in its own sterile container. Long after the screams had turned to bloodless clicking, Sankt labored, until eventually, freed of its prison, the bones of molded copper and the muscles of counterbalances stood on their own.</p>\n<p>It did only the simplest tasks. Sankt knew after only a short time that it would be mostly useless, incapable of anything more complex than the man that it had once been. So he set it to work pacing, carrying a rifle, back and forth in front of his door, letting it pretend it was still a soldier. It made him feel more secure, at least.</p>\n<p>Then, Sankt reexamined the flesh he removed from the gears and realized his mistake.</p>\n<p>The mounds of gristle and skin were metallic, some of them desperately interconnected in a feverish attempt to turn and move. \u201cOf course!\u201d thought Sankt. \u201cHow foolish of me. This must be amended.\u201d</p>\n<p>He contacted his superiors and told them what he needed. Much space would be required, as well as subjects for the testing, and soldiers willing to serve their country. His old friend, Dr. Rascher, had been carrying out his own experiments, and upon hearing what Sankt had discovered, cried out with joy. \u201cFinally!\u201d said Rascher. \u201cWe will have our answer.\u201d It was an answer Sankt was more than willing to provide.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The first were failures. Sankt knew they would be, so he used his least important subjects: the mentally deficient. They were vivisected, studied, and disposed of in the furnaces. Sankt knew their fates would have been much the same no matter the circumstances. It was the fate of those imperfect. It was the destiny of those not members of the master race. And so the cutting, screwing, and disinfecting did not concern him.</p>\n<p>After he felt that he understood enough, he brought in the next batch: the Romani. From one of them, he would remove a clockwork liver. From another, a living one. Laying them next to each other, he studied for hours, listening as their previous owners slowly died\u2014one dripping blood, the other oil. When he finally comprehended their relation, he tried transplanting the organs back and forth from body to body. These experiments often failed, but the occasional success kept his spirits up. He knew that soon, he would be ready.</p>\n<p>It was mid-1944 when he felt confident enough to send for the pianists and violinists. He would, of course, need their hands. So delicate and slender were the gears that his heart nearly broke as he removed them. Then, the artists. Their eyes would be invaluable. The singers he nearly forgot, only remembering them as he carefully screwed in the spinning lips of a poet. There would be no need for a voice, of course, but there was always a need for beauty. After all, Sankt was making a masterpiece; leaving part out would be like cutting the smile from the Mona Lisa\u2014unfathomable.</p>\n<p>But he knew that his delicate pieces were just that: delicate. He stewed over this for some time, thinking his work lost, until it suddenly came to him. Watching his clockwork guard march back and forth in front of his door, the epiphany appeared\u2014the ditch diggers, the miners, the street sweepers. They could also be a part! He almost felt foolish, thinking back how perturbed he\u2019d been when he almost forgot the singers. How could he make a true masterpiece without <em>everything</em>?</p>\n<p>Their arms and legs transferred the power down to the smaller gears, carried items along the internal paths, and made it possible for a single man, a single crank, to operate everything! But powerful, skilled hands meant nothing without a mind to drive them.</p>\n<p>So Sankt sent for the scientists and doctors, teachers and researchers. Their minds were a necessary component and could not be excluded. He struggled with the first subject, not fully seeing how the different parts were truly interconnected, but he persevered. The next was far easier. Eventually, the different parts were laced into the whole, guiding the hands and muscles in perfect, indomitable precision.</p>\n<p>Close to completion, so near his final, beautiful goal, Sankt was finally confident enough to invite the entirety of the German leadership to his laboratory and show them what his labors had wrought.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was a nervous group who crowded through the halls of the dank, almost claustrophobic bunker under Chelmno. Only one of the German high command had shown up, the others being far more concerned with the war knocking at the front door. However, Sankt had the answer to all their problems. With his device, Germany would be fully capable of defending itself into the unforeseeable future.</p>\n<p>While the onlookers watched, he placed a pistol into the intake, turning the dial and moving his hand to the crank. He turned it slowly, listening to the perfect rhythm for the first time. He\u2019d known that it would work, known innately that the device would perform perfectly. Each click was the turn of a ballerina, the pluck of a chord, the swing of a mattock, the hypothesis of a dream. Sankt felt as close to love as he ever had.</p>\n<p>When he stopped, he turned and picked up the gun, rotating it in his hands, examining how its nickel and steel had become gold and copper. He proffered it to one of the senior officers present, who examined it with distaste and laid it aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that all it does?\u201d the man asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied Sankt.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that all it does? Turn steel to bronze?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d replied Sankt, taken aback. \u201cThey do much more, so much more. This is only the first step in a long journey. Now, they can only manage a single kind of transformation, making that which is one thing into another of the same. But soon, very soon, they will be making things better. Improving them in ways we can\u2019t even imagine yet! Rewriting literature, correcting mistakes in complicated equations, making new bombs and new religions with equal skill!\u201d</p>\n<p>The men looked at him, and then to the mass of clockworks behind him. The officer peered at him intensely, painfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen finish it. We need a new god right now.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sankt labored ceaselessly. There were only a few people left to him, now. His research staff were the first he used, then the last of the emaciated, flawed prisoners. Finally, he began taking the more clever soldiers, interweaving them as best he could. He could no longer afford to be picky. Eventually, he turned to his loyal guardian. He took the gun from its hands, carefully guided it over to the table, and thanked it for the loyal service it had provided before unfastening its still beating clockwork heart.</p>\n<p>When the Americans finally came, he knew he was almost done. He could feel them approach through the smoke, the fires burning brightly in the furnaces even though most of the guards had either fled or been used. Even though Germany might fall, her labors could still be appreciated.</p>\n<p>He approached the front guard, smiling and waving his hands. He welcomed them in halting English, asking them for stories of the seemingly distant war. He warned them of the conditions in the camp, tried to explain what the commanders were doing, how they had to contain the infections he had been transferring. They killed him slowly\u2014first cutting off his hands, then his eyes, then his lips.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sgt. Mansell looked at the huge device. He\u2019d seen Big Ben in London before he\u2019d been sent over, and he liked to think its insides were similar. The other soldiers were outside, burying the dead between hoarse, racking vomits. He looked down at the dial in the front, the brass covering around it spelling out rudimentary instructions in English. Laying on the ground, directly below it, was a single cog.</p>\n<p>Mansell looked at the piece, and then at the device, licking his lips. The place was obvious, it seemed, almost glaring in its inconsistency. Picking up the brass fitting, he lowered the final cog into place and saw the machine shudder slightly, almost in ecstasy. It was finally, terribly complete.</p>\n<p>As he slept that night, he dreamed of a young woman, beautiful and bright. Sometime in the early morning, he rose, took out his pistol, and walked mechanically into the woods. The shot echoed through the trees, ringing with blood and iron.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-human-part-of-the-equation\">The Human Part of the Equation</a>\" by TroyL, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Bibs wasn't an entirely spiritual person, but he did believe that there was a finite amout of good luck in the universe, and a string of positive events in a row meant that one's luck was running out. It was the sort of belief that was confirmed no matter what happened: if things kept going well, it was just proof that something bad was soon coming. If something bad did happen, it justified his belief.</p>\n<p>As he followed the blinking lights directing him and other staff members to the emergency, he knew his string of good luck had run out. Since \"running towards a major threat\" was something Bibs did all the time, it gave him the time to mentally tick off all the good events in the past month that (in his own opinion) caused whatever Bad Thing had just happened.</p>\n<p>At the start of the month, he discovered a new way of containing <a href=\"/scp-409\">SCP-409</a>. Bombarding a source of 409 with high-impact sonar waves causes the crystals to dissolve into a non-contagious gel. It made complete sense to <em>him</em>, since 409 was just White Tiberium, but it was a surprise to everyone else. Last Bibs heard about it, the eggheads-with-actual-eggs-in-their-heads were working on figuring out why it worked.</p>\n<p>A week or so later, he had done\u2026 <em>something</em> about <a href=\"/scp-055\">SCP-055</a>. He wasn't sure what he did, or anything, and regularly forgot that he had done anything. All that remained of the event in his memory was the <em>existence</em> of 055 itself. It was a strange feeling, Bibs thought, to have a memory that actively wanted to escape. He could feel the the memory of 055 rattling through his brain, careening off memories and mental fanwanks and creations, trying to find a gap. So far, all it had accomplished was leaving residue of itself on other memories of his.</p>\n<p>A little bit after that, there was that\u2026 <em>thing</em> with Rights. Even in his head, he refused to actually specifically mention it. Every once in a while, when he was all alone, he did a little dance in celebration. It was almost worth the beating Bright gave him when he found out.</p>\n<p>Of course, the pride of the month was a few days ago. Abel knew that Bibs was a jumpy person, and since Abel was a prick, he enjoyed taking advantage of that. Without fail, the outcome was the same: Bibs jumped upward, urine flowed downward, and Abel laughed. But one time, one rare and precious time, only jumping happened. So proud that he hadn't wet himself, Bibs proceeded to dance a finely-tuned jig in front of the Sumerian warrior. Since Abel was a prick, though, he didn't appreciate it.</p>\n<p>At the end of the mental voyage, he jumped through the double-doors to where the emergency was. The scene was chaos, as to be expected. When the blinking lights and klaxons announcing a containment breach were going off, chaos always springs up. Something was very, <em>very</em> wrong, and <em>very</em> unexpected.</p>\n<p>One of the few things that kept Bibs employed by the Foundation was that his sense of fear was off-kilter compared to everyone else's. Things that scared everyone else didn't phase him too much. It wasn't bravado or courage, it was simply that almost <em>everything</em> the Foundation dealt with had some analogue, even distant ones, to some story he read at one time or another. Even if there <em>wasn't</em>, his mind created one. What scared Bibs were the warning signs that something the Foundation was handling reminded him of a Bad Event from something he'd read. The rate of such worries weren't extremely high, but they were high enough that he wasn't fired when performance reviews came up.</p>\n<p>What was in front of Bibs and the rest of the Foundation was a perfect example of this. To everyone else in the room, the frightening aspect was that the SCP attempting to escape confinement was <a href=\"/scp-682\">SCP-682</a>. They were afraid of how it was spewing forth thick gobs of acidic blood from its mouth and eyes, threatening to dissolve the walls of its containment. They were afraid of how any weapons fired at 682 were bouncing off its flesh with a flash of light.</p>\n<p>Bibs, Agent of the Foundation, wasn't phased by that too much. He trusted his fellow co-workers to contain 682 by itself. But what <em>did</em> frighten him was what was around 682's neck. It looked like a rusted iron necklace, digging into 682's flesh. It didn't look right, but it didn't take an idiot to know what it <em>was</em>.</p>\n<p>It did, however, take an idiot (Bibs himself) to fix it. So he ran back to his office, knowing he had the tools to stop the problem.</p>\n<p>There was one more thing he was afraid of. He was afraid of getting blamed for the containment breach.</p>\n<p>It <em>was</em> his fault.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Two Weeks Earlier</strong></p>\n<p>Bibs stood near <a href=\"/scp-914\">SCP-914</a>, holding what he wanted to refine in his hand. He was childishly excited to be given permission to do so. As with most of his suggestions, the O5s were hesitant to allow him to do it. They had every right to be, since it was a vanity experiment, with little actual benefit to the Foundation. Bibs made as such clear during his proposal. But in knowing that, he provided as much information explaining the objects to the higher-ups, so they understood what he wanted to do. These were <em>good</em> ones, not the <em>bad</em> ones, and he was only going to set 914 to Fine. There was very little chance of anything going wrong.</p>\n<p>Eventually, he was given permission. If there was a line between <em>\"Giving Bibs Permission To Do Something Because It Had Value\"</em> and <em>\"Giving Bibs Permission To Do Something To Get Him To Stop Asking For Permission\"</em>, he didn't know about it. Thankfully, such distinctions only <em>occasionally</em> depressed him.</p>\n<p>Bibs, Agent of the Foundation, stared briefly at the 914's knob, set to Fine. The setting Very Fine was tempting, but <em>really</em>, it had taken him too long to get permission for Fine, much less Very Fine. To get permission for Very Fine, he'd have to start the approval process all over again. Even if he wanted to do that (and he wasn't sure he wanted to, really), it'd mean a whole bunch more paperwork and begging. He wondered which one he'd have to do more.</p>\n<p>Well, it didn't hurt to ask, did it? He turned around to ask the guard, required by policy to be with him during the experiment, a question. To his surprise, he wasn't there. <em>Odd</em>, he thought. He turned around and went through the door. He went to the door to 914's containment room to find out why, and the two guards there were gone too. <em>Damned odd.</em></p>\n<p>Bibs wasn't the kind of person who complained when rules weren't followed - after all, he was usually skirting the occasional rule or six - but never the <em>big</em> ones. Containment Procedures were the biggest of the big rules. With 914, one guard was always with the guy doing the test, and two were positioned outside. Three guards, all away at the same time. He groaned. More likely than not, the Observation staff in the booth above 914 had let them take a break. <em>Yeah</em>, Bibs whined to himself. <em>It's not like I'm in need of protection or anything..</em></p>\n<p>Time to call the folks in the booth. He flipped open his communicator. \"Hey, it's Bibs. We got an O5 on-site? Last minute request to alter my experiment a bit. It's against the rules to change an experiment on the fly, and I'd rather not be shot for doing it without permission.\"</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>Groaning, he craned his head to look at the booth. He just barely was able to make out a crudely-written sign saying \"BRB COFFEE\" on it.</p>\n<p>Now, Bibs was annoyed. Sure, his uncanny ability to infiltrate and investigate without being noticed was invaluable in his role as a Foundation Agent. He could get into places, go where he wanted, and nobody bothered him because he always acted like he belonged there. Or lost and confused. Or like he belonged there, but lost and confused.</p>\n<p>But that 'gift' became <em>really</em> annoying when he wasn't in the field, and people forgot that he was around. Like today.</p>\n<p>He looked at the objects he planned to run through 914. Little toys, of no value to most people but himself. Shiny plastic promotional items. He figured 914 would turn them metallic on the Fine setting. Maybe fit a little bit better, since they were designed to be worn by much fatter people.</p>\n<p>He waited a few more minutes for someone to come back. He kicked the wall a few times. He contemplated peeing on the wall, figuring that would get someone's attention. But there was a fine line between \"I Told You Not To Leave Me Alone\" and \"Actually Crazy.\"</p>\n<p>Bibs was annoyed at being ignored. He had an experiment to run. The Observation Staff and the Guards were AWOL. They were the ones breaking all the rules.</p>\n<p>The Very Fine setting was <em>very</em> tempting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Today</strong></p>\n<p>Bibs had already worked out how this all happened by the time he returned to the containment breach.</p>\n<p>His first assumption was worked out, contemplated, and rejected before he even reached his office. Someone <em>else</em> had found out what he did with 914, and replicated his methods. Whoever it was, the ignorant fool decided it would be a <em>great</em> idea to use a different ones than he did. They used one of the <em>bad</em> ones, it got away from them, and it chose the finest bearer it could.</p>\n<p>As he reached his office, he had already judged that assumption as false. Nobody knew he what he had done. Sure enough, it was the guards and the Observation Staff that got reamed out for dereliction of duty. He was Bibs, Agent of the Foundation, so nobody doubted him as he filled out the test results. Two objects, fine setting, Two objects, metallic. No other change, with a <em>\"Aw Shucks, It's A Shame It Didn't Do What I Had Hoped!\"</em> note.</p>\n<p>No, this was <em>his</em> fault, albeit indirectly. He, using 914, had created two of them. Good Ones. But just like the stories they came from, the Good Ones' existence brought forth other ones. Bad Ones. Nature abhors a vacuum, a vacuum created by his own hand.</p>\n<p>Bibs slammed into the door to the containment booth, and 682 was still trying to escape. The Guards, reduced in number but no less determined, had kept the reptile contained. Its cage had seen better days, missing sections but still keeping the beast contained. The walls steamed from the acidic blood 682 continued to burst forth.</p>\n<p>The red-iron necklace was still clamped to its neck. Nobody else would understand what was going on, but to Bibs it was clear as day. The red necklace was demanding control and ownership over 682, and 682 was having <em>none</em> of that. Its physiology was not only rejecting the necklace, but attempting to <em>assimilate</em> it.</p>\n<p>Bibs found a big enough hole to fit his fist through. He slipped one of the rings onto his finger and stuck his hand in. He closed his eyes and concentrated. Whatever 914 had turned them into, they didn't work as they were supposed to. But they worked.</p>\n<p>The weapon Bibs used was <em>supposed</em> to make anything he thought of, but that one of the ways the ring didn't work quite right. It chose whatever images it wanted to, which is why everyone saw a massive green Abel suddenly appear in 682's cage. it was wearing a hardhat, though, and instead of a massive blade, it was wielding a giant wrench. <em>That's odd as all git-out</em>, Bibs said to himself.</p>\n<p>The Green Abel pinned 682 underneath its knees, holding 682's head down with its free hand. With the wrench-hand, it grabbed at the red necklace on 682's neck, twisting and pulling in an attempt to remove it from 682. With thick wet snaps of flesh and sinew, the necklace released its hold on the neck of the beast in fits and starts.</p>\n<p>When it seemed that the necklace would be completely freed from 682's neck, the horrible reptile flesh twitched and shook underneath the giant green Abel. Its flesh became smooth and shiny, with a sickly yellow tint to it. With a Sumerian curse Bibs was unaware of, the green simulacrum of Abel released its grasp on the beast, looking at its steaming hand and wrench. With a thick <em>plop</em>, the necklace reattached itself to 682. It spoke to 682, telling everyone his name and origin in the process. <em>Fascinating</em>, Bibs thought to himself. <em>Profoundly pointless, unless I get that thing off it, but fascinating nonetheless\u2026</em></p>\n<p>682 changing his flesh a different color to thwart the Big Green Abel wasn't surprising, to Bibs, at least. 682 was <em>very</em> good at adapting to things, and the rusted necklace that had been forced onto it. That necklace must have dumped all sorts of knowledge into its brain in the process, and 682 was using it. Sighing at having to use the <em>other</em> illegally-made weapon, he slid it onto his other hand, he shoved it in into the enclosure, and <em>thought</em>.</p>\n<p>With a flash of light, the Big Green Abel became Big Blue-Green Abel. With newfound confidence in itself, the giant again proceeded to pin 682 down. This time, its coloring did the beast no help. The wrench found purchase on the necklace on the reptile's neck, and pulled. It was still a struggle, but not a large one.</p>\n<p>The excursion was getting to Bibs, Ringbearer of the Foundation, and he struggled to maintain composure. He got a second wind when, with a final <em>skkr-ktt</em>, the Giant Cyan Abel succeeded in its task. The simulacrum raised the red-iron necklace over its head, screamed in victory, and crushed the object between its fist.</p>\n<p>The enclosure, or what remained of it, ignited in heat and flame. Some would say it was unholy. Some would say it was simply one facet of a spectrum that a certain Agent of the Foundation accidentally unleashed upon the world. Most, however, simply described it as a <em>big fireball</em>.</p>\n<p>When the flames ended, only one thing remained in the enclosure. An ash pile, in the shape of 682.</p>\n<p>The crowd, who up until now had fought with every fiber of their being, stood silent for only a moment. It was not a moment of silence for a fallen foe, but the quiet sound of a paradigm shifting without a clutch. <em>SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682. SCP-682 was a pile of ash.</em> It was impossible. Improbably. Profoundly unlikely.</p>\n<p>Before long, a cheer ran out. It started with some clapping. Then laughing. Then a full on celebration. People celebrated. Hugged. Kissed. Swarmed around Bibs, who didn't like this. As much as he refused to admit it, he <em>hated</em> attention.</p>\n<p>He felt hands around him, lifting him up. Carrying him. It wasn't for long, though, and before he even had a chance to enjoy the experience, he was dropped on his ass.</p>\n<p>\"Jesus wept! Aren't you supposed to warn a guy when you decide to stop carrying him? I mean\u2026 oh.\" He understood why he was dropped, and why his carriers suddenly regained their emotional composure.</p>\n<p>An older man, in a well-fitting and expensive-looking suit, stood before him. An O5. The crowd, joyous moments before, suddenly looked like children who had been caught playing when they were supposed to be working.</p>\n<p>The older man looked Bibs over. \"Good job, Agent Bibs.\"</p>\n<p>Bibs blushed. he hated compliments. \"It's\u2026 it's not as amazing as it looked, sir, anyone could have-\"</p>\n<p>\"Nonsense, Bibs. If it wasn't for you, there's a good likelihood that we would have had to nuke the entire Site from orbit. You're a debt to the Foundation, sir. And please, Bibs, it's Fred.\" He smiled.</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>\"Your name is\u2026 Fred?\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed. A bit against policy, I suppose, but in this case, I think you've earned it.\" He smiled again.</p>\n<p>He looked over at the smoking, steaming ash pile of 682.</p>\n<p><em>Figures</em>, Bibs sighed. <em>Fuckin' figures\u2026</em></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-improbable-bibs\">The Improbable Bibs</a>\" by MisterBibs, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Thankfully, such distinctions only //occasionally// depressed him.\n\n\n\nBibs, Agent of the Foundation, stared briefly at the 914's knob, set to Fine. The setting Very Fine was tempting, but //really//, it had taken him too long to get permission for Fine, much less Very Fine. To get permission for Very Fine, he'd have to start the approval process all over again. Even if he wanted to do that (and he wasn't sure he wanted to, really), it'd mean a whole bunch more paperwork and begging. He wondered which one he'd have to do more.\n\n\n\nWell, it didn't hurt to ask, did it? He turned around to ask the guard, required by policy to be with him during the experiment, a question. To his surprise, he wasn't there. //Odd//, he thought. He turned around and went through the door. He went to the door to 914's containment room to find out why, and the two guards there were gone too. //Damned odd.//\n\n\n\nBibs wasn't the kind of person who complained when rules weren't followed - after all, he was usually skirting the occasional rule or six - but never the //big// ones. Containment Procedures were the biggest of the big rules. With 914, one guard was always with the guy doing the test, and two were positioned outside. Three guards, all away at the same time. He groaned. More likely than not, the Observation staff in the booth above 914 had let them take a break. //Yeah//, Bibs whined to himself. //It's not like I'm in need of protection or anything..//\n\n\n\nTime to call the folks in the booth. He flipped open his communicator. \"Hey, it's Bibs. We got an O5 on-site? Last minute request to alter my experiment a bit. It's against the rules to change an experiment on the fly, and I'd rather not be shot for doing it without permission.\"\n\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\n\nGroaning, he craned his head to look at the booth. He just barely was able to make\u00a0\u00a0out a crudely-written sign saying \"BRB COFFEE\" on it.\n\n\n\nNow, Bibs was annoyed. Sure, his uncanny ability to infiltrate and investigate without being noticed was invaluable in his role as a Foundation Agent. He could get into places, go where he wanted, and nobody bothered him because he always acted like he belonged there. Or lost and confused. Or like he belonged there, but lost and confused. \n\n\n\nBut that 'gift' became //really// annoying when he wasn't in the field, and people forgot that he was around. Like today.\n\n\n\nHe looked at the objects he planned to run through 914. Little toys, of no value to most people but himself. Shiny plastic promotional items. He figured 914 would turn them metallic on the Fine setting. Maybe fit a little bit better, since they were designed to be worn by much fatter people.\n\n\n\nHe waited a few more minutes for someone to come back. He kicked the wall a few times. He contemplated peeing on the wall, figuring that would get someone's attention. But there was a fine line between \"I Told You Not To Leave Me Alone\" and \"Actually Crazy.\"\n\n\n\nBibs was annoyed at being ignored. He had an experiment to run. The Observation Staff and the Guards were AWOL. They were the ones breaking all the rules. \n\n\n\nThe Very Fine setting was //very// tempting.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Today**\n\n\n\nBibs had already worked out how this all happened by the time he returned to the containment breach.\n\n\n\nHis first assumption was worked out, contemplated, and rejected before he even reached his office. Someone //else// had found out what he did with 914, and replicated his methods. Whoever it was, the ignorant fool decided it would be a //great// idea to use a different ones than he did. They used one of the //bad// ones, it got away from them, and it chose the finest bearer it could.\n\n\n\nAs he reached his office, he had already judged that assumption as false. Nobody knew he what he had done. Sure enough, it was the guards and the Observation Staff that got reamed out for dereliction of duty. He was Bibs, Agent of the Foundation, so nobody doubted him as he filled out the test results. Two objects, fine setting, Two objects, metallic. No other change, with a //\"Aw Shucks, It's A Shame It Didn't Do What I Had Hoped!\"// note.\n\n\n\nNo, this was //his// fault, albeit indirectly. He, using 914, had created two of them. Good Ones. But just like the stories they came from, the Good Ones' existence brought forth other ones. Bad Ones. Nature abhors a vacuum, a vacuum created by his own hand.\n\n\n\nBibs slammed into the door to the containment booth, and 682 was still trying to escape. The Guards, reduced in number but no less determined, had kept the reptile contained. Its cage had seen better days, missing sections but still keeping the beast contained. The walls steamed from the acidic blood 682 continued to burst forth. \n\n\n\nThe red-iron necklace was still clamped to its neck. Nobody else would understand what was going on, but to Bibs it was clear as day. The red necklace was demanding control and ownership over 682, and 682 was having //none// of that. Its physiology was not only rejecting the necklace, but attempting to //assimilate// it. \n\n\n\nBibs found a big enough hole to fit his fist through. He slipped one of the rings onto his finger and stuck his hand in. He closed his eyes and concentrated. Whatever 914 had turned them into, they didn't work as they were supposed to. But they worked.\n\n\n\nThe weapon Bibs used was //supposed// to make anything he thought of, but that one of the ways the ring didn't work quite right. It chose whatever images it wanted to, which is why everyone saw a massive green Abel suddenly appear in 682's cage. it was wearing a hardhat, though, and instead of a massive blade, it was wielding a giant wrench. //That's odd as all git-out//, Bibs said to himself.\n\n\n\nThe Green Abel pinned 682 underneath its knees, holding 682's head down with its free hand. With the wrench-hand, it grabbed at the red necklace on 682's neck, twisting and pulling in an attempt to remove it from 682. With thick wet snaps of flesh and sinew, the necklace released its hold on the neck of the beast in fits and starts.\n\n\n\nWhen it seemed that the necklace would be completely freed from 682's neck, the horrible reptile flesh twitched and shook underneath the giant green Abel. Its flesh became smooth and shiny, with a sickly yellow tint to it. With a Sumerian curse Bibs was unaware of, the green simulacrum of Abel released its grasp on the beast, looking at its steaming hand and wrench. With a thick //plop//, the necklace reattached itself to 682. It spoke to 682, telling everyone his name and origin in the process. //Fascinating//, Bibs thought to himself. //Profoundly pointless, unless I get that thing off it, but fascinating nonetheless...//\n\n\n\n682 changing his flesh a different color to thwart the Big Green Abel wasn't surprising, to Bibs, at least. 682 was //very// good at adapting to things, and the rusted necklace that had been forced onto it. That necklace must have dumped all sorts of knowledge into its brain in the process, and 682 was using it. Sighing at having to use the //other// illegally-made weapon, he slid it onto his other hand, he shoved it in into the enclosure, and //thought//.\n\n\n\nWith a flash of light, the Big Green Abel became Big Blue-Green Abel. With newfound confidence in itself, the giant again proceeded to pin 682 down. This time, its coloring did the beast no help. The wrench found purchase on the necklace on the reptile's neck, and pulled. It was still a struggle, but not a large one. \n\n\n\nThe excursion was getting to Bibs, Ringbearer of the Foundation, and he struggled to maintain composure. He got a second wind when, with a final //skkr-ktt//, the Giant Cyan Abel succeeded in its task. The simulacrum raised the red-iron necklace over its head, screamed in victory, and crushed the object between its fist.\n\n\n\nThe enclosure, or what remained of it, ignited in heat and flame. Some would say it was unholy. Some would say it was simply one facet of a spectrum that a certain Agent of the Foundation accidentally unleashed upon the world. Most, however, simply described it as a //big fireball//.\n\n\n\nWhen the flames ended, only one thing remained in the enclosure. An ash pile, in the shape of 682.\n\n\n\nThe crowd, who up until now had fought with every fiber of their being, stood silent for only a moment. It was not a moment of silence for a fallen foe, but the quiet sound of a paradigm shifting without a clutch. //SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682. SCP-682 was a pile of ash.// It was impossible. Improbably. Profoundly unlikely.\n\n\n\nBefore long, a cheer ran out. It started with some clapping. Then laughing. Then a full on celebration. People celebrated. Hugged. Kissed. Swarmed around Bibs, who didn't like this.\u00a0\u00a0As much as he refused to admit it, he //hated// attention. \n\n\n\nHe felt hands around him, lifting him up. Carrying him. It wasn't for long, though, and before he even had a chance to enjoy the experience, he was dropped on his ass.\n\n\n\n\"Jesus wept! Aren't you supposed to warn a guy when you decide to stop carrying him? I mean... oh.\" He understood why he was dropped, and why his carriers suddenly regained their emotional composure.\n\n\n\nAn older man, in a well-fitting and expensive-looking suit, stood before him. An O5. The crowd, joyous moments before, suddenly looked like children who had been caught playing when they were supposed to be working.\n\n\n\nThe older man looked Bibs over. \"Good job, Agent Bibs.\"\n\n\n\nBibs blushed. he hated compliments. \"It's... it's not as amazing as it looked, sir, anyone could have-\"\n\n\n\n\"Nonsense, Bibs. If it wasn't for you, there's a good likelihood that we would have had to nuke the entire Site from orbit. You're a debt to the Foundation, sir. And please, Bibs, it's Fred.\" He smiled.\n\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\n\"Your name is... Fred?\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed. A bit against policy, I suppose, but in this case, I think you've earned it.\" He smiled again.\n\n\n\nHe looked over at the smoking, steaming ash pile of 682. \n\n\n\n//Figures//, Bibs sighed. //Fuckin' figures...//\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-409", "scp-055", "scp-682", "scp-914", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "able", "action", "fred", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "metafiction", "tale"], "title": "The Improbable Bibs - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-improbable-bibs", "year": 2010}, "the-king-is-dead": {"created_at": "2010-05-13T15:36:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-13T15:36:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2010-05-13T15:46:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "a -> an, in to -> into, added a comma and a to, typoes, 05 -> O5, added a couple periods.", "date": "2010-05-14T00:32:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Let's get to business, I know you are all busy, and I appreciate all of you taking time out\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCut it, Three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Very well. I think we all know the issue at hand. What with the recent\u2026unpleasantness that occurred during our military disentanglement\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, unpleasantness is just the word I would use. You know, because a near-total shutdown of all sites due to a military intervention is\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I continue, Eight? \u2026Thank you. As I was saying, recent events have caused a\u2026relaxing of protocol. Many of our sites have had to act in near-total isolation from any major command structure, and administrative decisions have been falling to staff members who would not be in any sort of command position under normal circumstances. We've managed to set major sections back to normal, and Site Security is now under our sole jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith all due respect, Three, we know this already. Please get to the point, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026One major hub site, our primary staff facility, and two of our major humanoid SCP-class item storage facilities have come under the sole administrative control of one Doctor Kondraki. During his period of command, the total number of security infractions, information leaks, misuse of resources, and containment breach events for his area have exceeded the sum total of all the infractions and security events of the whole Foundation for the past five years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile under normal conditions, this would result in immediate termination, this has proven\u2026difficult to do. Doctor Kondraki appears to command a level of respect and fear that could cause a minor rebellion in his commanded sites in the event of his hostile removal. He also has an uncanny knack for avoiding danger and near-certain death. Even in the event of non-terminal retirement, Marshall, Carter and Dark has made motions that lead us to believe that they would recruit or capture Doctor Kondraki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what you're saying is that we may have a second Insurgency brewing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for fuck's sake, you know that whole thing is a goddamn cover for-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not saying anything of the kind, and I would remind everyone that we are in polite company. What I am saying is that we need to mobilize a deep operative. Someone who can cause Doctor Kondraki's death in a way that will leave no trace of foul play, and be absolutely exempt from suspicion. Someone who can act with total focus on the mission. Someone tried, tested, and sure of success.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing about that is, everyone's deployed currently. Who do we have on-site there who could carry out the order?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know just the person.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cHey Cleffy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Draki, how'd the test go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man, it was great\u2026we had a D-Class turn into vapor!\u201d</p>\n<p>Doctor Clef nodded, the motion always causing a slight, disconcerting blur around the edges of his head. His flickering smile widened as he continued to walk past Doctor Kondraki. \u201cSounds like a blast. I gotta run for the moment, but I'll catch up with you a bit later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Doctor Kondraki laughed, cracking his knuckles, \u201cAhh, no big deal\u2026I'm going for a nap in the office anyway.\u201d He strode away, whistling as a small cluster of butterflies suddenly appeared from a wall and started to follow him.</p>\n<p>Had he turned, he would have seen Doctor Clef staring at his receding form, his face pinched in what could almost be called regret\u2026if not for the smile.</p>\n<p>Kondraki was on top of the goddamn world. He'd managed to shift all his research duties off to Bright and Iceberg, and he even had most of his actual administrative duties farmed out to terrified, hard-working cube slaves. He hadn't even heard from the bigwigs at central command for weeks\u2026it seemed like he'd finally gotten through to them that his methods, however brutal, worked. SCP-408 flitted ahead of him, the small swarm of butterflies flickering colors seemingly at random as he reached his office door.</p>\n<p>He strode in, tossing his beaten-up ball cap onto an awaiting hook, and started over to his desk. He was nearly seated before he noticed Doctor Gears standing near the right side of the desk, folder in hand. He stumbled in mid-step, the SCP-408 swarm flickering around him, ready to decoy at a moment's notice. \u201cJesus, Gears! Fucking say hi or something, I could have shot you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears nodded slightly, holding out the folder. \u201cDuly noted. I will attempt to be more conspicuous about my presence in the future. There has been a development with SCP-408 that you need to be made aware of immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Doctor Kondraki took the folder grudgingly, muttering as he sat and flipped through the folder. He stopped two pages in, and rocked forward in his chair at the half-way point. \u201cThe hell do they mean 'third lifestage'? SCP-408 has NEVER given any indication of that!\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cWhy has this even become an issue? We've known about his instability for ages, but just sat on our hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor Kondraki has a unique bond with SCP-408, one that The Foundation found intriguing. It turns out a mild chemical imbalance has given Doctor Kondraki a pheromone signature that has a mildly hypnotic effect on SCP-408.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHence why they follow him about all the bloody time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly, Six. Initially we were unable to find the precise chemical signature, but we have recently cracked it and found it rather easy to synthesize. We should be able to roll out a prototype treatment spray to some Mobile Task Forces within the year. With this development, Doctor Kondraki's continued existence has been deemed\u2026less than paramount.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still leaves us with the problem of \u201cKing of the Boooterflies\u201d Kondraki. Those things never leave him alone for a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe already have that situation in hand. A report about a 'third life stage' that may be a Keter-level threat will be issued to all sites. Any and all SCP-408 will be collected and contained without exception. Kondraki will comply, or be held before the Review Board. Once SCP-408 has been properly contained, stage two will be engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still question that, by the way. He's bound to catch on, I mean your so-called 'special agent' has been on more or less desk duty for some time now. Plus, Kondraki is bound to suspect something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, our agent has had some down-time, but this is not his first action in this capacity. Plus, despite their initial differences, Kondraki trusts him to a certain extent. He won't let us down.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I can't enter the containment cell? I've ALWAYS had access to SCP-408, you KNOW this report is bullshit!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dmitri smiled uncomfortably, holding up his wrists held together. \u201cI am sorry, Doktor, but I am in the handcuff. Command says 'no entry', I must give no entry. Security Head must set example, am sure you understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki swore and kicked at the containment door, then turned and stood directly before the Russian. \u201cListen, how many times have I gotten you out of jams, huh? Just let me check on them, to make sure everything's ok, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dimitri shook his head, forced smile firmly planted on his face. \u201cI am of the regretting, sir, but orders are orders. Nobody in, nobody out for three week. Order signed by O5 level, is nothing to do for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki roared, grabbing his hat and raging for several seconds, before grabbing the big Russian's shirt. \u201cListen, I'm the goddamn head of-\u201d</p>\n<p>He was abruptly cut off as Dmitri grabbed his arm and twisted him away. He then positioned himself in front of the containment access door, arms behind his back, feet planted at parade rest. His face was a stony mask. \u201cWas speaking as friend, Doktor. Am now speaking as Security Head. Leave area immediately, Doktor Kondraki, or you will be removed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki was still fuming hours later, when there was a sharp knock on his door. Before he could say \u201cfuck off\u201d, Clef slipped in, shutting the door behind him. He looked around the office, whistling. \u201cWow\u2026did you really have to shoot the ceiling that much? I mean, the computer is still semi-recognizable, wouldn't that have been better?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki shook his head, twirling a spent shotgun shell on his finger. \u201cNot now Clef, I'm really not in the mood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef slid into one of the few remaining undamaged chairs, and grinned at the smoldering doctor. \u201cShit happens Kon, you know this. It's probably some screw-up somewhere down the chain, you know how bureaucratic shit gets up at the top. Just\u2026roll with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki rose, starting to walk around the room. \u201cI know what they're up to. They've tried to kill me before a few times, but I always get loose. It's so fucking stupid\u2026they recall all the research work, try and delegate everything out so when I go, I won't leave a hole\u2026but I'm not about to let some dusty stuffed shirts brush me out of the way. I've shown the weapon potential for countless items\u2026plus, I always have an ace over them.\u201d He grinned coldly, looking at nothing. \u201cThey think that cutting me off from SCP-408 is going to leave me defenseless? Bullshit. Bull SHIT! Plus, nobody has the balls to try and go toe-to-toe with me!\" Kondraki continued. \"Hell, I rode fucking 682!\u201d He laughed, looking to Clef.</p>\n<p>The other man nodded, his eyes flickering slightly as he looked away. \u201cYeah\u2026you're really just too nuts to kill\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Both men chuckled for a few moments, before drifting into silence. Kondraki stared at Clef, his smile slowly fading as he warily moved back behind his desk. \u201cSo\u2026tell me, friend\u2026why is it you've been such a desk jockey lately? Seems weird for a\u2026man\u2026of action like you to just take being benched without a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef shrugged, his smile frozen inches from his ears. \u201cOh, you know, just recharging the batteries, molesting demi-humans, the usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>The laughter was forced, the remaining conversation false. When Kondraki pulled his shotgun and put a slug past Clef's ear, it was almost a relief.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cIsn't there a concern about fallout? Kondraki is somewhat well known for his\u2026 tendencies towards collateral damage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's been decided that, in light of the continued threat potential posed, the one-time costs are outweighed by the long-term benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Is the damn site nuke mentioned anywhere in the contingency plans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot in any of the primary ones, no.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>-SECURITY BREACH ON STAFF LEVEL 1-<br/>\n-SHOTS FIRED-<br/>\n-SHOTS FIRED-<br/>\n-STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO STAFF LEVEL ONE: STAFF DOORS 1-3-<br/>\n-SHOTS FIRED-</p>\n<p>\u201cSon of the bitch\u2026what is going\u2026\u201d Dmitri hunched over the site alert console, watching the alerts pop up, several security screens switching to the site of the action. It appeared Clef and Kondraki were locked in a gun battle. Again. Still, this seemed more\u2026vigorous than normal. For one thing, they were using real bullets this time.</p>\n<p>Dmitri flipped the sound toggle on, letting the room fill with the sound of screaming and gunfire.</p>\n<p>\u201c-onna creep up, blind-side me? Oooh, you're slipping\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>&lt;Three loud reports&gt;</p>\n<p>\u201cKon, I swear, I have no idea-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and now I'm going to believe a word that comes out of that polymorphic pie hole?\u201d</p>\n<p>&lt;Single report&gt;</p>\n<p>\u201cKon, calm the shit down!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dmitri sighed, rubbing his temple as he reached for the security intercom. \u201cIs to be much paperworks\u2026\u201d he muttered, picking up the receiver.</p>\n<p>Before he could dial up the security team, however, it rang in his hand. Shocked, he nearly dropped it before hitting the transmit button. He listened in silence for thirty eight seconds. He nodded once, then replaced the receiver. He looked at the screens, the intercom, and swallowed hard.</p>\n<p>He then switched everything off, and went to get a coffee. It was the first coffee break he'd taken in nine months.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cToo much seems left to chance. What if he somehow avoids the operative? Kondraki has shown some combat prowess, this could backfire rather quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you'll go to page eighteen of the third section, you'll see the actions detailed much more clearly. The main combat event is to assess the level of decay Kondraki's combat capabilities have undergone during his prolonged SCP-408 use.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026fair enough, but won't he be more on alert?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. On the wrong subject.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Kondraki raced down the hall, keeping to the side. His bleeding arm throbbed, but he kept running, the gradual slant keeping him at a good pace. He couldn't hear Clef any more, but he knew he was there, somewhere, waiting for an ambush. He smiled with bloody teeth as he rounded the corner. He knew where he'd be safe, be able to regroup. The one place nobody would dare fire a shot, never risk the full wrath of The Foundation for any collateral damage.</p>\n<p>Lurching forward, he pitched himself against the solid steel door. Panting, he fumbled for the knob, smearing blood over the brass plate reading \u201cDr. Gears\u201d.</p>\n<p>Gears looked up quickly from his screen as Kondraki stumbled in, blood splattering as he slammed the door shut. \u201cDoctor Kondraki. You appear distressed. And injured.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bleeding man laughed, then panted, leaning on the door. \u201cOoooh fuck\u2026.Gears, you have\u2026no idea\u2026how happy I\u2026am to\u2026hear you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears rose and crossed quickly to the door, easing Kondraki across the office. \u201cSit down. You need immediate medical attention. Is there a breach event in progress? I will contact site security.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki tensed as Gears spoke, then grabbed the older man's lab coat. \u201cNo\u2026no security\u2026just\u2026let me sit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki flopped into the office chair, sighing and wincing as he rubbed his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2026they tried to send Clef after me\u2026can you believe that? I knew they'd try it eventually. God DAMN but that hurts\u2026Got any pain killers, Gears?\u201d</p>\n<p>The older man shook his head slowly, watching Kondraki. \u201cI am sorry, but I keep no medical supplies on hand in my office. Any chemicals required for testing are kept-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know\u2026Jesus\u2026\u201d Kondraki waved Gears away, panting and closing his eyes as he rubbed his face. \u201cJust\u2026need a second to regroup. Then I'm going up to master control\u2026pop some doors\u2026\u201d Kondraki sighed, getting his wind back.</p>\n<p>He didn't hear the click of the trigger until the bullet was already in his temple.</p>\n<p>The .45 caliber slug tore through the thin tissue of his scalp and snipped a neat hole through the skull bone just as Kondraki thought \u201cwhat\u2026\u201d. As it shredded through his collected memories, dreams, and plans, he was simultaneously aware of the location of a book he'd misplaced weeks ago, and the vague smell of wood shavings. Then all of it, wood, book, and mind exited through a much less neat and much more explosive hole in the left side of the now former doctor's skull. He twitched once, then fell forward, hitting the desk hard enough to bruise, if he had been still capable of it.</p>\n<p>Gears shifted, replacing the gun in his coat pocket. He looked down, stone-faced, as the man emptied his life's blood and work onto his desk. He raised his hand, slowly, and placed it on the dead man's shoulder. He blinked once, slowly, eyes closed for several seconds, before opening them again. He then set about cleaning the gun, and re-positioning Kondraki's hands.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI still question the operative choice. His last combat action was\u2026four years ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCombat, yes. Rogue subject control is not considered a combat action.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026when\u2026when was he last active for that, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm afraid that's still sealed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026alright. Let's go with it. What are we going to do for a cover?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn this case, the old ways are the best ways.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>-Notice of Staff Death-</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Name: Dr. Kondraki</p>\n<p>Cause: Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound</p>\n<p>Information:<br/>\nSubject has been known to exhibit extreme bipolar and paranoid disorders consistent with extreme chemical imbalance.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\u201c...Please be seated.\u00a0\u00a0Let's get to business, I know you are all busy, and I appreciate all of you taking time out...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCut it, Three.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...Very well.\u00a0\u00a0I think we all know the issue at hand.\u00a0\u00a0What with the recent...unpleasantness that occurred during our military disentanglement...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes, unpleasantness is just the word I would use.\u00a0\u00a0You know, because a near-total shutdown of all sites due to a military intervention is...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMay I continue, Eight?\u00a0\u00a0...Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0As I was saying, recent events have caused a...relaxing of protocol.\u00a0\u00a0Many of our sites have had to act in near-total isolation from any major command structure, and administrative decisions have been falling to staff members who would not be in any sort of command position under normal circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0We've managed to set major sections back to normal, and Site Security is now under our sole jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, Three, we know this already.\u00a0\u00a0Please get to the point, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...One major hub site, our primary staff facility, and two of our major humanoid SCP-class item storage facilities have come under the sole administrative control of one Doctor Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0During his period of command, the total number of security infractions, information leaks, misuse of resources, and containment breach events for his area have exceeded the sum total of all the infractions and security events of the whole Foundation for the past five years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile under normal conditions, this would result in immediate termination, this has proven...difficult to do.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Kondraki appears to command a level of respect and fear that could cause a minor rebellion in his commanded sites in the event of his hostile removal.\u00a0\u00a0He also has an uncanny knack for avoiding danger and near-certain death.\u00a0\u00a0Even in the event of non-terminal retirement, Marshall, Carter and Dark has made motions that lead us to believe that they would recruit or capture Doctor Kondraki.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, what you're saying is that we may have a second Insurgency brewing?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh for fuck's sake, you know that whole thing is a goddamn cover for-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am not saying anything of the kind, and I would remind everyone that we are in polite company.\u00a0\u00a0What I am saying is that we need to mobilize a deep operative.\u00a0\u00a0Someone who can cause Doctor Kondraki's death in a way that will leave no trace of foul play, and be absolutely exempt from suspicion.\u00a0\u00a0Someone who can act with total focus on the mission.\u00a0\u00a0Someone tried, tested, and sure of success.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing about that is, everyone's deployed currently.\u00a0\u00a0Who do we have on-site there who could carry out the order?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know just the person.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cHey Cleffy!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHey Draki, how'd the test go?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh man, it was great...we had a D-Class turn into vapor!\u201d\n\n\n\nDoctor Clef nodded, the motion always causing a slight, disconcerting blur around the edges of his head.\u00a0\u00a0His flickering smile widened as he continued to walk past Doctor Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSounds like a blast.\u00a0\u00a0I gotta run for the moment, but I'll catch up with you a bit later.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoctor Kondraki laughed, cracking his knuckles, \u201cAhh, no big deal...I'm going for a nap in the office anyway.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He strode away, whistling as a small cluster of butterflies suddenly appeared from a wall and started to follow him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHad he turned, he would have seen Doctor Clef staring at his receding form, his face pinched in what could almost be called regret...if not for the smile.\n\n\n\nKondraki was on top of the goddamn world.\u00a0\u00a0He'd managed to shift all his research duties off to Bright and Iceberg, and he even had most of his actual administrative duties farmed out to terrified, hard-working cube slaves.\u00a0\u00a0He hadn't even heard from the bigwigs at central command for weeks...it seemed like he'd finally gotten through to them that his methods, however brutal, worked.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-408 flitted ahead of him, the small swarm of butterflies flickering colors seemingly at random as he reached his office door.\n\n\n\nHe strode in, tossing his beaten-up ball cap onto an awaiting hook, and started over to his desk.\u00a0\u00a0He was nearly seated before he noticed Doctor Gears standing near the right side of the desk, folder in hand.\u00a0\u00a0He stumbled in mid-step, the SCP-408 swarm flickering around him, ready to decoy at a moment's notice.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJesus, Gears! Fucking say hi or something, I could have shot you!\u201d\n\n\n\nGears nodded slightly, holding out the folder.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDuly noted.\u00a0\u00a0I will attempt to be more conspicuous about my presence in the future.\u00a0\u00a0There has been a development with SCP-408 that you need to be made aware of immediately.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoctor Kondraki took the folder grudgingly, muttering as he sat and flipped through the folder.\u00a0\u00a0He stopped two pages in, and rocked forward in his chair at the half-way point.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe hell do they mean 'third lifestage'?\u00a0\u00a0SCP-408 has NEVER given any indication of that!\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy has this even become an issue?\u00a0\u00a0We've known about his instability for ages, but just sat on our hands.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDoctor Kondraki has a unique bond with SCP-408, one that The Foundation found intriguing.\u00a0\u00a0It turns out a mild chemical imbalance has given Doctor Kondraki a pheromone signature that has a mildly hypnotic effect on SCP-408.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHence why they follow him about all the bloody time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cExactly, Six.\u00a0\u00a0Initially we were unable to find the precise chemical signature, but we have recently cracked it and found it rather easy to synthesize.\u00a0\u00a0We should be able to roll out a prototype treatment spray to some Mobile Task Forces within the year.\u00a0\u00a0With this development, Doctor Kondraki's continued existence has been deemed...less than paramount.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat still leaves us with the problem of \u201cKing of the Boooterflies\u201d Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0Those things never leave him alone for a second.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe already have that situation in hand.\u00a0\u00a0A report about a 'third life stage' that may be a Keter-level threat will be issued to all sites.\u00a0\u00a0Any and all SCP-408 will be collected and contained without exception.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki will comply, or be held before the Review Board.\u00a0\u00a0Once SCP-408 has been properly contained, stage two will be engaged.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI still question that, by the way.\u00a0\u00a0He's bound to catch on, I mean your so-called 'special agent' has been on more or less desk duty for some time now.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, Kondraki is bound to suspect something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, our agent has had some down-time, but this is not his first action in this capacity.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, despite their initial differences, Kondraki trusts him to a certain extent.\u00a0\u00a0He won't let us down.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, I can't enter the containment cell?\u00a0\u00a0I've ALWAYS had access to SCP-408, you KNOW this report is bullshit!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDmitri smiled uncomfortably, holding up his wrists held together.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am sorry, Doktor, but I am in the handcuff.\u00a0\u00a0Command says 'no entry', I must give no entry.\u00a0\u00a0Security Head must set example, am sure you understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nKondraki swore and kicked at the containment door, then turned and stood directly before the Russian.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, how many times have I gotten you out of jams, huh?\u00a0\u00a0Just let me check on them, to make sure everything's ok, yeah?\u201d\n\n\n\nDimitri shook his head, forced smile firmly planted on his face.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am of the regretting, sir, but orders are orders.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody in, nobody out for three week.\u00a0\u00a0Order signed by O5 level, is nothing to do for it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nKondraki roared, grabbing his hat and raging for several seconds, before grabbing the big Russian's shirt.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, I'm the goddamn head of-\u201d \n\n\n\nHe was abruptly cut off as Dmitri grabbed his arm and twisted him away.\u00a0\u00a0He then positioned himself in front of the containment access door, arms behind his back, feet planted at parade rest.\u00a0\u00a0His face was a stony mask.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWas speaking as friend, Doktor.\u00a0\u00a0Am now speaking as Security Head.\u00a0\u00a0Leave area immediately, Doktor Kondraki, or you will be removed.\u201d\n\n\n\nKondraki was still fuming hours later, when there was a sharp knock on his door.\u00a0\u00a0Before he could say \u201cfuck off\u201d, Clef slipped in, shutting the door behind him.\u00a0\u00a0He looked around the office, whistling.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWow...did you really have to shoot the ceiling that much?\u00a0\u00a0I mean, the computer is still semi-recognizable, wouldn't that have been better?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nKondraki shook his head, twirling a spent shotgun shell on his finger.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot now Clef, I'm really not in the mood.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nClef slid into one of the few remaining undamaged chairs, and grinned at the smoldering doctor. \u201cShit happens Kon, you know this.\u00a0\u00a0It's probably some screw-up somewhere down the chain, you know how bureaucratic shit gets up at the top.\u00a0\u00a0Just...roll with it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nKondraki rose, starting to walk around the room.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI know what they're up to.\u00a0\u00a0They've tried to kill me before a few times, but I always get loose.\u00a0\u00a0It's so fucking stupid...they recall all the research work, try and delegate everything out so when I go, I won't leave a hole...but I'm not about to let some dusty stuffed shirts brush me out of the way.\u00a0\u00a0I've shown the weapon potential for countless items...plus, I always have an ace over them.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He grinned coldly, looking at nothing.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey think that cutting me off from SCP-408 is going to leave me defenseless?\u00a0\u00a0Bullshit.\u00a0\u00a0Bull SHIT! Plus, nobody has the balls to try and go toe-to-toe with me!\" Kondraki continued. \"Hell, I rode fucking 682!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He laughed, looking to Clef.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe other man nodded, his eyes flickering slightly as he looked away.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah...you're really just too nuts to kill...\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBoth men chuckled for a few moments, before drifting into silence.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki stared at Clef, his smile slowly fading as he warily moved back behind his desk.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo...tell me, friend...why is it you've been such a desk jockey lately?\u00a0\u00a0Seems weird for a...man...of action like you to just take being benched without a fight.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nClef shrugged, his smile frozen inches from his ears.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, you know, just recharging the batteries, molesting demi-humans, the usual.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe laughter was forced, the remaining conversation false.\u00a0\u00a0When Kondraki pulled his shotgun and put a slug past Clef's ear, it was almost a relief.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cIsn't there a concern about fallout?\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki is somewhat well known for his. . . tendencies towards collateral damage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's been decided that, in light of the continued threat potential posed, the one-time costs are outweighed by the long-term benefits.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...Is the damn site nuke mentioned anywhere in the contingency plans?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot in any of the primary ones, no.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n-SECURITY BREACH ON STAFF LEVEL 1-\n\n-SHOTS FIRED-\n\n-SHOTS FIRED-\n\n-STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO STAFF LEVEL ONE: STAFF DOORS 1-3-\n\n-SHOTS FIRED-\n\n\n\n\u201cSon of the bitch...what is going...\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Dmitri hunched over the site alert console, watching the alerts pop up, several security screens switching to the site of the action.\u00a0\u00a0It appeared Clef and Kondraki were locked in a gun battle.\u00a0\u00a0Again.\u00a0\u00a0Still, this seemed more...vigorous than normal. For one thing, they were using real bullets this time.\n\n\n\nDmitri flipped the sound toggle on, letting the room fill with the sound of screaming and gunfire.\n\n\n\n\u201c-onna creep up, blind-side me?\u00a0\u00a0Oooh, you're slipping...\u201d\n\n\n\n<Three loud reports>\n\n\n\n\u201cKon, I swear, I have no idea-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, and now I'm going to believe a word that comes out of that polymorphic pie hole?\u201d\n\n\n\n<Single report>\n\n\n\n\u201cKon, calm the shit down!\u201d\n\n\n\nDmitri sighed, rubbing his temple as he reached for the security intercom.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs to be much paperworks...\u201d he muttered, picking up the receiver.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBefore he could dial up the security team, however, it rang in his hand.\u00a0\u00a0Shocked, he nearly dropped it before hitting the transmit button.\u00a0\u00a0He listened in silence for thirty eight seconds.\u00a0\u00a0He nodded once, then replaced the receiver.\u00a0\u00a0He looked at the screens, the intercom, and swallowed hard.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe then switched everything off, and went to get a coffee.\u00a0\u00a0It was the first coffee break he'd taken in nine months.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cToo much seems left to chance.\u00a0\u00a0What if he somehow avoids the operative?\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki has shown some combat prowess, this could backfire rather quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you'll go to page eighteen of the third section, you'll see the actions detailed much more clearly.\u00a0\u00a0The main combat event is to assess the level of decay Kondraki's combat capabilities have undergone during his prolonged SCP-408 use.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...fair enough, but won't he be more on alert?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u00a0\u00a0On the wrong subject.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nKondraki raced down the hall, keeping to the side.\u00a0\u00a0His bleeding arm throbbed, but he kept running, the gradual slant keeping him at a good pace.\u00a0\u00a0He couldn't hear Clef any more, but he knew he was there, somewhere, waiting for an ambush.\u00a0\u00a0He smiled with bloody teeth as he rounded the corner.\u00a0\u00a0He knew where he'd be safe, be able to regroup.\u00a0\u00a0The one place nobody would dare fire a shot, never risk the full wrath of The Foundation for any collateral damage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLurching forward, he pitched himself against the solid steel door.\u00a0\u00a0Panting, he fumbled for the knob, smearing blood over the brass plate reading \u201cDr. Gears\u201d.\n\n\n\nGears looked up quickly from his screen as Kondraki stumbled in, blood splattering as he slammed the door shut.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDoctor Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0You appear distressed.\u00a0\u00a0And injured.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe bleeding man laughed, then panted, leaning on the door.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOoooh fuck....Gears, you have...no idea...how happy I...am to...hear you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nGears rose and crossed quickly to the door, easing Kondraki across the office.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSit down.\u00a0\u00a0You need immediate medical attention.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a breach event in progress?\u00a0\u00a0I will contact site security.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nKondraki tensed as Gears spoke, then grabbed the older man's lab coat. \u201cNo...no security...just...let me sit.\u201d\n\n\n\nKondraki flopped into the office chair, sighing and wincing as he rubbed his shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey...they tried to send Clef after me...can you believe that?\u00a0\u00a0I knew they'd try it eventually.\u00a0\u00a0God DAMN but that hurts...Got any pain killers, Gears?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe older man shook his head slowly, watching Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am sorry, but I keep no medical supplies on hand in my office.\u00a0\u00a0Any chemicals required for testing are kept-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know...Jesus...\u201d Kondraki waved Gears away, panting and closing his eyes as he rubbed his face.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust...need a second to regroup.\u00a0\u00a0Then I'm going up to master control...pop some doors...\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki sighed, getting his wind back.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe didn't hear the click of the trigger until the bullet was already in his temple.\n\n\n\nThe .45 caliber slug tore through the thin tissue of his scalp and snipped a neat hole through the skull bone just as Kondraki thought \u201cwhat...\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0As it shredded through his collected memories, dreams, and plans, he was simultaneously aware of the location of a book he'd misplaced weeks ago, and the vague smell of wood shavings.\u00a0\u00a0Then all of it, wood, book, and mind exited through a much less neat and much more explosive hole in the left side of the now former doctor's skull.\u00a0\u00a0He twitched once, then fell forward, hitting the desk hard enough to bruise, if he had been still capable of it.\n\n\n\nGears shifted, replacing the gun in his coat pocket.\u00a0\u00a0He looked down, stone-faced, as the man emptied his life's blood and work onto his desk.\u00a0\u00a0He raised his hand, slowly, and placed it on the dead man's shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0He blinked once, slowly, eyes closed for several seconds, before opening them again.\u00a0\u00a0He then set about cleaning the gun, and re-positioning Kondraki's hands.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cI still question the operative choice.\u00a0\u00a0His last combat action was...four years ago?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCombat, yes.\u00a0\u00a0Rogue subject control is not considered a combat action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...when...when was he last active for that, then?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm afraid that's still sealed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...alright.\u00a0\u00a0Let's go with it.\u00a0\u00a0What are we going to do for a cover?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this case, the old ways are the best ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n-Notice of Staff Death-\n\n\n\n> Name: Dr.

He had to do something, after all. Even if it meant that his food might not last as long, that the precious, life-giving fat around his belly and thighs might burn away a little faster, he had to do something.\n<p>It had been at least a week since he\u2019d fired the last few rounds out of his rifle, killing the last of the invaders he\u2019d found lurking around the door to his basement. Their yellow faces and black eyes stared at him still, every time he looked through the tiny slit in the wall. There were no bacteria left to eat their dying bodies; no crows to feast on their eyes. The world was dead and sterile, as far as he could tell.</p>\n<p>Bragg knew that the United States had been victorious, though. The few stragglers left behind were those who managed to survive the initial bombs, hiding in their victims homes and shelters, only venturing out when they had depleted the supplies that those visionary few Americans had stocked and supplied for so long, so hard. It wasn\u2019t fair that these yellow bastards had come here. It wasn\u2019t fair that they had killed his wife and his children, that they had killed his friends and their families with their \u201cclean\u201d bomb.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, very clean,\u201d thought Bragg. It had dropped almost directly into their suburb, thousands of air based antiseptics. Those who breathed it died quickly, while those who ate food it landed on killed their digestive bacteria. A bomb that starved you to death! Bragg spat at the ground, letting go of the precious little water that remained. He knew for sure that-</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, there!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bragg nearly jumped out of his skin. In the hundreds of times he\u2019d paced the basement, his opinions rolling through his mind, he\u2019d never seen anyone with him. He was supposed to die down here, the food running out, starving. A post-modern tear jerker. But now\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Fredrickson,\u201d said the man, extending his hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m offering you a chance to save the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d sneered Bragg. \u201cThe world is over. It\u2019s all dead out there. The clean kind of dead, where nothing rots and you live with their eyes always watchi-</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know</em> they\u2019re all dead \u2018out there,\u2019\u201d interrupted Fredrickson, pointing at the door. \u201cI\u2019m talking about <em>further</em> away than that. \"</p>\n<p>For a moment, Bragg harbored hope. Washington? New York? Did they escape? Fredrickson dashed them quickly.</p>\n<p>\"Past the pages, into the real world. I\u2019m going to need as much help as I can get, and you\u2019re the only one alive in this book.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blithe comment had utterly shattered Bragg\u2019s composure. You were never, EVER, supposed to break character, not where they could read you. He rushed forward, grasping Fredrickson\u2019s\u2026 he wasn\u2019t sure what. He didn\u2019t know that it had ever been described.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my lab coat,\u201d said Fredrickson, seemingly understanding Bragg\u2019s problem. \u201cListen, I\u2019m very sorry to break your fourth wall, but it\u2019s kind of an emergency. Will you please come?\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn't know what to say. Other than the occasional flashback, this was all he'd ever known. He had the history of his character: the Korean War, the family and kids, the quickly lost jobs. And the bomb. Of course, the bomb was the focal point of his history. But this place, this abandoned basement, was all he'd ever really experienced. That was all that was within the pages.</p>\n<p>Bragg shrugged. What else could he do? Sit here and die? He regretfully looked up at the doctor.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>whole</em> world?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Fredrickson. \u201cVery likely, the whole world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018The whole world,\u2019 thought Bragg. \u2018So much more than Maple Street\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Cardiforce was listening, with delight. The chants of the faithful filled the air around him, exacting in their beauty and cadence.</p>\n<p><em>\"We are His Clockwork Servants!<br/>\nWe do the work of His hand!<br/>\nThose who oppose will forgive us<br/>\nwhen they are made to understand!\"</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Their chants filled him with the shriven perfunctory of a man of faith. He watched gleefully as they raised the arc-welders to the wall of the hanger and struck them against the metal.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bragg was staggered by the sight. In front of him, two men who looked almost exactly like Rommel and Patton were talking with each other, describing the different points of entry they might expect and the different prospects for armament they could hope for. Upon seeing Fredrickson, the two men smiled and walked forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do we have here, Fred?\u201d asked Patton, his white teeth glinting and the ghost of an American flag waving behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cRandy Bragg,\u201d said Fredrickson, motioning to the still stunned man. \u201cHe should be the last of the ones we can use. He fought in Korea, so he should work out well for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKorea?\u201d asked Rommel. \u201cWhy would he fight in that little backwater? Don\u2019t the Japanese know how to keep order in their own country?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fredrickson put one arm around Bragg and whispered in his ear. \u201cOhnay orldway arway Ootay, got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bragg nodded, turning to ask Fredrickson what might be a good topic, when he found himself suddenly alone. He allowed himself to be shepherded off by the two men, asking him of guns and models from the next few years.</p>\n<p>\"Tell me,\" asked Rommel. \"Who makes the better gun, from your time? The Germans or the Americans?\"</p>\n<p>Patton seemed patently interested in the same question. Bragg stood for a moment, looking from one to the other, unable to really answer much of anything.</p>\n<p>So he lied. \"The British,\" he said, calmly. Both men looked surprised, looked at each other for a moment, and then broke into laughter.</p>\n<p>\"This one is funnier than the others, Rommy!\" roared Patton.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" agreed Rommel, \"though he would almost have to be!\"</p>\n<p>The two men laughed loudly, turning away from Bragg. As they walked away, planning the different points at which they expected assault to arrive from, Bragg turned and walked around the battlefield, trying to shake off the haunting almost memories of Korea, trying to ignore the tickling fear than now began to gnaw at him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The door to the large hanger was glowing bright orange now, having shifted from the earlier red. The heat could be felt even at the other side, where the two Foundation Agents were working as quickly as possible, going through every book they could find in their small site, leafing and discarding them with a speed only seen in those who had grown efficient at being panicked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s moving quickly,\u201d said Dodridge. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from two wounded platoons to a full squad of rangers, a Cavalry, and three post-apocalyptic survivors. Are there any left?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing of use, I don\u2019t think,\u201d said Lament. \u201cWe\u2019ve just about run ourselves dry. Let\u2019s hope this actually works, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt had better, or I\u2019m pretty sure we won\u2019t be around to care,\u201d said Dodridge, hefting and placing the two dragon-shaped bookends on a small table, sliding the book between them and turning, both men running at breakneck speed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bragg sat in the dirt, next to one of the other men. He looked, Bragg thought, like he might have been a banker at one time.</p>\n<p>When the man saw him looking, he turned and smiled at Bragg. \"You're one of us, aren't you?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"One of what?\" replied Bragg.</p>\n<p>\"The post-apocers. You look like you've survived the end of the world once or twice.\" The man smiled at Bragg. \"My name's Darren Palanger. I'm from <em>Fallen Monuments, Fallen Gods</em>. Five atomic bombs, one city; which\u2026 will\u2026 survive!\" Palanger laughed, hollowly. \"How about you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Randy Bragg, from Maple Street. The clean bomb.\"</p>\n<p>\"Clean bomb?\"</p>\n<p>\"Kills all the bacteria, including the ones that keep you alive.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does that work?\"</p>\n<p>Bragg shrugged. \"My author thought so.\"</p>\n<p>\"And do you?\" asked another voice.</p>\n<p>Bragg turned around and saw Fredrickson standing there. \"Do you believe it works?\"</p>\n<p>\"I guess I must,\" said Bragg. \"It destroyed everything I ever remember loving.\"</p>\n<p>Fredrickson smiled. \"Then I have a job for you.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201c<em>We are his Clockwork servants</em>!\u201d sounded the cry. \u201c<em>We do the work of his hands</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>The men in the front were the luckiest, thought Cardiforce, looking toward them with envy. \u201cThey will be the first. The first to touch His heart. The first to become one with His body.\u201d He was regretful that he would not be allowed to join them, join in their sacrifice to the true god.</p>\n<p>With a crack and snap, he saw the door give way, breaking and bucking under its own weight as the flames of His servants blasted through it at last. And then came the gun fire.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cMow them all down!\u201d shouted the Sergeant, yelling through the snapping of shells on metal and flesh. \u201cKill all the bastards you can!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bragg found it difficult to concentrate, to remake, as Fredrickson was telling him, the description from the book. The sky had fallen away on one side, with the grim sunlight of earlier being replaced by night. Beyond the opening, glinting and turning, he saw their foe marching forward. He heard their clicking and turning as the bullets scattered some of them backward.</p>\n<p>He had no gun, though. Only a piece of paper. Fredrickson was looking at him desperately. \u201cFaster, Bragg. FASTER. You must try to remember before the pages. Read into what is implied!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bragg looked up at him, angry and desperate. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly EASY, ya know?\u201d He returned, trying to recall the moments in his author\u2019s mind when he\u2019d been crafted, the implication of the device. He was slow, deliberate, in explaining its fall. Methodical in the detonation. Only the range had to be changed, the duration of the effect. Fredrickson had explained this carefully, making sure to mention the several different outcomes of Bragg not being careful. It could mean, after all, no more readers.</p>\n<p>That didn't make it any easier.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Cardiforce ordered his men forward, charging into the room. It was bigger on the inside than the outside, he noted, dismissing the Foundation\u2019s trickery as nothing more than an idle illusion. While they hadn\u2019t expected any real resistance, they were more than capable of handling anything the tiny outpost could possibly muster.</p>\n<p>The penitent rushed them, bringing both guns and swords to bear on their attackers. The first lines fell away quickly, but there was no way to anticipate the horses. They charged down on the exposed flank from beyond the building\u2019s sides, cutting through the primary force with ease.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the glory of Gondor!\u201d shouted the lead man, his sword held brazenly aloft.</p>\n<p>Cardiforce instructed a sniper to shoot him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bragg finished and looked up, but Fredrickson was already gone. He looked back down to his page, and noted the sudden appearance of Super Fred, the hero of a thousand worlds, catching the falling bomb and vanishing with a dash\u2014</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A young man was cutting his way through the crowd with a sword much too big, much too sharp to be real. Cardiforce heard it moving through the air, whistling, snicker-snack. However, when the men the boy had beheaded did not stop moving, he was easily removed from the equation. But the whistling did not stop.</p>\n<p>Cardiforce looked up. There was a man there, plummeting, a white lab coat fluttering in the wind like a cape. Cardiforce assumed, for a moment, that it must have been one of the reinforcements the Foundation was expecting, his entry gone awry. A moment before the man hit the ground, he looked up at Cardiforce, smiling an evil grin. And vanished.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bragg coughed, breathing the noxious purifying gas, feeling it eat away at his lungs. All around him, men were dying, gagging on the weapon he had created. The thing he made from a time before text, when it was only an implied threat and not a real one.</p>\n<p>He struggled to stand, trying to run away from the deadly, impossible fallout, but he could not. As his eyes finally clouded over, he knew that his body would remain here forever, unchanging, the rot unable to take hold in a place where the bomb had been. Just as he had so many times before, he felt the darkness overtaking him, felt the little lights at the corners of his vision explode inward in a burst of adrenalin, glimpsed for a moment his wife and child standing among those golden refractions. Then, he died.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Cardiforce vomited, throwing up a mass of cogs and skin. He could feel them within him, turning slower and slower as His divine grace fled his body. He, like all those around him, had failed. Never before had the church been so close to a goal of this magnitude, and now it was taken away from them.</p>\n<p>He had decided. Their punishment was severe, their death assured. He reached down and touched some of the metal cogs that had moments ago been his lungs or stomach, crying as they broke into pieces. Then, he died.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fred was in trouble, he knew. He probably shouldn\u2019t have let them know he could carry people around, because now they\u2019d be asking for it all the time. Sooner or later, someone would try to write something really helpful or valuable into the book, not realizing that it would lose more than they could imagine outside the confines of the storyland. Everything was much more beautiful in here, much more perfect. Even that silly bomb.</p>\n<p>But Fred knew that, for a moment, he\u2019d been someone really important. At least, for a short while, he\u2019d been something that mattered. More than just words on a page or casual addenda, more than a footnote. He\u2019d been a savior to the world. Then, he died.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Well, not really. Wouldn't that just be a terrible way to end it?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Agent Lament smiled as he read the final chapter and closed the book, throwing it into the pile that had been building up at his feet. The far side of the hangar was still a ruined lump of burning metal, but everything else had returned to normal. He opened up his phone and pressed a few buttons, popping his neck as he leaned it over.</p>\n<p>\u201cSituation?\u201d came the voice from the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuccess, Doctor. 423 is capable of exactly what you expected and is apparently highly motivating to those he encounters. Kind of a nice guy, too, once you get past the attitude. We'll have to update its file.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'll take care of that personally. Tell him that the copy of the <em>Vatsayana</em> he requested will be delivered shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a click, he closed his phone and got out the notepad Fred was currently occupying. \"You got your book,\" wrote Lament. \"You ever get tired of living vicariously?\"</p>\n<p>He flipped back a couple of pages, looking through his notes intently for new addenda. He saw it, finally, at the bottom of the first page he'd written on.</p>\n<p>'Not when that's the only living you get.'</p>\n<p>Lament picked back through the books 423 had run through, noting how the stories seemed to fall apart. One of them, less than a quarter of the way through, quickly vanished into cursory descriptions of an unchanging room where no one ever lived, and then suddenly fell away into blank pages. He turned it over and looked at it again: <em>The Man from Maple Street</em>.</p>\nHe shrugged and threw it into the pile. Dodridge struck a match, and they were ablaze.<br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>. <a href=\"/his-clockwork-servants\">His Clockwork Servants</a> With Apologies to Yoric</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-man-from-maple-street\">The Man from Maple Street</a>\" by TroyL, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\nRandy Bragg\u2019s arms still hurt from the morning pushups he had recently resumed.\u00a0\u00a0He had to do something, after all.\u00a0\u00a0Even if it meant that his food might not last as long, that the precious, life-giving fat around his belly and thighs might burn away a little faster, he had to do something.\n\n\n\nIt had been at least a week since he\u2019d fired the last few rounds out of his rifle, killing the last of the invaders he\u2019d found lurking around the door to his basement.\u00a0\u00a0Their yellow faces and black eyes stared at him still, every time he looked through the tiny slit in the wall.\u00a0\u00a0There were no bacteria left to eat their dying bodies; no crows to feast on their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0The world was dead and sterile, as far as he could tell.\n\n\n\nBragg knew that the United States had been victorious, though.\u00a0\u00a0The few stragglers left behind were those who managed to survive the initial bombs, hiding in their victims homes and shelters, only venturing out when they had depleted the supplies that those visionary few Americans had stocked and supplied for so long, so hard.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t fair that these yellow bastards had come here.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t fair that they had killed his wife and his children, that they had killed his friends and their families with their \u201cclean\u201d bomb. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes, very clean,\u201d thought Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0It had dropped almost directly into their suburb, thousands of air based antiseptics.\u00a0\u00a0Those who breathed it died quickly, while those who ate food it landed on killed their digestive bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0A bomb that starved you to death!\u00a0\u00a0Bragg spat at the ground, letting go of the precious little water that remained.\u00a0\u00a0He knew for sure that-\n\n\n\n\u201cHello, there!\u201d\n\n\n\nBragg nearly jumped out of his skin.\u00a0\u00a0In the hundreds of times he\u2019d paced the basement, his opinions rolling through his mind, he\u2019d never seen anyone with him.\u00a0\u00a0He was supposed to die down here, the food running out, starving.\u00a0\u00a0A post-modern tear jerker.\u00a0\u00a0But now\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Fredrickson,\u201d said the man, extending his hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m offering you a chance to save the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d sneered Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe world is over.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s all dead out there.\u00a0\u00a0The clean kind of dead, where nothing rots and you live with their eyes always watchi-\n\n\n\n\u201cI //know// they\u2019re all dead \u2018out there,\u2019\u201d interrupted Fredrickson, pointing at the door.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m talking about //further// away than that. \" \n\n\n\nFor a moment, Bragg harbored hope.\u00a0\u00a0Washington?\u00a0\u00a0New York?\u00a0\u00a0Did they escape?\u00a0\u00a0Fredrickson dashed them quickly.\n\n\n\n\"Past the pages, into the real world.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to need as much help as I can get, and you\u2019re the only one alive in this book.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe blithe comment had utterly shattered Bragg\u2019s composure.\u00a0\u00a0You were never, EVER, supposed to break character, not where they could read you.\u00a0\u00a0He rushed forward, grasping Fredrickson\u2019s\u2026 he wasn\u2019t sure what.\u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t know that it had ever been described.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my lab coat,\u201d said Fredrickson, seemingly understanding Bragg\u2019s problem.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, I\u2019m very sorry to break your fourth wall, but it\u2019s kind of an emergency.\u00a0\u00a0Will you please come?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what to say.\u00a0\u00a0Other than the occasional flashback, this was all he'd ever known.\u00a0\u00a0He had the history of his character: the Korean War, the family and kids, the quickly lost jobs.\u00a0\u00a0And the bomb.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the bomb was the focal point of his history.\u00a0\u00a0But this place, this abandoned basement, was all he'd ever really experienced.\u00a0\u00a0That was all that was within the pages.\n\n\n\nBragg shrugged.\u00a0\u00a0What else could he do?\u00a0\u00a0Sit here and die?\u00a0\u00a0He regretfully looked up at the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe //whole// world?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Fredrickson.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cVery likely, the whole world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018The whole world,\u2019 thought Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018So much more than Maple Street\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nCardiforce was listening, with delight.\u00a0\u00a0The chants of the faithful filled the air around him, exacting in their beauty and cadence.\n\n\n\n//\"We are His Clockwork Servants!\n\nWe do the work of His hand!\n\nThose who oppose will forgive us\n\nwhen they are made to understand!\"//[[footnote]] [[[ his-clockwork-servants | His Clockwork Servants]]] With Apologies to Yoric [[/footnote]] \n\n\n\nTheir chants filled him with the shriven perfunctory of a man of faith.\u00a0\u00a0He watched gleefully as they raised the arc-welders to the wall of the hanger and struck them against the metal.\n\n-----\n\nBragg was staggered by the sight.\u00a0\u00a0In front of him, two men who looked almost exactly like Rommel and Patton were talking with each other, describing the different points of entry they might expect and the different prospects for armament they could hope for.\u00a0\u00a0Upon seeing Fredrickson, the two men smiled and walked forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho do we have here, Fred?\u201d asked Patton, his white teeth glinting and the ghost of an American flag waving behind him.\n\n\n\n\u201cRandy Bragg,\u201d said Fredrickson, motioning to the still stunned man.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe should be the last of the ones we can use.\u00a0\u00a0He fought in Korea, so he should work out well for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKorea?\u201d asked Rommel.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy would he fight in that little backwater?\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t the Japanese know how to keep order in their own country?\u201d\n\n\n\nFredrickson put one arm around Bragg and whispered in his ear.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOhnay orldway arway Ootay, got it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBragg nodded, turning to ask Fredrickson what might be a good topic, when he found himself suddenly alone. He allowed himself to be shepherded off by the two men, asking him of guns and models from the next few years. \n\n\n\n\"Tell me,\" asked Rommel.\u00a0\u00a0\"Who makes the better gun, from your time?\u00a0\u00a0The Germans or the Americans?\"\n\n\n\nPatton seemed patently interested in the same question.\u00a0\u00a0Bragg stood for a moment, looking from one to the other, unable to really answer much of anything.\n\n\n\nSo he lied.\u00a0\u00a0\"The British,\" he said, calmly.\u00a0\u00a0Both men looked surprised, looked at each other for a moment, and then broke into laughter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"This one is funnier than the others, Rommy!\" roared Patton.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Rommel, \"though he would almost have to be!\"\n\n\n\nThe two men laughed loudly, turning away from Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0As they walked away, planning the different points at which they expected assault to arrive from, Bragg turned and walked around the battlefield, trying to shake off the haunting almost memories of Korea, trying to ignore the tickling fear than now began to gnaw at him.\n\n----\n\nThe door to the large hanger was glowing bright orange now, having shifted from the earlier red.\u00a0\u00a0The heat could be felt even at the other side, where the two Foundation Agents were working as quickly as possible, going through every book they could find in their small site, leafing and discarding them with a speed only seen in those who had grown efficient at being panicked.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s moving quickly,\u201d said Dodridge.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from two wounded platoons to a full squad of rangers, a Cavalry, and three post-apocalyptic survivors.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any left?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing of use, I don\u2019t think,\u201d said Lament.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve just about run ourselves dry.\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s hope this actually works, huh?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt had better, or I\u2019m pretty sure we won\u2019t be around to care,\u201d said Dodridge, hefting and placing the two dragon-shaped bookends on a small table, sliding the book between them and turning, both men running at breakneck speed.\n\n-----\n\nBragg sat in the dirt, next to one of the other men.\u00a0\u00a0He looked, Bragg thought, like he might have been a banker at one time.\n\n\n\nWhen the man saw him looking, he turned and smiled at Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0\"You're one of us, aren't you?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"One of what?\" replied Bragg.\n\n\n\n\"The post-apocers.\u00a0\u00a0You look like you've survived the end of the world once or twice.\" The man smiled at Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0\"My name's Darren Palanger.\u00a0\u00a0I'm from //Fallen Monuments, Fallen Gods//.\u00a0\u00a0Five atomic bombs, one city; which... will... survive!\"\u00a0\u00a0Palanger laughed, hollowly.\u00a0\u00a0\"How about you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Randy Bragg, from Maple Street.\u00a0\u00a0The clean bomb.\"\n\n\n\n\"Clean bomb?\"\n\n\n\n\"Kills all the bacteria, including the ones that keep you alive.\"\n\n\n\n\"Does that work?\"\n\n\n\nBragg shrugged.\u00a0\u00a0\"My author thought so.\"\n\n\n\n\"And do you?\" asked another voice.\n\n\n\nBragg turned around and saw Fredrickson standing there.\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you believe it works?\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess I must,\" said Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0\"It destroyed everything I ever remember loving.\"\n\n\n\nFredrickson smiled.\u00a0\u00a0\"Then I have a job for you.\"\n\n-----\n\n\u201c//We are his Clockwork servants//!\u201d sounded the cry.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c//We do the work of his hands//!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe men in the front were the luckiest, thought Cardiforce, looking toward them with envy.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey will be the first.\u00a0\u00a0The first to touch His heart.\u00a0\u00a0The first to become one with His body.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He was regretful that he would not be allowed to join them, join in their sacrifice to the true god.\n\n\n\nWith a crack and snap, he saw the door give way, breaking and bucking under its own weight as the flames of His servants blasted through it at last.\u00a0\u00a0And then came the gun fire.\n\n-----\n\n\u201cMow them all down!\u201d shouted the Sergeant, yelling through the snapping of shells on metal and flesh.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKill all the bastards you can!\u201d\n\n\n\nBragg found it difficult to concentrate, to remake, as Fredrickson was telling him, the description from the book.\u00a0\u00a0The sky had fallen away on one side, with the grim sunlight of earlier being replaced by night.\u00a0\u00a0Beyond the opening, glinting and turning, he saw their foe marching forward.\u00a0\u00a0He heard their clicking and turning as the bullets scattered some of them backward. \n\n\n\nHe had no gun, though.\u00a0\u00a0Only a piece of paper.\u00a0\u00a0Fredrickson was looking at him desperately.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFaster, Bragg.\u00a0\u00a0FASTER.\u00a0\u00a0You must try to remember before the pages.\u00a0\u00a0Read into what is implied!\u201d\n\n\n\nBragg looked up at him, angry and desperate.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly EASY, ya know?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He returned, trying to recall the moments in his author\u2019s mind when he\u2019d been crafted, the implication of the device.\u00a0\u00a0He was slow, deliberate, in explaining its fall.\u00a0\u00a0Methodical in the detonation.\u00a0\u00a0Only the range had to be changed, the duration of the effect.\u00a0\u00a0Fredrickson had explained this carefully, making sure to mention the several different outcomes of Bragg not being careful.\u00a0\u00a0It could mean, after all, no more readers.\n\n\n\nThat didn't make it any easier.\n\n----\n\nCardiforce ordered his men forward, charging into the room.\u00a0\u00a0It was bigger on the inside than the outside, he noted, dismissing the Foundation\u2019s trickery as nothing more than an idle illusion.\u00a0\u00a0While they hadn\u2019t expected any real resistance, they were more than capable of handling anything the tiny outpost could possibly muster.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe penitent rushed them, bringing both guns and swords to bear on their attackers.\u00a0\u00a0The first lines fell away quickly, but there was no way to anticipate the horses.\u00a0\u00a0They charged down on the exposed flank from beyond the building\u2019s sides, cutting through the primary force with ease.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the glory of Gondor!\u201d shouted the lead man, his sword held brazenly aloft.\n\n\n\nCardiforce instructed a sniper to shoot him.\n\n----\n\nBragg finished and looked up, but Fredrickson was already gone.\u00a0\u00a0He looked back down to his page, and noted the sudden appearance of Super Fred, the hero of a thousand worlds, catching the falling bomb and vanishing with a dash\u2014\n\n----\n\nA young man was cutting his way through the crowd with a sword much too big, much too sharp to be real.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiforce heard it moving through the air, whistling, snicker-snack.\u00a0\u00a0However, when the men the boy had beheaded did not stop moving, he was easily removed from the equation.\u00a0\u00a0But the whistling did not stop.\n\n\n\nCardiforce looked up.\u00a0\u00a0There was a man there, plummeting, a white lab coat fluttering in the wind like a cape.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiforce assumed, for a moment, that it must have been one of the reinforcements the Foundation was expecting, his entry gone awry.\u00a0\u00a0A moment before the man hit the ground, he looked up at Cardiforce, smiling an evil grin.\u00a0\u00a0And vanished.\n\n----\n\nBragg coughed, breathing the noxious purifying gas, feeling it eat away at his lungs.\u00a0\u00a0All around him, men were dying, gagging on the weapon he had created.\u00a0\u00a0The thing he made from a time before text, when it was only an implied threat and not a real one.\n\n\n\nHe struggled to stand, trying to run away from the deadly, impossible fallout, but he could not.\u00a0\u00a0As his eyes finally clouded over, he knew that his body would remain here forever, unchanging, the rot unable to take hold in a place where the bomb had been.\u00a0\u00a0Just as he had so many times before, he felt the darkness overtaking him, felt the little lights at the corners of his vision explode inward in a burst of adrenalin, glimpsed for a moment his wife and child standing among those golden refractions.\u00a0\u00a0Then, he died.\n\n-----\n\nCardiforce vomited, throwing up a mass of cogs and skin.\u00a0\u00a0He could feel them within him, turning slower and slower as His divine grace fled his body.\u00a0\u00a0He, like all those around him, had failed.\u00a0\u00a0Never before had the church been so close to a goal of this magnitude, and now it was taken away from them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe had decided.\u00a0\u00a0Their punishment was severe, their death assured.\u00a0\u00a0He reached down and touched some of the metal cogs that had moments ago been his lungs or stomach, crying as they broke into pieces.\u00a0\u00a0Then, he died.\n\n----\n\nFred was in trouble, he knew.\u00a0\u00a0He probably shouldn\u2019t have let them know he could carry people around, because now they\u2019d be asking for it all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Sooner or later, someone would try to write something really helpful or valuable into the book, not realizing that it would lose more than they could imagine outside the confines of the storyland.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was much more beautiful in here, much more perfect.\u00a0\u00a0Even that silly bomb.\n\n\n\nBut Fred knew that, for a moment, he\u2019d been someone really important.\u00a0\u00a0At least, for a short while, he\u2019d been something that mattered.\u00a0\u00a0More than just words on a page or casual addenda, more

Lament smiled as he read the final chapter and closed the book, throwing it into the pile that had been building up at his feet.\u00a0\u00a0The far side of the hangar was still a ruined lump of burning metal, but everything else had returned to normal.\u00a0\u00a0He opened up his phone and pressed a few buttons, popping his neck as he leaned it over.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cSituation?\u201d came the voice from the other side.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuccess, Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0423 is capable of exactly what you expected and is apparently highly motivating to those he encounters.\u00a0\u00a0Kind of a nice guy, too, once you get past the attitude.\u00a0\u00a0We'll have to update its file.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI'll take care of that personally.\u00a0\u00a0Tell him that the copy of the //Vatsayana// he requested will be delivered shortly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a click, he closed his phone and got out the notepad Fred was currently occupying.\u00a0\u00a0\"You got your book,\" wrote Lament.\u00a0\u00a0\"You ever get tired of living vicariously?\"\n\n\n\nHe flipped back a couple of pages, looking through his notes intently for new addenda.\u00a0\u00a0He saw it, finally, at the bottom of the first page he'd written on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Not when that's the only living you get.'\n\n\n\nLament picked back through the books 423 had run through, noting how the stories seemed to fall apart.\u00a0\u00a0One of them, less than a quarter of the way through, quickly vanished into cursory descriptions of an unchanging room where no one ever lived, and then suddenly fell away into blank pages.\u00a0\u00a0He turned it over and looked at it again: //The Man from Maple Street//. \n\n\n\nHe shrugged and threw it into the pile.\u00a0\u00a0Dodridge struck a match, and they were ablaze.\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a

She could barely move her head, and the straps holding her down, (a surgical table?) made it so she could only stare at the ceiling and the walls to her side.

Bragging is for the prideful, and the Lord teaches us not to be prideful. So, let\u2019s talk about you, Michelle. I have to say, I\u2019m really happy that I saw you on the street a few days ago! Ever since I had to leave Wisconsin, I\u2019ve been having a hard time picking who to help out! But then I saw you, walking down the street, and I saw that you needed my help more than anyone. That look of loss in your eyes, like you needed someone to give you purpose, to reaffirm your life\u2026 That spoke to me. And so I decided to answer your plea, and here we are, ready to get you back on the right track!\u201d</p>\n<p>The man reached down and grabbed her jaw firmly, and with his other hand reached into her mouth and fixed something in place over her teeth. A mouth guard, made of rubber. He patted her cheek as his hand withdrew. \u201cDon\u2019t want you to bite your tongue. Not before we\u2019re finished.\u201d She stared at him, beseeching him with her eyes to let her go. He paid no heed, too lost in his own thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere was I? Ah yes. So I followed you, and I saw your life. The love you have for your husband, and your child. But I noticed that you were unhappy, particularly when your son and husband weren\u2019t with you. Feeling lonely? Didn\u2019t know what to do? I understand. Some people mock homemakers, saying they\u2019re just a relic of a past time, but I disagree. I think it\u2019s your choice, and you\u2019ve made a worthy decision. So let\u2019s get you back in that role you chose!\u201d</p>\n<p>He reached down and picked something up from behind her. As he walked around to stand next to the table, she saw the scalpel glint in his hand. Her eyes widened. She began to hyperventilate, the breaths through her nose sucking in more of that stench, making her gag. With one hand he held her stomach down, while with the other he reached down and slit the shirt she was wearing, exposing her abdomen. The scalpel continued cutting, drawing a burning line down her diaphragm. The wet, warm feeling of her own blood trickling down her sides as each breath began to hurt. He stepped back and put the scalpel back behind her and his hand came back up holding a large jar. The source of that earlier sound. The smoked sides gave no indication of what was inside, beyond faintly discernable motion. He turned it upside-down, and unscrewed the lid, holding it over the mouth as he brought it next to the cut.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t worry. This may sting at first, but its all right. A little pain is worth purpose, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hand holding the lid flashed away as he firmly pressed the jar down on the cut. Michelle\u2019s breaths were harsh as she felt the sharp pinpricks of the feet of the creatures inside the jar. She tried to struggle but was still too weak, the pain from her diaphragm and the psychological shock of what was going on making her movements pathetically impotent. He looked down at her, one hand dropping the lid on the ground to come up and stroke her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll soon be all better. Let them inside and they\u2019ll never leave you alone like your family does. Just what a homemaker would want, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>His hand moved past her head, back to grab something from behind her. A tuning fork. He sharply rapped it against the side of the jar, frightening the insects inside. Michelle screamed inside her mind as the first slipped inside, a burrowing pain in her entrails. More and more entered her, a gnawing tide clawing and biting at whatever it needed to get away. Tears streamed down her cheeks as more blood began to pour from around the jar, sliding down her ribcage and the writhing bulges under her skin. Her heart beat faster and faster, until the sensation of prickling feet and devouring mandibles entering it caused it to cease completely.</p>\n<p>The man looked at the slowly cooling body of what was once a human being, now just a hive. He reached down to the surgical table and picked up a camera. Another successful mission of mercy.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-samaritan\">The Samaritan</a>\" by Arlecchino, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

He beat on the door again, feeling the thick reverberation bounce through its solid core. \u00a0He could try and pick the lock, or bash it in, but that was not the way. \u00a0Not their way, never. \u00a0Respect was always foremost, even at the utmost end of need.\n<p>He folded back on his haunches, his sigh turning the dust on the long-abandoned floor. \u00a0He looked back, at the dim stair, and considered again just going back, letting it go. \u00a0He thought this way for a long time, then stood with a new, more burning resolve. He went and knocked again\u2026 and again\u2026 and again. \u00a0He hammered on the door. \u00a0He beat on the door. He slammed his fists over and over, thundering against its mocking, ageless weight. He beat his fists until they split, spilling blood that looked like deeper, slicker smears of darkness onto the unrelenting wood. \u00a0He threw himself against it, biting, clawing, gouging at the wood like something rabid and in pain.</p>\n<p>Finally, he slowed, then stopped, pulling away from the blank wood with an almost sheepish slink. \u00a0He folded back up again, letting the split, reeking flesh stop pulsing and start to knit over.

He beat on the door again, feeling the thick reverberation bounce through its solid core. \u00a0He could try and pick the lock, or bash it in, but that was not the way. \u00a0Not their way, never. \u00a0Respect was always foremost, even at the utmost end of need. \n\n\n\nHe folded back on his haunches, his sigh turning the dust on the long-abandoned floor. \u00a0He looked back, at the dim stair, and considered again just going back, letting it go. \u00a0He thought this way for a long time, then stood with a new, more burning resolve. He went and knocked again... and again... and again. \u00a0He hammered on the door. \u00a0He beat on the door. He slammed his fists over and over, thundering against its mocking, ageless weight. He beat his fists until they split, spilling blood that looked like deeper, slicker smears of darkness onto the unrelenting wood. \u00a0He threw himself against it, biting, clawing, gouging at the wood like something rabid and in pain. \n\n\n\nFinally, he slowed, then stopped, pulling away from the blank wood with an almost sheepish slink. \u00a0He folded back up again, letting the split, reeking flesh stop pulsing and start to knit over. He turned the black, pulsing mass that gave him sight to the door again, split tongues lolling as he chastised himself for his reckless, misplaced hatred. They had gone, those many, and hidden deep in their vaults. \u00a0This may be the last, the very last flake of rotten flesh left of their abandoned body. \u00a0Their endless impatience had called to them for correction, so...they had come.

However, I can not be the only one present who finds the situation ironic: we, as researchers of an institution whose sole purpose is the containment of the paranormal and unknown, are observing an over-commercialized holiday celebrating distilled and often completely fictitious versions of such.\u201d</p>\n<p>&lt;Gears, this is no time for analysis. Just drink your punch.&gt; Bright signed rapidly with one hand.</p>\n<p>The three doctors were all taking part in the time-honored party tradition of standing by the punch bowl, engaging in what could be called \u201cconversation\u201d, if the definition was stretched. In one way or another, each one was arrayed in costume: Crow had donned a black greatcoat, specially made of course, accompanied by a red sash and a matching high-peaked hat with a silver eagle pin on the front. Bright was in the body of an adult male orangutan. Gears was still wearing his lab coat, but someone had placed a floppy, oversized wizard\u2019s hat on his head and he had yet to take it off.</p>\n<p>The Site 19 D-class cafeteria had been converted into the main party center, and the effort was admirable. There was a considerable amount of black and orange streamers hanging from the ceiling, along with dozens of jack o\u2019 lanterns which sat grinning on the long metal tables. Of course, there was also the general mishmash of fake spiders, bugs, skeletons, bats, ghosts, neat glow-in-the-dark doohickeys, a fog machine, and a sound system currently running through volume two of \u201cHalloween\u2019s Best Hits\u201d. The cafeteria line was laden with a sizeable assortment of foods, mostly sugary and very little otherwise. The crowd was still small, consisting mostly of those in charge of the party. The night was still young, and most staff members were still spelunking their way through the haunted house.</p>\n<p>The haunted house was, easily, the crown jewel of the event.

However, I can not be the only one present who finds the situation ironic: we, as researchers of an institution whose sole purpose is the containment of the paranormal and unknown, are observing an over-commercialized holiday celebrating distilled and often completely fictitious versions of such.\u201d\n\n\n\n<Gears, this is no time for analysis. Just drink your punch.> Bright signed rapidly with one hand.\n\n\n\nThe three doctors were all taking part in the time-honored party tradition of standing by the punch bowl, engaging in what could be called \u201cconversation\u201d, if the definition was stretched. In one way or another, each one was arrayed in costume: Crow had donned a black greatcoat, specially made of course, accompanied by a red sash and a matching high-peaked hat with a silver eagle pin on the front. Bright was in the body of an adult male orangutan. Gears was still wearing his lab coat, but someone had placed a floppy, oversized wizard\u2019s hat on his head and he had yet to take it off.\n\n\n\nThe Site 19 D-class cafeteria had been converted into the main party center, and the effort was admirable. There was a considerable amount of black and orange streamers hanging from the ceiling, along with dozens of jack o\u2019 lanterns which sat grinning on the long metal tables. Of course, there was also the general mishmash of fake spiders, bugs, skeletons, bats, ghosts, neat glow-in-the-dark doohickeys, a fog machine, and a sound system currently running through volume two of \u201cHalloween\u2019s Best Hits\u201d. The cafeteria line was laden with a sizeable assortment of foods, mostly sugary and very little otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0The crowd was still small, consisting mostly of those in charge of the party. The night was still young, and most staff members were still spelunking their way through the haunted house.\n\n\n\nThe haunted house was, easily, the crown jewel of the event. All five floors of the adjacent D-class barracks had been cleared out and converted into a maze of terror, ending in the cafeteria. While some in the Foundation would question the wisdom or point in making a haunted house, the fact that the senior staff was in charge was usually enough to strike an appropriate level of fear in the average staff member.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, what went on within was classified.\n\n\n\nClef stepped out of the shadows right next to Crow, Gears and Bright, wasting no time in helping himself to a plate of pumpkin cookies and a cup of red punch. He was dressed in a sharp tuxedo, with a pair of plastic devil horns and a Guy Fawkes mask.\n\n\n\n\u201cRights, you\u2019re up.\u201d He nodded to the approaching doctor, who was plastered with zombie makeup and had a very large and relatively convincing meat cleaver stuck in her head. \u201cYou should probably tell Doctor Glass that his office will be pretty busy come tomorrow. And word from Ghost at the front says that Dr. King just entered the maze. Get the apple seeds ready.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on it.

Chances are, he\u2019d never know what it really was.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been released from cryogenic incarceration,\u201d said Lore, handing the naked doctor a towel. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOld problem or new?\u201d asked Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cOld.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c239 or 343?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c239.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout time they killed the little brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s not so little anymore,\u201d Lore said, passing the file to Clef.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cYou just keep reality benders around, Dr. Gears? That seems a little foolish, even by the Foundation\u2019s standards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can assure you, she is completely under our control, Commandant Schmetterling,\u201d replied the shorter, bald man.</p>\n<p>Schmetterling appeared unconvinced by Gears' assurances. Gears knew that the Coalition officer was not the happiest envoy the Foundation had ever received, especially not since he was informed of 239\u2019s continued existence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe thought your operatives had subdued her,\u201d said Schmetterling, irritably. \u201cWe knew you killed the other one. We saw it from one of our observatories. I was under the impression that this one was also eliminated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d said Gears, evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Schmetterling, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to let my superiors know that the Foundation has still yet to come to its senses.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef tied the robe around his midsection, not bothering to attempt to hide the erection he\u2019d sported since he woke up and saw Lore.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere to now, Sugartits?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m to take you to be briefed, Dr. Clef. You\u2019ll be meeting with the current head of 239\u2019s project.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKarrington?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Karrington was killed by 239-X in the 2017 attempt. It\u2019s all in the report.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef shrugged and looked around him. For five stories up, elongated tubes of glass and cryogenics held the Foundation\u2019s prisoners. When he\u2019d been imprisoned, the facility had been a third this size, newly implemented for cost purposes. When the O5\u2019s found out it was cheaper to freeze them than feed them, dozens of prisoners were transported here.</p>\n<p>Clef stopped short, suddenly looking at the familiar faces behind the glassy ice. There was Imants, a slight smirk passing over his pale face, as if he'd just heard a joke that only he had understood. Next to him was Glass, sporting a look of shocked surprise.</p>\n<p>Clef turned to Lore. \u201cWhat sort of look did I have on while I was frozen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looked horny,\u201d said Lore impassively. Clef smiled and turned back to the tubes.</p>\n<p>The next one was no surprise. Clef was shocked that he himself had been 'contained' before Kondraki, one of the earliest results of the Foundation's changing ambitions. The face of his sometimes friend was twisted with rage, open in a still silent scream, eyes narrowed with anger and disbelief. Next to him, frozen alongside his static form in the clear, perfect ice, a few butterflies remained, still shimmering. Clef raised his hand and placed it on the unit.</p>\n<p>A few seconds later, he removed it and smiled. \u201cYou always were a son of a bitch, Kondraki.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned back to Lore. \u201cYou bastards have anyone else I know in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d said Lore. \u201cMostly a few witnesses who were immune to Class-A\u2019s. One or two trespassers, some of Dr. Bright\u2019s other selves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJack\u2019s still around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Lore. She was lying again, Clef knew. He always knew.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef sat across the table from the short, dowdy woman in the white lab coat. She had been scowling at him since he walked into the room. Clef, for his part, wasn\u2019t paying attention. He\u2019d sat with the robe at its most revealing, reading the file he\u2019d been given as slowly as he possibly could. Once or twice, he looked up at the woman, smiled, and returned his attention to the file.</p>\n<p>After a while, he stopped, laid the file down and looked at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all complete fucking morons?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said the woman, whose name Clef hadn\u2019t even bothered to learn.</p>\n<p>\u201cPsychological tricks? Crushing force? Stabbing her with a knife? Shooting her with a gun? Where the hell are the backup plans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEach test was approved by a majority of the O5 command and I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d asked Clef suddenly, dangerously.</p>\n<p>The woman didn\u2019t reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. I\u2019ve completed, either alone or with some aid, the disposal of more than fourteen reality shifters for the Foundation alone. More than fourteen confirmed kills. I can\u2019t say more than that, because no one will tell me what\u2019s still classified, but I\u2019m sure that even with what I must assume is your piteously low security clearance, you were allowed to read at least <em>some</em> of my exploits?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019ve read the termination reports for several of the SCP\u2019s you were inv\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you pay attention?\u201d interrupted Clef again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you <em>pay attention</em> to a single, goddamned thing I wrote in them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. The methods you used have been tested and found lacking for our purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose \u2018methods,\u2019 as you call them, are merely scaffolding. You have to build on the scaffolding for it to hold up anything. Did you all just freeze everyone who was worth a damn around here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman shifted uncomfortably in her seat, not looking at Clef. \u201cThen what do you propose, Doctor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSimple,\u201d smiled Clef grimly. \u201cSince her subconscious defenses have been refined so far\u2026 I\u2019m going to wake her up.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re waking her <em>up</em>?\u201d yelled Schmetterling, turning suddenly and looking through the ten inches of transparent steel, as if the figure on the other side might have heard him. He dropped his voice, but his anger remained. \u201cAre you all <em>insane</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d replied Gears. \u201cWe have our best operative on the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d snapped Schmetterling. \u201cWho the hell do you think is capable of removing a Type Green that you\u2019ve allowed to progress this far?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Clef,\u201d replied Gears. \u201cWe\u2019ve released him from confinement for this task.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClef?\u201d asked Schmetterling. \u201cAlto Clef?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know any other Clefs, Commandant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d the representative replied, looking back through the steel at the sleeping form. Gears made a mental note to check in Schmetterling's claim, and then moved to stand next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear, Commandant,\u201d replied Gears. \u201cThe situation is well in hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Schmetterling\u2019s jowls quivered as he turned back to Gears. \u201cSo you say, Doctor. Tell me. Aren\u2019t you worried about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Gears, his expression unchanging, his voice perfectly, almost supernaturally level.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Clef is to be given access to any materials he currently requires. All personnel are to assist Dr. Clef by any and all non-carnal means. However, Dr. Clef is not to be informed of the continued existence of any personnel involved in his capture. Dr. Lore is designated as go-between for Clef and any wishing to contact him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef walked into the Victorian styled study and smiled at the fragrance of pipe smoke and old books. The old man was seated in high-backed chair with a hardbound copy of <em>Don Quixote</em> open in his lap. The old man looked up and started with surprise before smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor Clef!\u201d he exclaimed, his grin widening until the wrinkles of his face became subsumed by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, 343.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh please,\u201d said the old man, waving away the designation. \u201cNo numbers between friends. Sit. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef knew the chair would be there before he even bent his knees. He settled into a comfortable, overstuffed chair and looked at the elderly gentleman.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe both know what you are,\u201d said Clef, as seriously as he could. \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything about you, not to anyone, nor recommended your termination, mainly because you stayed at Level 3 and never posed a significant threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>The old man continued to smile happily.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember me from the G.O.C., then? Geneva? 1989?\u201d</p>\n<p>The old man nodded, not quite as happily as before.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you remember that you owe me a favor?\u201d</p>\n<p>The aged gentleman\u2019s smile faded slightly. \u201cYes, Doctor. I remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to collect. There\u2019s another Type Green. This one has progressed to Level 4.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very old now, Doctor. I\u2019m not sure how useful I can be. Sometimes, I look for books, but I can\u2019t remember their names. And they\u2019re just not there anymore. Just the other day, a young man came in here to ask me about\u2026 about something. And I forgot he was here. And then he wasn\u2019t. Just gone, and I can\u2019t remember him. No one wants to say anything\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Tears formed at the corners of 343\u2019s crinkled eyes. Clef almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Until he remembered Geneva.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour aid will be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a man of honor, Doctor. I will do whatever you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef stood to leave. The hard part was over.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef sat at the table, going over his plans once again. SCP-343 would be located in the middle of the fallout zone. Clef himself would be the bait. 239 should remember him, and once awake, her subconscious defenses would be significantly weaker. That <em>should</em> allow him to\u2014</p>\n<p>Clef heard the door open and looked up as Schmetterling entered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would ever be released, Doctor Clef,\u201d said Schmetterling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised you don\u2019t recognize me,\u201d replied Schmetterling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef merely shrugged. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly to give you something. A reward, for your service to the G.O.C.\u201d</p>\n<p>Schmetterling reached toward his pocket, but stopped as the shotgun suddenly became leveled cleanly at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe outline of your pocket looks like a gun,\u201d replied Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>is</em> a gun,\u201d said Schmetterling. He reached into his pocket, and slowly pulled out the purple revolver. He turned it slightly\u2015handle first\u2015and passed it to the other man.</p>\n<p>Clef smiled. \u201cThis used to be one of ours, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Atomic Revolver. Reported lost by your Foundation several years ago. We found it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you had nothing to do with the original disappearance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe G.O.C.? Of course not,\u201d said Schmetterling.</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't asking about the G.O.C.,\" replied Clef.</p>\n<p>Schmetterling merely shrugged.</p>\n<p>\"It was good to see you again, Doctor Clef. I wish you the best of luck.\"</p>\n<p>Clef nodded, watching the other man\u2019s back as he left the room. He quickly picked up the purple revolver and slid it into his pocket.</p>\n<p>Lore walked in carrying two drinks and set them down between Clef and herself. \u201cWhat\u2019d the Commandant want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo talk about old times,\u201d replied Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never mentioned that he\u2019d worked with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Clef.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef shut the safe, taking the small box carefully in his hands. He smiled. His trump card was ready, and everyone would soon be in place. He still had no idea what exactly he was going to be walking into, but he owed the Foundation this one.</p>\n<p>He shivered, remembering the coldness of his preemptive coffin, and cracked his knuckles.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think this will work?\u201d asked Lore.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt should. She shouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it from the other side.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mirror was slowly raised into place by the workmen as Clef palmed the jasper colored disk back and forth in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen break the mirror before I get back.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef looked at Gears, examining the shorter man briefly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Clef. You are looking well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGears. You look old as shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears merely handed the keycard to Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will get you all the way through the designated path. You\u2019ll find the telekill body armor in the observation room, as well as the equipment you requested. Good luck, Dr. Clef.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that all, Gears?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPardon, Dr. Clef?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou locked me in a frozen hell for eleven years, and I don\u2019t even get an apology?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were trying to kill our colleague, Dr. Clef. I was ordered to assist in your capture.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef grimaced at Gears and turned to walk into the Observation Room.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlto?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef stopped. \u201cWhat, Gears?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was\u2026 a regrettable set of circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The chamber was quiet, except for the quiet hum of a dozen computers. This was the core of the facility, where everything was stored. Dozens of firewalls, hundreds of security protocols. All of them bypassed.</p>\n<p>The man at the control panel typed for a few moments, laughed, and typed again. He walked over to the nearest set of panels, pulled out two of them, and slid the archival system into place.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef watched Gears walk away, heading to the last of the evacuation choppers. Site 19 was now abandoned, mostly. Those handful remaining were either vital to Clef\u2019s plans or wouldn\u2019t interfere with it.</p>\n<p>He waited for perhaps fifteen minutes, looking through the steel at 239\u2019s sleeping form. She was a young woman now, mature. And thanks to years of wrongfully committed attempts, particularly hard to kill. He watched her, watched the fading phantasms of her id flicker about the room, scratching at the telekill walls.</p>\n<p>He turned and picked up the thin helmet, strapping it to his head. The body armor was a little bulkier than he\u2019d anticipated, but it fit well enough. He pulled on the gloves, fingered the purple gun underneath his jacket, and felt through his pockets until he found the tiny box containing his emergency backup.</p>\n<p>He grinned and picked up the keycard Gears had given him. Sliding it into a control panel in front of the glass, he flipped the switches all down into their off position and pulled out the revolver, bringing it up to point at the slowly rousing reality shifter.</p>\n<p>The hammer fell, and a loud crack echoed through the room as the steel bent and shattered inward.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef was running very quickly. He could feel her back there, floating somewhere. He risked a glance backward, watching the floors buckle into water and piss, dirt and air. He hoped she would be off-balance enough from the medications that she would be less capable, less able to affect the environmental changes on the universe.</p>\n<p>He was pretty sure it was a pointless hope, now.</p>\n<p>He rounded the corner as the walls slid into chunks of burning babies, the smell of human flesh turning his stomach slightly, then making it growl uncomfortably. One more turn, and he\u2019d be at ground zero.</p>\n<p>Another ten feet, nine, eight, seven\u2026</p>\n<p>He burst through the doors, looking expectantly for 343 to be standing in position.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Lore was waiting next to the large mirror as Clef pounded through the double doors panting. He looked at her, incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck are you still doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys never work alone, right? I\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone!\u201d screamed Clef, as the doors behind him became a series of kittens with Barbie Doll arms sticking out of their eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s 343?!\u201d</p>\n<p>The doors opened slowly.</p>\n<p>The being floating through them didn\u2019t look like it was now or had ever been a little girl. Years of atrophy had turned her limbs into spindly wires of flesh wrapped around bone. She wasn\u2019t able to lift them, or even to turn her head. The tubes that had hung out of her arms were now crawling over her body like centipedes. The wall of kittens began to mewl, plaintively.</p>\n<p>She opened her mouth, trying to say something, but only a gurgle came out. She looked at Clef and gurgled again, louder, angrily. Her bowels began to empty black, blood smelling feces onto the floor, which in turn morphed into coals, and began to spread out slowly, burningly. Clef was preparing to make a mad dash when the floor\u2019s progression slowed and stopped. He blinked twice and looked around the room.</p>\n<p>343 was standing just behind Lore, his face knit in concentration. The old man\u2019s nose had a drop of blood forming from the left nostril, slowly running down over the crest of his lip, and dropping to his shirt.</p>\n<p>343 flinched. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something, Doctor\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef raised the gun again, and clicking the hammer back, let it fall.</p>\n<p>The gun popped slightly, bars of energetic power running over its metal surface.</p>\n<p>\u201cFUCK!\u201d screamed Clef. \u201cA goddamned recharge rate?!\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl screamed in rage, and 343 cried out, staggered by the changes she was forcing into the world. The drugs in her system were quickly dissipating, her control over the world around her returning.</p>\n<p>Clef grabbed Lore and pushed her hard, leaving her tottering toward the far wall of the wide room as he madly dashed for the opposite side.</p>\n<p>The floating woman turned the air into chlorine for a moment, just a moment, before 343 could stop her. A child in an adult body, broken and beaten over the course of a decade, lashing out with her shattered mind. The older SCP was kneeling on the floor, ears bleeding. His knotted hands were clenched, as his foe turned for the moment from Clef to float toward him.</p>\n<p>It was almost beautiful to watch, Clef thought, stopping for an instant to observe what he hoped was a rare circumstance. The distance between them crackled as the hovering female changed things, reversing the laws of physics and existence as 343 set them back into place. It was like watching a petulant child throwing her toys to the floor and her patient grandfather picking them up and setting them right.</p>\n<p>Clef edged around near the now dead kitten door, raising the revolver again. He fired, the painful report running up his arm as chunks of the hovering menace were ripped from her body and thrown behind her to the mirror. She screamed as the cancers started to form almost instantly under her flesh.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care much for that, do you little girl?\u201d shouted Clef, as 343 suddenly locked the universal order back into place.</p>\n<p>Clef dropped the gun and bull rushed her before she could recover, hitting her tiny midsection sharply and pushing her toward the mirror, grasping the red disk and shoving.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They fell into a strange field, with rolling wheat and smells of emptiness. The girl was rolling on the ground, willing herself up off the ground pitifully. Clef stood nearby, knocking the bits of wheat and grass off his armor. He walked over and forced her body over, straddling her small, heaving chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, dearie,\u201d he said, smirking. \u201cDifferent world, different rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>He placed both his hands around her neck and brought his thumbs up to her trachea. Tears ran down her face, her quivering lips pleading wordlessly with him to reconsider. As the brittle, malnourished bones snapped, her eyes thankfully glossed in the pleasant emptiness of oblivion.</p>\n<p>Clef stood and walked back toward the mirror. \"Should have done that years ago\u2026\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef stepped back through the mirror, unlocking the telekill body gear he was wearing and dropping it to the floor. 343 leaned against the wall nearby, being tended to by Lore. Clef watched as she dabbed the blood away from the old man\u2019s eyes before he cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>Lore looked up, smiled, and ran to the edge of the mirror.</p>\n<p>\u201c239\u2019s status?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEliminated,\u201d said Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Lore. She brought the gun only as far as Clef\u2019s midsection before she fired.</p>\n<p>Clef felt parts of him tear out of his back and staggered backward to the frame of the mirror. He looked up at Lore, the smiling face holding the violet pistol, feeling a tugging sense of recognition.</p>\n<p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lore smiled, eyes twinkling with mischief. \u201cWell, of course, Alto. Who else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef was sagging now, his legs giving out as the internal and external bleeding set in.</p>\n<p>Dr. Bright jiggled happily as she sneered down at the bleeding, middle-aged man laying on the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t take kindly to people who try to kill me, Clef, regardless of the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Really, Jack? But they were very good circumstances. Not even friends?\" asked Clef. \"What's a little murder between friends?\"</p>\n<p>\"Especially not friends.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, Jack,\u201d said Clef, throwing up parts of his stomach. \u201cYou look good enough to fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef rolled over, struggling to stand up. Bright let him, if for no other reason than it made the blood pour out of his gaping body that much faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou forgot one thing though, Jack,\u201d said Clef, feeling his muscles twitching around the cancers forming in his midsection.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Alto?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're jewellery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef stood in front of the mirror, smiling bloodily as he held SCP-963 at arm\u2019s length in his gloved hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Jack.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Clef lurched back through the mirror, Bright brought the pistol up a second time, pulling the trigger. The gun popped, electrical arcs running up and down its length. Bright screamed and rushed toward the mirror, but as she did, a loud shot\u2015gunpowder and copper\u2015echoed through the room, striking the disk hovering in the center of the glass. As Bright reached the mirror, she saw the disk chip, ever so slightly, and cease glowing.</p>\n<p>She whirled around, looking for the source of the shot, raising the pistol over her head in rage. She found no one.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The room was cold as Schmetterling walked down the hall, shouldering the sniper rifle. It had been a while since he\u2019d done any shooting, and he was proud that he still had the touch. He walked methodically toward the frozen tube, entered the old password they hadn\u2019t thought to delete, and smiled boldly as Imants fell bodily to the floor.</p>\n<p>He leaned down and slapped his face a few times. \u201cImants. IMANTS!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoza?\u201d</p>\n<p>Schmetterling sighed and picked up the larger man, resting him on his shoulder. He left the rifle behind and picked up the data backup, stashing it in his pocket. As he passed Dr. Kondraki\u2019s tube, he stopped, looking at the frozen visage.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to need all of you to help cover our escape.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tube shimmered as the butterflies flapped away from the empty containment chamber, floating around Schmetterling and his rescued friend for a moment before both of them vanished.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Jack Bright sat in the director\u2019s office, tapping her polished nails on the desk. This would be a set back. The amount of time needed to repair SCP-093 was unknown, if it could be repaired at all, and the disappearance of Kondraki from containment was highly unsettling.</p>\n<p>Bright stood and walked to the far wall, entering the long and complex code that was required for someone without stable voice recognition or handprint.</p>\n<p>The door slid open, revealing a carefully crafted box. She opened it, revealing the almost circle with the three, inward pointing arrows.</p>\n<p>\u2018Only a set back, Alto,\u2019 thought Jack. \u2018Only a set back.\u2019</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Alto Clef sat breathing heavily in a field of wheat and emptiness. He could feel the effects of having a Higgs boson thrown through his midsection, knew he didn\u2019t have too much longer to live, and that what time he did have would be unpleasant. If he\u2019d still had a gun, he might have shot himself, but since he didn\u2019t\u2026</p>\n<p>Clef looked at the amulet. Tilting his head back, he positioned it perfectly over his mouth, and dropped it down his throat, thinking in his last moments how much nicer oblivion would be than the perpetual, eternally cold dreams.</p>\n<p>And somewhere, somewhere on the other side of our world's mirrors, a cancer ridden, bleeding body shuts down\u2015and reawakens screaming.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a href=\"/unfinished-business-ii\">Unfinished Business II</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/unfinished-business\">Unfinished Business</a>\" by TroyL, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

used to keep her comatose.\u00a0\u00a0This could easily result in her reawakening.\u00a0\u00a0Since Dr. Clef\u2019s nearly successful attempt in 2008, all attempts at termination have failed.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-239 has resisted all practical methods of attack subconsciously, and all other methods of destroying reality shifters suggested by the G.O.C. envoy have proved fruitless.\u00a0\u00a0I am now forced to request the O5 for the immediate release of Dr. Alto Clef from his current confinement and his immediate assignment to this case.\n\n> \n\n> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t//Dr. Jack Bright//\n\n> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t//Foundation Director//\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s eyes opened slowly, and then shut immediately as the bleary light blinded him.\u00a0\u00a0He felt cold and naked, his flesh crawling with barely remembered frostbite and a decade of immobility.\u00a0\u00a0Was he awake, now?\u00a0\u00a0Was this another of the cold dreams?\n\n\n\nHe felt a hand on his wrist\u2014warm, soft, female flesh.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes opened again, and he blinked hard, staring directly at the large, perky breasts.\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Clef?\u201d\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s eyes never left her chest.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou have me at a disadvantage, Miss\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman adjusted her top.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Lore.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe watched her fumbling modestly.\u00a0\u00a0She was lying, he knew.\u00a0\u00a0That was not her name.\u00a0\u00a0Chances are, he\u2019d never know what it really was.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Clef.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been released from cryogenic incarceration,\u201d said Lore, handing the naked doctor a towel.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe need your help.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOld problem or new?\u201d asked Clef.\n\n\n\n\u201cOld.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c239 or 343?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c239.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout time they killed the little brat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not so little anymore,\u201d Lore said, passing the file to Clef.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\u201cYou just keep reality benders around, Dr. Gears?\u00a0\u00a0That seems a little foolish, even by the Foundation\u2019s standards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can assure you, she is completely under our control, Commandant Schmetterling,\u201d replied the shorter, bald man.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSchmetterling appeared unconvinced by Gears' assurances.\u00a0\u00a0Gears knew that the Coalition officer was not the happiest envoy the Foundation had ever received, especially not since he was informed of 239\u2019s continued existence.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thought your operatives had subdued her,\u201d said Schmetterling, irritably.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe knew you killed the other one.\u00a0\u00a0We saw it from one of our observatories.\u00a0\u00a0I was under the impression that this one was also eliminated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d said Gears, evenly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Schmetterling, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to let my superiors know that the Foundation has still yet to come to its senses.\u201d\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef tied the robe around his midsection, not bothering to attempt to hide the erection he\u2019d sported since he woke up and saw Lore.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere to now, Sugartits?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m to take you to be briefed, Dr. Clef.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ll be meeting with the current head of 239\u2019s project.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cKarrington?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Karrington was killed by 239-X in the 2017 attempt.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s all in the report.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef shrugged and looked around him.\u00a0\u00a0For five stories up, elongated tubes of glass and cryogenics held the Foundation\u2019s prisoners.\u00a0\u00a0When he\u2019d been imprisoned, the facility had been a third this size, newly implemented for cost purposes.\u00a0\u00a0When the O5\u2019s found out it was cheaper to freeze them than feed them, dozens of prisoners were transported here.\n\n\n\nClef stopped short, suddenly looking at the familiar faces behind the glassy ice.\u00a0\u00a0There was Imants, a slight smirk passing over his pale face, as if he'd just heard a joke that only he had understood.\u00a0\u00a0Next to him was Glass, sporting a look of shocked surprise.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nClef turned to Lore.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat sort of look did I have on while I was frozen?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou looked horny,\u201d said Lore impassively.\u00a0\u00a0Clef smiled and turned back to the tubes.\n\n\n\nThe next one was no surprise.\u00a0\u00a0Clef was shocked that he himself had been 'contained' before Kondraki, one of the earliest results of the Foundation's changing ambitions.\u00a0\u00a0The face of his sometimes friend was twisted with rage, open in a still silent scream, eyes narrowed with anger and disbelief.\u00a0\u00a0Next to him, frozen alongside his static form in the clear, perfect ice, a few butterflies remained, still shimmering.\u00a0\u00a0Clef raised his hand and placed it on the unit.\n\n\n\nA few seconds later, he removed it and smiled.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou always were a son of a bitch, Kondraki.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe turned back to Lore.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou bastards have anyone else I know in here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Lore.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMostly a few witnesses who were immune to Class-A\u2019s.\u00a0\u00a0One or two trespassers, some of Dr. Bright\u2019s other selves.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJack\u2019s still around?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lore.\u00a0\u00a0She was lying again, Clef knew.\u00a0\u00a0He always knew.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef sat across the table from the short, dowdy woman in the white lab coat.\u00a0\u00a0She had been scowling at him since he walked into the room.\u00a0\u00a0Clef, for his part, wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019d sat with the robe at its most revealing, reading the file he\u2019d been given as slowly as he possibly could.\u00a0\u00a0Once or twice, he looked up at the woman, smiled, and returned his attention to the file.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, he stopped, laid the file down and looked at her.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you all complete fucking morons?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said the woman, whose name Clef hadn\u2019t even bothered to learn.\n\n\n\n\u201cPsychological tricks?\u00a0\u00a0Crushing force?\u00a0\u00a0Stabbing her with a knife?\u00a0\u00a0Shooting her with a gun?\u00a0\u00a0Where the hell are the backup plans?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEach test was approved by a majority of the O5 command and I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d asked Clef suddenly, dangerously.\n\n\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t reply.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve completed, either alone or with some aid, the disposal of more than fourteen reality shifters for the Foundation alone.\u00a0\u00a0More than fourteen confirmed kills.\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t say more than that, because no one will tell me what\u2019s still classified, but I\u2019m sure that even with what I must assume is your piteously low security clearance, you were allowed to read at least //some// of my exploits?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve read the termination reports for several of the SCP\u2019s you were inv\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you pay attention?\u201d interrupted Clef again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you //pay attention// to a single, goddamned thing I wrote in them?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u00a0\u00a0The methods you used have been tested and found lacking for our purposes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThose \u2018methods,\u2019 as you call them, are merely scaffolding.\u00a0\u00a0You have to build on the scaffolding for it to hold up anything.\u00a0\u00a0Did you all just freeze everyone who was worth a damn around here?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman shifted uncomfortably in her seat, not looking at Clef.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen what do you propose, Doctor?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSimple,\u201d smiled Clef grimly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSince her subconscious defenses have been refined so far... I\u2019m going to wake her up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re waking her //up//?\u201d yelled Schmetterling, turning suddenly and looking through the ten inches of transparent steel, as if the figure on the other side might have heard him.\u00a0\u00a0He dropped his voice, but his anger remained.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre you all //insane//?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Gears.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have our best operative on the case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d snapped Schmetterling.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho the hell do you think is capable of removing a Type Green that you\u2019ve allowed to progress this far?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Clef,\u201d replied Gears. \u201cWe\u2019ve released him from confinement for this task.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cClef?\u201d asked Schmetterling.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlto Clef?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know any other Clefs, Commandant?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d the representative replied, looking back through the steel at the sleeping form.\u00a0\u00a0Gears made a mental note to check in Schmetterling's claim, and then moved to stand next to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear, Commandant,\u201d replied Gears.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe situation is well in hand.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchmetterling\u2019s jowls quivered as he turned back to Gears.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo you say, Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Tell me.\u00a0\u00a0Aren\u2019t you worried about this?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Gears, his expression unchanging, his voice perfectly, almost supernaturally level.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n> Dr. Clef is to be given access to any materials he currently requires.\u00a0\u00a0All personnel are to assist Dr. Clef by any and all non-carnal means.\u00a0\u00a0However, Dr. Clef is not to be informed of the continued existence of any personnel involved in his capture.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Lore is designated as go-between for Clef and any wishing to contact him.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef walked into the Victorian styled study and smiled at the fragrance of pipe smoke and old books.\u00a0\u00a0The old man was seated in high-backed chair with a hardbound copy of //Don Quixote// open in his lap.\u00a0\u00a0The old man looked up and started with surprise before smiling.\n\n\n\n\u201cDoctor Clef!\u201d he exclaimed, his grin widening until the wrinkles of his face became subsumed by it.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello, 343.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh please,\u201d said the old man, waving away the designation.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo numbers between friends.\u00a0\u00a0Sit.\u00a0\u00a0Please.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef knew the chair would be there before he even bent his knees.\u00a0\u00a0He settled into a comfortable, overstuffed chair and looked at the elderly gentleman.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWe both know what you are,\u201d said Clef, as seriously as he could.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never said anything about you, not to anyone, nor recommended your termination, mainly because you stayed at Level 3 and never posed a significant threat.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe old man continued to smile happily.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou remember me from the G.O.C., then?\u00a0\u00a0Geneva?\u00a0\u00a01989?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe old man nodded, not quite as happily as before.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you remember that you owe me a favor?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe aged gentleman\u2019s smile faded slightly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes, Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I remember.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to collect.\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s another Type Green.\u00a0\u00a0This one has progressed to Level 4.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very old now, Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m not sure how useful I can be.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, I look for books, but I can\u2019t remember their names.\u00a0\u00a0And they\u2019re just not there anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Just the other day, a young man came in here to ask me about\u2026 about something.\u00a0\u00a0And I forgot he was here.\u00a0\u00a0And then he wasn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0Just gone, and I can\u2019t remember him.\u00a0\u00a0No one wants to say anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nTears formed at the corners of 343\u2019s crinkled eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Clef almost felt sorry for him.\u00a0\u00a0Almost.\u00a0\u00a0Until he remembered Geneva.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour aid will be necessary.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am a man of honor, Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I will do whatever you need.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef stood to leave.\u00a0\u00a0The hard part was over.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef sat at the table, going over his plans once again.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-343 would be located in the middle of the fallout zone.\u00a0\u00a0Clef himself would be the bait.\u00a0\u00a0239 should remember him, and once awake, her subconscious defenses would be significantly weaker.\u00a0\u00a0That //should// allow him to\u2014\n\n\n\nClef heard the door open and looked up as Schmetterling entered.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would ever be released, Doctor Clef,\u201d said Schmetterling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised you don\u2019t recognize me,\u201d replied Schmetterling.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef merely shrugged.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly to give you something. A reward, for your service to the G.O.C.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSchmetterling reached toward his pocket, but stopped as the shotgun suddenly became leveled cleanly at his face.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe outline of your pocket looks like a gun,\u201d replied Clef.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt //is// a gun,\u201d said Schmetterling. He reached into his pocket, and slowly pulled out the purple revolver.\u00a0\u00a0He turned it slightly\u2015handle first\u2015and passed it to the other man.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nClef smiled.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis used to be one of ours, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Atomic Revolver.\u00a0\u00a0Reported lost by your Foundation several years ago.\u00a0\u00a0We found it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you had nothing to do with the original disappearance?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe G.O.C.?\u00a0\u00a0Of course not,\u201d said Schmetterling.\n\n\n\n\"I wasn't asking about the G.O.C.,\" replied Clef.\n\n\n\nSchmetterling merely shrugged.\n\n\n\n\"It was good to see you again, Doctor Clef.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best of luck.\"\n\n\n\nClef nodded, watching the other man\u2019s back as he left the room.\u00a0\u00a0He quickly picked up the purple revolver and slid it into his pocket.\n\n\n\nLore walked in carrying two drinks and set them down between Clef and herself.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019d the Commandant want?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTo talk about old times,\u201d replied Clef.\n\n\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe never mentioned that he\u2019d worked with you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Clef.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef shut the safe, taking the small box carefully in his hands.\u00a0\u00a0He smiled.\u00a0\u00a0His trump card was ready, and everyone would soon be in place.\u00a0\u00a0He still had no idea what exactly he was going to be walking into, but he owed the Foundation this one.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe shivered, remembering the coldness of his preemptive coffin, and cracked his knuckles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you really think this will work?\u201d asked Lore.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt should.\u00a0\u00a0She shouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it from the other side.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe mirror was slowly raised into place by the workmen as Clef palmed the jasper colored disk back and forth in his hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen break the mirror before I get back.\u201d\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef looked at Gears, examining the shorter man briefly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Clef.\u00a0\u00a0You are looking well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGears.\u00a0\u00a0You look old as shit.\u201d\n\n\n\nGears merely handed the keycard to Clef.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis will get you all the way through the designated path.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ll find the telekill body armor in the observation room, as well as the equipment you requested.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, Dr. Clef.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs that all, Gears?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPardon, Dr. Clef?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou locked me in a frozen hell for eleven years, and I don\u2019t even get an apology?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou were trying to kill our colleague, Dr. Clef.\u00a0\u00a0I was ordered to assist in your capture.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef grimaced at Gears and turned to walk into the Observation Room.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlto?\u201d\n\n\n\nClef stopped.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat, Gears?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was\u2026 a regrettable set of circumstances.\u201d\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nThe chamber was quiet, except for the quiet hum of a dozen computers.\u00a0\u00a0This was the core of the facility, where everything was stored.\u00a0\u00a0Dozens of firewalls, hundreds of security protocols.\u00a0\u00a0All of them bypassed.\n\n\n\nThe man at the control panel typed for a few moments, laughed, and typed again.\u00a0\u00a0He walked over to the nearest set of panels, pulled out two of them, and slid the archival system into place.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef watched Gears walk away, heading to the last of the evacuation choppers.\u00a0\u00a0Site 19 was now abandoned, mostly.\u00a0\u00a0Those handful remaining were either vital to Clef\u2019s plans or wouldn\u2019t interfere with it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe waited for perhaps fifteen minutes, looking through the steel at 239\u2019s sleeping form.\u00a0\u00a0She was a young woman now, mature.\u00a0\u00a0And thanks to years of wrongfully committed attempts, particularly hard to kill.\u00a0\u00a0He watched her, watched the fading phantasms of her id flicker about the room, scratching at the telekill walls. \n\n\n\nHe turned and picked up the thin helmet, strapping it to his head.\u00a0\u00a0The body armor was a little bulkier than he\u2019d anticipated, but it fit well enough.\u00a0\u00a0He pulled on the gloves, fingered the purple gun underneath his jacket, and felt through his pockets until he found the tiny box containing his emergency backup.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe grinned and picked up the keycard Gears had given him.\u00a0\u00a0Sliding it into a control panel in front of the glass, he flipped the switches all down into their off position and pulled out the revolver, bringing it up to point at the slowly rousing reality shifter.\n\n\n\nThe hammer fell, and a loud crack echoed through the room as the steel bent and shattered inward.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef was running very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0He could feel her back there, floating somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0He risked a glance backward, watching the floors buckle into water and piss, dirt and air.\u00a0\u00a0He hoped she would be off-balance enough from the medications that she would be less capable, less able to affect the environmental changes on the universe.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe was pretty sure it was a pointless hope, now.\n\n\n\nHe rounded the corner as the walls slid into chunks of burning babies, the smell of human flesh turning his stomach slightly, then making it growl uncomfortably.\u00a0\u00a0One more turn, and he\u2019d be at ground zero.\n\n\n\nAnother ten feet, nine, eight, seven\u2026\n\n\n\nHe burst through the doors, looking expectantly for 343 to be standing in position.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nLore was waiting next to the large mirror as Clef pounded through the double doors panting.\u00a0\u00a0He looked at her, incredulous.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fuck are you still doing here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou guys never work alone, right?\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not alone!\u201d screamed Clef, as the doors behind him became a series of kittens with Barbie Doll arms sticking out of their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s 343?!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe doors opened slowly. \n\n\n\nThe being floating through them didn\u2019t look like it was now or had ever been a little girl.\u00a0\u00a0Years of atrophy had turned her limbs into spindly wires of flesh wrapped around bone.\u00a0\u00a0She wasn\u2019t able to lift them, or even to turn her head.\u00a0\u00a0The tubes that had hung out of her arms were now crawling over her body like centipedes.\u00a0\u00a0The wall of kittens began to mewl, plaintively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe opened her mouth, trying to say something, but only a gurgle came out.\u00a0\u00a0She looked at Clef and gurgled again, louder, angrily.\u00a0\u00a0Her bowels began to empty black, blood smelling feces onto the floor, which in turn morphed into coals, and began to spread out slowly, burningly.\u00a0\u00a0Clef was preparing to make a mad dash when the floor\u2019s progression slowed and stopped.\u00a0\u00a0He blinked twice and looked around the room.\n\n\n\n343 was standing just behind Lore, his face knit in concentration.\u00a0\u00a0The old man\u2019s nose had a drop of blood forming from the left nostril, slowly running down over the crest of his lip, and dropping to his shirt.\n\n\n\n343 flinched.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something, Doctor\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nClef raised the gun again, and clicking the hammer back, let it fall.\n\n\n\nThe gun popped slightly, bars of energetic power running over its metal surface.\n\n\n\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d screamed Clef.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA goddamned recharge rate?!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe girl screamed in rage, and 343 cried out, staggered by the changes she was forcing into the world.\u00a0\u00a0The drugs in her system were quickly dissipating, her control over the world around her returning.\n\n\n\nClef grabbed Lore and pushed her hard, leaving her tottering toward the far wall of the wide room as he madly dashed for the opposite side.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe floating woman turned the air into chlorine for a moment, just a moment, before 343 could stop her.\u00a0\u00a0A child in an adult body, broken and beaten over the course of a decade, lashing out with her shattered mind.\u00a0\u00a0The older SCP was kneeling on the floor, ears bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0His knotted hands were clenched, as his foe turned for the moment from Clef to float toward him.\n\n\n\nIt was almost beautiful to watch, Clef thought, stopping for an instant to observe what he hoped was a rare circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0The distance between them crackled as the hovering female changed things, reversing the laws of physics and existence as 343 set them back into place.\u00a0\u00a0It was like watching a petulant child throwing her toys to the floor and her patient grandfather picking them up and setting them right.\n\n\n\nClef edged around near the now dead kitten door, raising the revolver again.\u00a0\u00a0He fired, the painful report running up his arm as chunks of the hovering menace were ripped from her body and thrown behind her to the mirror.\u00a0\u00a0She screamed as the cancers started to form almost instantly under her flesh.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t care much for that, do you little girl?\u201d shouted Clef, as 343 suddenly locked the universal order back into place.\n\n\n\nClef dropped the gun and bull rushed her before she could recover, hitting her tiny midsection sharply and pushing her toward the mirror, grasping the red disk and shoving.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nThey fell into a strange field, with rolling wheat and smells of emptiness.\u00a0\u00a0The girl was rolling on the ground, willing herself up off the ground pitifully.\u00a0\u00a0Clef stood nearby, knocking the bits of wheat and grass off his armor.\u00a0\u00a0He walked over and forced her body over, straddling her small, heaving chest.\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry, dearie,\u201d he said, smirking.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDifferent world, different rules.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe placed both his hands around her neck and brought his thumbs up to her trachea.\u00a0\u00a0Tears ran down her face, her quivering lips pleading wordlessly with him to reconsider.\u00a0\u00a0As the brittle, malnourished bones snapped, her eyes thankfully glossed in the pleasant emptiness of oblivion.\n\n\n\nClef stood and walked back toward the mirror. \"Should have done that years ago...\"\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nClef stepped back through the mirror, unlocking the telekill body gear he was wearing and dropping it to the floor.\u00a0\u00a0343 leaned against the wall nearby, being tended to by Lore.\u00a0\u00a0Clef watched as she dabbed the blood away from the old man\u2019s eyes before he cleared his throat.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLore looked up, smiled, and ran to the edge of the mirror.\n\n\n\n\u201c239\u2019s status?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEliminated,\u201d said Clef.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lore.\u00a0\u00a0She brought the gun only as far as Clef\u2019s midsection before she fired.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nClef felt parts of him tear out of his back and staggered backward to the frame of the mirror.\u00a0\u00a0He looked up at Lore, the smiling face holding the violet pistol, feeling a tugging sense of recognition.\n\n\n\n\u201cJack?\u201d\n\n\n\nLore smiled, eyes twinkling with mischief.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, of course, Alto.\u00a0\u00a0Who else?\u201d\n\n\n\nClef was sagging now, his legs giving out as the internal and external bleeding set in.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDr. Bright jiggled happily as she sneered down at the bleeding, middle-aged man laying on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t take kindly to people who try to kill me, Clef, regardless of the circumstances.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Really, Jack?\u00a0\u00a0But they were very good circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0Not even friends?\" asked Clef. \"What's a little murder between friends?\"\n\n\n\n\"Especially not friends.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, Jack,\u201d said Clef, throwing up parts of his stomach.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou look good enough to fuck.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef rolled over, struggling to stand up.\u00a0\u00a0Bright let him, if for no other reason than it made the blood pour out of his gaping body that much faster.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou forgot one thing though, Jack,\u201d said Clef, feeling his muscles twitching around the cancers forming in his midsection.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Alto?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou're jewellery.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef stood in front of the mirror, smiling bloodily as he held SCP-963 at arm\u2019s length in his gloved hand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye, Jack.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Clef lurched back through the mirror, Bright brought the pistol up a second time, pulling the trigger.\u00a0\u00a0The gun popped, electrical arcs running up and down its length.\u00a0\u00a0Bright screamed and rushed toward the mirror, but as she did, a loud shot\u2015gunpowder and copper\u2015echoed through the room, striking the disk hovering in the center of the glass.\u00a0\u00a0As Bright reached the mirror, she saw the disk chip, ever so slightly, and cease glowing.\n\n\n\nShe whirled around, looking for the source of the shot, raising the pistol over her head in rage.\u00a0\u00a0She found no one.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nThe room was cold as Schmetterling walked down the hall, shouldering the sniper rifle.\u00a0\u00a0It had been a while since he\u2019d done any shooting, and he was proud that he still had the touch.\u00a0\u00a0He walked methodically toward the frozen tube, entered the old password they hadn\u2019t thought to delete, and smiled boldly as Imants fell bodily to the floor.\n\n\n\nHe leaned down and slapped his face a few times.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cImants. IMANTS!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoza?\u201d\n\n\n\nSchmetterling sighed and picked up the larger man, resting him on his shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0He left the rifle behind and picked up the data backup, stashing it in his pocket.\u00a0\u00a0As he passed Dr. Kondraki\u2019s tube, he stopped, looking at the frozen visage.\n\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to need all of you to help cover our escape.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tube shimmered as the butterflies flapped away from the empty containment chamber, floating around Schmetterling and his rescued friend for a moment before both of them vanished.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nJack Bright sat in the director\u2019s office, tapping her polished nails on the desk.\u00a0\u00a0This would be a set back.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of time needed to repair SCP-093 was unknown, if it could be repaired at all, and the disappearance of Kondraki from containment was highly unsettling.\n\n\n\nBright stood and walked to the far wall, entering the long and complex code that was required for someone without stable voice recognition or handprint.\n\n\n\nThe door slid open, revealing a carefully crafted box.\u00a0\u00a0She opened it, revealing the almost circle with the three, inward pointing arrows.\n\n\n\n\u2018Only a set back, Alto,\u2019 thought Jack.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Only a set back.\u2019\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nAlto Clef sat breathing heavily in a field of wheat and emptiness.\u00a0\u00a0He could feel the effects of having a Higgs boson thrown through his midsection, knew he didn\u2019t have too much longer to live, and that what time he did have would be unpleasant.\u00a0\u00a0If he\u2019d still had a gun, he might have shot himself, but since he didn\u2019t\u2026\n\n\n\nClef looked at the amulet.\u00a0\u00a0Tilting his head back, he positioned it perfectly over his mouth, and dropped it down his throat, thinking in his last moments how much nicer oblivion would be than the perpetual, eternally cold dreams.\n\n\n\nAnd somewhere, somewhere on the other side of our world's mirrors, a cancer ridden, bleeding body shuts down\u2015and reawakens screaming.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n[[[Unfinished Business II]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["unfinished-business-ii", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "action", "alleged-god", "doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-kondraki", "featured", "global-occult-coalition", "sigurros", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Unfinished Business - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unfinished-business", "year": 2010}, "unfinished-business-ii": {"created_at": "2010-08-05T04:54:00", "creator": "TroyL", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Sequel to Unfinished Business", "date": "2010-08-05T04:54:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Rating thing.", "date": "2010-08-05T04:56:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Grammar edits; thanks go to A_Fat_Ghost", "date": "2010-08-05T07:34:00"}, {"author": "SamResuAjnin", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/samresuajnin", "comment": "", "date": "2010-11-18T07:25:00"}, {"author": "Kickassfrog", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kickassfrog", "comment": "changed 'draws' to 'drawers'", "date": "2011-07-03T21:17:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

It was rare that one of those few remaining SCPs originally classified as \u201cSafe\u201d ever proved otherwise, and as one of the caretakers of the relatively less deadly artifacts and anomalies, he enjoyed a certain amount of relaxation occasionally.</p>\n<p>A mostly competent staff, a relatively safe job, and a retirement age quickly approaching: Ghost had it all. He breathed a sigh and leaned back into his chair, pulling down his glasses long enough to rub his eyes. He might have drifted off for a moment, except that he heard\u2026 something.</p>\n<p>His eyes shot open and turned toward the door, narrowing. Almost without breathing, he reached for the front of his desk and retrieved a heavy brass candlestick he\u2019d kept there ever since The Serpent\u2019s Hand had broken in and \"borrowed\" a few SCPs. He still had the note they'd left, polite and somewhat condescending, hidden away in a desk drawer, right next to the broken commendation plaque he'd cracked over one of their heads when they'd come back for more.</p>\n<p>He felt comforted by the makeshift weapon\u2019s presence as he stood and slowly made his way to the door. Age had not lessened the instincts his time as an Agent had given him. He pressed an ear against the wood finish, listening again for the noise. He was almost certain he\u2019d heard someone walking past his office, which shouldn\u2019t be possible. No one else at this site had his clearance, and as far as he knew, no one who did was supposed to be visiting anytime soon.</p>\n<p>He clicked the door open, peering into the black hallway. He stepped out, bracing himself against the wall as he slowly sidled down the corridor, listening as he progressed. He was certain he heard it now, someone further down the hall, someone in one of the storage rooms.</p>\n<p>He controlled his labored breathing as he crept closer, turning the cold brass in his hands, snaking a step at a time until he stood directly next to the door. It was a rustle of files, the paper kind that were just used for archival information now. With a hard twist, he turned himself into the door, tensed to leap at whoever he saw.</p>\n<p>Instead, a small metal disk whirled by his head, causing him to turn sharply and stare as the wall behind him erupted with thumb tacks, nails, and burning thorns. He tried to turn back again, but instead felt a fist connect solidly with his jaw, sending him falling backwards onto the floor, the heavy candlestick spiraling out of reach.</p>\n<p>He glanced up and saw a face he remembered: blond hair and blue eyes. Skin paler than he remembered, but ice had a tendency to do that to you.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Imants. I heard you'd been\u2026 released.\u201d</p>\n<p>The younger man remained silent, but the knuckles of the hand clenching a couple of file folders whitened even further as he tightened his grip.</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s fingers were anxiously searching through the needles and points covering the floor, digging into his fingers and back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, if you turn yourself in, we would be lenient. The situation has changed in recent years. We know you were young. Impressionable. The people who came to you for help were legends. Kondraki. Clef. It's no wonder you were star struck. Dragged along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why wasn\u2019t this brought up at my first hearing?\u201d Imants replied, sneering with irritation.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d said Ghost, his fingers finally closing around the smooth, metal surface. \u201cThe situation has changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flung the disk hard, awkwardly pushing himself off the floor and desperately rushing Imants full on, burying a heavy shoulder into the ex-agent\u2019s midsection as papers flew from the cabinets around them, edges sharpening and glistening as they shot out of their folders, cutting at both men.</p>\n<p>Imants was shoved back hard, slamming into the wall. Ghost fell to one knee suddenly, age catching up to him. He pushed himself up as quickly as he could, painfully straining as he put the last of his strength into a final, desperate uppercut when he felt the knee collide with his chest, knocking the wind out of him. Two more sharp blows to the back of the head, and darkness claimed him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Several Years Earlier:</span></p>\n<p>Dr. Glass had spent the past several years working with the Foundation, during which time he'd both seen and been subjected to more than his fair share of trauma. As a psychologist, he was supposed to analyze, interpret, and recommend treatment for dozens of cases a week, most of them repeat patients unable to deal with the stress of the job. When he'd finally been promoted upward, he expected a much less traumatic job. The Senior Staff he was now in charge of interviewing were supposed to be trained, hardened, and experienced. And while they were, he found his work all the more distressing.</p>\n<p>He would write a paper about each of them if he could. Over seventy separate bundles of neuroses, each on a case study in either sheer madness or inexplicably intricate coping mechanisms. Over half of them went around armed constantly against threats seen and unseen. Still others regressed into childlike states of coloring their reports, and still more simply died inside eventually.</p>\n<p>Then there were the special cases. A talking dog he had to interview, another man whose emotional nerves had been cauterized long, long ago, and a doctor who insisted on referring to himself as a chord rather than a name. And there was the butterfly man, who delighted in chaos, a woman who chased him with lamps, and a high-ranking agent who had threatened to kill him when he'd seen the Pondur he'd been given by an old patient.</p>\n<p>But it was the man with all the faces that gave Glass the most trouble. At first, he'd simply thought the staff had been joking with him about Dr. Bright, a phantasm in the background who seemingly resisted all attempts at analysis by sending a different person to the interview each month. Then, he'd read the file on SCP-963 and found the truth even more disturbing.</p>\n<p>At least he participated in the interviews somewhat, which was far more than could be said for the likes of Dr. Kondraki or Dr. Clef. They got a kick out of fucking with him; Jack Bright got a kick out of telling him the truth.</p>\n<p>He was surprisingly talkative to someone with sufficient security clearance. Glass listened intently, hearing about Bright's early life\u2014 though he spoke little about his family\u2014 and the events leading up to his first death. He also told him about the deaths he had experienced first hand, the ones he had physically experienced. Most of them were gruesome, as so often death was in the Foundation, and Jack recounted each with the reverence of a soldier remembering fallen comrades. The cycle continued, and Glass became more and more in tune with the one overbearing wish Jack Bright had: release.</p>\n<p>Glass remembered one point when Jack had been attempting to aggregate a body together with Professor Crow. The Frankensteining process had never worked, but he remembered the way Bright had looked at his hands, commented on them, admiring them for a moment or two. Weeks later, he'd asked him about his brother. Bright got quiet for a moment and tilted his head to the right, almost like he was listening for the answer.</p>\n<p>\"I did what was necessary,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Dr. Glass continued to build the profiles, though after a while, he eventually stopped keeping anything but the most cursory notes on most of the staff. It was obvious that Dr. Gears would never change, though he still tried the occasional Rorschach test. Clef and Kondraki became a source of comedy at times, and he began to enjoy quiet coffees with Professor Crow in lieu of evaluation. But he kept keeping notes on Bright. For whatever reason, he was fascinated by the myriad of faces he'd seen over the years, the occasional animal, the regular shifts in gender.</p>\n<p>He noted cycles, patterns. He attempted to make sense of Bright's personality, the ways it moved and shifted, the ways it stayed the same. It was almost a year before he asked Jack Bright about his brother again. He had to go back and check his notes twice before he was satisfied, but he was sure that the tilt of the head, the listening expression, was exactly the same.</p>\n<p>\"I did what was required,\" replied Jack.</p>\n<p>It was a subtle shift, but one that Glass noted. Something that was necessary equated to a personal decision; something that was required pointed to one mandatory. Over the months, Glass continued asking different questions of Jack, different leads and answers. But he always returned, every so often, to his brother.</p>\n<p>\"I did what I was told.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's his own fault.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't choose for him to be that way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I did what I wanted.\"</p>\n<p>Each time, the same motion, the same pattern; a shifting answer.</p>\n<p>But the early files, the files from before he and 963 were linked, were consistent. And so was Jack Bright's loyalty to the Foundation. That, more so than anything, had led to the man's meteoric rise. It was a mere week after his promotion to Foundation Director that he stopped by Dr. Glass's office for the last time. He and Glass exchanged pleasantries and congratulations, shared a cup of coffee, and relaxed, talking about the time Kondraki had shot up a break room over a failure to brew proper coffee or the time a new recruit mistook Kain for an office pet and tried to rub his belly.</p>\n<p>And for the last time, Dr. Glass looked at Jack, currently in the body of a green-eyed, red-haired child rapist, and asked him about his brother. This time, instead of looking off to the side, Jack looked right at Glass, his gaze intense and penetrating.</p>\n<p>\"I don't remember.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>\"According to my reports, there was a massive information dump around four months ago. A complete backup was made of all Foundation reports. At first I thought it was the standard backup before base evacuation, but\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"What's the problem, Mr. Halifax?\"</p>\n<p>\"The entry code was wrong. I did that backup myself, and these are not my access codes. Someone went into the system, erased the record of my backup, and made one of their own. No one would have even noticed it if they hadn't been looking at the specific date stamp.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're saying that someone has a copy of the Foundation's archive, Halifax? Are you quite sure about that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Very sure, Dr. Bright. There's no one but me that accesses those terminals.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you tell me the user that accessed it?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, sir. They covered their tracks well. The only thing I know is that their password was last used over a decade ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Mr. Halifax. See that the code is deactivated and put a trace on all public terminals to look for additional access attempts.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Director Bright.\"</p>\n<p>Jack Bright leaned back into her chair, fingering the outline of SCP-963-2 hidden underneath a loose-fitting shirt. Everything was beginning to fall into place. The sudden disappearance of Kondraki and Imants from incarceration; the damage to the Red Sea Object by the unseen gunshot; Clef's suicidal leap into a parallel world; and the string of attacks on Foundation archives. They were looking for something, whoever they were. And Bright knew she had to find out what it was before they laid their hands on it.</p>\n<p>With a complete copy of the archive, though, the paper files should be unnecessary. Everything was contained within the archive; the only things that they might not have included were the older SCPs that were no longer\u2026</p>\n<p>The epiphany hit Dr. Bright like a ton of bricks. They weren't looking for something that was still active. They were looking for what was <em>left</em> of something.</p>\n<p>Jack leaned back in the chair smiling. All remains were in Site-19 reliquaries, which meant that they were looking for something specific, too specific to just try a mad dash directly into the Foundation's heart shooting and looting. She traced the edges of the amulet under her shirt, slowly putting everything together. She had preparations to make.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eleven Years Earlier</span>:</p>\n<p>Dr. Alto Clef carefully polished one of the several shotguns he kept around his office, running the oil soaked rag up and down the metal barrel before breaking the weapon down and carefully cleaning the ejecting mechanism. It was a ritual for him, one he executed weekly with an elegant precision, one he'd missed while paralyzed and was now eager to resume.</p>\n<p>A knock on his door led to a shell being loaded into the weapon. The opening of the door lead to its cocking.</p>\n<p>\"Am I disturbing anything, Dr. Clef?\" asked Glass.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Clef.</p>\n<p>\"We need to talk sometime soon.\"</p>\n<p>\"My psych evaluation was cleared weeks ago, Glass. Are you slipping?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not about that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then what is it about?\"</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Bright.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jack? He's a good guy. Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, Glass, I've got to go take care of a little problem the Foundation has been sitting on for a while now.\"</p>\n<p>\"You and Kondraki working together, huh?\"</p>\n<p>Clef smiled. \"For now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, if you could look me up when you get back on site?\"</p>\n<p>\"When I feel like it, Glass.\"</p>\n<p>Clef pushed past the psychiatrist into the hall, carrying the gun with him. He knew he couldn't take it into the chamber with him, but he felt better having it with him, nonetheless.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>Four security guards lay unconscious between the entrance to deep storage at Site-11 and the bank of filing cabinets lined the far wall. Imants moved from drawer to drawer, carefully flipping through the files and examining termination dates. He knew that despite its lack of presence in the database, there still had to be some record of the object. The Foundation didn't believe in destroying anything, at least on the paperwork side of things. It was a destroyed SCP he was looking for.</p>\n<p>He switched drawers and redoubled his efforts. His recent altercation with Neil Ghost was still playing on his mind. It wasn't too late to turn back. It was true, what Ghost had said. The second Kondraki approached him, he'd agreed, almost blindly. Kondraki was a legend in the Foundation, at least as well-known as Clef, if not more. Imants had been more than willing to do what he asked, especially if the future of the Foundation was at stake.</p>\n<p>He breathed a sigh of relief as he saw the number, pulled out the file, and looked over the paperwork. The Foundation was not inclined to let anything just drift about uncollected, even something that was no longer of use to them.</p>\n<p>Imants shoved the folder into his jacket and prepared to report to Kondraki. One way or the other, the job was going to get done.</p>\n<p>Jack Bright had to die.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eleven Years Earlier</span>:</p>\n<p>\"What are you saying, Glass? You want me to kill him a few times?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Glass, rubbing his eyes in frustration. \"We have to remove him from a position where anyone can be harmed, then we have to find a way to release Jack from the medallion. It's doing something to him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" said Kondraki. \"It's making him less appreciative of the fragility of life.\" Kondraki laughed. \"So, you want me to kill 963?\"</p>\n<p>\"Effectively\u2026 yes, I suppose. You're one of the Foundation's problem solvers. The O5 have ignored my requests for a conference, and I've got nowhere else to turn to. I need you to help me stop whatever it is his mind is doing.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean, Glass? His mind? The fuck are you talking about?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aggregate personalities.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aggregate Personalities? What do you mean, aggregate personalities?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just what I said,\" said Glass, his forehead creased. \"There seems to be a buildup, over time, of personalities\u2026 I don't know what to call them\u2026chunks. They just stick around in there, somewhere.\"</p>\n<p>\"And we've been attaching him to murderers, rapists, and baboons?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hence, my concern.\"</p>\n<p>\"God damn it Glass. He's just been made the director! Why didn't you come to me earlier?\"</p>\n<p>\"Apologies, Kondraki. I'm here now, though, and we don't really have another choice. Clef and I are on board. Will you help us?\"</p>\n<p>A smile was the only answer he received. It was also the only one he needed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present, A Few Weeks Later</span>:</p>\n<p>Quikngruvn Halifax cursed his parents for not the first time as he re-affixed his name-badge and proceeded through the opening door. Over the past few years, he'd worked himself up to the position of chief archivist in the Foundation, a post he was immensely proud of. The offer for transfers to other, safe sites had come in over the years, but he'd remained at Site-19, comfortable in the hustle and bustle of the Foundation's largest site.</p>\n<p>He looked around his perfectly arranged office, paying careful attention to everything and adjusting the few trays the cleaning staff had bumped when cleaning the previous night. He reached for the stereo remote on the corner of his desk and pressed play. He stopped, looked at the remote and back at the stereo, pressed the button again, and frowned. He walked over to cabinet, prepared to reach behind it to reconnect a cord he was sure the janitors had disconnected when he felt the circle of cool steel pressed into the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\"I want you to understand, Halifax, that while I have nothing against you, I am fully prepared to plaster the contents of your skull all over that wall. I'm afraid you disabled my old access code, so I'll be needing yours. Now.\"</p>\n<p>Quikngruvn's body tensed when he heard the voice, realizing immediately who was right behind him, who had used the antiquated access code, and what was pressed against his neck. A reputation came with the presence of the legendary Dr. Kondraki, one which he was in no way eager to discover the validity of. He eased his hand up to his collar, unclipped the name badge, and held it over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"That's a good boy, now.\"</p>\n<p>Quikngruvn saw as a hand reached over his shoulder, turning on the stereo and cranking up the volume.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry about the knee.\"</p>\n<p>The sound of the shot and the harsh drumming of the music meshed well, and the solid slap of the cold, metal butt of the gun against his head brought a welcomed repose from excruciating reality.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eleven Years Earlier</span>:</p>\n<p>\"We have to separate him from 963, then present our evidence. We'll never even make it to a formal hearing otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why don't we just chuck him through a Hell gate? Don't we have a few of those?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because, he's our friend. We should help him as best we can.\"</p>\n<p>\"Speak for yourself. I've never liked Bright.\"</p>\n<p>\"You've never liked anyone.\"</p>\n<p>\"Point being?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nevertheless, the plan stands. We kill Bright's current body, contain 963, present our evidence, and then hope we don't get our wrists slapped.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's an awful plan.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then what do you suggest?\"</p>\n<p>\"Poison him, then burn him. Then, we put 963 through 093 and pretend it never happened.\"</p>\n<p>\"Too complicated. It would never work.\"</p>\n<p>\"We could just use explosives. Explosives always work.\"</p>\n<p>\"963 is practically indestructible. An explosion big enough to take it out would be more than enough to burn off the atmosphere.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, just for killing him. Small explosion, then a series of them to bury the body in rubble. While they're sorting it out, we can convince them to do what we want with the medallion.\"</p>\n<p>\"You guys are forgetting one problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"And what's that, Glass?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's the director, now. He's going to have guards. <em>Good</em> guards.\"</p>\n<p>\"Guards, Glass? Really? That's what you're worried about?\"</p>\n<p>\"For God's sake, Glass, I'm a god damned legend. You think I can't handle a few trained monkeys?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not going to be that easy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why not?\"</p>\n<p>\"The guards are him too.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jack's a scientist, not an army.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why don't we just wait for a more opportune moment?

For god's sake, there have been more decommissions in the last month than there have been in the entire life of the Foundation.\"</p>\n<p>\"I heard about a few of them. I'm not sure why 914 was disassembled, but he had a good argument for 447. Too much of a hazard on site.\"</p>\n<p>\"It doesn't matter. The Foundation has a mission to carry out. We're the wall between humanity and all the shit that would break their minds. We hold it back; we don't blow it up.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've blown up plenty of shit for them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not stuff that didn't need it!

We strike tomorrow.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>Dr. Kondraki had spent the last few years haunting the halls of various sites, taking on the roles of people who did or didn't exist, acting in a million tiny ways, most of them either obnoxious or harmless. The occasional missing sample, the carefully made blueprints for the various sites, reports on newly recovered artifacts\u2014all passed along to the Global Occult Coalition. The little group was a useful tool, for now, and he hoped to keep using them into the foreseeable future. He'd always been good at killing things, and it was one of the few activities that they appreciated. He could see why Clef had worked with them.</p>\n<p>He was pressed hard against the hallway's curved walls, 408 carefully guarding him, as he waited for the approaching guard to get a little closer. It should be a fairly simple process. Enter the security point, open the proper containment units with Halifax's code, and clear a path straight to their insurance. He couldn't imagine finding the location of a bunch of failed experiments would be so damn hard, but Bright had covered the tracks of his weakness fairly well, if inadvertently. It would, of course, be here at Site-19, where Bright could keep an eye on it. But Site-19 was very, very big. And there were many, many places to hide something.</p>\n<p>Imants had done his job well, and now it was up to Kondraki. One last run into the belly of the beast. One last mission before everything would be over, finally. The Foundation had taken several steps away from where it had been when he'd been an agent. There were fewer and fewer containments, more and more Neutralizations. He was even aware of a few cities that had been razed after experiments were conducted there and found to have less than optimal results. The O5 were further and further removed, the Director given more and more power. He might have liked the position fifteen years ago, but time had mellowed his ambitions. Slightly.</p>\n<p>The guard rounded the last bend, slowly approaching the coded door. He placed his thumb over the checkpoint, causing the door to beep once, cheerily, and open. Kondraki stepped out, bringing a well timed chop down on his foe's neck, causing him to stumble, but not fall. Kondraki cursed as he pulled the sawed off shotgun out from under his coat as the guard looked up at him.</p>\n<p>\"Konny?\"</p>\n<p>Kondraki's eye's widened. \"Jack?\"</p>\n<p>The guard's hand flew to the alarm, slamming down on it as Kondraki's finger squeezed the trigger. The blast blew away much of the guard's face, though much too slowly to avoid the unfortunate consequences. The guard meant one thing: Jack had activated 963-2.</p>\n<p>He stepped over the body, scanned Halifax's name badge, and started running.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eleven Years Earlier</span>:</p>\n<p>In retrospect, Glass thought they should have gone with Clef's plan.</p>\n<p>The charges were set in a fairly open area, with a remote detonator rigged to the wall. They waited as the first security crew passed, until they knew the Jack with 963 would be directly above the explosion and sprung the trap.</p>\n<p>Clef spun around the forward corner, putting two shells each into the forward guards' backs as they turned to see the erupting flames around their charge. Kondraki emptied his sidearm into the rear guard from a safe, hidden corner as Imants dropped the remaining ceiling into the corridor with a well-timed grenade in the ventilation system.</p>\n<p>The entire attack had been executed flawlessly.</p>\n<p>\"That was too easy,\" said Kondraki, eying the guard's bodies. \"Jack's not a soldier, but he's also not an idiot.\"</p>\n<p>Clef nodded. \"He probably put 963 on one of the guards.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or he's not here at all.\" Everyone looked up at Glass, the young doctor nervously running his hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>The four of them looked at each other as the alarms started blaring.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>A brilliant flash of light blinded Kondraki as he rounded the corner, making the floating images around him shudder as 408 lost members of its hive. He fired the pistol over his shoulder twice, stopping after he heard a grunt and fall. The storage chamber he needed would be nearby, and if he was lucky\u2014</p>\n<p>A second blast of light flew ahead of Kondraki, cutting through the illusion and scattering the burned husks of butterflies through the air. He slid around a second corner, bringing the pistol up under the guard's chin and scattering his thoughts and memories over the ceiling without stopping. He leaped through the air as a second guard attempted to bull rush him from behind, firing downward into the man's lower back as he twisted sharply to avoid another blast of light.</p>\n<p>It would have been impressive if he'd left anyone alive to witness it.</p>\n<p>He found the door and scanned Halifax's card, entering the lab and sealing the door behind him. He walked across the room, putting a bullet into the forehead of a stunned researcher, and pulled several green vials out of a row of test tubes, placing them in his pocket. He smiled, running through the rest of the plan in his head.</p>\n<p>Then, he shrugged, muttered \"Fuck it\" under his breath, and reloaded his gun. If he was doing this, he was going to do it his way. He was going to have fun.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eleven Years Earlier</span>:</p>\n<p>Glass had been captured first. He'd not been trained for any sort of combat, so when the hoard of trained shock troops poured into the hallway following the explosion, he'd held his hands in the air and waited for them to quit beating him into the ground. He heard about Clef's capture, how it'd taken them four hours to get through the traps he set in his outer office and another two to actually lay hands on the man. Imants had managed to hole up in the ventilation system for almost two days before they found him. Kondraki had actually come quietly, having been found in his office apparently doing paperwork.</p>\n<p>Glass heard about the other trials through his guard. Clef had been sentenced quickly, Kondraki mere hours later. It was the next morning before Imants had been sentenced, as there was apparently a fair amount of dissent about the extent to which he'd been involved and how much he'd been influenced by his superiors. The sentence had been the same, nonetheless: indefinite stasis.</p>\n<p>Glass sat in his cell, listening to the footsteps, trying not to think about the stories he'd heard from other people who'd experienced stasis. Cold dreams; frozen memories. They could never remember what they'd dreamed, only the cold.</p>\n<p>It was the next morning when the guard approached his cell. Glass contemplated trying to hit the guard over the head and escape, but he knew that he wouldn't last more than two or three steps into the hall. He allowed them to cuff him, requested an opportunity to examine himself in the mirror, and after doing so, walked down the hallway, flanked by the guards.</p>\n<p>A series of blurry and darkened screens greeted him in the courtroom; he steeled himself and listened to the charges.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>Kondraki could hear the footsteps charging him, herding him. It was the problem with fighting with someone who could effectively create a hive mind with the right kind of telepathy. And the Foundation had the right kind, especially since they'd cut up 182's and 116's respective brains and played around with them.</p>\n<p>He took a short cut he knew he shouldn't, but Jack could go fuck himself if he thought that Kondraki would do what he wanted him to. He slid into one of the maintenance closets, a place he'd gotten used to hiding in over the years, and looked for one of the access pipes. He found one marked \"Pest Control\" and opened the access nozzles, filling them with two of the vials he'd stolen earlier. He looked around him and the butterflies flitting through the air and frowned, muttering quietly under his breath. \"I'm sorry.\"</p>\n<p>He turned back to the door, kicking it open and having 408 project an illusion of himself in front of the opening, smirking as a hail of gunfire issued from the left. He swung low out of the opening, bringing the pistol level and putting a bullet into the neck of both men firing, noting as they fell the dangling Foundation symbols strung around their necks. 'Jack,' he thought.</p>\n<p>Kondraki started running. He'd have to get to the climate control quickly, the one for this sector, or the plan would be pointless. It wouldn't take much longer, not now. Another turn and then a quick shot straight to\u2014</p>\n<p>The bullet tore through his thigh, hollow tip causing more damage than he might otherwise have preferred. He fell hard against the right wall, having 408 project him falling to the left, and fired a shot backwards wildly. He pulled himself further, ripping a sleeve off his shirt and tying it around his leg tightly. He could barely feel his leg, and he knew that there weren't enough members of 408 left alive to cover the blood. If this was going to happen, it would have to be soon.</p>\n<p>He struggled forward, smiling as the two symbol wearing guards pursuing him put several rounds into the illusory corpse. He took the time to turn and aim carefully, putting a shot into both of their heads before bringing himself into the climate control center.</p>\n<p>The room wasn't that much different than any one of a dozen across Site-19, but this one had the controls he needed. He found the Infestation Control Station that had been in place since 439 had been forcibly Neutralized. He looked at the handful of butterflies around him one last time and pressed the command sequence, releasing the anti-parasitics into the air.</p>\n<p>Glass erupted from the screen as two loud blasts sounded behind him, forcing him to roll out of the chair as blood loss made his vision swim. He struggled away from the station as a hoard of footsteps approached him.</p>\n<p>The pesticide had a faint hint of mint to it, Kondraki noticed, smiling. 408 died in the air around him, the multiple projections fading with them. His leg ached and bled in spite of the tourniquet.</p>\n<p>\"You shouldn't have come alone, Konny.\"</p>\n<p>Kondraki looked up at the handful of men, all wearing the same expression, all wearing the same medallion.</p>\n<p>\"What makes you think I came alone, Jack?\"</p>\n<p>\"Bluffing, at this point?\" Three men with crests around their necks approached Kondraki and kicked him in the stomach. Kondraki heard several Brights laugh as the dying butterflies tried to project an illusion around the dying, middle-aged doctor. He brought a hand out to brush his hair back off his forehead as he looked up at his foe.</p>\n<p>\"When have I ever lied to you, Jack?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elsewhere</span>:</p>\n<p>Imants turned the corner, running as stealthily as possible up the corridor, ignoring the green, acidic mist the sprayed from the ceiling. If the last round of reports from their informant had been correct, the package he was looking for was in the second room on the left, Corridor 23-B. With everyone going after Kondraki, he shouldn't have any problems finding the package.</p>\n<p>As the door slid open, he slowly walked into the room, looking quickly to either side for unexpected surprises. He was pleased to find none.</p>\n<p>Imants stepped forward, ignoring the new set of erupting sirens. He looked down at the red disk and collected it into a cloth, slipping it into his pocket. Two sets of plastic explosives later, he left the room, running as fast as possible. Kondraki's plan gave him two minutes, but he wanted to be further away.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>The mist was beginning to die down as dozens more Jack Brights surrounded Kondraki, watching him bleed. A bouncy, black-haired woman walked to the front of the crowd. She smiled, condescendingly, leaning over the injured man.</p>\n<p>\"You've gotten old and slow, Konny. No one would have caught you ten years ago.\"</p>\n<p>He sneered. \"No one did.\"</p>\n<p>She smiled at him again. \"I guess you're right. It's a shame really. The Foundation could have used you, Kondraki. Your talents. No one other than Clef had more confirmed decommissions than you. With our new programs, you might have had a place here again.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've not had a place here in a long time, Jack.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I guess you haven't. Any last requests?\"</p>\n<p>\"None. But I do have one question,\" said Kondraki, pushing himself up and leaning back against his legs.</p>\n<p>\"That's not a request,\" replied Jack.</p>\n<p>\"It's close enough. Humor me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is this everyone?\" asked Kondraki.</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is this everyone?\" repeated Kondraki. \"Did you really bring every copy of yourself to fight me?\"</p>\n<p>Bright's eyes narrowed. All of them.</p>\n<p>\"Because, Jack, if you did, that was a god damned stupid thing to do.\"</p>\n<p>Kondraki reached into both pockets. He pulled his gun out of the first. Out of the second, he pulled a green vial. Forty faces blanched in recognition, for the first time noticing the scent of the pesticide as the stopper on the vial flew through the air, and the substance contained within it splashed on Kondraki's face. Dozens of eyes turning to see the butterflies on the ground sparking and twitching as they died.</p>\n<p>\"A body is a body, Jack. See you in hell, you son of a bitch. All of you.\"</p>\n<p>Kondraki raised the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. As the bullet passed through his skull, he felt an instant of 447's reaction taking place. But then, reality was gone, and all that was left was an aftermath.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eleven Years Earlier</span>:</p>\n<p>\"None of you are listening!\" screamed Glass, his face shuddering. \"That's not Jack Bright! Not anymore! It didn't happen all at once! It was putting a pebble on the beach. And then another and another. Eventually, the whole thing is hidden, and you never noticed!\"</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Glass, please calm yourself. You've obviously experienced some kind of psychotic break\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I've experience nothing of the sort! You don't get it!\" he shouted, his voice cracking. \"It's not his whole personality, not even a big part of it. It's inches of the football field. But soon, it'll be worse.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nevertheless, Doctor, you've committed a serious crime, have no evidence, and rallied enough of our less\u2026 controllable members together to convince us you planned nothing less serious than another break like the Chaos Insurgency, as Dr. Bright concluded. Given your family history, it seems a logical\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I've got all the proof I need sitting right there,\" screeched Glass, pointing at Bright's current body. \"One question. That's all I ask. Just one.\"</p>\n<p>The face on the other side of the screen seemed to frown for a moment before visibly shrugging. \"Fine. Ask away.\"</p>\n<p>Glass looked at Jack Bright, narrowing his eyes as if to stare right through the visibly disturbed looking doctor.</p>\n<p>\"Jack. What do you want more than anything else in the world?\"</p>\n<p>Bright looked surprised. He smirked, the concern draining from his face. \"To serve the Foundation.\"</p>\n<p>Glass's face cracked as he smiled in triumph. \"That's not true, Jack.\"</p>\n<p>The voice from beyond the screen sounded again. \"Enough. The trial is over. We have the utmost faith in Dr. Bright, and this line of questioning will change nothing. Dr. Glass, you are to be suspended in cryogenic stasis for no fewer than thirty years.\"</p>\n<p>Glass turned to the screen, eyes widening in shock. \"What? Don't you see? It's not right! He doesn't want to serve!\"</p>\n<p>Two men approached the dais and took either of Glass's arms, proceeding to pull him away from the court room. Glass's voice echoed over the cacophony of voices and static, screaming in rage.</p>\n<p>\"IT'S NOT RIGHT! HE WANTS TO DIE, YOU IDIOTS! HE JUST WANTS TO DIE!\"</p>\n<p>He was still screaming when they put him in the chamber. Directly across from him, he saw Kondraki's cryogenic chamber. For a moment, it shimmered, a wing flapping momentarily out of place. Glass had only a moment to register his surprise before the ice took him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Present</span>:</p>\n<p>There was also a multitude of voices shouting now, though the shapely female form lay mostly still and silent, only occasionally coughing or hacking up blood. Murderers and thieves, rapists and pedophiles, and a handful of those who had just stumbled onto the wrong military base or into the wrong room. Most of them were angry, calling out with rage and anger at their denied immortality, while others were crying loudly in sadness. But somewhere, deep down at the bottom, there was one who was silent. Unspeakably and immeasurably relieved.</p>\n<p>'It feels good to finally die,' thought Jack.</p>\n<p>He watched from the bottom upward as the voices winked out, disappearing like vanishing stars. He heard them silenced, one by one, the din growing quieter and quieter as the others finally went away, finally vanished, blowing away like flakes of ash. He felt whole again for the first time in decades. It took an incredibly long time, though it seemed to happen all at once; then, Jack was alone.</p>\n<p>It was dark, and cold, and wonderful. Dreadfully wonderful. Then he saw it, just barely out of the corner of his eyes, exploding with the intensity of its presence. A single dot of light, still shimmering.</p>\n<p>'No,' thought Jack. 'God damn it. NO!'</p>\n<p>He tried to speak and could not. The body he was occupying shuddered, racked out a final, desperate cough, and died.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Seven Weeks Later</span>:</p>\n<p>Interim Director Gears sat uncomfortably in the chair, but it didn't show. Kondraki's actions would leave Site-19 unusable for the foreseeable future, unless some antidote to 447-2's effect could be found. Since it didn't seem likely, Gears had been forced to relocate. On top of that, he was the chief surviving member of Site-19's command structure, leaving him with a very large mess to clean up. Anyone else would have broken under the stress of Gears' responsibilities. And Gears himself might be feeling a similar strain, but it didn't show.</p>\n<p>He had shuffled through more paperwork in the last month than in his entire career. While he'd passed on some of it to Iceberg, he was still inundated daily with requests, notes on recovery, and personnel casualty reports. Today was no different.</p>\n<p>He leafed through half a dozen SCP recoveries, making notes about the number of newly Neutralized objects that would have to be refiled. At the bottom of the stack, he found a file he thought he wouldn't see again anytime soon. It was a thick folder, full of notes on exploration and chromatically based locations. SCP-093. Status: <em>Missing, Presumed Destroyed</em>.</p>\n<p>He looked over the several pages of examinations Bright had ordered on the object, noted how the prognosis for repair had looked quite promising, and quietly closed the folder, setting it aside and retrieving the logs from the last day of Site-19. It took him a few minutes to find the security access data, and less time to discover that one of the many alarms tripped that day was to 093's research lab. Furthermore, it was the only alarm set off in its sector. He slowly put the puzzle together, sighed, and looked at the next file: \"Concerning the Locating and Elimination of the Rogue Agent Imants.\"</p>\n<p>He read the report, signed at the bottom of the file to note he'd seen it, and then checked the box next to \"Denied,\" citing a need for Foundation resources to be applied more scrupulously during such a difficult time. With luck, that would keep them from rediscovering the object before Imant's new employers could destroy it. He'd had a long day, and he was fairly glad when it was over, but it didn't show.</p>\n<p>Gears placed the manila folder in his outbox, and a crease knitted his eyebrows briefly and was gone.</p>\n<p>\"Goodbye, Jack.\"</p>\n<p>He turned off the lights and left the room.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Future</span>:</p>\n<p>The stems of wheat waved slowly, methodically, in the wind. The corpse would have been long desiccated, save for the fact that there weren't enough bacteria left alive to do much to it. All over the middle and lower torso, bulges of tumorous growths protruded under the skin, sometimes breaking through. The expression spoke of one who had died in agony. Even now, the eyes were painfully cramped shut, the teeth broken from gnashing and grinding, though the face still flickered and changed occasionally. Every so often, it flitted into a mocking smile, the last vestige of a man who, in his final moments, had passed on his death to his enemy. A final, spiteful act of a spiteful man. But not one that was undeserved.</p>\n<p>How long the body lay there, no one could know, but eventually, coasting over the horizon, there came a form. A strange half body, dragging itself with its arms, incomprehensibly large and impossibly terrible. It came, smelling blood, something it hadn't sensed in many, many years. The face, if it could be called that, was leering down at the slowly rotting corpse, smelling it, possibly savoring it, although its intentions would be impossible to tell. There was no way to know the mind of such a creature, so far was it removed from its original, human roots.</p>\n<p>The mouth slowly lowered down to the ground, surrounding the body and swallowing it whole. For a brief instant, it ceased moving. But in the next moment, it howled\u2014though if in anguish or joy it could not be said. The form bent and twisted as the souls of a dead world became overwritten, leaving only a single, mingled consciousness. It doubled over as the eternal torment of billions became the burden of one. It shuddered as the knowledge of countless minds were added to its own.</p>\n<p>And just on the other side of the mirror, just out of sight, remained Jack Bright, trapped eternally between realities.</p>\n<p>Waiting.

Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n__The Present, Eventually__:\n\n\n\nSite Director Neil Ghost was one of the longest-serving members of the Foundation, a feat made possible by the relative safety of his job.\u00a0\u00a0It was rare that one of those few remaining SCPs originally classified as \u201cSafe\u201d ever proved otherwise, and as one of the caretakers of the relatively less deadly artifacts and anomalies, he enjoyed a certain amount of relaxation occasionally. \n\n\n\nA mostly competent staff, a relatively safe job, and a retirement age quickly approaching: Ghost had it all.\u00a0\u00a0He breathed a sigh and leaned back into his chair, pulling down his glasses long enough to rub his eyes.\u00a0\u00a0He might have drifted off for a moment, except that he heard\u2026 something.\n\n\n\nHis eyes shot open and turned toward the door, narrowing.\u00a0\u00a0Almost without breathing, he reached for the front of his desk and retrieved a heavy brass candlestick he\u2019d kept there ever since The Serpent\u2019s Hand had broken in and \"borrowed\" a few SCPs.\u00a0\u00a0He still had the note they'd left, polite and somewhat condescending, hidden away in a desk drawer, right next to the broken commendation plaque he'd cracked over one of their heads when they'd come back for more.\n\n\n\nHe felt comforted by the makeshift weapon\u2019s presence as he stood and slowly made his way to the door.\u00a0\u00a0Age had not lessened the instincts his time as an Agent had given him.\u00a0\u00a0He pressed an ear against the wood finish, listening again for the noise.\u00a0\u00a0He was almost certain he\u2019d heard someone walking past his office, which shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u00a0\u00a0No one else at this site had his clearance, and as far as he knew, no one who did was supposed to be visiting anytime soon.\n\n\n\nHe clicked the door open, peering into the black hallway.\u00a0\u00a0He stepped out, bracing himself against the wall as he slowly sidled down the corridor, listening as he progressed.\u00a0\u00a0He was certain he heard it now, someone further down the hall, someone in one of the storage rooms.\n\n\n\nHe controlled his labored breathing as he crept closer, turning the cold brass in his hands, snaking a step at a time until he stood directly next to the door.\u00a0\u00a0It was a rustle of files, the paper kind that were just used for archival information now.\u00a0\u00a0With a hard twist, he turned himself into the door, tensed to leap at whoever he saw.\n\n\n\nInstead, a small metal disk whirled by his head, causing him to turn sharply and stare as the wall behind him erupted with thumb tacks, nails, and burning thorns.\u00a0\u00a0He tried to turn back again, but instead felt a fist connect solidly with his jaw, sending him falling backwards onto the floor, the heavy candlestick spiraling out of reach.\n\n\n\nHe glanced up and saw a face he remembered: blond hair and blue eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Skin paler than he remembered, but ice had a tendency to do that to you.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello, Imants.\u00a0\u00a0I heard you'd been\u2026 released.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe younger man remained silent, but the knuckles of the hand clenching a couple of file folders whitened even further as he tightened his grip.\n\n\n\nGhost\u2019s fingers were anxiously searching through the needles and points covering the floor, digging into his fingers and back.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, if you turn yourself in, we would be lenient.\u00a0\u00a0The situation has changed in recent years.\u00a0\u00a0We know you were young.\u00a0\u00a0Impressionable.\u00a0\u00a0The people who came to you for help were legends.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0Clef.\u00a0\u00a0It's no wonder you were star struck.\u00a0\u00a0Dragged along.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd why wasn\u2019t this brought up at my first hearing?\u201d Imants replied, sneering with irritation.\n\n\n\n\u201cLike I said,\u201d said Ghost, his fingers finally closing around the smooth, metal surface.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe situation has changed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe flung the disk hard, awkwardly pushing himself off the floor and desperately rushing Imants full on, burying a heavy shoulder into the ex-agent\u2019s midsection as papers flew from the cabinets around them, edges sharpening and glistening as they shot out of their folders, cutting at both men.\n\n\n\nImants was shoved back hard, slamming into the wall.\u00a0\u00a0Ghost fell to one knee suddenly, age catching up to him.\u00a0\u00a0He pushed himself up as quickly as he could, painfully straining as he put the last of his strength into a final, desperate uppercut when he felt the knee collide with his chest, knocking the wind out of him.\u00a0\u00a0Two more sharp blows to the back of the head, and darkness claimed him.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Several Years Earlier:__ \n\n\n\nDr. Glass had spent the past several years working with the Foundation, during which time he'd both seen and been subjected to more than his fair share of trauma.\u00a0\u00a0As a psychologist, he was supposed to analyze, interpret, and recommend treatment for dozens of cases a week, most of them repeat patients unable to deal with the stress of the job.\u00a0\u00a0When he'd finally been promoted upward, he expected a much less traumatic job.\u00a0\u00a0The Senior Staff he was now in charge of interviewing were supposed to be trained, hardened, and experienced.\u00a0\u00a0And while they were, he found his work all the more distressing.\n\n\n\nHe would write a paper about each of them if he could.\u00a0\u00a0Over seventy separate bundles of neuroses, each on a case study in either sheer madness or inexplicably intricate coping mechanisms.\u00a0\u00a0Over half of them went around armed constantly against threats seen and unseen.\u00a0\u00a0Still others regressed into childlike states of coloring their reports, and still more simply died inside eventually.\n\n\n\nThen there were the special cases.\u00a0\u00a0A talking dog he had to interview, another man whose emotional nerves had been cauterized long, long ago, and a doctor who insisted on referring to himself as a chord rather than a name.\u00a0\u00a0And there was the butterfly man, who delighted in chaos, a woman who chased him with lamps, and a high-ranking agent who had threatened to kill him when he'd seen the Pondur he'd been given by an old patient.\n\n\n\nBut it was the man with all the faces that gave Glass the most trouble.\u00a0\u00a0At first, he'd simply thought the staff had been joking with him about Dr. Bright, a phantasm in the background who seemingly resisted all attempts at analysis by sending a different person to the interview each month.\u00a0\u00a0Then, he'd read the file on SCP-963 and found the truth even more disturbing.\n\n\n\nAt least he participated in the interviews somewhat, which was far more than could be said for the likes of Dr. Kondraki or Dr. Clef.\u00a0\u00a0They got a kick out of fucking with him;\u00a0\u00a0Jack Bright got a kick out of telling him the truth.\n\n\n\nHe was surprisingly talkative to someone with sufficient security clearance.\u00a0\u00a0Glass listened intently, hearing about Bright's early life-- though he spoke little about his family-- and the events leading up to his first death.\u00a0\u00a0He also told him about the deaths he had experienced first hand, the ones he had physically experienced.\u00a0\u00a0Most of them were gruesome, as so often death was in the Foundation, and Jack recounted each with the reverence of a soldier remembering fallen comrades.\u00a0\u00a0The cycle continued, and Glass became more and more in tune with the one overbearing wish Jack Bright had: release.\n\n\n\nGlass remembered one point when Jack had been attempting to aggregate a body together with Professor Crow.\u00a0\u00a0The Frankensteining process had never worked, but he remembered the way Bright had looked at his hands, commented on them, admiring them for a moment or two.\u00a0\u00a0Weeks later, he'd asked him about his brother.\u00a0\u00a0Bright got quiet for a moment and tilted his head to the right, almost like he was listening for the answer.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I did what was necessary,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDr. Glass continued to build the profiles, though after a while, he eventually stopped keeping anything but the most cursory notes on most of the staff.\u00a0\u00a0It was obvious that Dr. Gears would never change, though he still tried the occasional Rorschach test.\u00a0\u00a0Clef and Kondraki became a source of comedy at times, and he began to enjoy quiet coffees with Professor Crow in lieu of evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0But he kept keeping notes on Bright.\u00a0\u00a0For whatever reason, he was fascinated by the myriad of faces he'd seen over the years, the occasional animal, the regular shifts in gender.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe noted cycles, patterns.\u00a0\u00a0He attempted to make sense of Bright's personality, the ways it moved and shifted, the ways it stayed the same.\u00a0\u00a0It was almost a year before he asked Jack Bright about his brother again.\u00a0\u00a0He had to go back and check his notes twice before he was satisfied, but he was sure that the tilt of the head, the listening expression, was exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\"I did what was required,\" replied Jack.\n\n\n\nIt was a subtle shift, but one that Glass noted.\u00a0\u00a0Something that was necessary equated to a personal decision;\u00a0\u00a0something that was required pointed to one mandatory.\u00a0\u00a0Over the months, Glass continued asking different questions of Jack, different leads and answers.\u00a0\u00a0But he always returned, every so often, to his brother.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I did what I was told.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's his own fault.\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't choose for him to be that way.\"\n\n\n\n\"I did what I wanted.\"\n\n\n\nEach time, the same motion, the same pattern; a shifting answer.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut the early files, the files from before he and 963 were linked, were consistent.\u00a0\u00a0And so was Jack Bright's loyalty to the Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0That, more so than anything, had led to the man's meteoric rise.\u00a0\u00a0It was a mere week after his promotion to Foundation Director that he stopped by Dr. Glass's office for the last time.\u00a0\u00a0He and Glass exchanged pleasantries and congratulations, shared a cup of coffee, and relaxed, talking about the time Kondraki had shot up a break room over a failure to brew proper coffee or the time a new recruit mistook Kain for an office pet and tried to rub his belly.\n\n\n\nAnd for the last time, Dr. Glass looked at Jack, currently in the body of a green-eyed, red-haired child rapist, and asked him about his brother.\u00a0\u00a0This time, instead of looking off to the side, Jack looked right at Glass, his gaze intense and penetrating.\n\n\n\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\n\"According to my reports, there was a massive information dump around four months ago.\u00a0\u00a0A complete backup was made of all Foundation reports.\u00a0\u00a0At first I thought it was the standard backup before base evacuation, but...\"\n\n\n\n\"What's the problem, Mr. Halifax?\"\n\n\n\n\"The entry code was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I did that backup myself, and these are not my access codes.\u00a0\u00a0Someone went into the system, erased the record of my backup, and made one of their own.\u00a0\u00a0No one would have even noticed it if they hadn't been looking at the specific date stamp.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're saying that someone has a copy of the Foundation's archive, Halifax?\u00a0\u00a0Are you quite sure about that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Very sure, Dr. Bright.\u00a0\u00a0There's no one but me that accesses those terminals.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you tell me the user that accessed it?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, sir.\u00a0\u00a0They covered their tracks well.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I know is that their password was last used over a decade ago.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Halifax.\u00a0\u00a0See that the code is deactivated and put a trace on all public terminals to look for additional access attempts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Director Bright.\"\n\n\n\nJack Bright leaned back into her chair, fingering the outline of SCP-963-2 hidden underneath a loose-fitting shirt.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was beginning to fall into place.\u00a0\u00a0The sudden disappearance of Kondraki and Imants from incarceration; the damage to the Red Sea Object by the unseen gunshot; Clef's suicidal leap into a parallel world; and the string of attacks on Foundation archives.\u00a0\u00a0They were looking for something, whoever they were.\u00a0\u00a0And Bright knew she had to find out what it was before they laid their hands on it.\n\n\n\nWith a complete copy of the archive, though, the paper files should be unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was contained within the archive; the only things that they might not have included were the older SCPs that were no longer...\n\n\n\nThe epiphany hit Dr. Bright like a ton of bricks.\u00a0\u00a0They weren't looking for something that was still active.\u00a0\u00a0They were looking for what was //left// of something. \n\n\n\nJack leaned back in the chair smiling.\u00a0\u00a0All remains were in Site-19 reliquaries, which meant that they were looking for something specific, too specific to just try a mad dash directly into the Foundation's heart shooting and looting.\u00a0\u00a0She traced the edges of the amulet under her shirt, slowly putting everything together.\u00a0\u00a0She had preparations to make.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Eleven Years Earlier__:\n\n\n\nDr. Alto Clef carefully polished one of the several shotguns he kept around his office, running the oil soaked rag up and down the metal barrel before breaking the weapon down and carefully cleaning the ejecting mechanism.\u00a0\u00a0It was a ritual for him, one he executed weekly with an elegant precision, one he'd missed while paralyzed and was now eager to resume.\n\n\n\nA knock on his door led to a shell being loaded into the weapon.\u00a0\u00a0The opening of the door lead to its cocking.\n\n\n\n\"Am I disturbing anything, Dr. Clef?\" asked Glass.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clef.\n\n\n\n\"We need to talk sometime soon.\"\n\n\n\n\"My psych evaluation was cleared weeks ago, Glass.\u00a0\u00a0Are you slipping?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not about that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then what is it about?\"\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Bright.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jack?\u00a0\u00a0He's a good guy.\u00a0\u00a0Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, Glass, I've got to go take care of a little problem the Foundation has been sitting on for a while now.\"\n\n\n\n\"You and Kondraki working together, huh?\"\n\n\n\nClef smiled.\u00a0\u00a0\"For now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, if you could look me up when you get back on site?\"\n\n\n\n\"When I feel like it, Glass.\"\n\n\n\nClef pushed past the psychiatrist into the hall, carrying the gun with him.\u00a0\u00a0He knew he couldn't take it into the chamber with him, but he felt better having it with him, nonetheless.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\nFour security guards lay unconscious between the entrance to deep storage at Site-11 and the bank of filing cabinets lined the far wall.\u00a0\u00a0Imants moved from drawer to drawer, carefully flipping through the files and examining termination dates.\u00a0\u00a0He knew that despite its lack of presence in the database, there still had to be some record of the object.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation didn't believe in destroying anything, at least on the paperwork side of things.\u00a0\u00a0It was a destroyed SCP he was looking for.\n\n\n\nHe switched drawers and redoubled his efforts.\u00a0\u00a0His recent altercation with Neil Ghost was still playing on his mind.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't too late to turn back.\u00a0\u00a0It was true, what Ghost had said.\u00a0\u00a0The second Kondraki approached him, he'd agreed, almost blindly.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki was a legend in the Foundation, at least as well-known as Clef, if not more.\u00a0\u00a0Imants had been more than willing to do what he asked, especially if the future of the Foundation was at stake.\n\n\n\nHe breathed a sigh of relief as he saw the number, pulled out the file, and looked over the paperwork.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation was not inclined to let anything just drift about uncollected, even something that was no longer of use to them.\n\n\n\nImants shoved the folder into his jacket and prepared to report to Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0One way or the other, the job was going to get done.\n\n\n\nJack Bright had to die.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n__Eleven Years Earlier__:\n\n\n\n\"What are you saying, Glass?\u00a0\u00a0You want me to kill him a few times?\"\n\n\n\n\"No,\" said Glass, rubbing his eyes in frustration.\u00a0\u00a0\"We have to remove him from a position where anyone can be harmed, then we have to find a way to release Jack from the medallion.\u00a0\u00a0It's doing something to him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's making him less appreciative of the fragility of life.\" Kondraki laughed.\u00a0\u00a0\"So, you want me to kill 963?\"\n\n\n\n\"Effectively... yes, I suppose.\u00a0\u00a0You're one of the Foundation's problem solvers.\u00a0\u00a0The O5 have ignored my requests for a conference, and I've got nowhere else to turn to.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I need you to help me stop whatever it is his mind is doing.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean, Glass?\u00a0\u00a0His mind?\u00a0\u00a0The fuck are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\n\"Aggregate personalities.\"\n\n\n\n\"Aggregate Personalities?\u00a0\u00a0What do you mean, aggregate personalities?\"\n\n\n\n\"Just what I said,\" said Glass, his forehead creased.\u00a0\u00a0\"There seems to be a buildup, over time, of personalities... I don't know what to call them...chunks.\u00a0\u00a0They just stick around in there, somewhere.\"\n\n\n\n\"And we've been attaching him to murderers, rapists, and baboons?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hence, my concern.\"\n\n\n\n\"God damn it Glass.\u00a0\u00a0He's just been made the director!\u00a0\u00a0Why didn't you come to me earlier?\"\n\n\n\n\"Apologies, Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0I'm here now, though, and we don't really have another choice.\u00a0\u00a0Clef and I are on board.\u00a0\u00a0Will you help us?\"\n\n\n\nA smile was the only answer he received.\u00a0\u00a0It was also the only one he needed.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present, A Few Weeks Later__:\n\n\n\nQuikngruvn Halifax cursed his parents for not the first time as he re-affixed his name-badge and proceeded through the opening door.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past few years, he'd worked himself up to the position of chief archivist in the Foundation, a post he was immensely proud of.\u00a0\u00a0The offer for transfers to other, safe sites had come in over the years, but he'd remained at Site-19, comfortable in the hustle and bustle of the Foundation's largest site.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe looked around his perfectly arranged office, paying careful attention to everything and adjusting the few trays the cleaning staff had bumped when cleaning the previous night.\u00a0\u00a0He reached for the stereo remote on the corner of his desk and pressed play.\u00a0\u00a0He stopped, looked at the remote and back at the stereo, pressed the button again, and frowned.\u00a0\u00a0He walked over to cabinet, prepared to reach behind it to reconnect a cord he was sure the janitors had disconnected when he felt the circle of cool steel pressed into the back of his neck.\n\n\n\n\"I want you to understand, Halifax, that while I have nothing against you, I am fully prepared to plaster the contents of your skull all over that wall.\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid you disabled my old access code, so I'll be needing yours.\u00a0\u00a0Now.\"\n\n\n\nQuikngruvn's body tensed when he heard the voice, realizing immediately who was right behind him, who had used the antiquated access code, and what was pressed against his neck.\u00a0\u00a0A reputation came with the presence of the legendary Dr. Kondraki, one which he was in no way eager to discover the validity of.\u00a0\u00a0He eased his hand up to his collar, unclipped the name badge, and held it over his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"That's a good boy, now.\"\n\n\n\nQuikngruvn saw as a hand reached over his shoulder, turning on the stereo and cranking up the volume.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry about the knee.\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the shot and the harsh drumming of the music meshed well, and the solid slap of the cold, metal butt of the gun against his head brought a welcomed repose from excruciating reality.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Eleven Years Earlier__:\n\n\n\n\"We have to separate him from 963, then present our evidence.\u00a0\u00a0We'll never even make it to a formal hearing otherwise.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why don't we just chuck him through a Hell gate?\u00a0\u00a0Don't we have a few of those?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because, he's our friend.\u00a0\u00a0We should help him as best we can.\"\n\n\n\n\"Speak for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I've never liked Bright.\"\n\n\n\n\"You've never liked anyone.\"\n\n\n\n\"Point being?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, the plan stands.\u00a0\u00a0We kill Bright's current body, contain 963, present our evidence, and then hope we don't get our wrists slapped.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's an awful plan.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then what do you suggest?\"\n\n\n\n\"Poison him, then burn him.\u00a0\u00a0Then, we put 963 through 093 and pretend it never happened.\"\n\n\n\n\"Too complicated.\u00a0\u00a0It would never work.\"\n\n\n\n\"We could just use explosives.\u00a0\u00a0Explosives always work.\"\n\n\n\n\"963 is practically indestructible.\u00a0\u00a0An explosion big enough to take it out would be more than enough to burn off the atmosphere.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, just for killing him.\u00a0\u00a0Small explosion, then a series of them to bury the body in rubble.\u00a0\u00a0While they're sorting it out, we can convince them to do what we want with the medallion.\"\n\n\n\n\"You guys are forgetting one problem.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what's that, Glass?\"\n\n\n\n\"He's the director, now.\u00a0\u00a0He's going to have guards.\u00a0\u00a0//Good// guards.\"\n\n\n\n\"Guards, Glass?\u00a0\u00a0Really?\u00a0\u00a0That's what you're worried about?\"\n\n\n\n\"For God's sake, Glass, I'm a god damned legend.\u00a0\u00a0You think I can't handle a few trained monkeys?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not going to be that easy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\n\n\"The guards are him too.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jack's a scientist, not an army.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why don't we just wait for a more opportune moment?\u00a0\u00a0Why are we rushing this, anyhow?\"\n\n\n\n\"Have you //seen// some of the reports coming out of Site-19?\u00a0\u00a0For god's sake, there have been more decommissions in the last month than there have been in the entire life of the Foundation.\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard about a few of them.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure why 914 was disassembled, but he had a good argument for 447.\u00a0\u00a0Too much of a hazard on site.\"\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation has a mission to carry out.\u00a0\u00a0We're the wall between humanity and all the shit that would break their minds.\u00a0\u00a0We hold it back; we don't blow it up.\"\n\n\n\n\"I've blown up plenty of shit for them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not stuff that didn't need it!\u00a0\u00a0He's changing the mission!\"\n\n\n\n\"He's claiming that everything destroyed was a threat to the survival of the Foundation.\"\n\n\n\n\"107 was a threat?\"\n\n\n\n\"107 was decommed?\"\n\n\n\n\"47 Safe SCPs, 28 Euclid.\u00a0\u00a0Gone.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then we're agreed, yes?\u00a0\u00a0We have to do this.\u00a0\u00a0He has to be stopped, our evidence has to be presented.\"\n\n\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good.\u00a0\u00a0We strike tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\nDr. Kondraki had spent the last few years haunting the halls of various sites, taking on the roles of people who did or didn't exist, acting in a million tiny ways, most of them either obnoxious or harmless.\u00a0\u00a0The occasional missing sample, the carefully made blueprints for the various sites, reports on newly recovered artifacts--all passed along to the Global Occult Coalition.\u00a0\u00a0The little group was a useful tool, for now, and he hoped to keep using them into the foreseeable future.\u00a0\u00a0He'd always been good at killing things, and it was one of the few activities that they appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0He could see why Clef had worked with them.\n\n\n\nHe was pressed hard against the hallway's curved walls, 408 carefully guarding him, as he waited for the approaching guard to get a little closer.\u00a0\u00a0It should be a fairly simple process.\u00a0\u00a0Enter the security point, open the proper containment units with Halifax's code, and clear a path straight to their insurance.\u00a0\u00a0He couldn't imagine finding the location of a bunch of failed experiments would be so damn hard, but Bright had covered the tracks of his weakness fairly well, if inadvertently.\u00a0\u00a0It would, of course, be here at Site-19, where Bright could keep an eye on it.\u00a0\u00a0But Site-19 was very, very big.\u00a0\u00a0And there were many, many places to hide something.\n\n\n\nImants had done his job well, and now it was up to Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0One last run into the belly of the beast.\u00a0\u00a0One last mission before everything would be over, finally.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation had taken several steps away from where it had been when he'd been an agent.\u00a0\u00a0There were fewer and fewer containments, more and more Neutralizations.\u00a0\u00a0He was even aware of a few cities that had been razed after experiments were conducted there and found to have less than optimal results.\u00a0\u00a0The O5 were further and further removed, the Director given more and more power.\u00a0\u00a0He might have liked the position fifteen years ago, but time had mellowed his ambitions.\u00a0\u00a0Slightly.\n\n\n\nThe guard rounded the last bend, slowly approaching the coded door.\u00a0\u00a0He placed his thumb over the checkpoint, causing the door to beep once, cheerily, and open.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki stepped out, bringing a well timed chop down on his foe's neck, causing him to stumble, but not fall.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki cursed as he pulled the sawed off shotgun out from under his coat as the guard looked up at him.\n\n\n\n\"Konny?\"\n\n\n\nKondraki's eye's widened.\u00a0\u00a0\"Jack?\"\n\n\n\nThe guard's hand flew to the alarm, slamming down on it as Kondraki's finger squeezed the trigger.\u00a0\u00a0The blast blew away much of the guard's face, though much too slowly to avoid the unfortunate consequences.\u00a0\u00a0The guard meant one thing: Jack had activated 963-2.\n\n\n\nHe stepped over the body, scanned Halifax's name badge, and started running.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Eleven Years Earlier__:\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, Glass thought they should have gone with Clef's plan.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe charges were set in a fairly open area, with a remote detonator rigged to the wall.\u00a0\u00a0They waited as the first security crew passed, until they knew the Jack with 963 would be directly above the explosion and sprung the trap.\n\n\n\nClef spun around the forward corner, putting two shells each into the forward guards' backs as they turned to see the erupting flames around their charge.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki emptied his sidearm into the rear guard from a safe, hidden corner as Imants dropped the remaining ceiling into the corridor with a well-timed grenade in the ventilation system.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe entire attack had been executed flawlessly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"That was too easy,\" said Kondraki, eying the guard's bodies.\u00a0\u00a0\"Jack's not a soldier, but he's also not an idiot.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nClef nodded.\u00a0\u00a0\"He probably put 963 on one of the guards.\"\n\n\n\n\"Or he's not here at all.\"\u00a0\u00a0Everyone looked up at Glass, the young doctor nervously running his hand through his hair.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe four of them looked at each other as the alarms started blaring.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\nA brilliant flash of light blinded Kondraki as he rounded the corner, making the floating images around him shudder as 408 lost members of its hive.\u00a0\u00a0He fired the pistol over his shoulder twice, stopping after he heard a grunt and fall.\u00a0\u00a0The storage chamber he needed would be nearby, and if he was lucky\u2014\n\n\n\nA second blast of light flew ahead of Kondraki, cutting through the illusion and scattering the burned husks of butterflies through the air.\u00a0\u00a0He slid around a second corner, bringing the pistol up under the guard's chin and scattering his thoughts and memories over the ceiling without stopping.\u00a0\u00a0He leaped through the air as a second guard attempted to bull rush him from behind, firing downward into the man's lower back as he twisted sharply to avoid another blast of light.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt would have been impressive if he'd left anyone alive to witness it.\n\n\n\nHe found the door and scanned Halifax's card, entering the lab and sealing the door behind him.\u00a0\u00a0He walked across the room, putting a bullet into the forehead of a stunned researcher, and pulled several green vials out of a row of test tubes, placing them in his pocket.\u00a0\u00a0He smiled, running through the rest of the plan in his head.\n\n\n\nThen, he shrugged, muttered \"Fuck it\" under his breath, and reloaded his gun.\u00a0\u00a0If he was doing this, he was going to do it his way.\u00a0\u00a0He was going to have fun.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Eleven Years Earlier__:\n\n\n\nGlass had been captured first.\u00a0\u00a0He'd not been trained for any sort of combat, so when the hoard of trained shock troops poured into the hallway following the explosion, he'd held his hands in the air and waited for them to quit beating him into the ground.\u00a0\u00a0He heard about Clef's capture, how it'd taken them four hours to get through the traps he set in his outer office and another two to actually lay hands on the man.\u00a0\u00a0Imants had managed to hole up in the ventilation system for almost two days before they found him.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki had actually come quietly, having been found in his office apparently doing paperwork.\n\n\n\nGlass heard about the other trials through his guard.\u00a0\u00a0Clef had been sentenced quickly, Kondraki mere hours later.\u00a0\u00a0It was the next morning before Imants had been sentenced, as there was apparently a fair amount of dissent about the extent to which he'd been involved and how much he'd been influenced by his superiors.\u00a0\u00a0The sentence had been the same, nonetheless: indefinite stasis.\n\n\n\nGlass sat in his cell, listening to the footsteps, trying not to think about the stories he'd heard from other people who'd experienced stasis.\u00a0\u00a0Cold dreams; frozen memories.\u00a0\u00a0They could never remember what they'd dreamed, only the cold.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was the next morning when the guard approached his cell.\u00a0\u00a0Glass contemplated trying to hit the guard over the head and escape, but he knew that he wouldn't last more than two or three steps into the hall.\u00a0\u00a0He allowed them to cuff him, requested an opportunity to examine himself in the mirror, and after doing so, walked down the hallway, flanked by the guards.\n\n\n\nA series of blurry and darkened screens greeted him in the courtroom; he steeled himself and listened to the charges.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\nKondraki could hear the footsteps charging him, herding him.\u00a0\u00a0It was the problem with fighting with someone who could effectively create a hive mind with the right kind of telepathy.\u00a0\u00a0And the Foundation had the right kind, especially since they'd cut up 182's and 116's respective brains and played around with them.\n\n\n\nHe took a short cut he knew he shouldn't, but Jack could go fuck himself if he thought that Kondraki would do what he wanted him to.\u00a0\u00a0He slid into one of the maintenance closets, a place he'd gotten used to hiding in over the years, and looked for one of the access pipes.\u00a0\u00a0He found one marked \"Pest Control\" and opened the access nozzles, filling them with two of the vials he'd stolen earlier.\u00a0\u00a0He looked around him and the butterflies flitting through the air and frowned, muttering quietly under his breath.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\n\nHe turned back to the door, kicking it open and having 408 project an illusion of himself in front of the opening, smirking as a hail of gunfire issued from the left.\u00a0\u00a0He swung low out of the opening, bringing the pistol level and putting a bullet into the neck of both men firing, noting as they fell the dangling Foundation symbols strung around their necks.\u00a0\u00a0'Jack,' he thought.\n\n\n\nKondraki started running.\u00a0\u00a0He'd have to get to the climate control quickly, the one for this sector, or the plan would be pointless.\u00a0\u00a0It wouldn't take much longer, not now.\u00a0\u00a0Another turn and then a quick shot straight to-- \n\n\n\nThe bullet tore through his thigh, hollow tip causing more damage than he might otherwise have preferred.\u00a0\u00a0He fell hard against the right wall, having 408 project him falling to the left, and fired a shot backwards wildly.\u00a0\u00a0He pulled himself further, ripping a sleeve off his shirt and tying it around his leg tightly.\u00a0\u00a0He could barely feel his leg, and he knew that there weren't enough members of 408 left alive to cover the blood.\u00a0\u00a0If this was going to happen, it would have to be soon.\n\n\n\nHe struggled forward, smiling as the two symbol wearing guards pursuing him put several rounds into the illusory corpse.\u00a0\u00a0He took the time to turn and aim carefully, putting a shot into both of their heads before bringing himself into the climate control center.\n\n\n\nThe room wasn't that much different than any one of a dozen across Site-19, but this one had the controls he needed.\u00a0\u00a0He found the Infestation Control Station that had been in place since 439 had been forcibly Neutralized.\u00a0\u00a0He looked at the handful of butterflies around him one last time and pressed the command sequence, releasing the anti-parasitics into the air.\n\n\n\nGlass erupted from the screen as two loud blasts sounded behind him, forcing him to roll out of the chair as blood loss made his vision swim.\u00a0\u00a0He struggled away from the station as a hoard of footsteps approached him.\n\n\n\nThe pesticide had a faint hint of mint to it, Kondraki noticed, smiling.\u00a0\u00a0408 died in the air around him, the multiple projections fading with them.\u00a0\u00a0His leg ached and bled in spite of the tourniquet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You shouldn't have come alone, Konny.\"\n\n\n\nKondraki looked up at the handful of men, all wearing the same expression, all wearing the same medallion.\n\n\n\n\"What makes you think I came alone, Jack?\"\n\n\n\n\"Bluffing, at this point?\"\u00a0\u00a0Three men with crests around their necks approached Kondraki and kicked him in the stomach.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki heard several Brights laugh as the dying butterflies tried to project an illusion around the dying, middle-aged doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He brought a hand out to brush his hair back off his forehead as he looked up at his foe.\n\n\n\n\"When have I ever lied to you, Jack?\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n__Elsewhere__:\n\n\n\nImants turned the corner, running as stealthily as possible up the corridor, ignoring the green, acidic mist the sprayed from the ceiling. If the last round of reports from their informant had been correct, the package he was looking for was in the second room on the left, Corridor 23-B.\u00a0\u00a0With everyone going after Kondraki, he shouldn't have any problems finding the package.\n\n\n\nAs the door slid open, he slowly walked into the room, looking quickly to either side for unexpected surprises.\u00a0\u00a0He was pleased to find none.\n\n\n\nImants stepped forward, ignoring the new set of erupting sirens.\u00a0\u00a0He looked down at the red disk and collected it into a cloth, slipping it into his pocket.\u00a0\u00a0Two sets of plastic explosives later, he left the room, running as fast as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki's plan gave him two minutes, but he wanted to be further away.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\nThe mist was beginning to die down as dozens more Jack Brights surrounded Kondraki, watching him bleed.\u00a0\u00a0A bouncy, black-haired woman walked to the front of the crowd.\u00a0\u00a0She smiled, condescendingly, leaning over the injured man.\n\n\n\n\"You've gotten old and slow, Konny.\u00a0\u00a0No one would have caught you ten years ago.\"\n\n\n\nHe sneered.\u00a0\u00a0\"No one did.\"\n\n\n\nShe smiled at him again.\u00a0\u00a0\"I guess you're right.\u00a0\u00a0It's a shame really.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation could have used you, Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0Your talents.\u00a0\u00a0No one other than Clef had more confirmed decommissions than you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With our new programs, you might have had a place here again.\"\n\n\n\n\"I've not had a place here in a long time, Jack.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, I guess you haven't.\u00a0\u00a0Any last requests?\"\n\n\n\n\"None.\u00a0\u00a0But I do have one question,\" said Kondraki, pushing himself up and leaning back against his legs.\n\n\n\n\"That's not a request,\" replied Jack.\n\n\n\n\"It's close enough.\u00a0\u00a0Humor me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is this everyone?\" asked Kondraki.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\n\n\"Is this everyone?\" repeated Kondraki.\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you really bring every copy of yourself to fight me?\"\n\n\n\nBright's eyes narrowed.\u00a0\u00a0All of them.\n\n\n\n\"Because, Jack, if you did, that was a god damned stupid thing to do.\"\n\n\n\nKondraki reached into both pockets.\u00a0\u00a0He pulled his gun out of the first.\u00a0\u00a0Out of the second, he pulled a green vial.\u00a0\u00a0Forty faces blanched in recognition, for the first time noticing the scent of the pesticide as the stopper on the vial flew through the air, and the substance contained within it splashed on Kondraki's face.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dozens of eyes turning to see the butterflies on the ground sparking and twitching as they died.\n\n\n\n\"A body is a body, Jack.\u00a0\u00a0See you in hell, you son of a bitch.\u00a0\u00a0All of you.\"\n\n\n\nKondraki raised the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger.\u00a0\u00a0As the bullet passed through his skull, he felt an instant of 447's reaction taking place.\u00a0\u00a0But then, reality was gone, and all that was left was an aftermath.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Eleven Years Earlier__:\n\n\n\n\"None of you are listening!\" screamed Glass, his face shuddering.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's not Jack Bright!\u00a0\u00a0Not anymore!\u00a0\u00a0It didn't happen all at once!\u00a0\u00a0It was putting a pebble on the beach.\u00a0\u00a0And then another and another.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, the whole thing is hidden, and you never noticed!\"\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Glass, please calm yourself.\u00a0\u00a0You've obviously experienced some kind of psychotic break\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"I've experience nothing of the sort!\u00a0\u00a0You don't get it!\" he shouted, his voice cracking.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's not his whole personality, not even a big part of it.\u00a0\u00a0It's inches of the football field.\u00a0\u00a0But soon, it'll be worse.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, Doctor, you've committed a serious crime, have no evidence, and rallied enough of our less... controllable members together to convince us you planned nothing less serious than another break like the Chaos Insurgency, as Dr. Bright concluded.\u00a0\u00a0Given your family history, it seems a logical\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"I've got all the proof I need sitting right there,\" screeched Glass, pointing at Bright's current body.\u00a0\u00a0\"One question.\u00a0\u00a0That's all I ask.\u00a0\u00a0Just one.\"\n\n\n\nThe face on the other side of the screen seemed to frown for a moment before visibly shrugging.\u00a0\u00a0\"Fine.\u00a0\u00a0Ask away.\"\n\n\n\nGlass looked at Jack Bright, narrowing his eyes as if to stare right through the visibly disturbed looking doctor.\n\n\n\n\"Jack.\u00a0\u00a0What do you want more than anything else in the world?\"\n\n\n\nBright looked surprised.\u00a0\u00a0He smirked, the concern draining from his face.\u00a0\u00a0\"To serve the Foundation.\"\n\n\n\nGlass's face cracked as he smiled in triumph.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's not true, Jack.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice from beyond the screen sounded again.\u00a0\u00a0\"Enough.\u00a0\u00a0The trial is over.\u00a0\u00a0We have the utmost faith in Dr. Bright, and this line of questioning will change nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Glass, you are to be suspended in cryogenic stasis for no fewer than thirty years.\"\n\n\n\nGlass turned to the screen, eyes widening in shock.\u00a0\u00a0\"What?\u00a0\u00a0Don't you see?\u00a0\u00a0It's not right!\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't want to serve!\"\n\n\n\nTwo men approached the dais and took either of Glass's arms, proceeding to pull him away from the court room.\u00a0\u00a0Glass's voice echoed over the cacophony of voices and static, screaming in rage.\n\n\n\n\"IT'S NOT RIGHT!\u00a0\u00a0HE WANTS TO DIE, YOU IDIOTS!\u00a0\u00a0HE JUST WANTS TO DIE!\"\n\n\n\nHe was still screaming when they put him in the chamber.\u00a0\u00a0Directly across from him, he saw Kondraki's cryogenic chamber.\u00a0\u00a0For a moment, it shimmered, a wing flapping momentarily out of place.\u00a0\u00a0Glass had only a moment to register his surprise before the ice took him.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Present__:\n\n\n\nThere was also a multitude of voices shouting now, though the shapely female form lay mostly still and silent, only occasionally coughing or hacking up blood.\u00a0\u00a0Murderers and thieves, rapists and pedophiles, and a handful of those who had just stumbled onto the wrong military base or into the wrong room.\u00a0\u00a0Most of them were angry, calling out with rage and anger at their denied immortality, while others were crying loudly in sadness.\u00a0\u00a0But somewhere, deep down at the bottom, there was one who was silent.\u00a0\u00a0Unspeakably and immeasurably relieved.\n\n\n\n'It feels good to finally die,' thought Jack.\n\n\n\nHe watched from the bottom upward as the voices winked out, disappearing like vanishing stars.\u00a0\u00a0He heard them silenced, one by one, the din growing quieter and quieter as the others finally went away, finally vanished, blowing away like flakes of ash.\u00a0\u00a0He felt whole again for the first time in decades.\u00a0\u00a0It took an incredibly long time, though it seemed to happen all at once; then, Jack was alone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was dark, and cold, and wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0Dreadfully wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0Then he saw it, just barely out of the corner of his eyes, exploding with the intensity of its presence.\u00a0\u00a0A single dot of light, still shimmering.\n\n\n\n'No,' thought Jack.\u00a0\u00a0'God damn it.\u00a0\u00a0NO!'\n\n\n\nHe tried to speak and could not.\u00a0\u00a0The body he was occupying shuddered, racked out a final, desperate cough, and died.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Seven Weeks Later__:\n\n\n\nInterim Director Gears sat uncomfortably in the chair, but it didn't show.\u00a0\u00a0Kondraki's actions would leave Site-19 unusable for the foreseeable future, unless some antidote to 447-2's effect could be found.\u00a0\u00a0Since it didn't seem likely, Gears had been forced to relocate.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that, he was the chief surviving member of Site-19's command structure, leaving him with a very large mess to clean up.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else would have broken under the stress of Gears' responsibilities.\u00a0\u00a0And Gears himself might be feeling a similar strain, but it didn't show.\n\n\n\nHe had shuffled through more paperwork in the last month than in his entire career.\u00a0\u00a0While he'd passed on some of it to Iceberg, he was still inundated daily with requests, notes on recovery, and personnel casualty reports.\u00a0\u00a0Today was no different.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe leafed through half a dozen SCP recoveries, making notes about the number of newly Neutralized objects that would have to be refiled.\u00a0\u00a0At the bottom of the stack, he found a file he thought he wouldn't see again anytime soon.\u00a0\u00a0It was a thick folder, full of notes on exploration and chromatically based locations.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-093.\u00a0\u00a0Status: //Missing, Presumed Destroyed//.\n\n\n\nHe looked over the several pages of examinations Bright had ordered on the object, noted how the prognosis for repair had looked quite promising, and quietly closed the folder, setting it aside and retrieving the logs from the last day of Site-19.\u00a0\u00a0It took him a few minutes to find the security access data, and less time to discover that one of the many alarms tripped that day was to 093's research lab.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it was the only alarm set off in its sector.\u00a0\u00a0He slowly put the puzzle together, sighed, and looked at the next file: \"Concerning the Locating and Elimination of the Rogue Agent Imants.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe read the report, signed at the bottom of the file to note he'd seen it, and then checked the box next to \"Denied,\" citing a need for Foundation resources to be applied more scrupulously during such a difficult time.\u00a0\u00a0With luck, that would keep them from rediscovering the object before Imant's new employers could destroy it.\u00a0\u00a0He'd had a long day, and he was fairly glad when it was over, but it didn't show.\n\n\n\nGears placed the manila folder in his outbox, and a crease knitted his eyebrows briefly and was gone.\n\n\n\n\"Goodbye, Jack.\"\n\n\n\nHe turned off the lights and left the room.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__The Future__:\n\n\n\nThe stems of wheat waved slowly, methodically, in the wind.\u00a0\u00a0The corpse would have been long desiccated, save for the fact that there weren't enough bacteria left alive to do much to it.\u00a0\u00a0All over the middle and lower torso, bulges of tumorous growths protruded under the skin, sometimes breaking through.\u00a0\u00a0The expression spoke of one who had died in agony.\u00a0\u00a0Even now, the eyes were painfully cramped shut, the teeth broken from gnashing and grinding, though the face still flickered and changed occasionally.\u00a0\u00a0Every so often, it flitted into a mocking smile, the last vestige of a man who, in his final moments, had passed on his death to his enemy.\u00a0\u00a0A final, spiteful act of a spiteful man.\u00a0\u00a0But not one that was undeserved.\n\n\n\nHow long the body lay there, no one could know, but eventually, coasting over the horizon, there came a form.\u00a0\u00a0A strange half body, dragging itself with its arms, incomprehensibly large and impossibly terrible.\u00a0\u00a0It came, smelling blood, something it hadn't sensed in many, many years.\u00a0\u00a0The face, if it could be called that, was leering down at the slowly rotting corpse, smelling it, possibly savoring it, although its intentions would be impossible to tell.\u00a0\u00a0There was no way to know the mind of such a creature, so far was it removed from its original, human roots.\n\n\n\nThe mouth slowly lowered down to the ground, surrounding the body and swallowing it whole.\u00a0\u00a0For a brief instant, it ceased moving.\u00a0\u00a0But in the next moment, it howled--though if in anguish or joy it could not be said.\u00a0\u00a0The form bent and twisted as the souls of a dead world became overwritten, leaving only a single, mingled consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0It doubled over as the eternal torment of billions became the burden of one.\u00a0\u00a0It shuddered as the knowledge of countless minds were added to its own.\n\n\n\nAnd just on the other side of the mirror, just out of sight, remained Jack Bright, trapped eternally between realities.\n\n\n\nWaiting.\u00a0\u00a0Festering.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlotting.\n\n[[include <a

The picture and sound quality of the footage is substandard, with audio-visual distortions, cuts, and missing footage common throughout the recordings. The disks will play on any standard DVD player, and the contained footage has been copied and archived.</p>\n<p>No anomalous effects have been recorded regarding the disks themselves or the act of watching them. While the possibility of a hoax exists, such an undertaking would require several million dollars to produce equivalent special effects.</p>\n<p>Anomalous Item 20224 was recovered from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on July 16, 20\u2588\u2588. The previous owner was unaware of the object\u2019s origins, claiming to have received them through an anonymous seller on the internet. Anomalous Item 20224 is currently stored in Low Security Vault 2 of Site 19.</p>\n<p>The following transcript lists only a general overview of major events of note.</p>\n<p><strong>Disk 1</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. The scene shown resembles the Serengeti Plain. A large group of wildebeests, gazelles, zebras, and other savannah wildlife are shown around a watering hole.</li>\n<li>00:12 \u2013 The voices of the filmmakers are heard for the first time. Three distinct voices are heard, one female, two male. (Subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively.) The language spoken does not correlate with any known language, and has only been partially decoded. The Subjects seem to be describing the water hole scene, as the camera focuses on the drinking animals. Narration of this kind continues throughout most other segments of Anomalous Item 20224.</li>\n<li>05:15 \u2013 Subjects 1 and 3 appear on camera. Both are wearing similar outfits: utilitarian clothing in various shades of brown with backpacks for carrying equipment and supplies. For unknown reasons, the Subjects\u2019 faces have been blotted out. Documentary shifts focus to a nearby termite mound.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The next 34:06 of tape contains no anomalous or otherwise notable content.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>39:21 \u2013 First anomalous content seen. At this point in the documentary, focus is set upon a small bird, which on closer inspection is clearly a blue jay (<em>Cyanocitta cristata</em>). The bird displays no physical anomalies, besides being native to North America, not Africa.</li>\n<li>40:05 \u2013 Blue jay flies away. During the filming, the Subjects did not seem to find the presence of a non-native bird confusing or remarkable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The next 19:55 of tape contains no anomalous or otherwise notable content. All animals featured show no unusual characteristics or behaviors.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>60:00 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 2</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Scene shows a series of rocky foothills at the base of a mountain chain to the west. Scrub vegetation is common.</li>\n<li>00:10 \u2013 Camera focuses on a snake in the brush. (<em>Researcher\u2019s note: Identified as a western diamondback rattlesnake.</em>) Subject 3, grabs the snake by the tail and uses a stick to handle it for the camera as Subject 1 narrates. At 01:01, the snake is released.</li>\n<li>01:01 \u2013 Cut. Next shot is the middle of a segment on a large ant colony. Ants are a light shade of blue.</li>\n<li>01:15 - Camera focuses on a group of roughly fifty soldier ants attacking a reef gecko (<em>Sphaerodactylus notatus</em>, native to Florida). Ants are tearing away chunks of flesh with their pincher-like jaws. The gecko survives for nearly a minute before one of the ants cuts the gecko\u2019s jugular vein.</li>\n<li>02:12 \u2013 Cut. Scene is now focusing on a pack of vultures feeding on the carcass of a large Bactrian camel.</li>\n<li>05:36 \u2013 Cut. The camel stands up and attempts to bite a vulture. The remains of the camel\u2019s internal organs are dangling from the hole in its abdomen.</li>\n<li>05:45 \u2013 Cut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>There are no visuals for the next 10:45. Sound is in the form of five individual narrations on unknown subjects.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>16:21 \u2013 Cut. Camera focuses on a red panda drinking from a shallow stream. The creature is estimated to be roughly the size of a Kodiak bear.</li>\n<li>17:00 \u2013 Red panda leaves the shot, but not before defecating on the stream\u2019s edge. Subject 1 makes a comment, followed by laughter from Subjects 2 and 3.</li>\n<li>17:06 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 3</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Scene opens with Subject 2 in mid-sentence, pointing the camera at a snowy cliffside roughly 100-150m tall. Subjects are seen wearing mountain climbing gear, and appear to be discussing the best way to ascend the cliff face.</li>\n<li>02:20 \u2013 Subjects begin ascending the cliffside.</li>\n<li>02:43 \u2013 Cut. Following footage is a shot of the horizon from two-thirds up the cliffside. The savannah featured in Disk 1 can be seen in the distance.</li>\n<li>02:56 \u2013 Subject 2 is startled by the sudden appearance of a large, indistinct creature (<em>Researcher\u2019s note: believed to be a flying fox or similar large bat.</em>) and nearly drops the camera. Subject 3 scolds him while Subject 1 laughs.</li>\n<li>03:00 \u2013 Cut. Subjects are at the top of the cliff, looking out over the edge. Judging by the shadows cast by the mountain, it is nearing mid-afternoon.</li>\n<li>03:15 \u2013 Cut. Scene takes place later in the day, near sundown. Subjects are walking up a winding dirt path. A small village can be seen ahead of them.</li>\n<li>05:23 \u2013 Subjects arrive in the village. Buildings are small and stone, with wooden roofs. There are no signs of recent habitation: many of the buildings are in states of disrepair, and much of the village is covered in deep snow drifts. Subjects walk through the village for the next 03:40, conversing sporadically. No other life is seen.</li>\n<li>09:03 \u2013 Cut. Subjects are now approaching a larger building, a large section of which has collapsed and filled with snow. Subjects 1 and 3 step inside first, Subject 2 follows with the camera four seconds later.</li>\n<li>09:07 \u2013 Jump cut. Subjects are standing on top of a fallen chunk of masonry. A large swarm of black insects (<em>Researcher\u2019s note: Further analysis suggests that the creatures resemble terrestrial trilobites rather than any known insect.</em>), each at least 30cm in length, swarms around beneath them. Subject 3 opens his backpack, taking out a plastic box. Checking its contents once, he throws it across the hall. The swarm moves towards the box and begins consuming it. The camera lingers on the creatures as the subjects escape.</li>\n<li>09:56 \u2013 Cut. Subjects are inside another building, and it is now night. The house\u2019s fire pit has been cleared out and a fire has been set up. Subject 1 is feeding a black-furred chinchilla some of her rations, while Subject 3 narrates.</li>\n<li>10:28 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 4</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Subjects are walking through a thick forest of large fungal bodies. Judging by the slope of the ground, it is presumed that the Subjects are descending the foothills on the opposite side of the mountain. Available light indicates that it is mid-morning or mid-afternoon.</li>\n<li>00:15 \u2013 Movement is spotted to the right. Camera focuses on a dark shape moving deeper into the forest and out of sight. (<em>Researcher\u2019s note: Further analysis shows that the creature is a quagga, a relative of the zebra which has been extinct since 1883.</em>) One frame seems to show the creature unfurling wings, but the footage is too blurred to confirm this.</li>\n<li>00:45 \u2013 Cut. Scene shows a stone pillar, which has been partially eroded by encroaching hyphae. The pillar is clearly a marker of some sort, and Subject 1 is attempting to decode the symbols that are etched into it.</li>\n<li>01:30 \u2013 Subject 1 now steps away from the pillar. Judging by her tone of voice, she was incapable of translating any of the symbols. Subjects move onward through the forest.</li>\n<li>02:41 \u2013 There is a heavy seismic disturbance. The camera becomes unsteady as Subject 2 stumbles. The fungal \u2018trees\u2019 can be seen to sway in uniform motion.</li>\n<li>02:44 - The next ten seconds contain no visuals or audible sound. Analysis has shown an ultrasonic note within the blank segment. As it does not vary in frequency, it is hypothesized to be artificial in origin.</li>\n<li>02:54 \u2013 Cut. Subject 1 is now observing a large black beetle. Every few seconds she prods it with a twig. After she does this several times, the beetle flares its carapace outward, showing the brilliant orange-yellow coloration underneath.</li>\n<li>03:40 \u2013 The beetle sprays a yellow-green fluid from its abdomen at Subject 1, who doesn\u2019t step away quick enough to avoid the acid. She shouts in pain and attempts to wipe it off. Subject 3 steps in to help her.</li>\n<li>04:02 \u2013 Cut. Scene now shows a shallow gully, populated by a species of cup-shaped fungi, the smallest being a meter across. Subject 2 sets the camera on a tripod and walks away. No unusual events are recorded over the next 14:12.</li>\n<li>18:14 \u2013 A juvenile Javanese rhinoceros walks into the gully, sniffing the air. It makes a direct route towards one of the larger cup fungi and walks inside. The cup closes over it, and sounds of distress are heard from within after a few seconds. The silhouette of the rhinoceros inside the fungus can be seen as it struggles to free itself.</li>\n<li>19:20 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 5</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Scene shows the Subjects on the shores of a lake. Local geography resembles the American southwest, with thick scrub vegetation and several clumps of tamarisk on the lakeshore. Subject 3 is filling a canteen from the lake.</li>\n<li>00:30 \u2013 Subject 3 points out a disturbance behind the camera. Camera turns to see a group of about fifteen lemur-like creatures emerging from the brush, roughly twenty meters away. Camera zooms in to show that they are walking on their hind legs and are carrying sharpened sticks. The \u201ctribe\u201d ignores the presence of the Subjects.</li>\n<li>00:54 \u2013 The tribe begins to drink from the lake. Subject 1 makes a short narrative comment, showing some surprise at the event, but only enough to suggest that this is a rare find. She continues with the narration as usual.</li>\n<li>02:03 \u2013 The tribe\u2019s lookout makes a startled yelp. The other lemurs take notice.</li>\n<li>02:04 \u2013 A dromaeosaurid dinosaur of considerable size (<em>Researcher\u2019s Note: Believed to be an adult</em> Utahraptor) appears. Subjects begin to run away. Sounds of the conflict can be heard over the Subjects\u2019 footsteps.</li>\n<li>02:25 \u2013 Camera is directed back at the tribe. Lemurs have now either run away or been killed. The <em>Utahraptor</em> is feeding on the dead.</li>\n<li>03:13 \u2013 Cut. Scene now shows the dinosaur dead on the ground, with numerous bullet holes in its head and chest area. Subject 1 is scolding Subject 3, who is seen disassembling a long-barreled rifle.</li>\n<li>03:20 \u2013 Cut. Subjects have walked down the eastern shore of the lake. There are some unusual disturbances in the water. This continues for the next 01:36.</li>\n<li>04:04 \u2013 A <em>Megatherium</em> (giant ground sloth), which is seen to have six limbs instead of four, approaches the lake shore from the brush. After looking around the area, it bends down to drink.</li>\n<li>04:56 \u2013 Disturbances in the water increase as a large creature emerges from the lake. As only the upper portion is visible, identification is difficult. A membranous dome, lined by numerous frills of skin and cartilage, is visible. The skin is semi-transparent, showing a bulbous structure underneath. Visible are several triple-jointed arms (<em>Researcher\u2019s note: Five limbs have been counted</em>), which have thick black fur and hands with two opposable thumbs.</li>\n<li>04:59 \u2013 Unknown creature lashes its arms at the area behind the sloth, attacking a pack of raptors much like the one before, which were preparing to launch an attack on the sloth.</li>\n<li>05:12 \u2013 Unknown creature grabs a raptor in one of its hands and throws towards the Subjects, who it misses by no less than a meter. Camera moves to look at the body: the spine has been snapped on impact.</li>\n<li>05:17 \u2013 Cut. Subjects have left the lake behind, and are now climbing over a short ridge. Animal noises can be heard from the other side.</li>\n<li>05:18 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 6</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Video shows that the Subjects are traversing a salt plain on foot. Sky is overcast and dark. No life can be seen anywhere.</li>\n<li>00:07 \u2013 Subject 3 begins to speak. The conversation is casual and continues for the next twelve minutes without notable events.</li>\n<li>12:07 \u2013 Cut. Conversation is still ongoing, though Subject 1\u2019s tone has become increasingly worried.</li>\n<li>12:55 \u2013 Argument between Subjects 1 and 3 breaks out. Subject 2 steps in, attempting to break it up.</li>\n<li>13:12 \u2013 Cut. Conversation has ended. Subjects appear weary. Distant thunder is heard in the background. The camera pans to show two unknown creatures (<em>Researcher\u2019s note: Creatures are estimated to be between 200 and 250 meters tall</em>) on the southern horizon. From the distance, they appear to be masses of cartilage and gas sacks at least five stories tall. Subject 1 speaks, but is interrupted by a low roar in the distance. The Subjects look to the east, then at each other. Subject 3 speaks briefly, and the group resumes walking.</li>\n<li>14:04 \u2013Disk ends</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 7</strong><br/>\nData lost. The disk has been overwritten with several episodes of the anime <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. Closer inspection has shown several one-frame fragments of the original video that remain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>09:33 \u2013 A forest of crooked, leafless trees. Part of a bleached skeleton of unknown origin is seen in the corner of the frame.</li>\n<li>26:01 \u2013 Shot was taken within a small clearing containing six boulder-sized pearls which provide ambient light through unknown means. The clearing is within a dense formation of jagged limestone towers, known as <em>tsingy</em>.</li>\n<li>27:50 \u2013 Two frames of a bloated, wormlike creature with three flexible proboscises covered in feathered tufts.</li>\n<li>44:27 \u2013 A dark blue screen filled with complex mathematical formulae appearing in white Arabic numerals.</li>\n<li>54:14 \u2013 The final segment lasts for approximately three seconds. The soundless footage is too shaky for any conclusive analysis, but it would appear that Subject 2 is running up a steep incline at substantial speed with the camera rolling.</li>\n<li>55:02 \u2013 Static. Faint screams and gunfire can be heard beneath the white noise. A voice identified as Subject 2 can be heard shouting before being drowned out.</li>\n<li>55:46 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disk 8</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Scene shows subjects slowly descending a rocky slope towards the bottom of a small valley. There is no plant life to be seen. There is a substantial amount of smog and dust in the air, giving a red-brown color to the sky.</li>\n<li>00:04 \u2013 Camera focuses on the bottom of the valley, observing a large settlement. Shacks are constructed primarily of corrugated sheet metal and are built several layers thick. Some figures can be seen around the edge of the settlement.</li>\n<li>00:09 \u2013 Cut. Subjects have reached the bottom of the incline and are standing roughly 10 meters from the edge of the slum. At this distance the conditions within the settlement are seen in detail. The narrow spaces between shacks are lined with sewage and large patches of grey lichen or fungus. Roughly twenty inhabitants can be seen, though they pay no attention to the Subjects. The inhabitants are human, and their appearance is consistent with the living conditions around them: they are filthy, dressed in rags, malnourished, and many sport deformities. They walk without any seeming purpose, noticing little, if any, of their surroundings.</li>\n<li>00:12 \u2013 Subjects start walking slowly towards the settlement\u2019s edge. Inhabitants still show no signs of notice.</li>\n<li>00:15 \u2013 One of the slum inhabitants, male with severe deformities, sharply turns his head to face the camera.</li>\n<li>00:16 \u2013 Inhabitant begins running towards Subjects.</li>\n<li>00:19 \u2013 Inhabitant begins attacking Subjects, screaming \u201cLet us go! Let us go, you sick fucks!\u201d</li>\n<li>00:23 \u2013 A mob has formed around the Subjects, who attempt to fight them off.</li>\n<li>00:25 \u2013 Camera is knocked out of Subject 2\u2019s hand, and records the mob\u2019s feet for seven seconds afterwards. Screams can be heard off-screen.</li>\n<li>00:32 \u2013 Disk ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/video-oddity\">A Video Oddity</a>\" by Djoric, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The camera lingers on the creatures as the subjects escape.\n\n* 09:56 \u2013 Cut. Subjects are inside another building, and it is now night. The house\u2019s fire pit has been cleared out and a fire has been set up. Subject 1 is feeding a black-furred chinchilla some of her rations, while Subject 3 narrates.\n\n* 10:28 \u2013 Disk ends.\n\n\n\n**Disk 4**\n\n* 00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Subjects are walking through a thick forest of large fungal bodies. Judging by the slope of the ground, it is presumed that the Subjects are descending the foothills on the opposite side of the mountain. Available light indicates that it is mid-morning or mid-afternoon.\n\n* 00:15 \u2013 Movement is spotted to the right. Camera focuses on a dark shape moving deeper into the forest and out of sight. (//Researcher\u2019s note: Further analysis shows that the creature is a quagga, a relative of the zebra which has been extinct since 1883.//) One frame seems to show the creature unfurling wings, but the footage is too blurred to confirm this.\n\n* 00:45 \u2013 Cut. Scene shows a stone pillar, which has been partially eroded by encroaching hyphae. The pillar is clearly a marker of some sort, and Subject 1 is attempting to decode the symbols that are etched into it.\n\n* 01:30 \u2013 Subject 1 now steps away from the pillar. Judging by her tone of voice, she was incapable of translating any of the symbols. Subjects move onward through the forest.\n\n* 02:41 \u2013 There is a heavy seismic disturbance. The camera becomes unsteady as Subject 2 stumbles. The fungal \u2018trees\u2019 can be seen to sway in uniform motion.\n\n* 02:44 - The next ten seconds contain no visuals or audible sound. Analysis has shown an ultrasonic note within the blank segment. As it does not vary in frequency, it is hypothesized to be artificial in origin.\n\n* 02:54 \u2013 Cut. Subject 1 is now observing a large black beetle. Every few seconds she prods it with a twig. After she does this several times, the beetle flares its carapace outward, showing the brilliant orange-yellow coloration underneath.\n\n* 03:40 \u2013 The beetle sprays a yellow-green fluid from its abdomen at Subject 1, who doesn\u2019t step away quick enough to avoid the acid. She shouts in pain and attempts to wipe it off. Subject 3 steps in to help her.\n\n* 04:02 \u2013 Cut. Scene now shows a shallow gully, populated by a species of cup-shaped fungi, the smallest being a meter across. Subject 2 sets the camera on a tripod and walks away. No unusual events are recorded over the next 14:12.\n\n* 18:14 \u2013 A juvenile Javanese rhinoceros walks into the gully, sniffing the air. It makes a direct route towards one of the larger cup fungi and walks inside. The cup closes over it, and sounds of distress are heard from within after a few seconds. The silhouette of the rhinoceros inside the fungus can be seen as it struggles to free itself.\n\n* 19:20 \u2013 Disk ends.\n\n\n\n**Disk 5**\n\n* 00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Scene shows the Subjects on the shores of a lake. Local geography resembles the American southwest, with thick scrub vegetation and several clumps of tamarisk on the lakeshore. Subject 3 is filling a canteen from the lake.\n\n* 00:30 \u2013 Subject 3 points out a disturbance behind the camera. Camera turns to see a group of about fifteen lemur-like creatures emerging from the brush, roughly twenty meters away. Camera zooms in to show that they are walking on their hind legs and are carrying sharpened sticks. The \u201ctribe\u201d ignores the presence of the Subjects.\n\n* 00:54 \u2013 The tribe begins to drink from the lake. Subject 1 makes a short narrative comment, showing some surprise at the event, but only enough to suggest that this is a rare find. She continues with the narration as usual.\n\n* 02:03 \u2013 The tribe\u2019s lookout makes a startled yelp. The other lemurs take notice.\n\n* 02:04 \u2013 A dromaeosaurid dinosaur of considerable size (//Researcher\u2019s Note: Believed to be an adult// Utahraptor) appears. Subjects begin to run away. Sounds of the conflict can be heard over the Subjects\u2019 footsteps.\n\n* 02:25 \u2013 Camera is directed back at the tribe. Lemurs have now either run away or been killed. The //Utahraptor// is feeding on the dead.\n\n* 03:13 \u2013 Cut. Scene now shows the dinosaur dead on the ground, with numerous bullet holes in its head and chest area. Subject 1 is scolding Subject 3, who is seen disassembling a long-barreled rifle.\n\n* 03:20 \u2013 Cut. Subjects have walked down the eastern shore of the lake. There are some unusual disturbances in the water. This continues for the next 01:36.\n\n* 04:04 \u2013 A //Megatherium// (giant ground sloth), which is seen to have six limbs instead of four, approaches the lake shore from the brush. After looking around the area, it bends down to drink.\n\n* 04:56 \u2013 Disturbances in the water increase as a large creature emerges from the lake. As only the upper portion is visible, identification is difficult. A membranous dome, lined by numerous frills of skin and cartilage, is visible. The skin is semi-transparent, showing a bulbous structure underneath. Visible are several triple-jointed arms (//Researcher\u2019s note: Five limbs have been counted//), which have thick black fur and hands with two opposable thumbs.\n\n* 04:59 \u2013 Unknown creature lashes its arms at the area behind the sloth, attacking a pack of raptors much like the one before, which were preparing to launch an attack on the sloth.\n\n* 05:12 \u2013 Unknown creature grabs a raptor in one of its hands and throws towards the Subjects, who it misses by no less than a meter. Camera moves to look at the body: the spine has been snapped on impact.\n\n* 05:17 \u2013 Cut. Subjects have left the lake behind, and are now climbing over a short ridge. Animal noises can be heard from the other side.\n\n* 05:18 \u2013 Disk ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Disk 6**\n\n* 00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Video shows that the Subjects are traversing a salt plain on foot. Sky is overcast and dark. No life can be seen anywhere.\n\n* 00:07 \u2013 Subject 3 begins to speak. The conversation is casual and continues for the next twelve minutes without notable events.\n\n* 12:07 \u2013 Cut. Conversation is still ongoing, though Subject 1\u2019s tone has become increasingly worried.\n\n* 12:55 \u2013 Argument between Subjects 1 and 3 breaks out. Subject 2 steps in, attempting to break it up.\n\n* 13:12 \u2013 Cut. Conversation has ended. Subjects appear weary. Distant thunder is heard in the background. The camera pans to show two unknown creatures (//Researcher\u2019s note: Creatures are estimated to be between 200 and 250 meters tall//) on the southern horizon. From the distance, they appear to be masses of cartilage and gas sacks at least five stories tall. Subject 1 speaks, but is interrupted by a low roar in the distance. The Subjects look to the east, then at each other. Subject 3 speaks briefly, and the group resumes walking.\n\n* 14:04 \u2013Disk ends\n\n\n\n**Disk 7** \n\nData lost. The disk has been overwritten with several episodes of the anime //Cowboy Bebop//. Closer inspection has shown several one-frame fragments of the original video that remain.\n\n* 09:33 \u2013 A forest of crooked, leafless trees. Part of a bleached skeleton of unknown origin is seen in the corner of the frame.\n\n* 26:01 \u2013 Shot was taken within a small clearing containing six boulder-sized pearls which provide ambient light through unknown means. The clearing is within a dense formation of jagged limestone towers, known as //tsingy//.\n\n* 27:50 \u2013 Two frames of a bloated, wormlike creature with three flexible proboscises covered in feathered tufts.\n\n* 44:27 \u2013 A dark blue screen filled with complex mathematical formulae appearing in white Arabic numerals.\n\n* 54:14 \u2013 The final segment lasts for approximately three seconds. The soundless footage is too shaky for any conclusive analysis, but it would appear that Subject 2 is running up a steep incline at substantial speed with the camera rolling.\n\n* 55:02 \u2013 Static. Faint screams and gunfire can be heard beneath the white noise. A voice identified as Subject 2 can be heard shouting before being drowned out.\n\n* 55:46 \u2013 Disk ends.\n\n\n\n**Disk 8**\n\n* 00:00 \u2013 Disk starts. Scene shows subjects slowly descending a rocky slope towards the bottom of a small valley. There is no plant life to be seen. There is a substantial amount of smog and dust in the air, giving a red-brown color to the sky.\n\n* 00:04 \u2013 Camera focuses on the bottom of the valley, observing a large settlement. Shacks are constructed primarily of corrugated sheet metal and are built several layers thick. Some figures can be seen around the edge of the settlement.\n\n* 00:09 \u2013 Cut. Subjects have reached the bottom of the incline and are standing roughly 10 meters from the edge of the slum. At this distance the conditions within the settlement are seen in detail. The narrow spaces between shacks are lined with sewage and large patches of grey lichen or fungus. Roughly twenty inhabitants can be seen, though they pay no attention to the Subjects. The inhabitants are human, and their appearance is consistent with the living conditions around them: they are filthy, dressed in rags, malnourished, and many sport deformities. They walk without any seeming purpose, noticing little, if any, of their surroundings.\n\n* 00:12 \u2013 Subjects start walking slowly towards the settlement\u2019s edge. Inhabitants still show no signs of notice.\n\n* 00:15 \u2013 One of the slum inhabitants, male with severe deformities, sharply turns his head to face the camera.\n\n* 00:16 \u2013 Inhabitant begins running towards Subjects.\n\n* 00:19 \u2013 Inhabitant begins attacking Subjects, screaming \u201cLet us go! Let us go, you sick fucks!\u201d\n\n* 00:23 \u2013 A mob has formed around the Subjects, who attempt to fight them off.\n\n* 00:25 \u2013 Camera is knocked out of Subject 2\u2019s hand, and records the mob\u2019s feet for seven seconds afterwards. Screams can be heard off-screen.\n\n* 00:32 \u2013 Disk ends.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "featured", "horror", "otherworldly", "tale"], "title": "A Video Oddity - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/video-oddity", "year": 2010}, "wasteland": {"created_at": "2010-02-02T05:50:00", "creator": "Dr Gerald", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gerald", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gerald", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-02T05:50:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gerald", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gerald", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-02T05:52:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gerald", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gerald", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-02T06:20:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gerald", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gerald", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-02T06:20:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gerald", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gerald", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 1", "date": "2010-02-02T08:19:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-20T02:49:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-20T08:43:00"}, {"author": "Mulciber", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mulciber", "comment": "Voting (4/5)", "date": "2010-02-21T01:10:00"}, {"author": "Mulciber", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mulciber", "comment": "Fixed spacing in impromptu voting module so existing votes would display.", "date": "2010-02-21T01:11:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

It was a particularly hot day, the sun's rays bouncing off the endless gray of the wasteland, nothing but the occasional ravine or dead, naked tree dotting the endless fields of stone. Only the sighing wind gave him any company as he searched for the single source of food for miles, the devious rock lizards that scuttled throughout the rocky outcroppings.With his bow slung across his back, Gareth moved across the waste, using his hands as much as his feet to propel himself forward. The dull army helmet on his head and rags covering his clothing helped him blend in perfectly with the surroundings.The world was an unforgiving one, where you were either fast and silent or easy prey for a wandering Beast. Gareth was a straggler, one of those who chose to fend for themselves instead of joining one of the dozen armies that fought for control over this war-torn planet.</p>\n<p>Hugging close to a somewhat large boulder, Gareth pulled out his bow, spying a black lizard sunning itself on the rocks a dozen meters away. Knocking an arrow, he carefully aimed. He would get one shot at this, rock lizards were skittish and easily frightened creatures. Understandable, considering that they lived in a place where nameless abominations roamed freely and destroyed or devoured anything that was in their way.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the rock lizard perked up its head, staring off into the distance. Giving a squeak of fear, it scurried under the rocks, probably into some hidden burrow under the ground. Gareth paused, and placed a hand on the ground. He shuddered with fear, feeling the all-too-familiar vibrations in the earth. Quickly, he unstrapped his field glasses, looking off in the direction the lizard had. There, in the distance, was a black band of moving figures covering the horizon. Troops, there was an army approaching.</p>\n<p>Twiddling a dial at the side of the glasses, he zoomed in on them, scanning the ranks for a banner that would identify which army this was. If he knew which particular faction this army belonged to, he might be able to judge how they were going to act, and hopefully find a way to avoid encountering them. He spotted it, a massive flag depicting five jagged shards of metal joining together to form a twisted circle. Gareth groaned.</p>\n<p>They were Assemblage troops. The Church was on the move.</p>\n<p>Still sticking low to the ground, Gareth darted across the broken landscape. He moved diagonally away from the advancing army, trying to get away from them as fast as possible. It was unwise to run into soldiers belonging to the Holy Order of the Assemblage. If they found him, they would only give him a single choice: Become a devoted member of the army; join the Priesthood of the Assemblage God; or be turned into one of the mindless automatons the Church employed. Not content with summoning their monstrous deity to this planet, the Church had to subjugate the rest of the human species to their way.</p>\n<p>If he had been lucky, Gareth would have run into one of warmongering tribes devoted to the Hunter. That way, he could have thrown down his bow and arrows, shown he was no threat or challenge to them, and be left alone relatively unscathed. Even the horrifically inhuman minions of the immortal Lizard King would have been preferable to the proselytizing Church. A quick death to the purge being committed by the hordes the Lizard King had supposedly pulled from another realm would be far less painful to the iron grip the Church held on their recruits.</p>\n<p>As Gareth scurried across the rocky wastes, he could feel another set of vibrations shivering through the earth. Looking up in horror, he could see a second army, this one moving up from the south, towards him and the Assemblage army. Lying prone on the ground, he pulled up his field glasses in an attempt to see this new army.</p>\n<p>There was no point in searching for a banner with this group, however. This army's allegiance was made clear by the white paint all of the soldiers wore on their faces, put there in homage to the cruel masked being they served that was known only as the White Lord. The White Lord, who sat upon a throne as black as death, who could reach into the minds of men and tear their souls from their bodies. The White Lord, who revelled in corruption and could make the very walls bleed in fear of him. The White Lord, who commanded his army through sheer terror, and held a grip on them that could rival that of the Assemblage Church's.</p>\n<p>The two most fanatical armies in the world were about to clash, and Gareth was stuck between them.</p>\n<p>Forgetting any attempt at stealth, Garet stood up and bolted, making a mad dash to get out of the way of the two incoming titans. His feet slammed into the ground as he ran, sheer fear driving him away from the soon-to-be warzone. The opposing forces were large, but he had a good distance between the two, and he prayed to the gods that he reached the edge of the armies before they met.</p>\n<p>Luck was on his side, as it were, and when the forces were about to clash he was a good distance away from the field of battle. He kept running though, on the chance there was a flanking attempt that could sweep him up. As he moved, he could hear the two sides scream their respective battle cries of 'In the holy name of the Assembled God!' and 'For his high honor, the White Lord!'. A monstrous scream split the air as the two monstrous armies slammed into each other. Gareth was fairly far away from them, but their cries could be heard for miles.</p>\n<p>Gareth slowed down. He was far enough from them, he was safe. He continued his slow trot away from them, not even worrying to stay low to the ground. There weren't going to be any Beasts in the area, they were smart enough to avoid a battle. As he walked, Gareth sighed, depressed at the state the world was in. He had been a straggler since the day he was born, knowing no life other than hiding from monsters and armies, knowing no landscape except for the dead rock called Earth. There were small towns and cities scattered across the planet, yes, but Gareth had found living in them a difficult life, for they drew Beasts to them like moths to a light.</p>\n<p>It hadn't always been this way, according to the legends Gareth had heard as a child. Back then, years and years ago, the world was said to be a lush, green place, with water that wasn't brown and trees that had leaves. It was a world where armies hadn't destroyed the planet, and humans didn't have the need to hide from hideous monstrosities.</p>\n<p>That was almost three hundred years ago, according to the stories.</p>\n<p>From what he heard from the elders, something had happened two hundred and eighty years ago. The ancient tales told of a series of monstrous explosions across Earth. The first happened in the eastern portion of some long-dead nation called 'America'. That had been the trigger, for soon after that a wave of explosions popped up across the planet, everywhere from populated cities to the middle of the most desolate deserts. Out of these explosions came the Beasts, hundreds of terrifying creatures that would warp reality and kill without mercy.</p>\n<p>The nations of the world united, and attempted to vanquish these beasts. At first, they were successful. At first. But with the Beasts came the kings and generals that now fought for dominance. There was the Assemblage Church, the Hunter, the White Lord, the Lizard King, the Queen of Darkness, and the leaderless Army of the Dead, along with other monstrous rulers. Whatever it was that caused those explosions, it had sealed the fate of humankind and doomed them to a death of eternal warring and a husk of a planet as a home.</p>\n<p>Gareth sat down, now completely out of sight of the raging armies. Looking across this section of the blasted, dead terrain, he realized he needed to dig himself a new home before night fell. His stomach growled, the combat had lost him a chance to eat today. That was all that was left for humans. Hunger, death, and a desolate wasteland. For three centuries monsters and demons had fought for control, and they could do nothing but pray that their new masters would be a kind one, futile as that may sound. There would be no end, and no hope for humans.</p>\n<p>Gareth shook his head, setting out to build himself a new home. Such things were not his place to dwell upon, he was too busy trying to survive.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/wasteland\">Wasteland</a>\" by Dr Gerald, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The White Lord, who sat upon a throne as black as death, who could reach into the minds of men and tear their souls\u00a0\u00a0from their bodies. The White Lord, who revelled in corruption and could make the very walls bleed in fear of him. The White Lord, who commanded his army through sheer terror, and held a grip on them that could rival that of the Assemblage Church's.\n\n\n\nThe two most fanatical armies in the world were about to clash, and Gareth was stuck between them.\n\n\n\nForgetting any attempt at stealth, Garet stood up and bolted, making a mad dash to get out of the way of the two incoming titans. His feet slammed into the ground as he ran, sheer fear driving him away from the soon-to-be warzone. The opposing forces were large, but he had a good distance between the two, and he prayed to the gods that he reached the edge of the armies before they met.\n\n\n\nLuck was on his side, as it were, and when the forces were about to clash he was a good distance away from the field of battle. He kept running though, on the chance there was a flanking attempt that could sweep him up. As he moved, he could hear the two sides scream their respective battle cries of 'In the holy name of the Assembled God!' and 'For his high honor, the White Lord!'. A monstrous scream split the air as the two monstrous armies slammed into each other. Gareth was fairly far away from them, but their cries could be heard for miles.\n\n\n\nGareth slowed down. He was far enough from them, he was safe. He continued his slow trot away from them, not even worrying to stay low to the ground. There weren't going to be any Beasts in the area, they were smart enough to avoid a battle. As he walked, Gareth sighed, depressed at the state the world was in. He had been a straggler since the day he was born, knowing no life other than hiding from monsters and armies, knowing no landscape except for the dead rock called Earth. There were small towns and cities scattered across the planet, yes, but Gareth had found living in them a difficult life, for they drew Beasts to them like moths to a light.\n\n\n\nIt hadn't always been this way, according to the legends Gareth had heard as a child. Back then, years and years ago, the world was said to be a lush, green place, with water that wasn't brown and trees that had leaves. It was a world where armies hadn't destroyed the planet, and humans didn't have the need to hide from hideous monstrosities.\n\n\n\nThat was almost three hundred years ago, according to the stories.\n\n\n\nFrom what he heard from the elders, something had happened two hundred and eighty years ago. The ancient tales told of a series of monstrous explosions across Earth. The first happened in the eastern portion of some long-dead nation called 'America'. That had been the trigger, for soon after that a wave of explosions popped up across the planet, everywhere from populated cities to the middle of the most desolate deserts. Out of these explosions came the Beasts, hundreds of terrifying creatures that would warp reality and kill without mercy. \n\n\n\nThe nations of the world united, and attempted to vanquish these beasts. At first, they were successful. At first. But with the Beasts came the kings and generals that now fought for dominance. There was the Assemblage Church, the Hunter, the White Lord, the Lizard King, the Queen of Darkness, and the leaderless Army of the Dead, along with other monstrous rulers. Whatever it was that caused those explosions, it had sealed the fate of humankind and doomed them to a death of eternal warring and a husk of a planet as a home.\n\n\n\nGareth sat down, now completely out of sight of the raging armies. Looking across this section of the blasted, dead terrain, he realized he needed to dig himself a new home before night fell. His stomach growled, the combat had lost him a chance to eat today. That was all that was left for humans. Hunger, death, and a desolate wasteland. For three centuries monsters and demons had fought for control, and they could do nothing but pray that their new masters would be a kind one, futile as that may sound. There would be no end, and no hope for humans.\n\n\n\nGareth shook his head, setting out to build himself a new home. Such things were not his place to dwell upon, he was too busy trying to survive.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "broken-god", "chase", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "military-fiction", "post-apocalyptic", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Wasteland - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wasteland", "year": 2010}, "we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard": {"created_at": "2010-03-02T08:33:00", "creator": "AdminBright", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-02T08:33:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-03T08:50:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-30T07:44:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-30T08:13:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-30T08:17:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "Bright, I love you, but you can't use apostrophes for shit. <3", "date": "2010-03-30T08:28:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-31T06:04:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-31T07:56:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-01T03:05:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 7", "date": "2010-04-01T03:07:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-01T03:09:00"}, {"author": "Fred423", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fred423", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-01T04:38:00"}, {"author": "Pair Of Ducks", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pair-of-ducks", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 10", "date": "2010-04-02T04:04:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 7", "date": "2010-04-02T04:37:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:07:00"}, {"author": "Asthix", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/asthix", "comment": "'place' to 'placed' near the end", "date": "2011-04-12T17:15:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

And <em>this</em> is to attract 682's attention. How were you planning on getting SCP-963 onto 682?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, ah, a launcher, and, ah, hmmm\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Exactly.

And other people continually insult a vengeful immortal who holds no regard for human life. The really stupid people feed Bright straight lines. \"This.\" He raised the cane to point in a vaguely Samet direction, and pressed a button. Immediately, a purplish arc of electricity arched through the air, grounding itself in Samet's injured foot. The doctor screamed, desperately rolling his wheelchair backwards, even as the bandages caught fire. \"Hmm, Dr. Samet, it appears as if you have some sort of metal in your cast. Wonder how that happened.\"</p>\n<p>As Samet's lackeys hurried to put their boss out, Bright turned to Dr. Light and nodded. \"All right, Sophia, we know what we're doing. What're the current odds?\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Light checked her clipboard, frowning. \"2-1 it doesn't work. 5-1 you get in it and rampage across the site. Side bet on that one, even odds are that you use said rampage to kill Samet over there. 10-1 says something goes wrong, and you get stuck inside 682. 20-1 odds say that this goes bottoms up, and we all end up as you, somehow.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like those odds.\"</p>\n<p>\"963!\" Samet yelled, as his foot smoldered. \"You! You, I! You-!\"</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Samet. Understand this.\" Bright stalked over to tower over the other researcher. \"I am about to be put in the most dangerous SCP we've ever discovered. I will offer you this deal then. If you cover your feet in barbecue sauce, I will stop at them.\"</p>\n<p>And with that, Bright turned, and stalked down to the staging floor.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Jack Bright awoke with a headache, his memories fuzzy. There had been something\u2026 Barbecue sauce, maybe? No, something else\u2026 Oh yes, the memories came flooding back to him, him standing there with his staff, the beast charging, lightning and teeth, blood and pain, and that horrible indescribable feeling as he jumped hosts.</p>\n<p>But now- Things weren't right. He could feel cold stone beneath his back, which implied that he was lying down. And he could hear other people moving around him, so there was a good chance he was still in the Foundation. And there was always barbecue sauce. Wait, what?</p>\n<p>\"Jack? We really need you right now sir.\" A familiar voice called from above. Slowly, Jack opened his eyes, his face fixed in a pre-emptive frown. Standing over him, in a rather strange looking chain mail hauberk, was a familiar looking Mexican man. Something about him-</p>\n<p>\"I know you, don't I?\" The other man leaned down, helping Jack to his feet.</p>\n<p>\"Not really sir. Please, you have to come with me.\" His grip on Jack's arm was firm, his other hand holding firmly to a long staff. Jack stopped, suddenly, watching the other people moving past. All of them were dressed the same, a chain mail hauberk with gold rings in a circle over the heart, surrounding a ring of red rings. All of them held the same staff.</p>\n<p>\"You're D-113. You're the first, aren't you?\" Jack couldn't help but stare. It had been a long time since that first one.</p>\n<p>\"Well, the answer to that is yes and no. And yes. But not really. Uhm. Right, we do it your way, stupidly blunt. You see sir, none of this is real.\" As he gestured at the castle walls, and the people around him.</p>\n<p>\"Well, duh. Credit me with a little sense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, okay, right, that makes things, uhm, easier. See, your mind, it isn't ready for this. It can't, uhm, really deal with how 682 sees things. So, it came up with this as a defense. Only, it's not just your mind. 963 is involved, and somehow, bits and pieces of the leftovers of those you've taken over are being animated, to help. Only, it's still part of you. Uhm. Does that make sense?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not even a little bit.\" As they pushed through a great wooden door. \"But I do understand where you're com\u2026ing\u2026 from.\" Jack stared upwards at the sky, for once, without a voice. Above him was the thing, the creature, what we in our limited scope called SCP-682. And it was glorious. A beautiful, nightmarish, disturbing yet intriguing creature, spread across the sky, the ground, the horizon, hell, everything that wasn't Jack and his castle. Barbecue Sauce.</p>\n<p>\"I, well, then, whoo.\" Jack frowned more deeply, as several armored people suddenly ran up beside him. Even the old man was there, although he shouldn't have been. He could feel the impact lessen even as they stood there. \"Right, sharing the load, got it.\" He wrenched his eyes away from the\u2026 thing, turning to his own ramparts. A twisted, mangled castle that Escher would be proud of loomed above and below him, and from every corner, pieces of him stood, staffs in hand, striking out against the barbecue sauce creature. Purple lightning arched here and there, playing across the surface of the beast, carving inroads, yoking it to his command.</p>\n<p>\"We're stuck, aren't we?\"</p>\n<p>\"Encaged, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\"Have to figure out a way to get out. We have some barbecue sauce to serve up.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pardon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Figure of speech. Look, I need\u2026\" Bright racked his memories, oh so many of them. The answer would be there, somewhere. And then it was there, standing in front of him. Researcher Class 2 Damon Smith, promoted to Dr. Bright in the line of duty. Damon had always had a fear of being enclosed. And that would get them out of here.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, Damon, take that staff, and link up! Remember how it feels, to be in small spaces. Locked in, no one to hear you, how to get out\u2026\" The apparition before Jack raised its staff, as his limbs trembled in fear. A line of energy lashed out from the staff, scoring a long line in the creature above them.</p>\n<p>And it began to change. From the inside, the effects were hard to tell, but everyone there could feel it. Something different was happening. The Dragon was moving.</p>\n<p>Jack couldn't help but laugh. \"BARBECUE SAUCE!\" he called out - one of the absolute worst battle cries ever spoken. He wrenched the staff from Damon's hands, not even noticing as he pushed the poor researcher over the edge, not caring as a mouth of the beast snapped up the helpless researcher.</p>\n<p>Lines of energy, a mental projection of Jack's control over 682, lashed out in force from the castle construct. He could feel that it was doing his will, doing what he told it to do. He knew some part of his brain was actually inside the creature, controlling it, seeing through its eyes, but he also knew he could never hope to understand how it saw the world. So, down here, he fought a pitched battle, using metaphor and simile to act in his stead.</p>\n<p>But it wasn't to last. Even as he found himself filled with the knowledge that he had done what he wanted to do, the dragon fought back. Its ferocious claws ripped into the castle, shattering walls. Its foul breath played along the walls, sending body-forms reeling, tumbling back into the safety of 963. Jack knew he could not last.</p>\n<p>With the last of his mental will, he set the creature back, commanded it to return, and then he too retreated to the safety of his nightmares.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bright could feel the soft texture of a bed beneath him. Cotton sheets from the feel of it, so not his own bed. Thin mattress, the smell of disinfectant, the leather straps on his wrists, neck, chest and feet\u2026 Yes, he must be in Medical.</p>\n<p>\"Subject is waking up, Overseer.\"</p>\n<p>Bright opened his eyes slowly, aware of the feel of cold metal pressed against his temple. His eyes flicked first to the figure holding the gun, one of the Overseer's goon squad, none of them actually worth remembering. Then, to the sound of the voice, the lovely Dr. Light doing her medical duties. Finally, to the last remaining space by his bed, filled with a monitor screen, on which a black outline of a person could be seen.</p>\n<p>A mechanical voice, carefully filtered to remove any identifying markers, spoke to him. \"Please identify yourself.\" With or without identifying markers, Bright still knew who was behind the outline.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Jack Bright, Level five Researcher, Personnel Director of far too many sites, yada yada yada.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who is your sister?\" The voice continued. Bright knew it was the questions that needed to be asked, to make sure he was himself.</p>\n<p>\"Claire Pierce. And, in answer to your next three questions, 31-20-35, the Ebola virus, and purple monkey dishwasher.\"</p>\n<p>\"Identity confirmed. Dr. Bright, what is your last memory?\"</p>\n<p>Bright thought hard for a long moment, then spoke. \"I was\u2026 going up against 682, wasn't I? Yeah, I had the staff and everything! Guess he didn't snap up 963, huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Bright, SCP-963 was in contact with SCP-682 for the better part of a week. For the first 36 hours, SCP-682 remained in a comatose state. Shortly thereafter, it proceeded to grow large claws, and tunnel its way through its containment, causing a massive breach. Incredibly, SCP-682 only injured one researcher, and then allowed itself to be meekly shepherded back to its containment. 682 paced its room for another 24 hours, at which point it again went comatose. 10 hours ago, SCP-963 was excreted from SCP-682's brow. A team retrieved it, and immediately placed it upon the body you now wear. You have not stirred since. Can you add anything to this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry Six, I got nothing. Although\u2026\" Bright frowned, and licked his lips. \"Why do I taste barbecue sauce?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Someplace else entirely, the dragon curled around its newest acquisition. Such a tiny little man thing. It had never thought that the foul creatures could possibly teach it anything. But one of them had.</p>\n<p>The beast circled around the memories of Damon Smith, absorbed them, made them its own. And, in learning how to fear, it added one more tool to its vast arsenal, one more way that it could change itself, and finally eliminate the scourge it called man.</p>\n<p>Coming (Relatively) Soon!<br/>\n<a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/confessions-of-a-teenage-scp\">Chapter Three: Confessions of a Teenage SCP</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard\">We're Off To Be The Lizard</a>\" by AdminBright, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Side bet on that one, even odds are that you use said rampage to kill Samet over there. 10-1 says something goes wrong, and you get stuck inside 682. 20-1 odds say that this goes bottoms up, and we all end up as you, somehow.\" \n\n\n\n\"I like those odds.\"\n\n\n\n\"963!\" Samet yelled, as his foot smoldered. \"You! You, I! You-!\"\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Samet. Understand this.\" Bright stalked over to tower over the other researcher. \"I am about to be put in the most dangerous SCP we've ever discovered. I will offer you this deal then. If you cover your feet in barbecue sauce, I will stop at them.\"\n\n\n\nAnd with that, Bright turned, and stalked down to the staging floor.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nJack Bright awoke with a headache, his memories fuzzy. There had been something... Barbecue sauce, maybe? No, something else... Oh yes, the memories came flooding back to him, him standing there with his staff, the beast charging, lightning and teeth, blood and pain, and that horrible indescribable feeling as he jumped hosts.\n\n\n\nBut now- Things weren't right. He could feel cold stone beneath his back, which implied that he was lying down. And he could hear other people moving around him, so there was a good chance he was still in the Foundation. And there was always barbecue sauce. Wait, what?\n\n\n\n\"Jack? We really need you right now sir.\" A familiar voice called from above. Slowly, Jack opened his eyes, his face fixed in a pre-emptive frown.\u00a0\u00a0Standing over him, in a rather strange looking chain mail hauberk, was a familiar looking Mexican man. Something about him- \n\n\n\n\"I know you, don't I?\" The other man leaned down, helping Jack to his feet.\n\n\n\n\"Not really sir. Please, you have to come with me.\" His grip on Jack's arm was firm, his other hand holding firmly to a long staff. Jack stopped, suddenly, watching the other people moving past. All of them were dressed the same, a chain mail hauberk with gold rings in a circle over the heart, surrounding a ring of red rings. All of them held the same staff.\n\n\n\n\"You're D-113. You're the first, aren't you?\" Jack couldn't help but stare. It had been a long time since that first one.\n\n\n\n\"Well, the answer to that is yes and no. And yes. But not really. Uhm. Right, we do it your way, stupidly blunt. You see sir, none of this is real.\" As he gestured at the castle walls, and the people around him.\n\n\n\n\"Well, duh. Credit me with a little sense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, okay, right, that makes things, uhm, easier. See, your mind, it isn't ready for this. It can't, uhm, really deal with how 682 sees things. So, it came up with this as a defense. Only, it's not just your mind. 963 is involved, and somehow, bits and pieces of the leftovers of those you've taken over are being animated, to help. Only, it's still part of you. Uhm. Does that make sense?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not even a little bit.\" As they pushed through a great wooden door. \"But I do understand where you're com...ing... from.\" Jack stared upwards at the sky, for once, without a voice. Above him was the thing, the creature, what we in our limited scope called SCP-682. And it was glorious. A beautiful, nightmarish, disturbing yet intriguing creature, spread across the sky, the ground, the horizon, hell, everything that wasn't Jack and his castle. Barbecue Sauce.\n\n\n\n\"I, well, then, whoo.\" Jack frowned more deeply, as several armored people suddenly ran up beside him. Even the old man was there, although he shouldn't have been. He could feel the impact lessen even as they stood there. \"Right, sharing the load, got it.\" He wrenched his eyes away from the... thing, turning to his own ramparts. A twisted, mangled castle that Escher would be proud of loomed above and below him, and from every corner, pieces of him stood, staffs in hand, striking out against the barbecue sauce creature. Purple lightning arched here and there, playing across the surface of the beast, carving inroads, yoking it to his command.\n\n\n\n\"We're stuck, aren't we?\"\n\n\n\n\"Encaged, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\"Have to figure out a way to get out. We have some barbecue sauce to serve up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\n\n\"Figure of speech. Look, I need...\" Bright racked his memories, oh so many of them. The answer would be there, somewhere. And then it was there, standing in front of him. Researcher Class 2 Damon Smith, promoted to Dr. Bright in the line of duty. Damon had always had a fear of being enclosed. And that would get them out of here.\n\n\n\n\"Come on, Damon, take that staff, and link up! Remember how it feels, to be in small spaces. Locked in, no one to hear you, how to get out...\" The apparition before Jack raised its staff, as his limbs trembled in fear. A line of energy lashed out from the staff, scoring a long line in the creature above them. \n\n\n\nAnd it began to change. From the inside, the effects were hard to tell, but everyone there could feel it.\u00a0\u00a0Something different was happening. The Dragon was moving. \n\n\n\nJack couldn't help but laugh. \"BARBECUE SAUCE!\" he called out - one of the absolute worst battle cries ever spoken. He wrenched the staff from Damon's hands, not even noticing as he pushed the poor researcher over the edge, not caring as a mouth of the beast snapped up the helpless researcher.\n\n\n\nLines of energy, a mental projection of Jack's control over 682, lashed out in force from the castle construct. He could feel that it was doing his will, doing what he told it to do. He knew some part of his brain was actually inside the creature, controlling it, seeing through its eyes, but he also knew he could never hope to understand how it saw the world. So, down here, he fought a pitched battle, using metaphor and simile to act in his stead.\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't to last. Even as he found himself filled with the knowledge that he had done what he wanted to do, the dragon fought back. Its ferocious claws ripped into the castle, shattering walls. Its foul breath played along the walls, sending body-forms reeling, tumbling back into the safety of 963. Jack knew he could not last.\n\n\n\nWith the last of his mental will, he set the creature back, commanded it to return, and then he too retreated to the safety of his nightmares.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nBright could feel the soft texture of a bed beneath him. Cotton sheets from the feel of it, so not his own bed. Thin mattress, the smell of disinfectant, the leather straps on his wrists, neck, chest and feet... Yes, he must be in Medical.\n\n\n\n\"Subject is waking up, Overseer.\"\n\n\n\nBright opened his eyes slowly, aware of the feel of cold metal pressed against his temple. His eyes flicked first to the figure holding the gun, one of the Overseer's goon squad,\u00a0\u00a0none of them actually worth remembering. Then, to the sound of the voice, the lovely Dr. Light doing her medical duties. Finally, to the last remaining space by his bed, filled with a monitor screen, on which a black outline of a person could be seen.\n\n\n\nA mechanical voice, carefully filtered to remove any identifying markers, spoke to him. \"Please identify yourself.\" With or without identifying markers, Bright still knew who was behind the outline.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Jack Bright, Level five Researcher, Personnel Director of far too many sites, yada yada yada.\"\n\n\n\n\"Who is your sister?\" The voice continued. Bright knew it was the questions that needed to be asked, to make sure he was himself.\n\n\n\n\"Claire Pierce. And, in answer to your next three questions, 31-20-35, the Ebola virus, and purple monkey dishwasher.\"\n\n\n\n\"Identity confirmed. Dr. Bright, what is your last memory?\"\n\n\n\nBright thought hard for a long moment, then spoke. \"I was... going up against 682, wasn't I? Yeah, I had the staff and everything! Guess he didn't snap up 963, huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Bright, SCP-963 was in contact with SCP-682 for the better part of a week. For the first 36 hours, SCP-682 remained in a comatose state. Shortly thereafter, it proceeded to grow large claws, and tunnel its way through its containment, causing a massive breach. Incredibly, SCP-682 only injured one researcher, and then allowed itself to be meekly shepherded back to its containment. 682 paced its room for another 24 hours, at which point it again went comatose. 10 hours ago, SCP-963 was excreted from SCP-682's brow. A team retrieved it, and immediately placed it upon the body you now wear. You have not stirred since. Can you add anything to this?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry Six, I got nothing. Although...\" Bright frowned, and licked his lips. \"Why do I taste barbecue sauce?\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nSomeplace else entirely, the dragon curled around its newest acquisition.\u00a0\u00a0Such a tiny little man thing. It had never thought that the foul creatures could possibly teach it anything. But one of them had. \n\n\n\nThe beast circled around the memories of Damon Smith, absorbed them, made them its own. And, in learning how to fear, it added one more tool to its vast arsenal, one more way that it could change itself, and finally eliminate the scourge it called man.\n\n\n\nComing (Relatively) Soon!\n\n[[[Confessions-of-a-Teenage-SCP|Chapter Three: Confessions of a Teenage SCP]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["confessions-of-a-teenage-scp", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "action", "doctor-bright", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "surrealism", "tale"], "title": "We're Off To Be The Lizard - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard", "year": 2010}, "wednesday-1": {"created_at": "2010-02-11T03:52:00", "creator": "Cherry Pict", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Cherry Pict", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cherry-pict", "comment": "foundation tale-ing", "date": "2010-02-11T03:52:00"}, {"author": "Cherry Pict", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cherry-pict", "comment": "vote module...", "date": "2010-02-11T04:45:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-12T04:37:00"}, {"author": "Cherry Pict", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cherry-pict", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-25T22:56:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

I would sleep a little, and wake up whenever someone tried opening the door. I'd hold it shut until they gave up, and I would go back to sleep, and it would start again. I would occasionally leave to take a piss but I don't know how long I was in there. I only left because I really wanted some food.</p>\n<p>The other half of the school was gone, cut cleanly as if a giant kitchen knife had chopped it off. With it went half the girls' locker room, one of the science labs, the back wall of the gym, most of the sophomores and seniors, and a sizable chunk of the library. I only noticed because I checked the library for anyone I knew, and a lot of it had just gone. It was empty save for one of the library assistants, curled up next to a bookshelf. I left.</p>\n<p>Passing through the senior hall on the way to the cafeteria was the longest run I'd ever taken. It didn't start as a run, just a quick walk. I stopped when I heard screaming coming from one of the classrooms. I peeked inside\u2014it one of the senior English classes, and Miss Ladia was trying to control them. I watched a group of seniors advance on her as one mass, and I watched them violate her, I watched as they took turns and I watched redness pool around them all. They noticed me next.</p>\n<p>I ran, I heard them behind me, and I swear I ran for hours, tearing through air as thick as water, filled with their jeers and grasps at my arms, only wrenched out of their grip by the grace of adrenaline. Every time I blinked the cafeteria door seemed farther away and the mob nipping at my back seemed closer, and I screamed at them, \"no, no\"; they didn't understand me, they were no longer human. I crashed through the door and slammed it shut. I was hardly a match for one senior, let alone two or three or ten, they forced the door open and knocked me to the floor. Indistinct faces filled my vision until something snagged my wrist.</p>\n<p>\"Come on,\" said my captor, practically dragging me into the kitchen. I screamed at him too before realizing who it was.</p>\n<p>When I'd caught my breath, I looked over the place. I recognized the cafeteria workers, all lying on the ground with great red wounds in their stomachs, and I recognized Cyrus, locking the door.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" I said, my gaze fixed on the kitchen workers. \"Did you\u2026did you do that?\"</p>\n<p>He sat down on the floor, massaging his forehead. \"No. I just took the keys \u2014\" he nodded in the direction of the door, indicating the mob, \" \u2014before they could. They'd try to take the food.\"</p>\n<p>\"Food,\" I murmured. \"Is there any left?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, take what you want\u2026\"</p>\n<p>I stepped over the kitchen workers towards the big industrial fridge. There wasn't much variety in school food, and I suspect it will be that way until the end of humanity, but I was so thirsty I'd take anything drinkable I could get.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" said Cyrus, raising his voice a bit over the ruckus in the cafeteria, \"where were you hiding? It's been almost three days since I last saw you.\"</p>\n<p>\"The boiler room,\" I said after settling down with a carton of chocolate milk, one of those packaged burritos, and a cookie. \"It's really cramped and kind of musty but no one ever looked in there\u2026\"</p>\n<p>We were silent for a while. Cyrus looked absolutely exhausted, like he'd been up all night guarding our only food.

I would sleep a little, and wake up whenever someone tried opening the door. I'd hold it shut until they gave up, and I would go back to sleep, and it would start again. I would occasionally leave to take a piss but I don't know how long I was in there. I only left because I really wanted some food.\n\n\n\nThe other half of the school was gone, cut cleanly as if a giant kitchen knife had chopped it off. With it went half the girls' locker room, one of the science labs, the back wall of the gym, most of the sophomores and seniors, and a sizable chunk of the library. I only noticed because I checked the library for anyone I knew, and a lot of it had just gone. It was empty save for one of the library assistants, curled up next to a bookshelf. I left.\n\n\n\nPassing through the senior hall on the way to the cafeteria was the longest run I'd ever taken. It didn't start as a run, just a quick walk. I stopped when I heard screaming coming from one of the classrooms. I peeked inside--it one of the senior English classes, and Miss Ladia was trying to control them. I watched a group of seniors advance on her as one mass, and I watched them violate her, I watched as they took turns and I watched redness pool around them all. They noticed me next.\n\n\n\nI ran, I heard them behind me, and I swear I ran for hours, tearing through air as thick as water, filled with their jeers and grasps at my arms, only wrenched out of their grip by the grace of adrenaline. Every time I blinked the cafeteria door seemed farther away and the mob nipping at my back seemed closer, and I screamed at them, \"no, no\"; they didn't understand me, they were no longer human. I crashed through the door and slammed it shut. I was hardly a match for one senior, let alone two or three or ten, they forced the door open and knocked me to the floor. Indistinct faces filled my vision until something snagged my wrist.\n\n\n\n\"Come on,\" said my captor, practically dragging me into the kitchen. I screamed at him too before realizing who it was.\n\n\n\nWhen I'd caught my breath, I looked over the place. I recognized the cafeteria workers, all lying on the ground with great red wounds in their stomachs, and I recognized Cyrus, locking the door.\n\n\n\n\"What's going on?\" I said, my gaze fixed on the kitchen workers. \"Did you...did you do that?\"\n\n\n\nHe sat down on the floor, massaging his forehead. \"No. I just took the keys --\" he nodded in the direction of the door, indicating the mob, \" --before they could. They'd try to take the food.\"\n\n\n\n\"Food,\" I murmured. \"Is there any left?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, take what you want...\"\n\n\n\nI stepped over the kitchen workers towards the big industrial fridge. There wasn't much variety in school food, and I suspect it will be that way until the end of humanity, but I was so thirsty I'd take anything drinkable I could get.\n\n\n\n\"So,\" said Cyrus, raising his voice a bit over the ruckus in the cafeteria, \"where were you hiding? It's been almost three days since I last saw you.\"\n\n\n\n\"The boiler room,\" I said after settling down with a carton of chocolate milk, one of those packaged burritos, and a cookie. \"It's really cramped and kind of musty but no one ever looked in there...\"\n\n\n\nWe were silent for a while. Cyrus looked absolutely exhausted, like he'd been up all night guarding our only food. He had a switchblade in one hand and a couple keys in the other.\n\n\n\n\"Where are all the teachers?\" I said.\n\n\n\nHe shrugged. \"Some of them are dead. Some of them just disappeared.\" He paused, looking at the ceiling in thought. \"I did see one of them jump. That one freshman science teacher.\"\n\n\n\nI knew immediately who \"that one\" was--the one who kept a boa constrictor in a tank in his classroom. While Mr. Darrick was beyond help, I wondered if the snake was okay.\n\n\n\n\"I think I watched Miss Ladia die,\" I said. My voice turned hollow as I realized what had happened. \"Those guys that were chasing me, they did it. I should have done something.\"\n\n\n\nMore silence. I guess it was the closest thing to a funeral the dead would have.\n\n\n\n\"You're called Wednesday, right?\"\n\n\n\nI nodded, and was about to ask if I'd gotten his name right when something slammed hard into the kitchen door.\n\n\n\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wednesday-3 Continued in part three >>]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["wednesday-1", "wednesday-3", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Wednesday - 2 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wednesday-2", "year": 2010}, "wednesday-3": {"created_at": "2010-02-14T22:24:00", "creator": "Cherry Pict", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Cherry Pict", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cherry-pict", "comment": "chapter 3", "date": "2010-02-14T22:24:00"}, {"author": "Cherry Pict", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cherry-pict", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-25T22:54:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

No flickers of human voices or music, just the hiss of white noise. It hurt to listen to.

The pulsating of an alien's thoughts, the sound of the very farthest reaches of space.

I was about to throw open the door to the office to hide, but Cyrus dragged me into a janitors' closet instead.</p>\n<p>\"Don't go in there,\" he said, almost inaudible over the footsteps and screaming. \"Don't ever go in there.\"</p>\n<p>I almost asked why, but I stopped myself, not wanting to know. I opened the closet door just a crack and looked through into the hall.</p>\n<p>They weren't after us, I quickly realized, they were running towards the edge. They jumped. All of them, too many for me to get a count. None of them were afraid. Their running steps were utterly drowned out by a great roar like the sound the ocean makes during a storm, but much larger, more terrible than any ocean or any storm or any tangible thing on Earth. They all tumbled into the whiteness. I had known some of them. I had known all of them. I heard their monstrous sound tear out of their throats, it came from the fog and the air. The roar grew to a deafening volume. I felt like perhaps I should jump too, but when I stood to do it, Cyrus pulled me back.</p>\n<p>\"Wednesday,\" he said, almost breathless with panic. \"Wednesday.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I woke up.</p>\n<p>Above me were a few people wearing gas masks and talking amongst themselves. I couldn't hear them, their voices were only a murmur, at least until my head cleared itself a little. I rubbed my eyes.</p>\n<p>\"She's coming around,\" said one of them.</p>\n<p>I tried to speak to them. I knew I spoke their language but I didn't completely understand what they were saying.</p>\n<p>\"Hmmh,\" I mumbled, attempting to sit up. Everything felt heavy.</p>\n<p>\"What do you remember last?\" said another gas mask, but one of his fellows swatted him.</p>\n<p>\"Don't ask her now, dipshit. Wait until she's at least lucid enough to speak properly.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry.\"</p>\n<p>\"C'mon.\"</p>\n<p>One of them scooped me up and threw me over his shoulder. Another yelled in surprise.</p>\n<p>\"Snake!\"</p>\n<p>\"Well don't scream about it! Where?\"</p>\n<p>\"On her shoulder\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Is it alive?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah - \"</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry about it - \"</p>\n<p>\"Can we focus for two seconds and leave? Dunford, Barnes, stay here, we'll come back.\"</p>\n<p>I felt like I was falling from a great height. Had I jumped? If I did jump, then the other kids who jumped must have been around there somewhere too\u2026</p>\n<p>Had I just dreamed the whole thing?</p>\n<p>\"Where\u2026?\" I said, my mouth not working right.</p>\n<p>\"Don't talk yet, you'll have plenty of time for that later.\"</p>\n<p>They took me outside, and I heard many voices. They took my clothes and undid my hair and pushed me into a tent where I was soaped and hosed down by a cranky-looking woman in a white coat. I stumbled into a different tent, and the woman directed me to a metal chair. Cyrus was there too, looking far more alert than I felt.</p>\n<p>One of the gas masks handed me Rob, who was pretty wet and maybe a little stunned from the shower. He promptly curled up in my lap.</p>\n<p>All of the people in the tent were adults - none of my classmates in sight. The gas masks who had carried me out were not there either, but there were what looked like doctors and nurses and people who looked maybe they might be in the military, though something was off about them. Each had some sort of symbol on their shoulders or their chests, something I didn't recognize. They conducted their business with lowered voices just barely above a whisper.</p>\n<p>A man wearing a white coat and small round glasses was speaking to Cyrus too quietly for me to hear. Cyrus seemed to listen, I guess, but wasn't responding.</p>\n<p>The man grew frustrated with Cyrus's silence and approached me carrying a tape recorder.</p>\n<p>\"My name is Dr. Krell,\" he said in a cool voice. \"We represent the SCP Foundation.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wednesday-5\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/wednesday-4\">Wednesday - 4</a>\" by Cherry Pict, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I was about to throw open the door to the office to hide, but Cyrus dragged me into a janitors' closet instead.\n\n\n\n\"Don't go in there,\" he said, almost inaudible over the footsteps and screaming. \"Don't ever go in there.\"\n\n\n\nI almost asked why, but I stopped myself, not wanting to know. I opened the closet door just a crack and looked through into the hall.\n\n\n\nThey weren't after us, I quickly realized, they were running towards the edge. They jumped. All of them, too many for me to get a count. None of them were afraid. Their running steps were utterly drowned out by a great roar like the sound the ocean makes during a storm, but much larger, more terrible than any ocean or any storm or any tangible thing on Earth. They all tumbled into the whiteness. I had known some of them. I had known all of them. I heard their monstrous sound tear out of their throats, it came from the fog and the air. The roar grew to a deafening volume. I felt like perhaps I should jump too, but when I stood to do it, Cyrus pulled me back.\n\n\n\n\"Wednesday,\" he said, almost breathless with panic. \"Wednesday.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nI woke up.\n\n\n\nAbove me were a few people wearing gas masks and talking amongst themselves. I couldn't hear them, their voices were only a murmur, at least until my head cleared itself a little. I rubbed my eyes.\n\n\n\n\"She's coming around,\" said one of them.\n\n\n\nI tried to speak to them. I knew I spoke their language but I didn't completely understand what they were saying.\n\n\n\n\"Hmmh,\" I mumbled, attempting to sit up. Everything felt heavy.\n\n\n\n\"What do you remember last?\" said another gas mask, but one of his fellows swatted him.\n\n\n\n\"Don't ask her now, dipshit. Wait until she's at least lucid enough to speak properly.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\n\n\n\"C'mon.\"\n\n\n\nOne of them scooped me up and threw me over his shoulder. Another yelled in surprise.\n\n\n\n\"Snake!\"\n\n\n\n\"Well don't scream about it! Where?\"\n\n\n\n\"On her shoulder...\"\n\n\n\n\"Is it alive?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah - \"\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry about it - \"\n\n\n\n\"Can we focus for two seconds and leave? Dunford, Barnes, stay here, we'll come back.\"\n\n\n\nI felt like I was falling from a great height. Had I jumped? If I did jump, then the other kids who jumped must have been around there somewhere too...\n\n\n\nHad I just dreamed the whole thing?\n\n\n\n\"Where...?\" I said, my mouth not working right.\n\n\n\n\"Don't talk yet, you'll have plenty of time for that later.\"\n\n\n\nThey took me outside, and I heard many voices. They took my clothes and undid my hair and pushed me into a tent where I was soaped and hosed down by a cranky-looking woman in a white coat. I stumbled into a different tent, and the woman directed me to a metal chair. Cyrus was there too, looking far more alert than I felt.\n\n\n\nOne of the gas masks handed me Rob, who was pretty wet and maybe a little stunned from the shower. He promptly curled up in my lap.\n\n\n\nAll of the people in the tent were adults - none of my classmates in sight. The gas masks who had carried me out were not there either, but there were what looked like doctors and nurses and people who looked maybe they might be in the military, though something was off about them. Each had some sort of symbol on their shoulders or their chests, something I didn't recognize. They conducted their business with lowered voices just barely above a whisper.\n\n\n\nA man wearing a white coat and small round glasses was speaking to Cyrus too quietly for me to hear. Cyrus seemed to listen, I guess, but wasn't responding.\n\n\n\nThe man grew frustrated with Cyrus's silence and approached me carrying a tape recorder.\n\n\n\n\"My name is Dr. Krell,\" he said in a cool voice. \"We represent the SCP Foundation.\"\n\n\n\n[[[wednesday-5 | >> ]]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["interference", "wednesday-5", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Wednesday - 4 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wednesday-4", "year": 2010}, "welcome-to-the-machine": {"created_at": "2010-03-18T18:51:00", "creator": "bleggs", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-18T18:51:00"}, {"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "Uploaded file \"church.gif\".", "date": "2010-03-18T18:52:00"}, {"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-18T18:54:00"}, {"author": "bleggs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bleggs", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-24T01:46:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-06T18:16:00"}, {"author": "OgremanSam", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ogremansam", "comment": "vote", "date": "2010-04-09T02:02:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Vote 4", "date": "2010-04-10T02:57:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Private Scott followed two others and the sergeant into a bombed out church. The four soldiers sifted between the pews, calmly but rapidly assuming position. They scrambled over chunks of concrete and stone littering the floor with early morning irritation. Scott turned his gaze up to the broken rafters of the roof and tripped clumsily over his own feet. It seemed funny to him that the cathedral in this little French town was larger than any back in Trenton. Clambering over a cracked slab of the wall, the four men set up at a pair of tall stained-glass windows. The intermittent missing diamond panes offered a fine view of the road below while providing a modest visual obstruction to anyone approaching. They had to take it in good faith, Scott supposed, that the other five men had found a position on the other side of the street.</p>\n<p>The sergeant lay prone and silent, the barrel of his rifle poking slightly past the sill. Scott stood awkwardly by, looking over his shoulder at the beams of light coming down through the roof. It was almost angelic.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck down, jackass,\u201d said Private McKenzie jovially, tugging on the edge of Scott\u2019s coat. Scott scrambled down, weapon bouncing loudly off the stone. Then they waited, tensely. A full platoon of German soldiers was scheduled to come through sometime that morning, though they didn\u2019t know when. They had three squads behind them, thankfully, but Private Scott\u2019s squad would be at the front.</p>\n<p>They fidgeted. McKenzie and Scott flicked pebbles at each other, and Jacobsen smoked. The sergeant just lay there. He could have been asleep.</p>\n<p>After a long while they became aware of other sounds under the songbirds and the light creek of the broken ceiling slats. There was movement, and slight hints of \u201cs\u201d sounds drifting from voices at the far rear of the cathedral.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hear that, sarge?\u201d asked Private Jacobsen, inching over on his elbows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d the NCO responded. \u201cNone of our boys are up this far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe two of us should go check it out-\u201d Jacobsen added, eager to get up.</p>\n<p>\u201cJerry ain\u2019t up this far either,\u201d the sergeant continued, not listening. He peered far off down the road. \u201cWe\u2019re all going,\u201d he decided. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The four stood and began moving to the back of the church, Private Scott in tow. The light disoriented them, shifting from bright to dark as they walked beneath the gashes in the great ceiling. The sergeant lifted a finger to his lips. A spent cartridge jangled underfoot, and Scott jumped a little. Behind the altar and to the left was a wooden door, slightly ajar. Voices echoed from within, up a long stone staircase. And there was another noise, something subtler, and higher pitched, barely audible.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the sound of gunfire erupted up from below. The soldiers sprang from inaction and pressed themselves against the wall. There were shouts from the basement, and more shots. The sergeant motioned quickly with two fingers, looking markedly at Private Scott. Scott turned from the wall to the door, rifle outstretched, and felt aching pangs of adrenaline up the back of his neck. He pushed into the stairwell gingerly. The three other men followed him slowly down the moist, dark passage. The gunfire had stopped, but there were still loud cries emanating from below, and a strange, shrill chittering, as if from rats.</p>\n<p>They came to the bottom of the steps, and Scott leaned quickly around the edge of the threshold. It was a long basement room with a low ceiling, poorly lit by flickering torches in wall brackets. At the end of the room was an altar, hung with a white cloth. Upon it sat an ornate golden goblet. It shone strangely in the relative darkness, giving off a bluish shimmer.</p>\n<p>In the center of the basement was a wooden table, upon which stood two figures. They were a man and a woman, and they wore odd khaki jumpsuits. The man was frantically fiddling with a flamethrower, cursing loudly in an accent that sounded German. The woman stood at his back, brandishing an ugly machete. There was a third khaki figure below them on the floor, body partially obscured by a dark, flowing mass.</p>\n<p>As Scott looked closer, he saw that the mass was in fact a swarm of thousands of vermin. They were nothing he had ever seen before \u2013 grapefruit sized, skittering with perverted rapidity on spindly legs, screeching incessantly. Most of them pressed at the table, crawling over each other in ravenous eagerness to get up to the two figures. The woman swept the machete low, angrily slicing back the creatures that managed to mount the table. The man was cursing in German, and whacking at the flamethrower with his fists. Private Scott stood agape at the base of the stair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on in there?\u201d asked the sergeant impatiently, pushing Scott aside and stepping down to the basement floor. \u201cOh fuck-\u201d he managed. The rushing mass of creatures on the floor turned simultaneously from the table to look at the four soldiers. The little nightmares grinned with hundreds of thousands of unnaturally needle-like teeth. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, they sprinted for the men. The sergeant was paralyzed. Scott hysterically squeezed off a clip of shots while a screaming McKenzie attempted to pull himself back up the staircase. The four soldiers were quickly over-swept. A tide of tiny, searing pinpricks attacked their bodies, ripping little chunks out of their flesh. They were pulled down to the floor. Their ears were filled with the incessant screeching. Scott blacked out when they began tearing at his face.</p>\n<p>Private Scott awoke on the stone floor, his sight blurry, spluttering blood. He turned his head, and the dead eyes of the sergeant stared back at him. Jacobsen was slumped in the corner, also dead. McKenzie was face down on the stairs. He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but he was sticky all over with his own blood. An excruciating pain suddenly expressed itself throughout his body. He gurgled, arching his back. There was an acrid smell in the air, like burning, and the myriad little bodies of the needle-toothed creatures lay blackened and legs-up on the floor all around.</p>\n<p>The man and the woman in the khaki suits were standing over their fallen comrade at the other end of the basement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marty,\u201d said the German one, folding the man\u2019s arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should have been more cautious,\u201d said the woman, distraught.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, we got the goblet,\u201d the German replied, \u201cand he died doing his duty, in the field. We couldn\u2019t have foreseen the flamethrower malfunctioning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d said the woman, dejectedly. Scott coughed again, and she looked over to the staircase. \u201cOne of those bastards is alive!\u201d she exclaimed. The woman ran over, feet crunching on the small bodies littering the floor. She bent down and put a finger to the side of Scott\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlexandra! We don\u2019t have time for this!\u201d chastised her companion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied, exasperated, \u201cthe Germans are going to be here soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>Nazis</em> are going to be here soon,\u201d the man said sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis kid is barely alive,\u201d she said, ignoring him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave him. An unfortunate casualty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can save him,\u201d she said, after a pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow? He\u2019s fatally wounded\u2026what, do you mean to use\u2026?\u201d the German asked incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d the woman exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d her companion cried, waving his hands. \u201cLeave him. Even if you did what you\u2019re thinking, you\u2019d be giving him no choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has no choice. He\u2019s dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would we ever get away with it, Alexandra?\u201d the man pleaded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take him with us,\u201d she said firmly. There was a long silence between them. Private Scott spluttered weakly, blood soaking through his uniform. He felt his feet growing cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be stuck, he\u2019ll be imprisoned for the rest of his life,\u201d said the German.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know \u2013 I know,\u201d said the woman. \u201cBut at least we\u2019ll have given him life. We owe him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not our burden\u2026,\u201d the German said, but his tone revealed that he had given way. \u201cIf <em>anyone</em> ever finds out about this, it will be both of our heads,\u201d he stressed, conceding.</p>\n<p>Scott was aware of someone crouching down beside him. He sensed something cold and metal being pressed to his lips. And suddenly his body was filled with a warm, dense liquid. The pain was forgotten, like a dream slipping away, and he felt the ragged tears across in his flesh sealing and knitting together. And he was better.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-1451 is a Caucasian male of indeterminate age\u2026</em></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/welcome-to-the-machine\">Welcome to the Machine</a>\" by bleggs, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

An unfortunate casualty.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWe can save him,\u201d she said, after a pause.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow? He\u2019s fatally wounded\u2026what, do you mean to use...?\u201d the German asked incredulously.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d the woman exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d her companion cried, waving his hands. \u201cLeave him. Even if you did what you\u2019re thinking, you\u2019d be giving him no choice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has no choice. He\u2019s dying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow would we ever get away with it, Alexandra?\u201d the man pleaded.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take him with us,\u201d she said firmly. There was a long silence between them. Private Scott spluttered weakly, blood soaking through his uniform. He felt his feet growing cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be stuck, he\u2019ll be imprisoned for the rest of his life,\u201d said the German.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know \u2013 I know,\u201d said the woman. \u201cBut at least we\u2019ll have given him life. We owe him that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not our burden...,\u201d the German said, but his tone revealed that he had given way. \u201cIf //anyone// ever finds out about this, it will be both of our heads,\u201d he stressed, conceding.\n\n\n\nScott was aware of someone crouching down beside him. He sensed something cold and metal being pressed to his lips. And suddenly his body was filled with a warm, dense liquid. The pain was forgotten, like a dream slipping away, and he felt the ragged tears across in his flesh sealing and knitting together. And he was better.\n\n\n\n//SCP-1451 is a Caucasian male of indeterminate age\u2026//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "Welcome to the Machine - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-the-machine", "year": 2010}, "whole": {"created_at": "2010-02-01T14:59:00", "creator": "Aeish", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Aeish", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aeish", "comment": "Page created.", "date": "2010-02-01T14:59:00"}, {"author": "Aeish", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aeish", "comment": "Fixed a couple of typos.", "date": "2010-02-01T15:03:00"}, {"author": "Aeish", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aeish", "comment": "Added rate module, forgot to do it earlier :/", "date": "2010-02-01T15:34:00"}, {"author": "Aeish", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aeish", "comment": "Changed \"Ticking\" to \"Tick\", the first made no sense against \"reverberating\".", "date": "2010-02-02T01:14:00"}, {"author": "Aeish", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aeish", "comment": "Few minor edits/changes.", "date": "2010-02-06T00:11:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-02-20T02:47:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Which seemed to be, mostly, wandering around aimlessly and talking to each other.</p>\n<p>She wondered if they got bored, or if ghosts could get bored. It had, after all, been three-hundred years.</p>\n<p>A whole three centuries of a nearly-empty earth. And then she wondered why all the ghosts congregated here, in the Midwestern area of the former United States of America. They had never seen ghosts anywhere else, perhaps there was just something about the area?</p>\n<p>\u201cLadies and gentleman, the world tour has started!\u201d she announced, moving the controls of the UAV smoothly. The secondary pilot grinned at her with his dagger-like teeth, the spines down his back pricked in excitement, and sat back, looking up at the massive array of screens.</p>\n<p>For Anahita, it was just like the first time she saw her world all over again. While she had been born and raised in the refugee city, and had grown up in a sky with too many moons, streaked with orange and red, the blue grasses and violet-brown trees\u2026she couldn\u2019t fight the part of her mind that was truly human, and recognized its home immediately. The burning yellow sun. The blue sky.</p>\n<p>She turned the UAV and it looked backwards, towards the small town they operated from. It was small, cramped, dusty and stuck out from the desert with its crude farmland and little garden sanctuary, just like any other earth town, but it was still not so bad a place. Then she turned the UAV back out, to the Midwestern desert, and pushed the controls towards. The sleek, alien device moved smoothly, like it was swimming through the air, and thus began her travels by proxy.</p>\n<p>The desert covered most of the former Northern Americas. An endless expanse of dust and sand, bone-white and golden for the most part, with occasional patches of scrubland clinging to survival, or thin rivers that trickled through cracked-mud riverbanks. The Mississippi crawled, only a foot or so wide, sluggishly through the channel it had carved, and she steered the UAV down with it, following southwards.</p>\n<p>Passing over the excavation site, she circled low and saw the workers, a mixture of human and lurks, look up and smile and wave. They knew that the mission was to be launched soon.</p>\n<p>The desert was more or less unchanged as they explored. They already knew what to expect, but the aerial view made up for plenty of interest. They followed a roving band of clickers for a few hours, a half-dozen individuals who trucked forwards through the sand, gears whirling inside their bodies, bronze and copper metal faces looking to and fro, searching for anything alive.</p>\n<p>They followed them south and west, to one of the larger clockwork cities. Its moving, shifting spires reaching into the sky. She circled the UAV around them and weaved it between buildings that occasionally rumbled and moved of their own accord in some unchanging pattern. A massive fountain with a living statue of a woman, composed entirely of pneumatics and gears, swam with koi made of gold, and workers went to and fro in their set patterns, unchanging, unnoticing of the world around them.</p>\n<p>Only when a guard, some mixture of human and a massive hawk, with silver blades for wings and a tunic made out of platinum threads woven so fine as to flow like cloth, caught attention of the UAV and took chase did they leave the shining, repetitive city. She recalled once listening to a traveler tell his tales of how he once walked clear through one of the clicker cities, timing so perfect that not a thing touched or saw him.</p>\n<p>The UAV, fortunately, easily could out-fly the guard, who eventually wheeled back to the city, and she took it to the higher atmospheres, where it went into a circling pattern for the night as she slept. The next morning, they powered southwards and over Mexico. She gasped as they rounded over a series of deep craters that formed a mountainous range, and saw for the first time in her life the green of grass that spread further than a few yards. Of a forest! How wonderful!</p>\n<p>So few people had been to the southern American jungles, after all. She steered the UAV in low, and slowed it down, weaving her way through the grassy forest, which slowly became a thick, lush jungle. Flowers the size of doorways bloomed, vivid red and orange. Trees hundreds of meters tall towered overhead, and she wove the UAV carefully around looped vines bigger around than her waist would have been. Here and there, she saw things move.</p>\n<p>A creature that could have once been a parrot, but now had slim green leaves for feathers and a dark wooden beak looked at her with beady black eyes, before fluttering off, becoming invisible among the plant life. She only thought about pulling out of the jungle when she found a clearing and spotted a group of plantlings resting, their soft membranous skin covered in dew, and long grassy hair braided crudely. She avoided nearing them, curious as she was, after all plantlings were a lot that was quick to anger and attack.</p>\n<p>There was a flash of copper, later, and she chased the UAV after a clicker, one that was fast and built like a jaguar, hurrying through the jungle. A messenger, she assumed.</p>\n<p>She pulled up out of the jungle at the urging of the copilot, and soared further south, until the jungle faded again and they neared another city of gears and metal, and gave it a wide berth when they spotted condors that were armored in gold and swinging steel talons.</p>\n<p>And to Antarctica the following day. The death had barely touched here, and she curiously observed a group of penguins before steering the UAV through a small storm, and into the waiting shed of the Antarctic Observation Platform. A tall woman dressed in furs performed maintenance on the UAV to assure them it would stay in working condition the rest of the trip, and spoke over the videophone with a gently accented voice. They were back in the air by the next day, and this time Anahita shivered with excitement. Up, they crawled over the Atlantic, up and to the East. While the ocean was largely uneventful, sometimes they would catch glimpses of things moving under the endless blue waves. Seagulls still soared, and the UAV followed a flock of them until a tentacle that must have reached fifty meters into the air snapped up out of the water with lightning speed and grabbed one, yanking it down into the waters below.</p>\n<p>She pulled the UAV up higher after that, and they stared in amazement as nighttime fell and the bioluminescent spots of something the size of an oil tanker under the waves appeared, and then were joined by other creatures of the same type. They converged, lights flashing and flickering, then dove or faded out of sight.</p>\n<p>In South Africa, they cautiously slowed and approached a sight few had seen. The trees were not terribly large, but for their size, they were\u2026strange. They grew everywhere, but only here had they seen a truly impressive forest of them. The flesh trees, twisted upwards, their multi-branched, stiffened arms reaching to the sky, skin hardened and calloused. Some of them were old, very old, and probably deeply sleeping, but there were a few, here and there, that were quite fresh.</p>\n<p>She steered past one that was newly rooted, still shaped like a young woman, eyes glassed over, arms just starting to split apart. The ground around her was scratched and scraped, like she\u2019d tried to dig herself out before finally falling and stretching to the sky. In a moment of misthought, she moved close enough that the tail of the UAV gently brushed the side of the new tree, and it shuddered. Although the microphone of the UAV was not on, they could tell that she had started screaming. The trees nearby all shuddered and opened hidden mouths as well.</p>\n<p>They moved away quickly, passing over a tribe nearby of unchanged humans, who glanced at the UAV with only a flicker of curiosity, before returning to their business. With humanity decimated, the wilderness here, in Africa, had returned. Scrublands and grasslands, just as before. Although, she steered the UAV back over a village, and they muttered and commented as a group of young men ran after a fleeting gazelle, before the men \u2013 in mid-stride \u2013 hunched over and became furred, massive facsimiles of hyenas and tackled it to the ground.</p>\n<p>They continued northwards, over giraffes and elephants, and everybody on the team expressed their distaste as they spotted a herd of zebras \u2013 but among the black and white stripes, there were individuals that were partially bronze, or iron, and some that were entirely mechanical replicas of the equines. Even here, the clickers took hold, she noted.</p>\n<p>Another night of rest for her, and then they crossed over the Mediterranian, where on small island flocks of birdlike creatures roosted. When she steered the UAV near the cliffs they were on, they came in close to curiously observe, looking like nude women with hooked, hawklike beaks on their chins under their mouths, and a bird\u2019s legs, and wings instead of arms. Then they lost interested, and returned to their nests, where down-covered infants nibbled on rotting fish and leathery eggs waited.</p>\n<p>The ruins of Europe, as it turned out, were still there. Nobody went into the heart of France, or Britain, or Germany, not for what could be anywhere in there. And here they were, looking for it. It wasn\u2019t hard to spot, as they circled over the overgrown rubble and dust that was once London, and the UAV\u2019s sensors picked up life. They came in close and caught a fast glimpse of a girl, a little one with dark hair and eyes, and a wide smile, climbing over the ruined buildings and picking weed-flowers that had started to grow.</p>\n<p>Then Anahita frantically pulled the UAV up as what she could only describe as a dragon lunged from seemingly nowhere and attempted to snap it out of the air. It was massive and shifted like a liquid just as they watched it for a moment, before the UAV was out of reach and it turned down. Then they watched as the girl started to skip off, and the dragon dutifully followed, padding along like a much-overgrown dog behind her. They turned the camera away, fully aware of what exposure could lead to, and pushed southeast.</p>\n<p>They spent the next day with the UAV as the Saudi Arabian shelter, which existed just a few tentative kilometers from a large clicker-city, and the militant personnel there looked over the UAV, and spoke little, simply doing any needed maintenance and checking the device over. The captain of the base, a man with dark skin and a harsh, raspy voice told them not to go into Russia, and then thanked him for the advice with no intent to follow it.</p>\n<p>But first, they had the Indian Ocean to explore, and even at full height its most impressive feature was still fully ungraspable, as the creature stretched past the horizon like an island chain. One made of chitenous armor where lichen collected and birds roosted, that occasionally rumbled and moved a few feet forwards or backwards. It stretched all the way from Maldives to the Great Barrier Reef, where massive towers of coral stretched into the sky out of the water like some sort of bizarre city.</p>\n<p>The reef was a sanctuary of life, if that life was quite unusual. They observed huge schools of fish and jellyfish, pods of dolphins and whales of various sorts, and even glimpses of massive squids resting and feeding in the shallow, rich blue-green waters. Then there was Australia, where they soared low and slowly around the edges of the last truly human place on earth. They had no clearance to enter the territory known only as 23, but even from the edges, they could see fertile farmlands, and caught glimpses of people tending to them, or ones in uniforms who tensed and peered at the UAV through the scopes of their weapons before letting it pass by.</p>\n<p>Indonesia passed in a blur of sandy, deserted islands, spotted with vast open-mine pits, and the occasional tall spire of a golden clicker city, a flicker of a messenger whale plated in titanium here, a seagull made completely out of golden paper-thin blades there, and then up, into the heart of India, where a truly astounding sight awaited them.</p>\n<p>The largest clockworks city in the world, perhaps in all of existence. It spanned for hundreds of miles in any direction, a sprawling, ornate work of art, the people and animals and things that were neither operating in perfect patterns. Women who looked like dark bronze marionettes wearing saris of woven steel silk shined and washed the immense brass walls and walkways of the cities. Men wearing plated golden armor walked to and fro, observing with camera eyes. Massive moving statues were everywhere, swinging their many arms in a repetitive, slow dance, and pigeons who were strangely unaffected by the metal disease roosted in nooks and crannies.</p>\n<p>What they ate, Anahita thought, she didn\u2019t want to know.</p>\n<p>The city was so huge and glorious that they spent several days in exploration, careful to avoid the guards or other things that would notice and could attack the UAV with spring-loaded steel blades or slicing wires. There was a center to the city, a massive gold and brass monument, a temple, but the guards were so thick around it \u2013 dogs the size of cars made out of silver, centaurs made of copper and partially of glass that showed the gears and wires whirring about inside their bodies, all kinds of strange things \u2013 that they dared not move any closer to it.</p>\n<p>Then up through China. A desert of pale dust. Not sand, but true dust. There were ghosts here, too, but they were not the bored, simple people that she had seen before. These were specters, wraiths that drifted through the dust, twisted and malformed in fear and pain, attacking each other and attempting to attack the UAV at seemingly random intervals, while others simply crouched and cried or screamed and thrashed endlessly. Nothing was alive here. They had traveled, and they knew, that this area, the dead dust, was nothing but death. And it was more than death.</p>\n<p>It was a battlefield and a neutral zone.</p>\n<p>At first, she almost thought there were trees, then she saw their fleshy texture, and watched as the ground became less dust\u2026and more of a softly throbbing mat of meat under the UAV. They wheeled high above the infectious range, just in case, and peered downwards. Nobody entered what was once Russia. Nobody entered, and nobody left. If there was something to be said about the clickers and their clockwork virus, they did a damn fine job of at least keeping something worse at bay through unknown means.</p>\n<p>They only did a quick circling, enough to see whole cities of flesh, malformed monsters wandering to and fro, the long-distance camera a little fuzzy on the UAV, before jetting Eastwards. Somewhere between Russia and Alaska, everyone looking at the screens or the data blacked out temporarily, then came to as if nothing had happened once the UAV entered Canada. They knew that they had observed something, but a quick rewind of the video feed provided only static and the amnesia showed no signs of clearing.</p>\n<p>They quickly decided that perhaps this was a good thing.</p>\n<p>Down through Canada they went, watching as the snowy tundra slowly started to turn into desert, and down to the Golden Gate bridge, which truly was golden now, as it had been assimilated into a clicker city where cars that operated and wind-up wheels that brass men cranked every so often went to and fro.</p>\n<p>And then the UAV turned Eastwards\u2026and headed home.</p>\n<p>All things considered, the worldwide tour had taken nearly two weeks, and Anahita was hardly satisfied. But there would be more, her copilot assured her, tail wagging. After all, he pointed out, the UAV\u2019s were easy for his kind to manufacture, and they would need more data. This had, after all, just been a preliminary tour.</p>\n<p>Anahita smiled, then, and looked at the screens as the UAV slowly circled in on autopilot for a landing, wherin it\u2019d be taken to be disinfected through god-knows-what means, and watched the ghosts.</p>\n<p>Several of them, men and women and fading specters alike, waited on the roof, wearing lab coats. One, a plump woman with long hair that billowed constantly in a phantom breeze smiled and watched the UAV before starting to clap, before they all applauded silently.</p>\n<p>At least, Anahita thought\u2026somebody respected this first tour.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/world-tour\">World Tour</a>\" by agatharights, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It was a given, and she\u2019d known it the whole time, but it still startled her a little as the UAV moved over the desert. They were usually invisible to the naked eye, but curiously enough tended to show up on camera. It made the otherwise empty desert seem like a fairly crowded place. Some of them looked up and waved, and just went about their business. Which seemed to be, mostly, wandering around aimlessly and talking to each other.\n\n\n\nShe wondered if they got bored, or if ghosts could get bored. It had, after all, been three-hundred years. \n\n\n\nA whole three centuries of a nearly-empty earth. And then she wondered why all the ghosts congregated here, in the Midwestern area of the former United States of America. They had never seen ghosts anywhere else, perhaps there was just something about the area?\n\n\n\n\u201cLadies and gentleman, the world tour has started!\u201d she announced, moving the controls of the UAV smoothly. The secondary pilot grinned at her with his dagger-like teeth, the spines down his back pricked in excitement, and sat back, looking up at the massive array of screens.\n\n\n\nFor Anahita, it was just like the first time she saw her world all over again. While she had been born and raised in the refugee city, and had grown up in a sky with too many moons, streaked with orange and red, the blue grasses and violet-brown trees\u2026she couldn\u2019t fight the part of her mind that was truly human, and recognized its home immediately. The burning yellow sun. The blue sky.\n\n\n\nShe turned the UAV and it looked backwards, towards the small town they operated from. It was small, cramped, dusty and stuck out from the desert with its crude farmland and little garden sanctuary, just like any other earth town, but it was still not so bad a place. Then she turned the UAV back out, to the Midwestern desert, and pushed the controls towards. The sleek, alien device moved smoothly, like it was swimming through the air, and thus began her travels by proxy.\n\n\n\nThe desert covered most of the former Northern Americas. An endless expanse of dust and sand, bone-white and golden for the most part, with occasional patches of scrubland clinging to survival, or thin rivers that trickled through cracked-mud riverbanks. The Mississippi crawled, only a foot or so wide, sluggishly through the channel it had carved, and she steered the UAV down with it, following southwards.\n\n\n\nPassing over the excavation site, she circled low and saw the workers, a mixture of human and lurks, look up and smile and wave. They knew that the mission was to be launched soon.\n\n\n\nThe desert was more or less unchanged as they explored. They already knew what to expect, but the aerial view made up for plenty of interest. They followed a roving band of clickers for a few hours, a half-dozen individuals who trucked forwards through the sand, gears whirling inside their bodies, bronze and copper metal faces looking to and fro, searching for anything alive.\n\n\n\nThey followed them south and west, to one of the larger clockwork cities. Its moving, shifting spires reaching into the sky. She circled the UAV around them and weaved it between buildings that occasionally rumbled and moved of their own accord in some unchanging pattern. A massive fountain with a living statue of a woman, composed entirely of pneumatics and gears, swam with koi made of gold, and workers went to and fro in their set patterns, unchanging, unnoticing of the world around them.\n\n\n\nOnly when a guard, some mixture of human and a massive hawk, with silver blades for wings and a tunic made out of platinum threads woven so fine as to flow like cloth, caught attention of the UAV and took chase did they leave the shining, repetitive city. She recalled once listening to a traveler tell his tales of how he once walked clear through one of the clicker cities, timing so perfect that not a thing touched or saw him.\n\n\n\nThe UAV, fortunately, easily could out-fly the guard, who eventually wheeled back to the city, and she took it to the higher atmospheres, where it went into a circling pattern for the night as she slept.

She steered the UAV in low, and slowed it down, weaving her way through the grassy forest, which slowly became a thick, lush jungle. Flowers the size of doorways bloomed, vivid red and orange. Trees hundreds of meters tall towered overhead, and she wove the UAV carefully around looped vines bigger around than her waist would have been. Here and there, she saw things move.\n\n\n\nA creature that could have once been a parrot, but now had slim green leaves for feathers and a dark wooden beak looked at her with beady black eyes, before fluttering off, becoming invisible among the plant life. She only thought about pulling out of the jungle when she found a clearing and spotted a group of plantlings resting, their soft membranous skin covered in dew, and long grassy hair braided crudely. She avoided nearing them, curious as she was, after all plantlings were a lot that was quick to anger and attack.\n\n\n\nThere was a flash of copper, later, and she chased the UAV after a clicker, one that was fast and built like a jaguar, hurrying through the jungle. A messenger, she assumed.\n\n\n\nShe pulled up out of the jungle at the urging of the copilot, and soared further south, until the jungle faded again and they neared another city of gears and metal, and gave it a wide berth when they spotted condors that were armored in gold and swinging steel talons.\n\n\n\nAnd to Antarctica the following day. The death had barely touched here, and she curiously observed a group of penguins before steering the UAV through a small storm, and into the waiting shed of the Antarctic Observation Platform. A tall woman dressed in furs performed maintenance on the UAV to assure them it would stay in working condition the rest of the trip, and spoke over the videophone with a gently accented voice. They were back in the air by the next day, and this time Anahita shivered with excitement. Up, they crawled over the Atlantic, up and to the East. While the ocean was largely uneventful, sometimes they would catch glimpses of things moving under the endless blue waves. Seagulls still soared, and the UAV followed a flock of them until a tentacle that must have reached fifty meters into the air snapped up out of the water with lightning speed and grabbed one, yanking it down into the waters below.\n\n\n\nShe pulled the UAV up higher after that, and they stared in amazement as nighttime fell and the bioluminescent spots of something the size of an oil tanker under the waves appeared, and then were joined by other creatures of the same type.

The captain of the base, a man with dark skin and a harsh, raspy voice told them not to go into Russia, and then thanked him for the advice with no intent to follow it.\n\n\n\nBut first, they had the Indian Ocean to explore, and even at full height its most impressive feature was still fully ungraspable, as the creature stretched past the horizon like an island chain. One made of chitenous armor where lichen collected and birds roosted, that occasionally rumbled and moved a few feet forwards or backwards. It stretched all the way from Maldives to the Great Barrier Reef, where massive towers of coral stretched into the sky out of the water like some sort of bizarre city.\n\n\n\nThe reef was a sanctuary of life, if that life was quite unusual. They observed huge schools of fish and jellyfish, pods of dolphins and whales of various sorts, and even glimpses of massive squids resting and feeding in the shallow, rich blue-green waters.

They knew that they had observed something, but a quick rewind of the video feed provided only static and the amnesia showed no signs of clearing.\n\n\n\nThey quickly decided that perhaps this was a good thing.\n\n\n\nDown through Canada they went, watching as the snowy tundra slowly started to turn into desert, and down to the Golden Gate bridge, which truly was golden now, as it had been assimilated into a clicker city where cars that operated and wind-up wheels that brass men cranked every so often went to and fro.\n\n\n\nAnd then the UAV turned Eastwards\u2026and headed home.\n\n\n\nAll things considered, the worldwide tour had taken nearly two weeks, and Anahita was hardly satisfied. But there would be more, her copilot assured her, tail wagging. After all, he pointed out, the UAV\u2019s were easy for his kind to manufacture, and they would need more data. This had, after all, just been a preliminary tour.\n\n\n\nAnahita smiled, then, and looked at the screens as the UAV slowly circled in on autopilot for a landing, wherin it\u2019d be taken to be disinfected through god-knows-what means, and watched the ghosts.\n\n\n\nSeveral of them, men and women and fading specters alike, waited on the roof, wearing lab coats. One, a plump woman with long hair that billowed constantly in a phantom breeze smiled and watched the UAV before starting to clap, before they all applauded silently.\n\n\n\nAt least, Anahita thought\u2026somebody respected this first tour.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "adventure", "fantasy", "featured", "ghost", "post-apocalyptic", "tale", "talecon10"], "title": "World Tour - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/world-tour", "year": 2010}, "yellow-death": {"created_at": "2010-03-24T11:43:00", "creator": "FullHazard", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "FullHazard", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fullhazard", "comment": "", "date": "2010-03-24T11:43:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-06T18:17:00"}, {"author": "Photosynthetic", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/photosynthetic", "comment": "Votes 1 & 2", "date": "2010-04-07T02:55:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "vote 3", "date": "2010-04-08T00:26:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Gaius Marius Quartius, the Centurion in charge of the fort, had said that for the last three nights, but Titus knew that they couldn't hold out any longer.

When he got to the palisades, he had climbed them like a ladder, leaving a trail of smoldering wood wherever his feet touched them, and he went into the Roman tents and he killed a dozen men. Exactly a dozen, and he took their heads, and he left, not harming a soul except the dozen headless men and anyone who tried to stop him.

Cursed Gauls.</p>\n<p>Gaius hadn't known what to do that first night, but he tried to keep his men calm, claimed it was a fluke and trying to keep the camp from panicking, but to Titus, he showed a different face. Gaius was afraid. He tried to explain, using words that didn't quite work together and the vaguest of terms. \u201cThere were things in this world that are greater than man, and they want us dead, and somebody might be able to stop that from happening, but it isn't us. Tonight will be the last night of this siege.\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>So the chief came back again, screaming that terrible scream.

Titus looked out over the sleeping army of the Gauls, cursed Gauls, and he looked up at the moon, which was just about full, and he knew the blackest and most terrible fear.</p>\n<p>The worst thing about it wasn't the screaming, or the fire, or the blood red rage that soaked his eyes. It was his sword. You see, it wasn't the chief screaming at all. His mouth was stitched shut with brambles. No, it was his sword screaming. A blade made of flesh and bone, with a dozen horrible mouths that screamed to one awful, dissonant chorus. The cuts it made wouldn't heal, and bled unnaturally for days. So much as a scratch\u2026</p>\n<p>That scream went up, and Titus ducked down, trying not to be seen, trying not to cry, but it was different this time. There were more horses than just the one. Fearing the worst, Titus stood, and saw them. A dozen men, Romans, riding black horses were racing towards the chieftain. Each man wore a white tunic with the head of the Gorgon Medusa in dark red, and they carried swords and spears. Two at the back carried an ornate wooden box between their two horses, inscribed with golden text.</p>\n<p>The Roman horsemen were upon the chieftain now. Where their swords touched flesh lightning arced, and their spears were sheathed in fire. He fought hard, long after an ordinary man would be dead a dozen times over, but they took him apart. First his legs, and then his arms, and then head.</p>\n<p>Titus was overjoyed, and stood to shout to the rest of the legion, but he caught sight of one of the Roman horsemen's face, and he stopped. The man, moving the severed leg of the chieftain to the ornate golden box. He looked Titus straight in the eyes for a fraction of a second, then looked away in shame.</p>\n<p>Minutes after they arrived, the Roman horsemen took the boxed remains of the Gaul chief and rode away, and Titus was aware of another scream. Not the terrible scream of that horrible blade, but the scream of ten thousand angry men. \u201cThey weren't here for us. Steel yourself, child.\u201d Gaius Marius Quartius said, readying his bow. The Gauls, cursed Gauls, rose up like a giant wave and crashed against the walls of the fort.
