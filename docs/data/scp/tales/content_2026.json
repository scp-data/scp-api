The van belonging to the SCP Foundation parked right outside the convenience store. Its driver, Beau, sighed as he took the keys out of the ignition. Of all the days to get stuck in the field.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve got plans tonight. So being that you\u2019re free, I\u2019m\u2026 <em>delegating</em> this to you. Dee's words echoed in his head. They were the bottom of the SCP Foundation\u2019s totem pole, but then, Beau was the dirt underneath it. If he didn\u2019t want to accept orders from them, his only available option was walking out the door and hanging up his cleaning supplies for good.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have plans for tonight too?\u201d He pocketed his keys. \u201c\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t, but you could have at least considered it.\u201d Beau lamented to himself before getting out of the car. His first step down out of the van splashed his beige uniform with muck and dirt from the wet ground, and he grimaced.</p>\n<p>Grabbing a few basic supplies, he rounded the van and saw a man standing just outside the store. He was, simply described, a messy looking person. Beau less politely thought of him as white trash, seeing his tangled, grungy hair poking out from his flip flop sandals. The white wife beater tank top and sullied blue pants looked just as old and musty as they smelled. His hair clung to the back of his balding scalp for dear life, while his tired expression made him look done with life. He seemed unbothered by the hefty rain. Beau hoped this wasn\u2019t the man who owned the store-</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you, janitor man - you my hookup to get this fuckin\u2019 thing outta my store? I didn\u2019t buy this damn thing to have freaks shittin\u2019 on my floor all night!\u201d</p>\n<p>Goddammit. The janitor shook his head, trying to at least pretend to be willing to do the job of his own volition. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Beau. Beau Larkin of the Safe Cleanup Professionals. We sanitize, cleanse, and polish. I hope to be of service.\u201d</p>\n<p>He seemed somewhat appeased by the professionalism. The man shook his hand, glancing down at Beau\u2019s mud-spattered uniform with a furrowed brow. \u201cYeah, uh - Tony Watkins, nice to meetcha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what can I do for you, Mr. Watkins? I was told you had a mess in your store that was scaring away your paying customers?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man, Tony, became quite incensed. \u201cMess? Yeah I got a friggin\u2019 mess - There\u2019s this smelly, green fuck sittin\u2019 on my fridge, eating my whoppers, and wrecking my shit. And listen, my weird as fuck customers don't even care that he's there. The real problem is he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 up my freakin\u2019 store! And when I try to get him to leave he pulls a Glock on me - and, uh, the police think I\u2019m high! So you get in there, janitor man, and you either ice the fucker or get him outta my friggin\u2019 store! This is almost as bad as those freaks with the big meat ball!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, animal control is one of our specialties.\u201d Beau lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a look? Just let me grab my supplies from the truck.\u201d He tried to maintain the professional demeanor, both to appease Tony, and also to try to keep his own sanity.</p>\n<p>Beau went to retrieve his full duffel of the remaining cleaning supplies, cursing himself once again for not buying a taser, and followed the man inside. He was greeted with a half destroyed store, shelves and products spilled out everywhere. Any tubs of icecream, or snack bags, were open and drained of their contents. The cabinet behind the register that contained the cigarettes had been ransacked, and there was a pungent aroma of weed in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God, it looks like a tornado went through here. What exactly did you say did this?\u201d Beau looked back at the owner, fighting to hold his nose while in such close proximity to the other man.</p>\n<p>The fat store owner chuckled, and Beau was uncomfortably attentive to the way he\u2026 undulated. \u201cHeh, yeah I don\u2019t have a damn clue. Why don\u2019t you, uhhh, take a look yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>When they turned into the aisle, Beau didn\u2019t see anything besides the general devastation until he turned his head and nearly jumped back in surprise. Sitting there was a large brown tree frog the approximate size of a grown ass man. He was smoking a lit menthol cigarette while his hands were splayed out, the four fingers fiddling with random debris strewn about. He was sat atop a Hershey\u2019s brand freezer.</p>\n<p>Now, Beau was not a total stranger to strange animals\u2026 but this was fucking ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you, frog thing.\u201d The creature slightly lifted its head, blearily looking at the fat man. \u201cYeah I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, you little shit-stain. I got the janitor on your ass now. Your days are numbered -\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a loud clicking noise, as the frog cocked the Glock and pointed it at Tony. Beau and Tony exclaimed loud noises of surprise, and ducked out of the way as a bullet whizzed by and blew up a vat of Nutella, spilling its contents onto the floor - and Beau\u2019s already dirty shirt.</p>\n<p>Breathing deeply and averting his hyperventilation, Beau asked Tony why he hadn\u2019t called hazardous animal control of some kind if the frog had a gun.</p>\n<p>Tony, in response, looked at Beau like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI got rats, and you can\u2019t sell no food in a place with rats. Your uh, Sucking, Cleaning, Proselytizing or whatever doesn't report to the state. And I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 no damn animal control fees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau didn\u2019t know how to respond, and wrangled the topic back to the matter at hand. \u201cListen, okay? Cleaning I can do. Removing this guy? I mean, he\u2019s got a gun, I don\u2019t really-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t paying you to mull it over. This frog better be gone by the morning or I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m calling your manager.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa. No need for that.\u201d Beau swallowed at the thought of anyone except Dee chewing him out. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAttaboy! Just make sure you lock up afterwards.\u201d He tossed a spare key to Beau and started to head out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Wait, are you not gonna stay to make sure that I finish the job?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got plans with the, uh, ladies, ya know? I mean come on, it\u2019s Friday, I got a couple of bills burnin\u2019 a hole in my pocket. I got better things to do than fuck around with a frog after the 9-5. So uh, get to it, janitor man.\u201d The store owner walked out, and Beau looked away from his filthy attire. He felt a lot better being mercifully separated from the malodorous store owner. He peered around the corner at the frog, who seemed to be fiddling with the Glock before tossing it to the floor. Beau then looked down at the key in his palm as he heard the door shut behind Watkins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Friday. And everyone has plans.\u201d He turned his head over to the frog, who was ominously much closer than before, having approached silently. It was looking at the janitor expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo.\u201d The frog greeted, taking the cigarette out of its mouth and flicking some ash onto the tile floor. It had a deep gravelly voice, not what Beau had expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhhh, yo?\u201d Beau responded, forcing himself to have nerves of steel he didn\u2019t really possess.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Gary. You said your name was Beau?\u201d The frog took another drag from the cigarette as he finished speaking.</p>\n<p>Beau blinked twice, figuring he must have heard him outside. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d The frog took several more drags from the stick, and Beau watched it as a sweat bead dribbled down his wet face. \u201cSo what brings you to, uh, the corner store? Didn\u2019t know frogs liked\u2026 convenience?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog dropped into a splayed out sitting position, his body making a profoundly loud \u2018splop\u2019 noise as it collided with the smoothly tiled floor. \u201cI love frozen dinners and menthols, brother. Can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. This place has \u2018em in spades.\u201d \u2018Gary\u2019 seemed to believe that was reason enough, and went back to taking drags from his cig.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange combination.\u201d Beau hoped that this would be a lot smoother than he was fearing it would have been. \u201cSoooooo, is there like a home I can help you get back to?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog shook his head in the negative, which really meant he shook his entire torso more or less. \u201cAin\u2019t goin\u2019 home. Too much heat on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeat? What\u2026 what did you do?\u201d Beau leaned in, morbidly curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m famous. You never heard of the Chugwater Frogman?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is a Chugwater?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTown in Wyoming. I\u2019m their local frogman. Got tired of their bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau hoped there would be more of an explanation, or at least justification, but he was left wanting. \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay in this corner store, the uhm\u2026 the owner is gonna kill you. With a gun. A really big gun.\u201d Beau lied once again.</p>\n<p>Another wisp of menthol wafted through the air. \u201cNah, I could take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u2026 a bullet? You\u2019re saying you can take a bullet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I've had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cL-like what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot hit by a car once.\u201d The frog looked Beau dead in the eyes, and said, \u201cDo you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau blinked and swallowed. \u201cNo, I don't think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog stood up, his feet making little plap noises on the floor as he paced. \u201cListen, this place has everything a frogman could need, except for a nice Olive Garden platter, flat screen, and a DVR so I can watch Big Brother\u2026 sittin\u2019 on a sofa, rubbing my belly, scratchin\u2019 my-\u201d</p>\n<p>The janitor loudly cleared his throat. \u201cWell, look, that sounds awesome but my job right now is to clean this place up. If you want, I can get you somewhere wet at least? Do frogs like wet things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m more of a branch guy, but wet is a good start.\u201d Beau thought that over\u2026</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, Beau had situated Gary on a mop handle he had haphazardly placed inside of a trucker shower stall. Gary was gripping onto it, using it like a branch. It was liable to fall apart any second, but the lukewarm water cascading down Gary\u2019s back giving him a serene expression oddly made it all worth it. Sort of.</p>\n<p>It was much less fun when he had to start wheeling his mop bucket setup back and forth from the main store back to the janitor closet, the same room with the shower stall, and began the arduous task of the clean up. It was going to be quite a long one, between all the spilled food and drinks, cigarette ashes, poop\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cHey wait a minute.\u201d Beau said, looking at Gary as he was dumping out the bucket into the mop sink. Gary opened his eyes, and looked annoyed that he was being talked to. \u201cWhy did you shit all over the store - aren\u2019t you like, basically a human frog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrogman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, so\u2026 Why? Do they not house train frogmen in Wyoming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am burrow trained, thank you very much. That Tony guy just reminds me of the damn truckers who\u2019d come through. Always littering, fouling up the water. One of the reasons I left. I don\u2019t take shit from nobody, but I will shit on people who I think deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Man, Beau wished he could do that. Well, not shit on people\u2019s floors - that would be weird. But he definitely liked the rest of that attitude. \u201cYeah, that Tony guy is\u2026 not great. I\u2019d go so far as to say I think he\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude he smells like shit, at least you only smell like bleach and sadness.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man winced, looking down at his sullied beige uniform. \u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d He felt the soreness in his legs more profoundly, and decided to take a break by sitting down and leaning against the wall. \u201cI guess I am kinda sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frogman looked over, peering out of the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotcha down? You seemed pretty confident back there, like a\u2026 real cleaning professional.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau sighed heavily and leaned on the handle of his mop. \u201cA cleaning professional that barely makes above minimum wage. But it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s the issue, I just\u2026 can\u2019t shake how lonely I feel in this town, y\u2019know? I\u2019m committed to cleaning up Pierre\u2019s messes but I\u2019ve got no one to be in a mess with.\u201d He looked up at the creature.</p>\n<p>The frogman gazed at him with his large, unreadable golden eyes. There was something\u2026 utterly human in those eyes. \u201cNo one? Don\u2019t most people have someone else at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau shrugged. \u201cWell, I have a roommate, but we don\u2019t really talk to each other, just kinda exist in the same space. He wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day even if I was made of money. We just pay rent together.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few moments passed, as the shower continued to run its water, splattering over the floor. Then, Beau looked up from the blue and grey tiles as a brown froggy foot stepped into view. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anybody either. It\u2019s always just been me, not even really sure where I came from but this place seems better than Chugwater. It\u2019s got better janitors at least. And it has more than one restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau smirked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWendy\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau sat up straighter. \u201cNo way dude, me too! You fuck with a vanilla frosty?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gary sat down with a wet noise next to Beau. \u201cThat and the breakfast baconator with the swiss cheese sauce.\u201d</p>\n<p>The janitor nodded. \u201cI feel you, I feel you. Guy I live with only ever wants to order out Little Caesars - no taste whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck Little Caesars, they\u2019re cheap for sure but they taste like cardboard - and I\u2019ve eaten cardboard so I should know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely! I don\u2019t wanna eat a fuckin hot and ready every weekend because he can\u2019t pick up some actual groceries.\u201d A few moments passed, the soothing sound of water on tiles the only noise in the store.</p>\n<p>Then, Gary turned to Beau. \u201cYo, I got a twenty, let\u2019s slam some Dominoes when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026 Really?\u201d Beau asked, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah bro, least I can do after making you pick up my crap -\u201d</p>\n<p>A raucous shattering of glass followed by a series of thuds resonated through the store. The two budding fast food aficionados turned to see two people fall through the window on the side of the room. One man crashed directly onto the floor with a big thunk, while the woman landed more gracefully than her partner, though still not very professionally.</p>\n<p>\u201cCracker down\u2026.\u201d The man on the ground groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, the Pizza Hut in this town is better than the Dominoes.\u201d The woman remarked, cleaning herself off before grabbing her partner and hoisting him up to his feet. Beau noted she used a mechanical arm that seemed to make lifting a grown man effortless. \u201cChudley, you're making us look bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy you gotta say fuck me then? They didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He gestured to Gary and Beau, before desperately looking at them. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026. can I help you?\u201d Beau was too dumbfounded to even react to Chudley\u2019s question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can help us by staying out of the way, you damn spook.\u201d Maria scoffed.</p>\n<p>Beau blinked, and Gary chuckled. \u201cSpook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things around here and we know you SCPeople are government contractors. Things that go bump in the night disappear around y'all, and you're always driving around in those fuckass Chevy vans.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just a janitor, lady, and I don\u2019t have to explain myself to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to use a damn door!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re from Wyoming.\u201d Gary replied dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us know how to use doors. I broke that window over there when I came in.\u201d Gary pointed at another, larger window that was busted in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna state for the record that I suggested we use a door but my partner wanted to make an entrance in style.\u201d Chudley stepped forward. \u201cThis is Maria Johnston, aspiring parabiologist. And I am Greg Chudley, aspiring has-been.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gary looked at them with contempt. \u201cParabiology isn\u2019t real, dipshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be a real science, once I have a chance to study you.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cThen those chuds at UW will finally see my brilliance.\u201d</p>\n<p>The realization hit Beau like a bag of bricks to who he was dealing with, \u201cYou two are college students?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria glared as though Beau had just said the dumbest thing she\u2019d heard in her entire life. \u201cYeah man. We\u2019re on summer break. Do you not spend your summer break chasing your local cryptid 500 miles to the capital of South Dakota?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d Beau asked, only to be easily thrown aside by Maria\u2019s metal limb.</p>\n<p>Maria pointed an accusing thumb at Greg, who was pretending not to sift through the bags on the ground of the convenience store. \u201cBlame this one\u2019s trust fund for enabling our insane tendencies. Now, Gary. We\u2019ve come a long way for this. I promise I\u2019m not going to hurt you but I need to take you back to my lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frogman made a loud, furious squeaking noise. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not going anywhere! Why does everyone want something from me?!\u201d Gary leapt with an incredible force across the room to distance himself from the pair. A lightbulb went off in his big froggy brain as he saw a discarded firearm on the ground. \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d Gary picked up his Glock 17 and took aim at the collegiate duo. Chudley immediately threw his hands up but Maria held her ground. \u201cYou two skeddaddle! I want to go to Dominoes with Beau and maybe roll around in the soil, just for a bit, and then binge Big Brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the right side of Beau\u2019s body was aching from being thrown to the floor he would have felt all warm and tingly on the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had wanted to hang out with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you're being so loyal to Dominoes. Pizza Hut has the superior pepperoni.\u201d Maria continued to overcompliment Pizza Hut ignoring the fact she was being held at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you like wet dog food! Those \u2018ronis are too damn soggy. Stop trying to change the subject! I will shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take it.\u201d Maria smirked confidently.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being cocky, have you ever been shot before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than getting hit by a car, do you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends on what kind of car. A smart car\u2019s worth of bullets is a lot of bullets but not as many bullets as a Sedan. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I could get my boy to go get the van, could you take a van\u2019s worth of bullets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI survived getting hit by a train. There isn\u2019t a single amount of goddamn bullets that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take!\u201d Maria screamed, and Gary clicked the safety to the off position.</p>\n<p>Beau crawled over to Chudley, who had just found a fifty in the corner and pocketed it. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2026is happening right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, if you haven\u2019t noticed Maria is very\u2026. Particular about the semantics of things. She\u2019s never one to lose an argument, no matter how ridiculous. Or if a frog is pointing a gun at her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRiiight. Should we intervene before she gets herself shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno man, she\u2019s got me convinced. Maybe she could take a cruise ship\u2019s worth of bullets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau tuned back into the conversation and decided he needed to act. He immediately jumped in between the pair again when Gary chambered a round, and they\u2019d gotten somewhere near space shuttles worth of munition endurance.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, none of you can take any FUCKING amount of bullets. Listen, Gary is the only person in this god forsaken town who seems to want to give me the time of day and I\u2019m not gonna let you take him.\u201d Beau said, impassioned. \u201cThis town is full of oddities, weirdos, and whatever the hell else. I would know. Just fucking pick one to write your paper on but not him, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria stared daggers through Beau at the annoying frogman behind him but the janitor noticed a slight change in her demeanor before she turned around.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. You can take him.\u201d She said over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>Beau slumped with relief, and a little confusion. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re not gonna clock me again?\u201d</p>\n<p>A belabored sigh came from her as she walked away. \u201cWe've got other leads to follow up on. I'm sure we'll find something for the thesis.\u201d She turned around and signaled for Chudley to follow. \u201cWe'll be seeing you around Skipper, dunno how lenient I'll be next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chudley gave a wordless salute as the pair disappeared into the night, leaving Beau and Gary dumbfounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh\u2026 You really mean all that?\u201d Gary asked as he put away his Glock into the place in which he was storing it.</p>\n<p>Beau looked down at the slightly shorter creature. \u201cOf course man. You think that old coot has got more loose bills lying around? I saw that Chudley guy pocket a fifty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the way you think, funny man. Let's get ourselves some Dominoes money!\u201d</p>\n<p>And so Beau and Gary finished cleaning up the store to the best of their ability all except one mess that Gary had left behind in Tony's office, as well they managed to loot at least sixty more dollars from the backroom.</p>\n<p>Their weekend would be filled with delicious pizza and getting Gary set up back at Beau's place. While they didn't have an extra television just for Gary , they did have a window with a convenient angle to their next door neighbor whose favorite show just happened to be Big Brother.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-highlighter-theme\">:scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:cleaning-services\">:scp-wiki:theme:cleaning-services</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> start=--\n\n|name=SYTYCFanon]]\n\n**A Wyoming Frog in Pierre**\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sytycfanon|For more stories click here]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> end=--]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**Friday, 3:07 PM**\n\n[[size 120%]] **Watkins Corner Store** [[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nRain poured hard on the windshield of the broad, white vehicle. The van belonging to the SCP Foundation parked right outside the convenience store. Its driver, Beau, sighed as he took the keys out of the ignition. Of all the days to get stuck in the field.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got plans tonight. So being that you\u2019re free, I\u2019m\u2026 //delegating// this to you.\u00a0\u00a0Dee's\u00a0\u00a0words echoed in his head. They were the bottom of the SCP Foundation\u2019s totem pole, but then, Beau was the dirt underneath it. If he didn\u2019t want to accept orders from them, his only available option was walking out the door and hanging up his cleaning supplies for good.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have plans for tonight too?\u201d He pocketed his keys. \u201c... I mean, I don\u2019t, but you could have at least considered it.\u201d Beau lamented to himself before getting out of the car. His first step down out of the van splashed his beige uniform with muck and dirt from the wet ground, and he grimaced.\n\n\n\nGrabbing a few basic supplies, he rounded the van and saw a man standing just outside the store. He was, simply described, a messy looking person. Beau less politely thought of him as white trash, seeing his tangled, grungy hair poking out from his flip flop sandals. The white wife beater tank top and sullied blue pants looked just as old and musty as they smelled. His hair clung to the back of his balding scalp for dear life, while his tired expression made him look done with life. He seemed unbothered by the hefty rain. Beau hoped this wasn\u2019t the man who owned the store-\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, you, janitor man - you my hookup to get this fuckin\u2019 thing outta my store? I didn\u2019t buy this damn thing to have freaks shittin\u2019 on my floor all night!\u201d\n\n\n\nGoddammit. The janitor shook his head, trying to at least pretend to be willing to do the job of his own volition. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Beau. Beau Larkin of\u00a0\u00a0the Safe Cleanup Professionals. We sanitize, cleanse, and polish. I hope to be of service.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe seemed somewhat appeased by the professionalism. The man shook his hand, glancing down at Beau\u2019s mud-spattered uniform with a furrowed brow. \u201cYeah, uh - Tony Watkins, nice to meetcha.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo what can I do for you, Mr. Watkins? I was told you had a mess in your store that was scaring away your paying customers?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man, Tony, became quite incensed. \u201cMess? Yeah I got a friggin\u2019 mess - There\u2019s this smelly, green fuck sittin\u2019 on my fridge, eating my whoppers, and wrecking my shit. And listen, my weird as fuck customers don't even care that he's there. The real problem is he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 up my freakin\u2019 store! And when I try to get him to leave he pulls a Glock on me - and, uh, the police think I\u2019m high! So you get in there, janitor man, and you either ice the fucker or get him outta my friggin\u2019 store! This is almost as bad as those freaks with the big meat ball!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, animal control is one of our specialties.\u201d Beau lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a look? Just let me grab my supplies from the truck.\u201d He tried to maintain the professional demeanor, both to appease Tony, and also to try to keep his own sanity. \n\n\n\nBeau went to retrieve his full duffel of the remaining cleaning supplies, cursing himself once again for not buying a taser, and followed the man inside. He was greeted with a half destroyed store, shelves and products spilled out everywhere. Any tubs of icecream, or snack bags, were open and drained of their contents. The cabinet behind the register that contained the cigarettes had been ransacked, and there was a pungent aroma of weed in the air. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh God, it looks like a tornado went through here. What exactly did you say did this?\u201d Beau looked back at the owner, fighting to hold his nose while in such close proximity to the other man.\n\n\n\nThe fat store owner chuckled, and Beau was uncomfortably attentive to the way he\u2026 undulated. \u201cHeh, yeah I don\u2019t have a damn clue. Why don\u2019t you, uhhh, take a look yourself?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen they turned into the aisle, Beau didn\u2019t see anything besides the general devastation until he turned his head and nearly jumped back in surprise. Sitting there was a large brown tree frog the approximate size of a grown ass man. He was smoking a lit menthol cigarette while\u00a0\u00a0his hands were splayed out, the four fingers fiddling with random debris strewn about. He was sat atop a Hershey\u2019s brand freezer.\n\n\n\nNow, Beau was not a total stranger to strange animals\u2026 but this was fucking ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, you, frog thing.\u201d The creature slightly lifted its head, blearily looking at the fat man. \u201cYeah I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, you little shit-stain. I got the janitor on your ass now. Your days are numbered -\u201d \n\n\n\nThere was a loud clicking noise, as the frog cocked the Glock and pointed it at Tony. Beau and Tony exclaimed loud noises of surprise, and ducked out of the way as a bullet whizzed by and blew up a vat of Nutella, spilling its contents onto the floor - and Beau\u2019s already dirty shirt.\n\n\n\nBreathing deeply and averting his hyperventilation, Beau asked Tony why he hadn\u2019t called hazardous animal control of some kind if the frog had a gun.\n\n\n\nTony, in response, looked at Beau like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI got rats, and you can\u2019t sell no food in a place with rats. Your uh, Sucking, Cleaning, Proselytizing or whatever doesn't report to the state. And I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 no damn animal control fees.\u201d \n\n\n\nBeau didn\u2019t know how to respond, and wrangled the topic back to the matter at hand. \u201cListen, okay? Cleaning I can do. Removing this guy? I mean, he\u2019s got a gun, I don\u2019t really-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t paying you to mull it over. This frog better be gone by the morning or I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m calling your manager.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa. No need for that.\u201d Beau swallowed at the thought of anyone except Dee chewing him out. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 figure it out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAttaboy! Just make sure you lock up afterwards.\u201d He tossed a spare key to Beau and started to head out.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Wait, are you not gonna stay to make sure that I finish the job?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got plans with the, uh, ladies, ya know? I mean come on, it\u2019s Friday, I got a couple of bills burnin\u2019 a hole in my pocket. I got better things to do than fuck around with a frog after the 9-5. So uh, get to it, janitor man.\u201d The store owner walked out, and Beau looked away from his filthy attire. He felt a lot better being\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mercifully separated from the malodorous store owner. He peered around the corner at the frog, who seemed to be fiddling with the Glock before tossing it to the floor. Beau then looked down at the key in his palm as he heard the door shut behind Watkins.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Friday. And everyone has plans.\u201d He turned his head over to the frog, who was ominously much closer than before, having approached silently. It was looking at the janitor expectantly.\n\n\n\n\u201cYo.\u201d The frog greeted, taking the cigarette out of its mouth and flicking some ash onto the tile floor. It had a deep gravelly voice, not what Beau had expected.\n\n\n\n\u201cUhhhh, yo?\u201d Beau responded, forcing himself to have nerves of steel he didn\u2019t really possess.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Gary. You said your name was Beau?\u201d The frog took another drag from the cigarette as he finished speaking.\n\n\n\nBeau blinked twice, figuring he must have heard him outside. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d The frog took several more drags from the stick, and Beau watched it as a sweat bead dribbled down his wet face. \u201cSo what brings you to, uh, the corner store? Didn\u2019t know frogs liked\u2026 convenience?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog dropped into a splayed out sitting position, his body making a profoundly loud \u2018splop\u2019 noise as it collided with the smoothly tiled floor. \u201cI love frozen dinners and menthols, brother. Can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. This place has \u2018em in spades.\u201d \u2018Gary\u2019 seemed to believe that was reason enough, and went back to taking drags from his cig.\n\n\n\n\u201cStrange combination.\u201d Beau hoped that this would be a lot smoother than he was fearing it would have been. \u201cSoooooo, is there like a home I can help you get back to?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog shook his head in the negative, which really meant he shook his entire torso more or less. \u201cAin\u2019t goin\u2019 home. Too much heat on me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHeat? What\u2026 what did you do?\u201d Beau leaned in, morbidly curious.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famous. You never heard of the Chugwater Frogman?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is a Chugwater?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTown in Wyoming. I\u2019m their local frogman. Got tired of their bullshit.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau hoped there would be more of an explanation, or at least justification, but he was left wanting. \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay in this corner store, the uhm\u2026 the owner is gonna kill you. With a gun. A really big gun.\u201d Beau lied once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother wisp of menthol wafted through the air. \u201cNah, I could take it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA\u2026 a bullet? You\u2019re saying you can take a bullet?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I've had worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cL-like what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGot hit by a car once.\u201d The frog looked Beau dead in the eyes, and said, \u201cDo you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau blinked and swallowed. \u201cNo, I don't think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...Have you?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog stood up, his feet making little plap noises on the floor as he paced. \u201cListen, this place has everything a frogman could need, except for a nice Olive Garden platter, flat screen, and a DVR so I can watch Big Brother\u2026 sittin\u2019 on a sofa, rubbing my belly, scratchin\u2019 my-\u201d\n\n\n\nThe janitor loudly cleared his throat. \u201cWell, look, that sounds awesome but my job right now is to clean this place up. If you want, I can get you somewhere wet at least? Do frogs like wet things?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m more of a branch guy, but wet is a good start.\u201d Beau thought that over\u2026\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, Beau had situated Gary on a mop handle he had haphazardly placed inside of a trucker shower stall. Gary was gripping onto it, using it like a branch. It was liable to fall apart any second, but the lukewarm water cascading down Gary\u2019s back giving him a serene expression oddly made it all worth it. Sort of.\n\n\n\nIt was much less fun when he had to start wheeling his mop bucket setup back and forth from the main store back to the janitor closet, the same room with the shower stall, and began the arduous task of the clean up. It was going to be quite a long one, between all the spilled food and drinks, cigarette ashes, poop\u2013\n\n\n\n\u201cHey wait a minute.\u201d Beau said, looking at Gary as he was dumping out the bucket into the mop sink. Gary opened his eyes, and looked annoyed that he was being talked to. \u201cWhy did you shit all over the store - aren\u2019t you like, basically a human frog?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFrogman.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRight, so\u2026 Why? Do they not house train frogmen in Wyoming?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am burrow trained, thank you very much. That Tony guy just reminds me of the damn truckers who\u2019d come through. Always littering, fouling up the water. One of the reasons I left. I don\u2019t take shit from nobody, but I will shit on people who I think deserve it.\u201d\n\n\n\nMan, Beau wished he could do that. Well, not shit on people\u2019s floors - that would be weird. But he definitely liked the rest of that attitude. \u201cYeah, that Tony guy is\u2026 not great. I\u2019d go so far as to say I think he\u2019s an ass.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDude he smells like shit, at least you only smell like bleach and sadness.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man winced, looking down at his sullied beige uniform. \u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d He felt the soreness in his legs more profoundly, and decided to take a break by sitting down and leaning against the wall. \u201cI guess I am kinda sad.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frogman looked over, peering out of the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotcha down? You seemed pretty confident back there, like a\u2026 real cleaning professional.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau sighed heavily and leaned on the handle of his mop. \u201cA cleaning professional that barely makes above minimum wage. But it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s the issue, I just\u2026 can\u2019t shake how lonely I feel in this town, y\u2019know? I\u2019m committed to cleaning up Pierre\u2019s messes but I\u2019ve got no one to be in a mess with.\u201d He looked up at the creature.\n\n\n\nThe frogman gazed at him with his large, unreadable golden eyes. There was something\u2026 utterly human in those eyes. \u201cNo one? Don\u2019t most people have someone else at home?\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau shrugged. \u201cWell, I have a roommate, but we don\u2019t really talk to each other, just kinda exist in the same space. He wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day even if I was made of money. We just pay rent together.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few moments passed, as the shower continued to run its water, splattering over the floor. Then, Beau looked up from the blue and grey tiles as a brown froggy foot stepped into view. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anybody either. It\u2019s always just been me, not even really sure where I came from but this place seems better than Chugwater. It\u2019s got better janitors at least. And it has more than one restaurant.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau smirked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to eat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau sat up straighter. \u201cNo way dude, me too! You fuck with a vanilla frosty?\u201d\n\n\n\nGary sat down with a wet noise next to Beau. \u201cThat and the breakfast baconator with the swiss cheese sauce.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe janitor nodded. \u201cI feel you, I feel you. Guy I live with only ever wants to order out Little Caesars - no taste whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck Little Caesars, they\u2019re cheap for sure but they taste like cardboard - and I\u2019ve eaten cardboard so I should know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! I don\u2019t wanna eat a fuckin hot and ready every weekend because he can\u2019t pick up some actual groceries.\u201d A few moments passed, the soothing sound of water on tiles the only noise in the store.\n\n\n\nThen, Gary turned to Beau. \u201cYo, I got a twenty, let\u2019s slam some Dominoes when you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2026 Really?\u201d Beau asked, stunned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah bro, least I can do after making you pick up my crap -\u201d\n\n\n\nA raucous shattering of glass followed by a series of thuds resonated through the store. The two budding fast food aficionados turned to see two people fall through the window on the side of the room. One man crashed directly onto the floor with a big thunk, while the woman landed more gracefully than her partner, though still not very professionally.\n\n\n\n\u201cCracker down\u2026.\u201d The man on the ground groaned.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, the Pizza Hut in this town is better than the Dominoes.\u201d The woman remarked, cleaning herself off before grabbing her partner and hoisting him up to his feet. Beau noted she used a mechanical arm that seemed to make lifting a grown man effortless. \u201cChudley, you're making us look bad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy you gotta say fuck me then? They didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He gestured to Gary and Beau, before desperately looking at them. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see that, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2026. can I help you?\u201d Beau was too dumbfounded to even react to Chudley\u2019s question.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can help us by staying out of the way, you damn spook.\u201d Maria scoffed.\n\n\n\nBeau blinked, and Gary chuckled. \u201cSpook?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things around here and we know you SCPeople are government contractors. Things that go bump in the night disappear around y'all, and you're always driving around in those fuckass Chevy vans.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a janitor, lady, and I don\u2019t have to explain myself to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to use a damn door!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re from Wyoming.\u201d Gary replied dryly. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of us know how to use doors. I broke that window over there when I came in.\u201d Gary pointed at another, larger window that was busted in.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna state for the record that I suggested we use a door but my partner wanted to make an entrance in style.\u201d Chudley stepped forward. \u201cThis is Maria Johnston, aspiring parabiologist. And I am Greg Chudley, aspiring has-been.\u201d\n\n\n\nGary looked at them with contempt. \u201cParabiology isn\u2019t real, dipshit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be a real science, once I have a chance to study you.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cThen those chuds at UW will finally see my brilliance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe realization hit Beau like a bag of bricks to who he was dealing with, \u201cYou two are college students?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria glared as though Beau had just said the dumbest thing she\u2019d heard in her entire life. \u201cYeah man. We\u2019re on summer break. Do you not spend your summer break chasing your local cryptid 500 miles to the capital of South Dakota?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d Beau asked, only to be easily thrown aside by Maria\u2019s metal limb. \n\n\n\nMaria pointed an accusing thumb at Greg, who was pretending not to sift through the bags on the ground of the convenience store. \u201cBlame this one\u2019s trust fund for enabling our insane tendencies. Now, Gary. We\u2019ve come a long way for this. I promise I\u2019m not going to hurt you but I need to take you back to my lab.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frogman made a loud, furious squeaking noise. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not going anywhere! Why does everyone want something from me?!\u201d Gary leapt with an incredible force across the room to distance himself from the pair. A lightbulb went off in his big froggy brain as he saw a discarded firearm on the ground. \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d Gary picked up his Glock 17 and took aim at the collegiate duo. Chudley immediately threw his hands up but Maria held her ground. \u201cYou two skeddaddle! I want to go to Dominoes with Beau and maybe roll around in the soil, just for a bit, and then binge Big Brother.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf the right side of Beau\u2019s body was aching from being thrown to the floor he would have felt all warm and tingly on the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had wanted to hang out with him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you're being so loyal to Dominoes. Pizza Hut has the superior pepperoni.\u201d Maria continued to overcompliment Pizza Hut ignoring the fact she was being held at gunpoint.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you like wet dog food! Those \u2018ronis are too damn soggy. Stop trying to change the subject! I will shoot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can take it.\u201d Maria smirked confidently.\n\n\n\n\u201cStop being cocky, have you ever been shot before?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than getting hit by a car, do you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDepends on what kind of car. A smart car\u2019s worth of bullets is a lot of bullets but not as many bullets as a Sedan. \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I could get my boy to go get the van, could you take a van\u2019s worth of bullets?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI survived getting hit by a train. There isn\u2019t a single amount of goddamn bullets that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take!\u201d Maria screamed, and Gary clicked the safety to the off position.\n\n\n\nBeau crawled over to Chudley, who had just found a fifty in the corner and pocketed it. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2026is happening right now?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, uh, if you haven\u2019t noticed Maria is very\u2026. Particular about the semantics of things. She\u2019s never one to lose an argument, no matter how ridiculous. Or if a frog is pointing a gun at her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRiiight. Should we intervene before she gets herself shot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI dunno man, she\u2019s got me convinced. Maybe she could take a cruise ship\u2019s worth of bullets.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau tuned back into the conversation and decided he needed to act. He immediately jumped in between the pair again when Gary chambered a round, and they\u2019d gotten somewhere near space shuttles worth of munition endurance.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, none of you can take any FUCKING amount of bullets. Listen, Gary is the only person in this god forsaken town who seems to want to give me the time of day and I\u2019m not gonna let you take him.\u201d Beau said, impassioned. \u201cThis town is full of oddities, weirdos, and whatever the hell else. I would know. Just fucking pick one to write your paper on but not him, please.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaria stared daggers through Beau at the annoying frogman behind him but the janitor noticed a slight change in her demeanor before she turned around.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. You can take him.\u201d She said over her shoulder.\n\n\n\nBeau slumped with relief, and a little confusion. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re not gonna clock me again?\u201d\n\n\n\nA belabored sigh came from her as she walked away. \u201cWe've got other leads to follow up on. I'm sure we'll find something for the thesis.\u201d She turned around and signaled for Chudley to follow. \u201cWe'll be seeing you around Skipper, dunno how lenient I'll be next time.\u201d \n\n\n\nChudley gave a wordless salute as the pair disappeared into the night, leaving Beau and Gary dumbfounded.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, uh\u2026 You really mean all that?\u201d Gary asked as he put away his Glock into the place in which he was storing it.\n\n\n\nBeau looked down at the slightly shorter creature. \u201cOf course man. You think that old coot has got more loose bills lying around? I saw that Chudley guy pocket a fifty.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI like the way you think, funny man. Let's get ourselves some Dominoes money!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so Beau and Gary finished cleaning up the store to the best of their ability all except one mess that Gary had left behind in Tony's office, as well they managed to loot at least sixty more dollars from the backroom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTheir weekend would be filled with delicious pizza and getting Gary set up back at Beau's place. While they didn't have an extra television just for Gary , they did have a window with a convenient angle to their next door neighbor whose favorite show just happened to be Big Brother.\n", "references": ["sytycfanon"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "cleanliness-guaranteed", "greg-chudley", "tale"], "title": "A Wyoming Frog In Pierre - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-wyoming-frog-in-pierre", "year": 2026}, "abasedebase": {"created_at": "2026-01-13T14:58:00", "creator": "whenwerewe", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-13T14:58:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-13T15:00:00"}, {"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"black-diamond-billions-hub\".", "date": "2026-01-13T15:00:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Added tags: corporate, fantasy, first-person, ghost, marshall-carter-and-dark, science-fiction, slice-of-life.

Dropping back from the centre I try out an insouciant look: leaning against the far wall, examining the unscuffed mirror. As my back makes contact with the shuddering steel behind me I feel it. Shards of bass-thrum embed in my spine, grow around my skull, a premonition of the terrible music waiting for me above. Miserable proto-Sarkic noise-pop, dragged writhing from an \u201821 grave to haunt a \u201823 party.</p>\n<p>Okay. So my host has bad taste. That\u2019s just the job. People with good taste don\u2019t hire artists; they make art. Only one chance at this, so focus on what matters:</p>\n<p>In the reflection I\u2019m wiry in an ill-fitting suit, festooned in chains and miscellaneous leather accoutrements, with overgenerous eyeliner and ironical side-swept hair bringing the fit together. Incongruous blocky features, skin alabaster to the point of translucence, pupils fixed and staring even as the fascia move under my skin, brows knotting and unknotting. I\u2019m a kid from a scene that\u2019s yet to be reborn. The joke will land with this crowd, I\u2019m certain. I did a little market research beforehand, as they\u2019d call it. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019d think I was being tacky <em>sincerely</em>. Right?</p>\n<p>(But then again, they might see right through the winking self-deprecation, spear me through the heart with a thought, and then where will I be? If \u2014 )</p>\n<p>I bounce urgently off the wall, one leg springing me back to the centre of the pointlessly spacious lift, and my eyes dart around, taking in the detail, trying to drown the doubt. I can\u2019t afford to indulge my skittishness at this late hour.</p>\n<p>Opulence and beauty have a parabolic relationship; on the far side of the valley of kitsch is the rising cliff-face of real elegance. Absurdly, that\u2019s where the decor lands. Aside from the mirror on the east wall (redoubling the setting sun) every surface is covered in delicate trimmed-back gilding. Above me as I crane my neck are the twelvefold panels of a dome delicately enamelled with the lives of the apostles. As the lift rises past the mundane roof of the building, into the celestial floors, the figures take on a life of their own: laughing, praying, locked in bitter struggle.</p>\n<p>I narrow my eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an attempt at metacommentary, winking at the viewer, presumed some novice, at how it draws attention with tawdry motion while the grace of the original artist fades into the background. <em>God</em>, it says, <em>maybe we should install shortform video panels in all our galleries, and that\u2019ll get the kids in.</em> But this kind of moralising is hollow \u2014 they have made the work hideous, and not even interestingly hideous. This is the degree of infatuation with crude occult hackery I should have expected from my hosts, but still it disappoints. That\u2019s the second bad sign.</p>\n<p>A clear tone. The lambent far wall of the elevator slides open. Beyond is an unexpectedly narrow corridor, brightly lit by swooping crystal fixtures. To the right it ends abruptly, as if the architect simply walked away from the incomplete plans. The floor gives way to half a kilometre of whipping wind, and below it, spreadeagled, a vermillion world nearly bisected by a strip of slow whitecapped churn, where Lake Michigan rumbles against neo-gothic never-dead Chicago.</p>\n<p>I take it in for a heartbeat, and then back off. I don\u2019t want to be seen shying away, but heights have never agreed with me.</p>\n<p>Down the left-hand path is a blessedly plain oak door, attended by a woman wearing a sleek Bardot and a perfectly measured smile. No, not a woman, by that glimmer at her neckline, which is not quite a jewel: a gynoid, probably the single most contemptible innovation I\u2019ve ever heard of. I feel my mouth twitching into a sneer, but what if they see through her, and know my face? Instead I approach an image of meekness and nod at her with a curt quirk of my own lips. She \u2014 it? \u2014 fuck these people for doing this to me. The <em>thing</em> tilts its head one moment in what is surely an imitation of human curiosity, purposeless except in the sympathy it elicits, and asks:</p>\n<p>\u201cLukas Havel? I hope the journey treated you well.\u201d</p>\n<p>They chartered a private craft for me, and still managed to make me late. They <em>probably</em> aren\u2019t the types to lash out over a complaint, but why take the risk?</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty good! But please, call me by my work name. We will be professionals here, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>(Widening my nonchalant little smirk, playing up the eurojank for the audience.)</p>\n<p>It swings the door open and nods once, flicking its eyes in a once-over across my body, eyebrows raised in appreciation. Choke on it, Anderson, you rat, I think, and step inside.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing (the worst thing) is the music. I heard the bassline below the clouds, conducted unknowably through brass lines extending the whole length of the elevator, but the sound itself is contained to this room. A better word would be <em>concentrated</em>, because now that I\u2019m finally exposed it roars over and into me, worse than ever.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to pen down mentally an assessment of the lounge\u2019s aesthetic qualities, but in the blaring neon light, scintillating over two dozen sweaty bodies, it's impossible to make any real judgment. Instead, I make my way past wandering staff (who try to foist on me flutes of some obscure vintage) and head straight for the open bar, where the music is in a lull. It\u2019s done up in a faux-speakeasy getup, all dark panelling and bowtied vendors. I\u2019ve never scored a commission sober, so I snag a piquant vermouth negroni.</p>\n<p>Not a moment too soon: As I move away from the bar someone claps me on the back with a throaty bark.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s the man! We really did muck up the scheduling, but, well, no use crying over spilled milk, am I right?\u201d</p>\n<p>I do not grimace and turn toward the unctuous voice of Harold \u201cHarry\u201d Freeman, Chief of Marketing for Anderson\u2019s North American branch, recently hired after being caught up in the tertiary fallout of the infamous Foundation infilitration affair.</p>\n<p>He would have been handsome when he was younger, but something has wilted, and his features droop waxen down his face. Greying hair has beaten a retreat from his temples and his head is crowned in a widow\u2019s peak. Despite his withered muscles, his handshake is firm enough to crush my phalanges. I feel a heady flush, and then a stab of queasiness. If I piss this guy off enough, that's the last six months of networking wasted.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, he seems ebullient as he pumps my wrist erratically up and down, arms emerging from a carefully-fit and carelessly-dyed Hawaiian affair. He gestures magnanimously to the two others who have followed him to the bar, forming a circle.</p>\n<p>The first of them is a rather fetching lady in monochrome: white flats and palazzos, sable blouse, ivory jacket, jet sunglasses, etcetera. On any other day I would be stunned to be face-to-face with Beznash Bekele, egomantrix extraordinaire, one of whose shows set me on this path, but her accompaniment pins me to the spot with a glance.</p>\n<p>Those foppish manners, the peach fuzz on his lips, is that a short bob with bangs over his forehead? After a certain point one sets fashions rather than serving them, I suppose. I don\u2019t try to hide the tremor in my voice as I answer:</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t miss too much. Thanks for keeping an eye out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I address my remark to the second man, much to Harry\u2019s frowned displeasure \u2014 but so what? Only an idiot greets the Marshall heir <em>second</em>. \u2014 and give what I know must be a sickly smile.</p>\n<p>Ms. Bekele laughs, high and clear, and says:</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are not going to bite your head off, you know? And Harry has been talking you up all evening. If you are silent the rest of the night I am sure he will still be satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p>(She has the infamous Italian accent.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI do try to keep abreast of movements in the art world, you know. Now, I\u2019m no aficionado, certainly can\u2019t say I have Bez\u2019s knack for these things \u2014\u201d her expression dims a milliwatt, \u201c\u2014 but I could hardly miss out on <em>you</em>, young man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not wardens of culture, then we\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Chrysophilus\u2019 first contribution to the conversation, and he says it so drily that I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s mocking me. It sounds like he\u2019s quoting someone. He probably already hates my work, the insightless constructed lives, the brief forays into dadaist incoherence. Damn, damn, damn, I can save this.</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t catch the irony, or perhaps I\u2019m delusional, because he barrels on.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecisely! That\u2019s the insight that, well, that\u2019s kept our firm afloat all these years. Anderson, the man has <em>money</em>, more money than God, but petty cash can\u2019t buy <em>refinement</em>. People just can\u2019t take it seriously, all that cyber-network mainframe crap. That\u2019s why, Chris, you\u2019re going to inherit a keystone of the whole, this whole hidden subculture, and Anderson will just be another silicon catamite in ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chrysophilius nurses a tumbler of golden drink, and as he takes a sip I think I spy a grimace on that perfectly-framed face. Bekele manages his reproach for him (well-trained, I can\u2019t help but think).</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Freeman, it is no shame to have a transactional interest in the arts, but you are hardly supposed to <em>say it out loud</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws up his hands in defeat and gives a conciliatory wink around the circle.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you\u2019ve got me. Still the marketing man, eh? I do apologise, Lukas, Antispace, whatever name you\u2019d prefer, but these are the vulgar lines of questioning I exist to plumb. I get my hands dirty with all this low culture claptrap and the rest of the firm patronises the finer stuff in peace. But, please, enough about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mention of my pseudonym, which is probably the single most embarrassing aspect of my career, does not draw a wince from me, because I have been expecting it all evening. Instead I force a laugh alongside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my honour to be here. I cannot say that I expected the call, but of course for an opportunity to be among this company \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, do not flatter me,\u201d interjects Bekele, flicking one hand dismissively, \u201cThey\u2019ve been singing my praises for actual years. Instead,\u201d and she leans forward, stage-whispering, \u201cTell me what you think of the piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>I glance around wildly. Only one thing catches my eye: Bekele\u2019s centerpiece, a humming cylinder of cerebral tissue, ten feet tall, flayed by a hundred electrodes, to which a man screaming in vulgate Latin is being dragged. The other partygoers strap him into a purposefully rickety plastic chair as his face flashes through terror and ecstasy, and then he gets up laughing. From him a captive mind has been extracted and returned to its glisteningly organic container: the spirit of Valerius Solanus, who learned the secret name of Rome, and was condemned to wander the Earth eternal. Guests line up to pull him from his fleshy cage and let him live in them for sixty seconds, feel his hate and desperation, then reel him back out. Bekele\u2019s contemplation of how history inhabits us, they say.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s distinctive,\u201d I demur, not wanting to give her the tongue-lashing she deserves, \u201cAnd it\u2019s an excellent choice of subject; I mean, Christ, that Italian does not stop talking. I don\u2019t even speak the language and I feel bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>I chuckle and even Chrysophilius joins in, polite hollow <em>hahahaha</em>s, but unbelievably Harry has seen right through me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Lukas has to be diplomatic, poor guy\u2019s the ambassador of the new pseudo-identitarian wave, and I\u2019m not and I don\u2019t, so I\u2019ll say he thinks it\u2019s utter wank, if you\u2019ll forgive the expression. I mean, you set this thing up, basically treading on his toes, artificial experiences and so on, and all while we want to commission his own work. It\u2019s practically an insult, and anyone can see that though Bez has her vision, she just can\u2019t achieve the same depth with a <em>real</em> spirit that our boy Havel can with his homunculi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now: he\u2019s not wrong. I am a student of the artificial psychosphere; I build sixty-second slices of a life for any passerby to inhabit. This resurrectionism is a pale shadow of my art. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s confirmed he might want some work out of me. On the other had, <em>what the fuck is he doing</em>? I shoot him an expression of repressed horror, the kind of thing you have to use at public functions, but he\u2019s not looking at either of us artsy types. He has eyes only for his blonde leaseholder leashholder, who blows him off with a single skewed eye-roll.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard that little insight somewhere before,\u201d he replies, \u201cIn, oh, was it the <em>Deer College Odyssey</em>? As original as ever, buddy. I see why Dad brought you in.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes flick either side, to me and Bekele, as he shows just a hint of teeth, and Harry\u2019s own grin fades. That gaze holds some real spite (for who?) and Freeman quails. He looks away, to the bar, making some private illuminated sign that draws from the bartender two shots of girlish strawberry-scented vodka. Chrysophilius shakes his head. I want to take a jab myself, but \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Bekele, sparing me Harry\u2019s pique.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too old, madame, to stick to manly fashions. And you, I insist,\u201d he adds, passing me one saccharine sticky shotglass. I cast my eyes around but the other two seem unwilling to help me. Beznash raises her eyebrows (what are you waiting for, punk, inserts the grizzled voice I\u2019ve assigned her internally) and Chrysophilius could be mistaken for amused, but there\u2019s a tense aspect to him.</p>\n<p>I throw back the cloying liquor, do not make a face, and set down the glass on the bartop.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Harry.\u201d mutters Chrysophilius (perhaps he prefers Chris? I\u2019ll think of him that way; a preemptive strike on our friendship), \u201cUppers. Or downers. Not both, for God\u2019s sake. It is <em>not that fucking hard</em>.\u201d Like he wants to be angry, but can\u2019t quite summon it up. Something stuck in his craw?</p>\n<p>Now that I properly look at Freeman, though, there really is something electric to him, his breath and body thrillingly warm even as his skin dessicates, manic in his movements. I\u2019m not a biologist, but anartists love their allegory, and I\u2019m reminded of the sight of a rat twitching galvanically, reduced to a facsimile of life by an ampere.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow!\u201d he cries, inordinately loud, \u201cWhat do you think of the music? I think that\u2019s real Old Slavonic; Skitter had a spectral monk consulted on the proper forms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018Skitter\u2019 spreads his arms, feigning modesty (his type, obviously, cannot mean it).</p>\n<p>\u201cWe both know I\u2019m not a musician. I just gave my girl a little shove; the rest is her work, which means it\u2019s God\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>(By his expression he thinks he has said something wise.)</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I was never a music guy. Neither are you, of course, but there is a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to having a real <em>artiste</em>\u2019s view. Go on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why the fuck has he started spouting French? Does he think I\u2019m French? Is it some kind of bit? Bekele by his side clearly wants to make some acid remark, but Chris has gotten into the swing of things, now.</p>\n<p>\u201cFreeman, as he says, is a salesman. He thinks we pay artists so we can lure in more customers with some <em>pretty pictures</em>. It\u2019s hardly his fault, but what we know \u2014 and Bez, here, of course \u2014 is that it\u2019s backwards; all my money\u2019s good for nothing if it isn\u2019t good for art. What is the point of power if I can\u2019t build a little beauty, hm? That\u2019s all I really want to be able to say at the end, that I left this world prettier than I found it. Not that I hit some real good KPIs!\u201d</p>\n<p>(He is pulling this snobbery from somewhere outside himself: it\u2019s not in his nature to look down on good workers.)</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it work out, you think? Good piece?\u201d</p>\n<p>He probably does not realise that his rant sounds positively Hitlerian, and I definitely won\u2019t be the one to alert him. Now, how to massage his ego? I squint a little and listen in to the squealing riffs, the uninterestingly disharmonious spikes of signal, and what sound like neofolk lyrics that got horribly lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwful,\u201d I think, and say, because I really shouldn\u2019t have agreed to that shot. I have to go on, because commitment is the only way to save this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the most unmemorable thing I\u2019ve heard since I left the Vienna underground, and for them you could say they really were <em>experimental</em>, but this is imitation of indie, the worst kind of industry plant bullshit. I have no idea what you were thinking, and I would ask for a refund.\u201d</p>\n<p>God, I got too into it. I can hear the carefully neutral midwestern American accent fall away, that Czech snarl leaking back into my voice. And as expected, when I look at Chris\u2019 face, there\u2019s the disappointment, the irritation, even (though it\u2019s fathoms deep, this I know better than anything else) the hurt. But though he\u2019s dropped the shit-eating smirk I can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019s also happier than ever.</p>\n\n<p>I drift through the next hours semi-conscious, still not past the instant of terror where I thought I\u2019d wasted my chance on a cheap shot at his house musician. At some point we take a seat in some nook; Chris (who I cannot bring myself to think of as \u2018Skitter\u2019) buys us a round of nutty amaretto, though he doesn\u2019t partake, and Bekele some shockingly smaragdine sours. Other drinks diffuse between the three of us as he watches on, grimly sober. The conversation drifts away from me, as does Freeman, off to talk business with his \u2018lads\u2019 elsewhere. This is strictly still an industry meeting; the art is as always a showpiece first and foremost (the artists, too).</p>\n<p>A few mumbles carry me through the banal conversation we manage, and I let my attention wander as Chris halfheartedly tries to keep up with Bekele\u2019s talk on the contesting ontologies of historiography. She\u2019s a striking figure, though she often struggles to get out from under the shadow of her name. That melodic Latian accent is the product of a distinguished family history of which she prefers not to speak. She\u2019s not the type whose presence can be bought for any sane price, which means that improbably Chrissy has something she actually wants. She\u2019s a legendary laconic, having memorably excised her own last memory of her half-brother at a Glaswegian exhibition, so that means he has <em>hooks</em> in her, real barbed things gleaming with a promise, waiting for me too, if only I take the bait.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the junior Marshall. He cuts an indistinct figure: skim off the designer overwear, fix that <em>hair</em>, and he\u2019d blend seamlessly into any \u2014 every \u2014 crowd on the planet. (Isn\u2019t that a thought, pale skin and bone glimmering at the centre of some town square? But no, so lithe, not enough weight behind the tread, and altogether still too boyish, not my type.) He scarfs down the scant hors d\u2019ouevres, slivers of steak tartare still bloody, carmine running down the curve of his neck. He chews methodically, with a distant expression, like this is his day job. The lines of his face are distant as he looks, oh Christ he\u2019s looking right into my eyes, forcing a smile, bits of bovine filigree stuck in his teeth.</p>\n<p>He stands upright to my side of the table we\u2019re situated at and throws his arms about my shoulders in a stiff embrace.</p>\n<p>\u201cLukas, Luke, you really need to be more aggressive. You let that old scrote run circles around you. You need to be tapped in on this, marketplace attitude, on the balls of your feet.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grabs my shoulders, and I recede deeper into the plush of my seating, stickying the genuine leather with my sweat. His voice isn\u2019t slurring at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re rocking with the punches, then you\u2019ve got the <em>momentum</em>. Mo-<em>men</em>-tum. Be the man, my man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bekele is sat primly on the third seat, legs neatly folded, sipping her schnapps. It\u2019s not fair that she handles her drink better than either of us, but what can you do? She looks distinctly disdainful of the whole affair, and I can\u2019t pass any further judgment because now Skitter\u2019s face is right up in mine, breath rank against me, and I\u2019m not going to kiss him because he\u2019s definitely not doing that on purpose, the legendary bachelor. (But what if\u2014)</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>One finger crackles between us.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He twirls on one leg, and looks back over his shoulder at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like this? You\u2019re going to get a commission out of this, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because apparently I pissed all sanity out to make room for the third flavoured shot, calling up an old college memory for someone in the C-suite out in the crowd. I spent the entire trip here worrying about my financials and lost them the first wineglass someone passed me. I really should be down for this.</p>\n<p>He pivots to face me again, keeping his distance this time, and juts his chin out at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeak up. I didn\u2019t bring you here to mope.\u201d</p>\n<p>(This to Bekele, still sour on her own:)</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have seen this coming. Invite in my own Diogenes and what does he do? Sits in his barrel all day! I need a better class of cynic.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rounds away from me, on me, again and again. An insight: Foucault\u2019s pendulum is unvarying; when it seems to move it only tracks the motion of the Earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome <em>on</em>! You had an opinion just now. Do you know how many <em>new</em> peoples\u2019 opinions I get to hear in a year? Here's a hint, it\u2019s in the single digits. Just this fucking circle, over and over \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts off to take a breath, pressing down some memory. Something he just said finally clicks into a part of my brain gummed up by the acetate haze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me anywhere, Chris.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops, stunned, as do I. This backtalk will get me literally killed. I think I might have caught him offguard with the insight, oh God, what happens now?</p>\n<p>He makes a moue of displeasure.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Skitter</em>, please. Nobody calls me Chris. I\u2019m not a teenage model, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah. But then what \u2014</p>\n<p>Bekele polishes off her last mouthful and stands up to join Chris, (who is Skitter), leaving me feeling terminally surrounded. She shoots him a scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did say you would slip very fast, if you recall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, Bez, I\u2019m not done yet \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She ignores whatever he\u2019s about to say and strides over to me, hinging me up at the knees until I\u2019m vertical.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat he wants to say, Lukas, is that when he heard of you in the <em>Foundation Anart Almanac</em> he was so impressed that he set up this whole pantomime to reel you in. The overbearing executive and all. Because he thought it would be too humiliating to just ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBez\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris motions as if he\u2019s going to throw his glass, but she\u2019s still as a mirror.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut a charade revealed is worth nothing, so maybe now he will get up from behind that stage and talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>With one finger she pokes a silently fuming Chris \u2014 <em>Skitter</em> \u2014 right in the brow, sending him crosseyed, and then adds:</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and he asked me to help him out because he does not quite grasp that you think of me as a dilettante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man is for once lost for words, as she strides off into the ember-gathering, dying with the sunset. Outside it\u2019s pitch black, and dimming fast, plunging into an abyssal dark previously known only to squirming hadean things. I need to get out of this place, which now seems nothing more than an oversized coffin. But as I leave \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t done.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s that voice of command, the molten lead pouring down my spine, casting my limbs solid. The Marshall specialty. I take what I hoped would be one last look at him.</p>\n<p>He reaches out an affable hand. It\u2019s unmistakeably human. The first glimpse of anything like vulnerability. A frisson rolls over my skin, and I try not to recoil. Here is the miracle. Here is the killing-time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou came here wanting me to ask you for some work? Let\u2019s hammer out some terms.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He seats me back in the central lobby, on stools by a little round table only feet from the peristaltic cranial mass that holds the iconoclast tribune. At this hour the night has seeped into the room and rendered the guests immobile. The only movement is from corners too obscure for it to notice, where the secrecy of dyads and triads is undermined by their furtive giggling. By the entrance Freeman is spacing out on some kind of psychedelic. He opens.</p>\n<p>\u201cFive million, and six months. I want the memories of a week worth living, wholesome working-class joy, something for Amos to enjoy. He loves that shit. You know the man.\u201d</p>\n<p>(He doesn\u2019t feel the need to verify the latter; his confidence is well-placed.)</p>\n<p>He forgets his stool has no back and nearly leans far enough to fall, and hisses as he catches himself. His eyes do not meet mine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has to be <em>good</em>. Bez is solid, she knows her stuff, but she\u2019s not got the spark. I never understood why Dad felt that way, but if you agree then he\u2019s right. And he speaks well of you. Vindicate his faith.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bekele has wisely evacuated the suite entirely, leaving me alone with my first glimpse of his unvarnished desire, the thing that burns men to touch.</p>\n<p>Time to play dice with God. I\u2019d curse that I\u2019m so drunk, but really, how else can one shore up the arrogance for it? I think I know what he needs, if not what he wants.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>A microscopic sneer flickers across his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? I can do ten, whatever, don\u2019t quibble over pocket change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pay is fine. You don\u2019t have any idea what you actually want out of me. You\u2019re just gesturing at a portrait of the world, an ideal you want me to bridge to. I can\u2019t make your father respect you by following your genre conventions. I need a free hand\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the very first person to ever try the daddy issues line on me. I\u2019ve never heard that one before. You\u2019ve just pierced my fucking heart, great job. You think you know better what he\u2019ll like than me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t manage the deadpan he\u2019s going for. Instead the line comes out as if he really is about to cry. That contempt can\u2019t be faked, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get under your skin; I value mine. Yes, whatever, not my business if you get into shouting matches with daddy. But I can\u2019t use your ideas as a starting point. If your father respects me, trust in his taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>He narrows his eyes. That line doesn\u2019t work on him, but he prefers that it <em>seems</em> as if it did. Odd.</p>\n<p>I stroke my chin as if thinking. He probably doesn\u2019t grasp that mine is a nonsensical complaint. Of course I can work with direction, what use would I be otherwise? What he\u2019ll see is a man with principles, a pillar to anchor himself by.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d I add, before he can make a cackhanded attempt at a \u2018solution\u2019, \u201cYou said you forced Harold \u2014 whatever \u2014 to play the fool. Do you really have the Anderson C-suite so whipped?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an ungentlemanly snort as he turns to look at the sprawled form of the salesman on the far side of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf all of Anderson were so cooperative there wouldn\u2019t <em>be</em> an Anderson; there\u2019d be a Marshall robotics line and a screaming shrunken head labelled \u2018Vincent\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brows furrow parodically:</p>\n<p>\u201cBut there are certain downsides to being overleveraged when you\u2019re on the soul options market.\u201d</p>\n<p>A devilish little grin, and he taps the side of his nose. His hands whirl gracile and slow. I\u2019m so caught up in the delicate weave of his fingertips I hardly notice when Freeman twitches in his sleep.</p>\n<p>I do notice when he sits straight up, yells in animal terror, and frantically scans the room for three full seconds before falling back dead asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cWord of advice: never get assigned a put, and especially never get assigned on your <em>anima</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a light in his eyes. I won\u2019t have nightmares about this, but I\u2019ll think about it as I\u2019m about to go to sleep and shudder.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery classy,\u201d I drawl, \u201cIs that how you keep Bekele on side, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, her I just keep around because she\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>I raise my eyebrows at him, but he just shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can imagine how much pushback most people are willing to give me. I need something to keep me earthed. The stratosphere is pretty, but you\u2019ll drown in it as surely as any ocean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not sure what got him so eloquent, but I examine the back of my hand, projecting indifference so transparently he must see right through to the hope at the heart of me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, details aside, I do think your proposal has some merits. We can discuss trivialities later, but for now I really do need to get to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods slowly, fists clenching and unclenching.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it that last detail that brought you around? Freeman, the agent of history, now inhabited in turn? And my father said I didn\u2019t have the soul of a visionary.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t help it; I burst out laughing. My sides ache, I hunch over, tears briefly cloud my eyes. When I look up past the slow eye-roll and the feigned amusement, I see it again: a real and sustained injury. How strange, that he should care what I think. But it\u2019s the crack I\u2019ll need to pry open to win a lifetime position. So:</p>\n<p>The shakes die down, and I stand, ready to descend icarine from the celestial suite back to terra firma, seedy ever-dead Chicago, and my comfortably drab hotel.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have not,\u201d I make very clear, \u201cGot a visionary bone in your body, not yet. But there is an ember in you, and if we tend it well, it might be a fire. For now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>I fluff up my jacket to give it that perfect arhythm, and turn. <em>Here's</em> what he wants to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave the art to me.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-diamond\">:scp-wiki:theme:black-diamond</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n\n\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=EB+Garamond:500&display=swap');\n\n\n\n.fancytext {\n\nfont-family:\"EB Garamond\"; sans-serif;\n\nfont-size:120%;\n\n}\n\n\n\n.authorlink-wrapper,\n\n.authorlink-wrapper + div {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0margin-right: 0 !important; /* needed to override inline styles */\n\n}\n\n\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"fancytext\"]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/info:start\">:scp-wiki:info:start</a>]]\n\n**Author:** [[*user whenwerewe]]\n\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whenwerewe Here's my page!]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/info:end\">:scp-wiki:info:end</a>]]\n\n\n\n++ **March 4th, 2023**\n\n\n\nThe first warning comes when I let myself relax in the elevator. Dropping back from the centre I try out an insouciant look: leaning against the far wall, examining the unscuffed mirror. As my back makes contact with the shuddering steel behind me I feel it. Shards of bass-thrum embed in my spine, grow around my skull, a premonition of the terrible music waiting for me above. Miserable proto-Sarkic noise-pop, dragged writhing from an \u201821 grave to haunt a \u201823 party.\n\n\n\nOkay. So my host has bad taste. That\u2019s just the job. People with good taste don\u2019t hire artists; they make art. Only one chance at this, so focus on what matters:\n\n\n\nIn the reflection I\u2019m wiry in an ill-fitting suit, festooned in chains and miscellaneous leather accoutrements, with overgenerous eyeliner and ironical side-swept hair bringing the fit together. Incongruous blocky features, skin alabaster to the point of translucence, pupils fixed and staring even as the fascia move under my skin, brows knotting and unknotting. I\u2019m a kid from a scene that\u2019s yet to be reborn. The joke will land with this crowd, I\u2019m certain. I did a little market research beforehand, as they\u2019d call it. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019d think I was being tacky //sincerely//. Right? \n\n\n\n(But then again, they might see right through the winking self-deprecation, spear me through the heart with a thought, and then where will I be? If -- )\n\n\n\nI bounce urgently off the wall, one leg springing me back to the centre of the pointlessly spacious lift, and my eyes dart around, taking in the detail, trying to drown the doubt. I can\u2019t afford to indulge my skittishness at this late hour.\n\n\n\nOpulence and beauty have a parabolic relationship; on the far side of the valley of kitsch is the rising cliff-face of real elegance. Absurdly, that\u2019s where the decor lands. Aside from the mirror on the east wall (redoubling the setting sun) every surface is covered in delicate trimmed-back gilding. Above me as I crane my neck are the twelvefold panels of a dome delicately enamelled with the lives of the apostles. As the lift rises past the mundane roof of the building, into the celestial floors, the figures take on a life of their own: laughing, praying, locked in bitter struggle.\n\n\n\nI narrow my eyes.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an attempt at metacommentary, winking at the viewer, presumed some novice, at how it draws attention with tawdry motion while the grace of the original artist fades into the background. //God//, it says, //maybe we should install shortform video panels in all our galleries, and that\u2019ll get the kids in.// But this kind of moralising is hollow -- they have made the work hideous, and not even interestingly hideous. This is the degree of infatuation with crude occult hackery I should have expected from my hosts, but still it disappoints. That\u2019s the second bad sign.\n\n\n\nA clear tone. The lambent far wall of the elevator slides open. Beyond is an unexpectedly narrow corridor, brightly lit by swooping crystal fixtures. To the right it ends abruptly, as if the architect simply walked away from the incomplete plans. The floor gives way to half a kilometre of whipping wind, and below it, spreadeagled, a vermillion world nearly bisected by a strip of slow whitecapped churn, where Lake Michigan rumbles against neo-gothic never-dead Chicago. \n\n\n\nI take it in for a heartbeat, and then back off. I don\u2019t want to be seen shying away, but heights have never agreed with me.\n\n\n\nDown the left-hand path is a blessedly plain oak door, attended by a woman wearing a sleek Bardot and a perfectly measured smile. No, not a woman, by that glimmer at her neckline, which is not quite a jewel: a gynoid, probably the single most contemptible innovation I\u2019ve ever heard of. I feel my mouth twitching into a sneer, but what if they see through her, and know my face? Instead I approach an image of meekness and nod at her with a curt quirk of my own lips. She -- it? -- fuck these people for doing this to me. The //thing// tilts its head one moment in what is surely an imitation of human curiosity, purposeless except in the sympathy it elicits, and asks:\n\n\n\n\u201cLukas Havel? I hope the journey treated you well.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey chartered a private craft for me, and still managed to make me late. They //probably// aren\u2019t the types to lash out over a complaint, but why take the risk?\n\n\n\n\u201cPretty good! But please, call me by my work name. We will be professionals here, yes?\u201d\n\n\n\n(Widening my nonchalant little smirk, playing up the eurojank for the audience.)\n\n\n\nIt swings the door open and nods once, flicking its eyes in a once-over across my body, eyebrows raised in appreciation. Choke on it, Anderson, you rat, I think, and step inside.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"ornament1\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe first thing (the worst thing) is the music. I heard the bassline below the clouds, conducted unknowably through brass lines extending the whole length of the elevator, but the sound itself is contained to this room. A better word would be //concentrated//, because now that I\u2019m finally exposed it roars over and into me, worse than ever. \n\n\n\nI\u2019d like to pen down mentally an assessment of the lounge\u2019s aesthetic qualities, but in the blaring neon light, scintillating over two dozen sweaty bodies, it's impossible to make any real judgment. Instead, I make my way past wandering staff (who try to foist on me flutes of some obscure vintage) and head straight for the open bar, where the music is in a lull. It\u2019s done up in a faux-speakeasy getup, all dark panelling and bowtied vendors. I\u2019ve never scored a commission sober, so I snag a piquant vermouth negroni.\n\n\n\nNot a moment too soon: As I move away from the bar someone claps me on the back with a throaty bark.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the man! We really did muck up the scheduling, but, well, no use crying over spilled milk, am I right?\u201d\n\n\n\nI do not grimace and turn toward the unctuous voice of Harold \u201cHarry\u201d Freeman, Chief of Marketing for Anderson\u2019s North American branch, recently hired after being caught up in the tertiary fallout of the infamous Foundation infilitration affair.\n\n\n\nHe would have been handsome when he was younger, but something has wilted, and his features droop waxen down his face. Greying hair has beaten a retreat from his temples and his head is crowned in a widow\u2019s peak. Despite his withered muscles, his handshake is firm enough to crush my phalanges. I feel a heady flush, and then a stab of queasiness. If I piss this guy off enough, that's the last six months of networking wasted.\n\n\n\nThankfully, he seems ebullient as he pumps my wrist erratically up and down, arms emerging from a carefully-fit and carelessly-dyed Hawaiian affair. He gestures magnanimously to the two others who have followed him to the bar, forming a circle.\n\n\n\nThe first of them is a rather fetching lady in monochrome: white flats and palazzos, sable blouse, ivory jacket, jet sunglasses, etcetera. On any other day I would be stunned to be face-to-face with Beznash Bekele, egomantrix extraordinaire, one of whose shows set me on this path, but her accompaniment pins me to the spot with a glance.\n\n\n\nThose foppish manners, the peach fuzz on his lips, is that a short bob with bangs over his forehead? After a certain point one sets fashions rather than serving them, I suppose. I don\u2019t try to hide the tremor in my voice as I answer:\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t miss too much. Thanks for keeping an eye out for me.\u201d\n\n\n\nI address my remark to the second man, much to Harry\u2019s frowned displeasure -- but so what? Only an idiot greets the Marshall heir //second//. -- and give what I know must be a sickly smile.\n\n\n\nMs. Bekele laughs, high and clear, and says:\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are not going to bite your head off, you know? And Harry has been talking you up all evening. If you are silent the rest of the night I am sure he will still be satisfied.\u201d\n\n\n\n(She has the infamous Italian accent.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI do try to keep abreast of movements in the art world, you know. Now, I\u2019m no aficionado, certainly can\u2019t say I have Bez\u2019s knack for these things \u2014\u201d her expression dims a milliwatt, \u201c\u2014 but I could hardly miss out on //you//, young man.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not wardens of culture, then we\u2019re nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Chrysophilus\u2019 first contribution to the conversation, and he says it so drily that I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s mocking me. It sounds like he\u2019s quoting someone. He probably already hates my work, the insightless constructed lives, the brief forays into dadaist incoherence. Damn, damn, damn, I can save this.\n\n\n\nHarry doesn\u2019t catch the irony, or perhaps I\u2019m delusional, because he barrels on.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely! That\u2019s the insight that, well, that\u2019s kept our firm afloat all these years. Anderson, the man has //money//, more money than God, but petty cash can\u2019t buy //refinement//. People just can\u2019t take it seriously, all that cyber-network mainframe crap. That\u2019s why, Chris, you\u2019re going to inherit a keystone of the whole, this whole hidden subculture, and Anderson will just be another silicon catamite in ten years.\u201d\n\n\n\nChrysophilius nurses a tumbler of golden drink, and as he takes a sip I think I spy a grimace on that perfectly-framed face. Bekele manages his reproach for him (well-trained, I can\u2019t help but think).\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Freeman, it is no shame to have a transactional interest in the arts, but you are hardly supposed to //say it out loud//.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe throws up his hands in defeat and gives a conciliatory wink around the circle.\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019ve got me. Still the marketing man, eh? I do apologise, Lukas, Antispace, whatever name you\u2019d prefer, but these are the vulgar lines of questioning I exist to plumb. I get my hands dirty with all this low culture claptrap and the rest of the firm patronises the finer stuff in peace. But, please, enough about me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe mention of my pseudonym, which is probably the single most embarrassing aspect of my career, does not draw a wince from me, because I have been expecting it all evening. Instead I force a laugh alongside him.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my honour to be here. I cannot say that I expected the call, but of course for an opportunity to be among this company \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, do not flatter me,\u201d interjects Bekele, flicking one hand dismissively, \u201cThey\u2019ve been singing my praises for actual years. Instead,\u201d and she leans forward, stage-whispering, \u201cTell me what you think of the piece.\u201d\n\n\n\nI glance around wildly. Only one thing catches my eye: Bekele\u2019s centerpiece, a humming cylinder of cerebral tissue, ten feet tall, flayed by a hundred electrodes, to which a man screaming in vulgate Latin is being dragged. The other partygoers strap him into a purposefully rickety plastic chair as his face flashes through terror and ecstasy, and then he gets up laughing. From him a captive mind has been extracted and returned to its glisteningly organic container: the spirit of Valerius Solanus, who learned the secret name of Rome, and was condemned to wander the Earth eternal. Guests line up to pull him from his fleshy cage and let him live in them for sixty seconds, feel his hate and desperation, then reel him back out. Bekele\u2019s contemplation of how history inhabits us, they say.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s distinctive,\u201d I demur, not wanting to give her the tongue-lashing she deserves, \u201cAnd it\u2019s an excellent choice of subject; I mean, Christ, that Italian does not stop talking. I don\u2019t even speak the language and I feel bad.\u201d\n\n\n\nI chuckle and even Chrysophilius joins in, polite hollow //hahahaha//s, but unbelievably Harry has seen right through me.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, Lukas has to be diplomatic, poor guy\u2019s the ambassador of the new pseudo-identitarian wave, and I\u2019m not and I don\u2019t, so I\u2019ll say he thinks it\u2019s utter wank, if you\u2019ll forgive the expression. I mean, you set this thing up, basically treading on his toes, artificial experiences and so on, and all while we want to commission his own work. It\u2019s practically an insult, and anyone can see that though Bez has her vision, she just can\u2019t achieve the same depth with a //real// spirit that our boy Havel can with his homunculi.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow: he\u2019s not wrong. I am a student of the artificial psychosphere; I build sixty-second slices of a life for any passerby to inhabit. This resurrectionism is a pale shadow of my art. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s confirmed he might want some work out of me. On the other had, //what the fuck is he doing//? I shoot him an expression of repressed horror, the kind of thing you have to use at public functions, but he\u2019s not looking at either of us artsy types. He has eyes only for his blonde leaseholder leashholder, who blows him off with a single skewed eye-roll.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard that little insight somewhere before,\u201d he replies, \u201cIn, oh, was it the //Deer College Odyssey//? As original as ever, buddy. I see why Dad brought you in.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis eyes flick either side, to me and Bekele, as he shows just a hint of teeth, and Harry\u2019s own grin fades. That gaze holds some real spite (for who?) and Freeman quails. He looks away, to the bar, making some private illuminated sign that draws from the bartender two shots of girlish strawberry-scented vodka. Chrysophilius shakes his head. I want to take a jab myself, but --\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d says Bekele, sparing me Harry\u2019s pique.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too old, madame, to stick to manly fashions. And you, I insist,\u201d he adds, passing me one saccharine sticky shotglass. I cast my eyes around but the other two seem unwilling to help me. Beznash raises her eyebrows (what are you waiting for, punk, inserts the grizzled voice I\u2019ve assigned her internally) and Chrysophilius could be mistaken for amused, but there\u2019s a tense aspect to him.\n\n\n\nI throw back the cloying liquor, do not make a face, and set down the glass on the bartop.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Harry.\u201d mutters Chrysophilius (perhaps he prefers Chris? I\u2019ll think of him that way; a preemptive strike on our friendship), \u201cUppers. Or downers. Not both, for God\u2019s sake. It is //not that fucking hard//.\u201d Like he wants to be angry, but can\u2019t quite summon it up. Something stuck in his craw?\n\n\n\nNow that I properly look at Freeman, though, there really is something electric to him, his breath and body thrillingly warm even as his skin dessicates, manic in his movements. I\u2019m not a biologist, but anartists love their allegory, and I\u2019m reminded of the sight of a rat twitching galvanically, reduced to a facsimile of life by an ampere.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d he cries, inordinately loud, \u201cWhat do you think of the music? I think that\u2019s real Old Slavonic; Skitter had a spectral monk consulted on the proper forms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018Skitter\u2019 spreads his arms, feigning modesty (his type, obviously, cannot mean it). \n\n\n\n\u201cWe both know I\u2019m not a musician. I just gave my girl a little shove; the rest is her work, which means it\u2019s God\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\n\n(By his expression he thinks he has said something wise.)\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I was never a music guy. Neither are you, of course, but there is a certain //je ne sais quoi// to having a real //artiste//\u2019s view. Go on.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy the fuck has he started spouting French? Does he think I\u2019m French? Is it some kind of bit? Bekele by his side clearly wants to make some acid remark, but Chris has gotten into the swing of things, now.\n\n\n\n\u201cFreeman, as he says, is a salesman. He thinks we pay artists so we can lure in more customers with some //pretty pictures//. It\u2019s hardly his fault, but what we know \u2014 and Bez, here, of course \u2014 is that it\u2019s backwards; all my money\u2019s good for nothing if it isn\u2019t good for art. What is the point of power if I can\u2019t build a little beauty, hm? That\u2019s all I really want to be able to say at the end, that I left this world prettier than I found it. Not that I hit some real good KPIs!\u201d \n\n\n\n(He is pulling this snobbery from somewhere outside himself: it\u2019s not in his nature to look down on good workers.)\n\n\n\n\u201cDid it work out, you think? Good piece?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe probably does not realise that his rant sounds positively Hitlerian, and I definitely won\u2019t be the one to alert him. Now, how to massage his ego? I squint a little and listen in to the squealing riffs, the uninterestingly disharmonious spikes of signal, and what sound like neofolk lyrics that got horribly lost.\n\n\n\n\u201cAwful,\u201d I think, and say, because I really shouldn\u2019t have agreed to that shot. I have to go on, because commitment is the only way to save this.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the most unmemorable thing I\u2019ve heard since I left the Vienna underground, and for them you could say they really were //experimental//, but this is imitation of indie, the worst kind of industry plant bullshit. I have no idea what you were thinking, and I would ask for a refund.\u201d\n\n\n\nGod, I got too into it. I can hear the carefully neutral midwestern American accent fall away, that Czech snarl leaking back into my voice. And as expected, when I look at Chris\u2019 face, there\u2019s the disappointment, the irritation, even (though it\u2019s fathoms deep, this I know better than anything else) the hurt. But though he\u2019s dropped the shit-eating smirk I can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019s also happier than ever.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"ornament2\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nI drift through the next hours semi-conscious, still not past the instant of terror where I thought I\u2019d wasted my chance on a cheap shot at his house musician. At some point we take a seat in some nook; Chris (who I cannot bring myself to think of as \u2018Skitter\u2019) buys us a round of nutty amaretto, though he doesn\u2019t partake, and Bekele some shockingly smaragdine sours. Other drinks diffuse between the three of us as he watches on, grimly sober. The conversation drifts away from me, as does Freeman, off to talk business with his \u2018lads\u2019 elsewhere. This is strictly still an industry meeting; the art is as always a showpiece first and foremost (the artists, too).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nA few mumbles carry me through the banal conversation we manage, and I let my attention wander as Chris halfheartedly tries to keep up with Bekele\u2019s talk on the contesting ontologies of historiography. She\u2019s a striking figure, though she often struggles to get out from under the shadow of her name. That melodic Latian accent is the product of a distinguished family history of which she prefers not to speak. She\u2019s not the type whose presence can be bought for any sane price, which means that improbably Chrissy has something she actually wants. She\u2019s a legendary laconic, having memorably excised her own last memory of her half-brother at a Glaswegian exhibition, so that means he has //hooks// in her, real barbed things gleaming with a promise, waiting for me too, if only I take the bait.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the junior Marshall. He cuts an indistinct figure: skim off the designer overwear, fix that //hair//,\u00a0\u00a0and he\u2019d blend seamlessly into any \u2014 every \u2014 crowd on the planet. (Isn\u2019t that a thought, pale skin and bone glimmering at the centre of some town square? But no, so lithe, not enough weight behind the tread, and altogether still too boyish, not my type.) He scarfs down the scant hors d\u2019ouevres, slivers of steak tartare still bloody, carmine running down the curve of his neck. He chews methodically, with a distant expression, like this is his day job. The lines of his face are distant as he looks, oh Christ he\u2019s looking right into my eyes, forcing a smile, bits of bovine filigree stuck in his teeth.\n\n\n\nHe stands upright to my side of the table we\u2019re situated at and throws his arms about my shoulders in a stiff embrace. \n\n\n\n\u201cLukas, Luke, you really need to be more aggressive. You let that old scrote run circles around you. You need to be tapped in on this, marketplace attitude, on the balls of your feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe grabs my shoulders, and I recede deeper into the plush of my seating, stickying the genuine leather with my sweat. His voice isn\u2019t slurring at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re rocking with the punches, then you\u2019ve got the //momentum//. Mo-//men//-tum. Be the man, my man.\u201d\n\n\n\nBekele is sat primly on the third seat, legs neatly folded, sipping her schnapps. It\u2019s not fair that she handles her drink better than either of us, but what can you do? She looks distinctly disdainful of the whole affair, and I can\u2019t pass any further judgment because now Skitter\u2019s face is right up in mine, breath rank against me, and I\u2019m not going to kiss him because he\u2019s definitely not doing that on purpose, the legendary bachelor. (But what if\u2014)\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne finger crackles between us.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe twirls on one leg, and looks back over his shoulder at me.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like this? You\u2019re going to get a commission out of this, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\nBecause apparently I pissed all sanity out to make room for the third flavoured shot, calling up an old college memory for someone in the C-suite out in the crowd. I spent the entire trip here worrying about my financials and lost them the first wineglass someone passed me. I really should be down for this.\n\n\n\nHe pivots to face me again, keeping his distance this time, and juts his chin out at me.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpeak up. I didn\u2019t bring you here to mope.\u201d\n\n\n\n(This to Bekele, still sour on her own:)\n\n\n\n\u201cI should have seen this coming. Invite in my own Diogenes and what does he do? Sits in his barrel all day! I need a better class of cynic.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe rounds away from me, on me, again and again. An insight: Foucault\u2019s pendulum is unvarying; when it seems to move it only tracks the motion of the Earth.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome //on//! You had an opinion just now. Do you know how many //new// peoples\u2019 opinions I get to hear in a year? Here's a hint, it\u2019s in the single digits. Just this fucking circle, over and over --\u201d\n\n\n\nHe cuts off to take a breath, pressing down some memory. Something he just said finally clicks into a part of my brain gummed up by the acetate haze. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me anywhere, Chris.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stops, stunned, as do I. This backtalk will get me literally killed. I think I might have caught him offguard with the insight, oh God, what happens now?\n\n\n\nHe makes a moue of displeasure.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Skitter//, please. Nobody calls me Chris. I\u2019m not a teenage model, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\n\nAh. But then what \u2014\n\n\n\nBekele polishes off her last mouthful and stands up to join Chris, (who is Skitter), leaving me feeling terminally surrounded. She shoots him a scowl.\n\n\n\n\u201cI did say you would slip very fast, if you recall.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck off, Bez, I\u2019m not done yet --\u201d\n\n\n\nShe ignores whatever he\u2019s about to say and strides over to me, hinging me up at the knees until I\u2019m vertical.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat he wants to say, Lukas, is that when he heard of you in the //Foundation Anart Almanac// he was so impressed that he set up this whole pantomime to reel you in. The overbearing executive and all. Because he thought it would be too humiliating to just ask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBez\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nChris motions as if he\u2019s going to throw his glass, but she\u2019s still as a mirror. \n\n\n\n\u201cBut a charade revealed is worth nothing, so maybe now he will get up from behind that stage and talk to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith one finger she pokes a silently fuming Chris \u2014 //Skitter// \u2014 right in the brow, sending him crosseyed, and then adds:\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, and he asked me to help him out because he does not quite grasp that you think of me as a dilettante.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe man is for once lost for words, as she strides off into the ember-gathering, dying with the sunset. Outside it\u2019s pitch black, and dimming fast, plunging into an abyssal dark previously known only to squirming hadean things. I need to get out of this place, which now seems nothing more than an oversized coffin. But as I leave \u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t done.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s that voice of command, the molten lead pouring down my spine, casting my limbs solid. The Marshall specialty. I take what I hoped would be one last look at him.\n\n\n\nHe reaches out an affable hand. It\u2019s unmistakeably human. The first glimpse of anything like vulnerability. A frisson rolls over my skin, and I try not to recoil. Here is the miracle. Here is the killing-time.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou came here wanting me to ask you for some work? Let\u2019s hammer out some terms.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"ornament3\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe seats me back in the central lobby, on stools by a little round table only feet from the peristaltic cranial mass that holds the iconoclast tribune. At this hour the night has seeped into the room and rendered the guests immobile. The only movement is from corners too obscure for it to notice, where the secrecy of dyads and triads is undermined by their furtive giggling. By the entrance Freeman is spacing out on some kind of psychedelic. He opens.\n\n\n\n\u201cFive million, and six months. I want the memories of a week worth living, wholesome working-class joy, something for Amos to enjoy. He loves that shit. You know the man.\u201d\n\n\n\n(He doesn\u2019t feel the need to verify the latter; his confidence is well-placed.)\n\n\n\nHe forgets his stool has no back and nearly leans far enough to fall, and hisses as he catches himself. His eyes do not meet mine.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has to be //good//. Bez is solid, she knows her stuff, but she\u2019s not got the spark. I never understood why Dad felt that way, but if you agree then he\u2019s right. And he speaks well of you. Vindicate his faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nBekele has wisely evacuated the suite entirely, leaving me alone with my first glimpse of his unvarnished desire, the thing that burns men to touch.\n\n\n\nTime to play dice with God. I\u2019d curse that I\u2019m so drunk, but really, how else can one shore up the arrogance for it? I think I know what he needs, if not what he wants.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\nA microscopic sneer flickers across his mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo? I can do ten, whatever, don\u2019t quibble over pocket change.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pay is fine. You don\u2019t have any idea what you actually want out of me. You\u2019re just gesturing at a portrait of the world, an ideal you want me to bridge to. I can\u2019t make your father respect you by following your genre conventions. I need a free hand\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the very first person to ever try the daddy issues line on me. I\u2019ve never heard that one before. You\u2019ve just pierced my fucking heart, great job. You think you know better what he\u2019ll like than me?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t manage the deadpan he\u2019s going for. Instead the line comes out as if he really is about to cry. That contempt can\u2019t be faked, though.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get under your skin; I value mine. Yes, whatever, not my business if you get into shouting matches with daddy. But I can\u2019t use your ideas as a starting point. If your father respects me, trust in his taste.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe narrows his eyes. That line doesn\u2019t work on him, but he prefers that it //seems// as if it did. Odd.\n\n\n\nI stroke my chin as if thinking. He probably doesn\u2019t grasp that mine is a nonsensical complaint. Of course I can work with direction, what use would I be otherwise? What he\u2019ll see is a man with principles, a pillar to anchor himself by.\n\n\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d I add, before he can make a cackhanded attempt at a \u2018solution\u2019, \u201cYou said you forced Harold \u2014 whatever \u2014 to play the fool. Do you really have the Anderson C-suite so whipped?\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an ungentlemanly snort as he turns to look at the sprawled form of the salesman on the far side of the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf all of Anderson were so cooperative there wouldn\u2019t //be// an Anderson; there\u2019d be a Marshall robotics line and a screaming shrunken head labelled \u2018Vincent\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis brows furrow parodically:\n\n\n\n\u201cBut there are certain downsides to being overleveraged when you\u2019re on the soul options market.\u201d\n\n\n\nA devilish little grin, and he taps the side of his nose. His hands whirl gracile and slow. I\u2019m so caught up in the delicate weave of his fingertips I hardly notice when Freeman twitches in his sleep.\n\n\n\nI do notice when he sits straight up, yells in animal terror, and frantically scans the room for three full seconds before falling back dead asleep.\n\n\n\n\u201cWord of advice: never get assigned a put, and especially never get assigned on your //anima//.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a light in his eyes. I won\u2019t have nightmares about this, but I\u2019ll think about it as I\u2019m about to go to sleep and shudder.\n\n\n\n\u201cVery classy,\u201d I drawl, \u201cIs that how you keep Bekele on side, too?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, her I just keep around because she\u2019s a bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nI raise my eyebrows at him, but he just shrugs.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much pushback most people are willing to give me. I need something to keep me earthed. The stratosphere is pretty, but you\u2019ll drown in it as surely as any ocean.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot sure what got him so eloquent, but I examine the back of my hand, projecting indifference so transparently he must see right through to the hope at the heart of me.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, details aside, I do think your proposal has some merits. We can discuss trivialities later, but for now I really do need to get to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe nods slowly, fists clenching and unclenching.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it that last detail that brought you around? Freeman, the agent of history, now inhabited in turn? And my father said I didn\u2019t have the soul of a visionary.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t help it; I burst out laughing. My sides ache, I hunch over, tears briefly cloud my eyes. When I look up past the slow eye-roll and the feigned amusement, I see it again: a real and sustained injury. How strange, that he should care what I think. But it\u2019s the crack I\u2019ll need to pry open to win a lifetime position. So:\n\n\n\nThe shakes die down, and I stand, ready to descend icarine from the celestial suite back to terra firma, seedy ever-dead Chicago, and my comfortably drab hotel.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have not,\u201d I make very clear, \u201cGot a visionary bone in your body, not yet. But there is an ember in you, and if we tend it well, it might be a fire. For now\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nI fluff up my jacket to give it that perfect arhythm, and turn. //Here's// what he wants to hear.\n\n\n\n\u201cLeave the art to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n", "references": ["whenwerewe"], "tags": ["black-diamond-billions", "corporate", "fantasy", "first-person", "ghost", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "science-fiction", "skitter-marshall", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Tame Impaler - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/abasedebase", "year": 2026}, "acceptable-losses": {"created_at": "2026-01-14T09:55:00", "creator": "Loop11", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Rhys_and_wolves.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-14T09:55:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-14T09:55:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-14T09:56:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "corrected word count", "date": "2026-01-14T10:42:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "Added tags: adventure, military-fiction.

Lying face down in the snow with blood streaming from his left shoulder, he considered his situation.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>The cold hit first, seeping through the torn layers of Kevlar into his skin. His arm, half exposed through the ruins of his sleeve, had already gone numb in the snow. He couldn\u2019t feel his fingers. Carefully, he managed to prop himself up with his back against a tree. He tried to move his left arm and regretted it immediately. Something in his shoulder tore as he shifted it and he had to fight back a scream. He let his arm slack again and focused on breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. It didn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>Through the pine trees, snowflakes drifted down. He could almost hear them falling, quiet as it was. He watched one settle on the back of his glove and vanish. Another followed. Then another. It distantly occurred to him that if he stayed here long enough, the snow would cover him completely and he would be like the others.</p>\n<p>The others.</p>\n<p>His squadron lay around him. He could tell by the stained red mounds of snow that covered them. Rhys closed his eyes for a moment and revelled in the darkness, but even the eigengrau wasn\u2019t safe as images of his friends being torn apart resurfaced in his mind's eye. His heart racing, he opened his eyes again, and stared at the forest floor until it stopped spinning. Having composed himself, Rhys ran his functional hand over his body. A few minor surface wounds, but aside from his shoulder he and his gear seemed mostly intact. Sitting there in the snow, 53\u00a0km deep into Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, he did the only thing he knew how to do: consult his training.</p>\n<p>He had dug out three of his fallen comrades before he found Stephen, their medpack carrier. He packed the deep bite and covered it with gauze, before tightly wrapping his shoulder and upper arm in bandages. He could feel the blood soak through the first few layers, but it would have to be enough for now. His left arm held up in a sling, he felt for the comm in his helmet.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'MTF Lambda-7, this is Agent Carter, come in,' he said, forcing the words out. His throat felt raw, like he had been screaming for hours. Maybe he had. It occurred to him that he had no idea how long he\u2019d be lying there, drifting in and out of consciousness. He tapped the side of his helmet twice, 'Command, do you read?'</p>\n<p>He lay there listening to the static, waiting for the click that meant he wasn\u2019t totally alone. Someone always answered. Even if Command didn\u2019t reply, even if the uplink failed, someone on their squad would come in with some smart-ass remark or a shaky 'yeah, I\u2019m here.' Nothing came. The dead line didn\u2019t even give him the courtesy of interference.</p>\n<p>Rhys shifted his head just enough to look beyond the base of a tree. Dense patches of spruce and pine stretched in all directions. Dark and pale trunks rose from the snow like his own personal prison bars. He could see shallow, pinkish tracks leading to a larger mound of snow, approximately thirty metres from his position. He knew what would be under there, something large and furry that vaguely reminded him of a Smilodon. It must have wandered off after massacring his squad and knocking him unconscious. It was dead. Small red blots seeping through the snow revealed the location of at least forty bullet-holes.</p>\n<p>Rhys caught himself feeling disappointment. That shocked him. After all, he was safer with it dead than alive. Still, the dread persisted, it was the knowledge that their capture mission had failed. Part of him had hoped that if he could face the thing again then maybe, just maybe he wouldn\u2019t die in vain. Perhaps he could still do something to help future squads catch and study it. Now, that hope melted away, and looking at the snow-covered corpse of the beast that had murdered his friends he felt well and truly alone.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'They\u2019re coming,' He muttered, though he wasn\u2019t sure who he meant. Extraction, QRF, anyone. It didn\u2019t matter. He knew the protocols, everyone did. Contact loss, presumed total casualty, they\u2019d redirect the comm line and divert resources elsewhere. That comm unit in his helmet was useful for nothing but decoration.</p>\n<p>He pictured some weaselly, bespectacled man already writing a neat line into his report, somewhere far south of the treeline. <em>MTF Lambda-7 neutralised during initial engagement. Recovery deemed nonviable.</em></p>\n<p><em>Nonviable</em>, he almost laughed.</p>\n<p>It was such a stupid word, too clinical in the face of it all. He tried to picture himself as a data point, an \u2018X\u2019 in a box, but the image refused to settle. His shoulder throbbed in time with his pulse. He tasted copper in his mouth. Slowly, he got up, his nearly empty M25 held out in front of him, and approached the bleeding mound that used to be the anomaly. Now closer, he could see tufts of frozen, light grey fur poking through the snow. He kicked it, then again, and again, screamed every profanity he knew at it and then some. It didn\u2019t move. Rhys cleared away some of the snow and sat against its side, knowing he was going to die.</p>\n<p>He'd just closed his eyes when he heard a cracking noise, subtle at first then louder. A distinct primal fear overtook him when he met the eyes of a wolf standing just a few metres from him. Three wolves, he noted soon after, three wolves circling him. It was funny, he hadn\u2019t been afraid when the anomaly charged them, but now, alone in the snow with one bullet left in his pistol, he was terrified of some ordinary wolves.</p>\n<p>Still facing the main wolf, Rhys awkwardly pushed himself onto the large back of the anomaly. It was a clumsy affair, with only one functional arm, but the wolves didn\u2019t advance. Perhaps they too, were confused as to what he was doing. They watched him with flat, unreadable eyes. Steam curled from their mouths in steady breaths. They were healthy, shiny coats, no visible ribs, not desperate. That, somehow, made it worse. Rhys kept the gun trained on the one in front, though the blood loss and the cold made his arm tremble badly enough that the sight wobbled in and out of line with its head. One bullet. He was acutely aware of it now, of the fact that even if he used it perfectly it wouldn\u2019t matter. Wolves didn\u2019t charge one at a time.</p>\n<p>Behind him, a wolf took a step closer. Rhys spun around.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'Stay back,' Rhys commanded. He raised his arm above his head, attempting to look as large as possible. Rhys was not a small man, but the blood now seeping through the bandage on his shoulder and the way he winced with every movement did nothing to help his threat display. He swallowed hard and tried again, louder. 'Go on, get out of here!'</p>\n<p>The wolf cocked its head, as if genuinely considering the offer. Its gaze flicked briefly from Rhys, to the bulk of the anomaly beneath him. Rhys felt a sudden, absurd surge of possessiveness. This thing was his now. It had killed his friends, but they had killed it, so now it belonged to him. He trained his pistol on the mass of the closest wolf again.</p>\n<p>The main wolf behind him moved forward, he heard its paws crunch in the snow. He didn\u2019t know if it actually was the lead wolf, or if wolves had a chain of command at all, but it seemed as good a name as any. A third stayed back in the treeline, a pale thing half swallowed by the snow. They\u2019d stopped circling him now, but he estimated he could easily touch one if he reached down, as close as they\u2019d gotten. He\u2019d barely even noticed it, but there they were, only an arms-length away. And him, standing atop the thing that killed his friends, brandishing a gun that wouldn\u2019t save him.</p>\n<p>Then the front wolf lowered its head and sniffed. Not at Rhys. At the anomaly. Its nose brushed a piece of blood-matted fur where the snow had fallen away. It recoiled instantly, fur on end, and let out a low growl. The other two reacted instantly, stiff, with their ears pinned back and teeth bared.</p>\n<p>Rhys noticed it then, too. The anomaly didn\u2019t smell of death, not exclusively at least. It had this sharp, metallic, yet strangely sweet scent about it. He hadn\u2019t even noticed it at first, because he\u2019d smelled it so many times before. That\u2019s just what lingers around things that don\u2019t quite belong. That <em>wrong</em> smell that made his stomach churn if he breathed too deeply. The wolves clearly knew it as well.</p>\n<p>The front wolf took a step back. Then another. The wolves lingered for a moment longer, eyes never leaving him, then one by one turned and melted back into the trees. The last thing he saw was the pale one, at the treeline, glancing over its shoulder before vanishing out of sight. Rhys let out a deep breath. His knees threatened to give out and he kneeled onto the body beneath him, digging his fingers into its pallid fur. He laughed then, a rough, broken sound that turned into something close to a sob. He pressed his forehead to the creature\u2019s back and stayed there, breathing deep, until the shaking passed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'Okay,' he whispered to no one particular. 'Okay, still here.'</p>\n<p>It occurred to him, then, that these were not the words of a man resigned to his inevitable demise. The realization crept up on him slowly, unwelcome yet utterly undeniable: this thing had protected him. Not intentionally, of course, but its presence, even in death, had kept him alive for a few minutes longer. That changed things.</p>\n<p>He pushed himself back upright, grimacing at the pain in his shoulder, and scanned the forest. No movement, the wolves were gone. Now, just a long, cold stretch of wilderness lay between him and anything resembling safety. Dying here was still an option, but it wasn\u2019t the only one anymore.</p>\n<p>Rhys carefully slid from the anomaly\u2019s back and looked it over. A massive ruin of a body with thick, albeit blood-soaked, fur. An idea began to take shape, one very much against protocol. He holstered his pistol and went for the knife at his belt.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'You\u2019re going to be useful,' he smiled. The forest did not protest as he began to work.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIt couldn\u2019t quite be called a cloak. The vaguely oblong swath of fur with a slit cut into it to wrap around his shoulders still dripped with blood, despite Rhys\u2019 best attempts to scrub it clean with snow. Skinning such a large creature one-handed had been no easy feat. It didn\u2019t help that the anomaly seemed to have some kind of thick, blubber-like layer into which his knife continuously lodged itself. In the end, he\u2019d given up on taking the entire skin and settled for carving out a patch of fur from the thing\u2019s side. While this left his end product looking less than presentable, the large size of the anomaly meant Rhys\u2019 new cloak was still more than big enough to wrap around his entire body like a parka.</p>\n<p>His work had left an open hole in the side of the thing, exposing its meat. Rhys wondered if it was edible. He\u2019d resigned himself to the fact that a very long hike was in his future, and he\u2019d need something to eat. He ran his knife along a rib, scraping off a thin sliver of marbled red meat and hesitantly placed it into his mouth. Rancid. That was the only word that came close to describing the taste Rhys stood trying to scrub from his tongue. He\u2019d spat it out immediately, gagging, but the sour taste lingered. He now understood why the wolves had growled at it, he was tempted to do the same.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'Fine,' Rhys muttered. 'Worth a try.'</p>\n<p>He shelved the thought of food for now. Logistics and tactics, that was safer ground for him. He took stock of what he had left with a familiar, detached efficiency that gave him a comforting sense of normal. One sidearm, good. One bullet in said sidearm, less good. An m4 carbine slung across his back, but that wouldn\u2019t do him much good with his motionless left arm. A knife dulled by bone and hide. An in-helmet communicator that might as well have been brick, and a well-stocked medpack which he was currently using to refresh his bandages.</p>\n<p>And time, maybe.</p>\n<p>He forced himself away from the body and gathered what he could from the snow around him. The ripped open pack of their field scout yielded a crushed ration brick and a plastic baggy with cigarettes and, more interestingly, a lighter. While clearing away snow from what he thought was an extra coat, he found only the frozen arm of one of his comrades. He left it where it was, but it reminded him of his most important duty. He dug out and lined up his fallen squadmates, then saluted them one by one.</p>\n<p>Before moving on, he returned to the anomaly once more. The dark hole he\u2019d left in its side still steamed faintly. Rhys hesitated for a moment, then plunged his hand into the open cavity. He rubbed a thick layer of blood all over his fur cloak and tactical gear, until he reeked to high heavens and had to fight his gag reflex. The wolves hadn\u2019t liked the smell. That was all that mattered.</p>\n<p>He saluted it, too.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span><span style=\"color: #c5d1c9\">DAY 1</span></span></h1>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>Rhys started counting his steps in intervals of three. It gave his mind something to do in the monotony of trees and snow.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d picked his direction quickly. While their tracks were long gone, they\u2019d moved in a relatively straight line, and walking away from the bodies soon brought Rhys to small landmarks he recognised. He knew his goal clearly: Two jeeps waited in a clearing, a few kilometres into the park. They'd ditched them there to avoid tipping off the anomaly. <em>Lotta good that did</em>, he thought.</p>\n<p>The fur cloak worked better than he\u2019d expected. Having to keep holding it shut tired him out, so he poked a small hole on either side of the slit and pinned it closed with a stick. The cold still crept in eventually, but slower now with both his arms under the fur.</p>\n<p>When exhaustion hit, he let himself collapse against a tree. His carbine\u2019s bullets proved useful for starting a small fire which he used to warm up a chunk of the ration bar. It didn\u2019t taste any better warmed than cold, but even a meagre hot meal helped stave off the shreds of cold that had slipped through the cloak. That night he slept in fragments, waking every time he twitched in his sleep and hit his shoulder against the tree. He dreamt of radio static turning into voices. He awoke to silence.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc1\"><span><span style=\"color: #c5d1c9\">DAY 2</span></span></h1>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>The trees seemed to be thinning slightly, and Rhys came upon a thin stream. The freezing water soothed his aching throat and invigorated his movements. He took the moment to clean his wounds. The cold water stung, but seemed to slow the bleeding.</p>\n<p>That afternoon he saw a deer in the distance. Hesitantly, he removed his pistol from its place at his hip. However, as he dropped into a crouch and inched closer into position, the deer\u2019s head shot up in his direction. For a split second they stared at each other, prey and predator, both frozen. Then it bolted, vanishing into the brush with the violent crash of branches.</p>\n<p>Rhys was beginning to regret his venture into the world of anomalous perfumery.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc2\"><span><span style=\"color: #c5d1c9\">DAY 3</span></span></h1>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>After what had begun to feel like an endlessly repeating landscape, the trees finally gave way to icy plains. Here, away from the protection of the trees, the wind cut into him. He was reminded harshly of the damage his body had taken when a minor gust caused him to slip on a patch of ice. He crashed onto the frigid surface and his vision burst white. He lay there longer than he should have. He\u2019d learned, by now, that staying still for too long was a bad idea, the cold would creep into his bones no matter how tightly he pulled his fur around him. He lay on his back, gasping for air. <em>This is it, this is where I stop</em>, the thought flashed through his mind for only a moment before he forced it away. It took him a while to get back up. He struggled to find his balance on the slick surface. Eventually, he was able to use his knife to anchor himself into the ice and hoist himself up.</p>\n<p>Rhys thought a lot as he walked. Frankly, there wasn\u2019t much else to do. He thought of his friends, of how he\u2019d liked to have buried them proper, even though the ground was hard and frozen so he knew it was impossible. Of the anomaly, laying there in the vast wilderness. He imagined it contained in a sterile, white box. Pulling his cloak tight, he considered that maybe it was better off dead.</p>\n<p>Most of all, he thought about the Foundation.</p>\n<p>The even, undisturbed snow reminded him of the shiny white walls and the coats of researchers. Researchers who stood around watercoolers talking casually about monsters and how many had died to contain them. One day, on his way to windowless briefing room, he\u2019d overheard two weathered senior researchers comparing \u2018kill stats\u2019. They\u2019d boasted, trying to convince the other that <em>their</em> project was the more dangerous and impressive assignment.</p>\n<p>He'd believed in it once, too. In the idea that someone had to do the dirty work so the rest of the machine could pretend that things just materialised in boxes for them to study. That it mattered, that <em>they</em> mattered. Someone had to die in the dark. He wasn\u2019t sure when that faith had begun to crack. Maybe it had always been just a hollow fantasy he convinced himself of so he could sleep at night.</p>\n<p>He imagined a meeting room. Some suits who\u2019d never been in the field a day in their life saying his name in the past tense before moving on to the next point on the agenda. They\u2019d consider sending some other squad to go looking for the anomaly. Maybe they\u2019d even designate a new Lambda-7. His stomach stiffened and he tightened his jaw against the feeling.</p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t come looking. That was what stuck with him, kept him walking. No reply on the comms for a few hours had been enough to be written off.</p>\n<p>Rhys stumbled, caught himself on a rock and pressed his forehead to the icy stone. The hard, cold texture felt nice against his face, it soothed a burning there he hadn\u2019t even noticed existed. He elected to spend the night by the boulder, to shelter from the harsh winds that swept the plain. His eyes wandered over the smooth snow ahead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'If I make it.' Rhys stopped, shaking his head. 'When I make it out of here\u2026'<br/>\nHe didn\u2019t finish the thought. What would he do? The world outside the Foundation seemed abstract, but the idea of walking into another briefing room made his heart race.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t feel himself fall asleep, and he didn\u2019t dream.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span><span style=\"color: #c5d1c9\">DAY 4</span></span></h1>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>He smelled the jeeps before he saw them. He\u2019d never noticed it before, but after days of nothing but frost and pine the smell of gasoline was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Every step after that was weightless. He didn\u2019t even feel the hot pulse of his shoulder or the weight of his gear, not even after today\u2019s hours of walking. He trudged into some spindly bushes and elected to put his helmet back on to prevent the branches from whipping him in the face as he pushed through.</p>\n<p>Then, the foliage gave way and Rhys' eyes began to sting.</p>\n<p>A clearing with some frozen tarps and tape flapping about. Their shapes now seemed so alien he barely recognised what he was looking at. The jeeps. His jeep. He\u2019d imagined this moment a thousand times while he walked, yet now faced with his freedom he found himself overcome with a profound aimlessness. He regarded the jeeps with careful eyes. The keys of the one he\u2019d driven burned a hole in one of his many pockets. He wanted nothing more than to just get in, to be <em>inside</em> something again. Something gnawed at him, however.</p>\n<p>His gaze wandered to the roof of his jeep. From the smooth black, unmarked body rose the metre tall broadcast antenna. The more complex radio system in the jeep would let him talk directly to various command channels. He had his pick of open lines. For a long time, Rhys stared at the dark rod surrounded by smooth snow on the roof.</p>\n<p>He trained his pistol\u2019s sights on the antenna and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p>The thing exploded in a mess of plastic, metal and wires. He dropped his gun in the snow and looked at what he\u2019d done. <em>Worth it.</em></p>\n<p>He limped over to the driver\u2019s side and fumbled with the door. It took him two good tugs before it snapped open. The inside smelled like dusty fabric and cough drops. In that moment, it was the best smell in the world. He slid into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled the door closed behind him with a reverent <em>click</em>. For a moment he just sat there, his fur coat thrown messily into the seat next to him. Inside felt amazing. His first course of action was to turn the heat up as high as it would go. It soothed his aching muscles, but the warmth combined with the enclosed space made the terrible odour he\u2019d coated himself with all the more apparent. Maybe a shower should be his first stop, he considered, after the hospital of course. His fingers had turned black somewhere between day two and three.</p>\n<p>He turned the key all the way. The engine coughed once, then roared to life. The sound was deafening to him. Rhys let out a shaky breath and rested his hand on the wheel. He could drive north. Find some tiny town that didn\u2019t ask too many questions, blend in. He could head south. Dump the jeep, flag someone down on the side of the road and see how long it took before the men in unmarked cars arrived.</p>\n<p>He could go anywhere.</p>\n<p>The Foundation would notice eventually. Of course they would, Rhys held no illusions about that. They might notice their radio antenna going dark and figure it out, or come back here eventually and find one less jeep than there should be. They\u2019d open a file, and speculate quietly in windowless rooms.</p>\n<p>But they wouldn\u2019t know where he went.</p>\n<p>Rhys glanced in the rearview mirror. Covered in dried viscera, his hair standing stiff on his head, his arm transitioned from bright red to purply black and the beginnings of a beard covered his face. He barely recognised himself. He smiled.</p>\n<p><em>Nonviable.</em> The word didn\u2019t hurt as much anymore.</p>\n<p>He put the jeep in gear. The tires crunched in the snow as he pulled away. It would swallow his tracks like it had swallowed everything else. Rhys didn\u2019t look back. He drove until the sky began to change colour. Eventually he drove from an unmarked patch of plains, onto an equally unmarked backwater road. He didn\u2019t know where he was going.</p>\n<p>Only that he was going.</p>\n<p>And somewhere far away a report would eventually be written.</p>\n<p>It would be drafted up, formatted perfectly and shoved into a dusty filing cabinet.</p>\n<p>It would say:</p>\n<p><em>MTF Lambda-7: no survivors.</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>And for once, it would be wrong.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/acceptable-losses\">Acceptable Losses</a>\" by Loop11, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Even if Command didn\u2019t reply, even if the uplink failed, someone on their squad would come in with some smart-ass remark or a shaky 'yeah, I\u2019m here.' Nothing came. The dead line didn\u2019t even give him the courtesy of interference.\n\n\n\nRhys shifted his head just enough to look beyond the base of a tree. Dense patches of spruce and pine stretched in all directions. Dark and pale trunks rose from the snow like his own personal prison bars. He could see shallow, pinkish tracks leading to a larger mound of snow, approximately thirty metres from his position. He knew what would be under there, something large and furry that vaguely reminded him of a Smilodon. It must have wandered off after massacring his squad and knocking him unconscious. It was dead. Small red blots seeping through the snow revealed the location of at least forty bullet-holes. \n\n\n\nRhys caught himself feeling disappointment. That shocked him. After all, he was safer with it dead than alive. Still, the dread persisted, it was the knowledge that their capture mission had failed. Part of him had hoped that if he could face the thing again then maybe, just maybe he wouldn\u2019t die in vain. Perhaps he could still do something to help future squads catch and study it. Now, that hope melted away, and looking at the snow-covered corpse of the beast that had murdered his friends he felt well and truly alone.\n\n\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@'They\u2019re coming,' He muttered, though he wasn\u2019t sure who he meant.

Slowly, he got up, his nearly empty M25 held out in front of him, and approached the bleeding mound that used to be the anomaly. Now closer, he could see tufts of frozen, light grey fur poking through the snow. He kicked it, then again, and again, screamed every profanity he knew at it and then some. It didn\u2019t move. Rhys cleared away some of the snow and sat against its side, knowing he was going to die.\n\n\n\nHe'd just closed his eyes when he heard a cracking noise, subtle at first then louder. A distinct primal fear overtook him when he met the eyes of a wolf standing just a few metres from him. Three wolves, he noted soon after, three wolves circling him. It was funny, he hadn\u2019t been afraid when the anomaly charged them, but now, alone in the snow with one bullet left in his pistol, he was terrified of some ordinary wolves.\n\n\n\nStill facing the main wolf, Rhys awkwardly pushed himself onto the large back of the anomaly. It was a clumsy affair, with only one functional arm, but the wolves didn\u2019t advance. Perhaps they too, were confused as to what he was doing. They watched him with flat, unreadable eyes. Steam curled from their mouths in steady breaths. They were healthy, shiny coats, no visible ribs, not desperate. That, somehow, made it worse. Rhys kept the gun trained on the one in front, though the blood loss and the cold made his arm tremble badly enough that the sight wobbled in and out of line with its head. One bullet. He was acutely aware of it now, of the fact that even if he used it perfectly it wouldn\u2019t matter. Wolves didn\u2019t charge one at a time.\n\n\n\nBehind him, a wolf took a step closer.

He swallowed hard and tried again, louder. 'Go on, get out of here!'\n\n\n\nThe wolf cocked its head, as if genuinely considering the offer. Its gaze flicked briefly from Rhys, to the bulk of the anomaly beneath him. Rhys felt a sudden, absurd surge of possessiveness. This thing was his now. It had killed his friends, but they had killed it, so now it belonged to him. He trained his pistol on the mass of the closest wolf again.\n\n\n\nThe main wolf behind him moved forward, he heard its paws crunch in the snow. He didn\u2019t know if it actually was the lead wolf, or if wolves had a chain of command at all, but it seemed as good a name as any. A third stayed back in the treeline, a pale thing half swallowed by the snow. They\u2019d stopped circling him now, but he estimated he could easily touch one if he reached down, as close as they\u2019d gotten. He\u2019d barely even noticed it, but there they were, only an arms-length away. And him, standing atop the thing that killed his friends, brandishing a gun that wouldn\u2019t save him.\n\n\n\nThen the front wolf lowered its head and sniffed. Not at Rhys. At the anomaly. Its nose brushed a piece of blood-matted fur where the snow had fallen away. It recoiled instantly, fur on end, and let out a low growl. The other two reacted instantly, stiff, with their ears pinned back and teeth bared.\n\n\n\nRhys noticed it then, too. The anomaly didn\u2019t smell of death, not exclusively at least. It had this sharp, metallic, yet strangely sweet scent about it. He hadn\u2019t even noticed it at first, because he\u2019d smelled it so many times before. That\u2019s just what lingers around things that don\u2019t quite belong. That //wrong// smell that made his stomach churn if he breathed too deeply. The wolves clearly knew it as well.\n\n\n\nThe front wolf took a step back. Then another. The wolves lingered for a moment longer, eyes never leaving him, then one by one turned and melted back into the trees. The last thing he saw was the pale one, at the treeline, glancing over its shoulder before vanishing out of sight. Rhys let out a deep breath. His knees threatened to give out and he kneeled onto the body beneath him, digging his fingers into its pallid fur. He laughed then, a rough, broken sound that turned into something close to a sob.

Not intentionally, of course, but its presence, even in death, had kept him alive for a few minutes longer. That changed things.\n\n\n\nHe pushed himself back upright, grimacing at the pain in his shoulder, and scanned the forest. No movement, the wolves were gone.

The vaguely oblong swath of fur with a slit cut into it to wrap around his shoulders still dripped with blood, despite Rhys\u2019 best attempts to scrub it clean with snow. Skinning such a large creature one-handed had been no easy feat. It didn\u2019t help that the anomaly seemed to have some kind of thick, blubber-like layer into which his knife continuously lodged itself. In the end, he\u2019d given up on taking the entire skin and settled for carving out a patch of fur from the thing\u2019s side. While this left his end product looking less than presentable, the large size of the anomaly meant Rhys\u2019 new cloak was still more than big enough to wrap around his entire body like a parka.\n\n\n\nHis work had left an open hole in the side of the thing, exposing its meat. Rhys wondered if it was edible. He\u2019d resigned himself to the fact that a very long hike was in his future, and he\u2019d need something to eat. He ran his knife along a rib, scraping off a thin sliver of marbled red meat and hesitantly placed it into his mouth. Rancid.

Logistics and tactics, that was safer ground for him. He took stock of what he had left with a familiar, detached efficiency that gave him a comforting sense of normal. One sidearm, good. One bullet in said sidearm, less good. An m4 carbine slung across his back, but that wouldn\u2019t do him much good with his motionless left arm. A knife dulled by bone and hide. An in-helmet communicator that might as well have been brick, and a well-stocked medpack which he was currently using to refresh his bandages.\n\n\n\nAnd time, maybe.\n\n\n\nHe forced himself away from the body and gathered what he could from the snow around him. The ripped open pack of their field scout yielded a crushed ration brick and a plastic baggy with cigarettes and, more interestingly, a lighter. While clearing away snow from what he thought was an extra coat, he found only the frozen arm of one of his comrades. He left it where it was, but it reminded him of his most important duty. He dug out and lined up his fallen squadmates, then saluted them one by one.\n\n\n\nBefore moving on, he returned to the anomaly once more. The dark hole he\u2019d left in its side still steamed faintly. Rhys hesitated for a moment, then plunged his hand into the open cavity.

It was, as these things go, safe to be around; if undamaged, the Chanhassen source would take over a week of passive exposure to kill a healthy adult.</p>\n<p>You will note that there are four variables in that sentence: \"undamaged\", \"passive\", \"healthy\" and \"adult\". We will come back to them later.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Chanhassen is an outer suburb on the southern edge of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. It has a population of approximately twenty-five thousand, and is home to the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum; the Temple of Eck, headquarters of the new-age religious movement Eckankar; and Paisley Park, the former estate of the late musician Prince, now a recording studio and museum. It was also home to Athanasia Radiology, the Prometheus Medical subsidiary which conducted thanatotherapy trials in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Athanasia Radiology did not make it through the paratech crash, and shuttered its doors in 1997. All the mundane radiation sources were removed during the company's liquidation; Lieutenant Hackwell's femur was not. It remained untouched in a basement storage room for a quarter of a century, slightly lowering the life expectancy of the abandoned laboratory's rodent population and occasionally reanimating an insect. And there it would have stayed, if not for the intervention of a group of local teens.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>On October 31st, 2023, around 10:30 PM, a group of six Chanhassen High School seniors broke in to the Athanasia Radiology facility on a dare. All the teenagers were mildly intoxicated, and two of them had smoked a small amount of cannabis. One of those two, Keith Dahl, had also consumed a dose of psilocybin mushrooms; unbeknownst to him, this psychedelic experience had awakened his latent thaumaturgic talent.</p>\n<p>The ringleader, Mike Nelson, led the group into the basement, intending to hold a seance. The storage room containing the Chanhassen source was chosen, as it had the \"spookiest vibes\", and the teenagers soon found the source, deciding to use it as a prop for their seance. They lit candles, attempted to invoke the spirits of the dead, and passed around the femur. When Keith Dahl was given the femur, and called out to the spirit of its former owner, the Chanhassen Catastrophe began.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the framework of Universal Thaumatology, there are three components to any thaumatological working (or, in layman's terms, a spell): energy, action, and will. Energy is given purpose by the caster's will and form by their action. Purpose guides form, leading to change. In the case of Keith Dahl's accidental working, the energy was the thanatic power of the Chanhassen source; the action was his invocation of Lieutenant Hackwell's spirit; and the will was his own desire to, in his own words, \"see some spooky Halloween shit\". The result of this malformed spell was predictably disastrous.</p>\n<p>First: the summoning succeeded. Jeremiah Hackwell's shade was conjured up from Hell, the Tartarean realm where it had resided for the past 160 years. He was disoriented and only semi-sapient. This working had an approximate ARAD reading of 2.5 Kilocaspers, Sapphire, Sharp, Loose \u2014 moderate power, relatively blatant, constructive, and poorly formed. From these data, we can extrapolate the spell's backlash.</p>\n<p>Lower intensity, opposite hue, opposite pitch, same weave. With a Loose weave, we expect backlash of around 75% the original intensity, or approximately 1.8 Kilocaspers. Hue goes from Sapphire to Lemon, reducing the blatancy of the effect; pitch goes from Sharp to Flat, resulting in a destructive effect. The Chanhassen source's inlaid circuitry was partially destroyed by a burst of heat, and as a result, the source began actively and uncontrollably emitting thanatic energy, killing and reanimating all six teenagers.</p>\n<p>Secondary backlash occured with an intensity of about 1.25 Kilocaspers, and the same hue and pitch as the original spell. This bound the ghost of Jeremiah Hackwell into the Chanhassen source, and the ghost of Keith Dahl into his own reanimated corpse, allowing him to regain control of his body; the ghosts of the remaining teenagers were too weak to survive the binding, and dissipated.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Post-mortem sapience is possible for most thaumaturges, given sufficient study of the necromantic arts, but rarely desireable. Even the most powerful ghosts are limited by their existence as energy constructs, unable to work magic without destabilizing their animating essence and damaging their own memories. Revenants, like the unfortunate Mr. Dahl, are slightly hardier, and can safely cast spells using external EVE sources, but they require expensive chemical treatments and regular embalming sessions to stave off decay. Most mages simply prefer to die, and leave their legacy to their heirs.</p>\n<p>Keith Dahl was luckier than most revenants, in that his body was in near-perfect condition; thanatic energy kills by interrupting metabolic processes, much like cyanide, leading to cell death without gross tissue damage. He had yet to realize that he was dead. His first reaction, upon regaining consciousness and seeing the corpses of his friends, was to call 911. The tertiary backlash (subtle, destructive) of his accidental spell had damaged his cell phone, but his friend Mary Anderson's was still functional, and he made the call. An ambulance was sent to the abandoned laboratory, followed by a Carver County sheriff's deputy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Mr. Dahl made his way out of the basement to wait for emergency services, still holding the Chanhassen source. The ambulance arrived first, and the EMTs, Carlos Gutierrez and Julie Vang, quickly identified Mr. Dahl's lack of any vital signs. Given his continued animation, the human bone still clutched in his left hand, and the date, they decided to \"get the fuck out before [they] got zombified too.\" They gave him a space blanket and a hand warmer, and fled the scene. This saved their lives.</p>\n<p>Deputy Eli Johanssen was not so lucky. He had been warned about Mr. Dahl's undead nature by the paramedics, and came out of his squad car with his pistol drawn. Unfortunately, Carver County sheriff's uniforms are grey, and Jeremiah Hackwell's bound spirit was startled. Believing Deputy Johanssen to be a member of the Confederate Army, Hackwell used his nascent control over the Chanhassen source to shoot a focused beam of thanatic energy at Deputy Johanssen's heart, killing him instantly.</p>\n<p>At this point, Mr. Dahl fled back into the abandoned laboratory with the Chanhassen source. His decision to hide, rather than to make his way into town in search of medical attention or an authority figure, likely saved many lives. Within two hours, alerted by keywords in local law enforcement radio transmissions, Moblie Task Force Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\") had arrived on the scene, and quickly contained Mr. Dahl and the Chanhassen source.</p>\n<p>At his request, Mr. Dahl's spirit was banished after a brief interview; his body and the bodies of his friends were deanimated and returned to their families for burial. Standard cover story CO-3, \"Carbon Monoxide Inhalation,\" was disseminated to the press. The EMTs, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Vang, were amnesticized and implanted with false memories of discovering the bodies of the children and the sheriff's deputy in the laboratory basement. The Chanhassen source is classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is contained in a lead-lined containment locker at Storage Site-23.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>There are three primary lessons to be learned from the Chanhassen Catastrophe.</p>\n<p>First, that paratechnology must be contained. If the Athanasia Radiology clinic had been located in a paranormal enclave such as Three Portlands, it is likely that the Chanhassen Source would not have been abandoned in the first place; and if it had, anyone who encountered it would have been better equipped to recognize it as a dangerous occult artifact. The spread of paratechnology into unveiled society is dangerous, and preventing that spread is one of the primary purposes of the Foundation; nexuses and freeports are the lesser of two evils.</p>\n<p>Second, that thaumatology is inherently dangerous. Even operatives of the Global Occult Coalition sometimes fail to sufficiently account for backlash; if the best-trained occultists in the world can be killed by an unmanaged spell, self-trained civilian thaumaturges stand no chance. The Coalition's near-monopoly on thaumatological education probably causes more good than harm, at least for now, but the Foundation, in the interest of public safety and the continuity of humanity, has a duty to contain or eliminate any thaumaturges not affiliated with the GOC.</p>\n<p>And finally, that civilian cowardice saves lives. The EMTs immediately left the scene when they realized that Mr. Dahl's condition was anomalous; after the death of Deputy Johanssen, Mr. Dahl himself hid from further human contact. Both these actions prevented deaths, and more could have been prevented if Mr. Dahl and his friends had been too scared to enter the abandoned laboratory in the first place. Foundation social engineering programs since the end of the Cold War have done an admirable job at maintaining high levels of fear and anxiety in the American populace, and consistently prove their worth; if adolescent male bravado can be further tempered, it is estimated that civilian contact with the anomalous could be reduced by up to 15%. A scared populace is a quiet populace.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/dig-u-better-dead\">Dig U Better Dead</a>\" by ch00bakka, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

And there it would have stayed, if not for the intervention of a group of local teens.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOn October 31st, 2023, around 10:30 PM, a group of six Chanhassen High School seniors broke in to the Athanasia Radiology facility on a dare. All the teenagers were mildly intoxicated, and two of them had smoked a small amount of cannabis. One of those two, Keith Dahl, had also consumed a dose of psilocybin mushrooms; unbeknownst to him, this psychedelic experience had awakened his latent thaumaturgic talent. \n\n\n\nThe ringleader, Mike Nelson, led the group into the basement, intending to hold a seance. The storage room containing the Chanhassen source was chosen, as it had the \"spookiest vibes\", and the teenagers soon found the source, deciding to use it as a prop for their seance. They lit candles, attempted to invoke the spirits of the dead, and passed around the femur. When Keith Dahl was given the femur, and called out to the spirit of its former owner, the Chanhassen Catastrophe began. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nIn the framework of Universal Thaumatology, there are three components to any thaumatological working (or, in layman's terms, a spell): energy, action, and will. Energy is given purpose by the caster's will and form by their action. Purpose guides form, leading to change. In the case of Keith Dahl's accidental working, the energy was the thanatic power of the Chanhassen source; the action was his invocation of Lieutenant Hackwell's spirit; and the will was his own desire to, in his own words, \"see some spooky Halloween shit\". The result of this malformed spell was predictably disastrous. \n\n\n\nFirst: the summoning succeeded. Jeremiah Hackwell's shade was conjured up from Hell, the Tartarean realm where it had resided for the past 160 years. He was disoriented and only semi-sapient. This working had an approximate ARAD reading of 2.5 Kilocaspers, Sapphire, Sharp, Loose -- moderate power, relatively blatant, constructive, and poorly formed. From these data, we can extrapolate the spell's backlash.\n\n\n\nLower intensity, opposite hue, opposite pitch, same weave. With a Loose weave, we expect backlash of around 75% the original intensity, or approximately 1.8 Kilocaspers. Hue goes from Sapphire to Lemon, reducing the blatancy of the effect; pitch goes from Sharp to Flat, resulting in a destructive effect. The Chanhassen source's inlaid circuitry was partially destroyed by a burst of heat, and as a result, the source began actively and uncontrollably emitting thanatic energy, killing and reanimating all six teenagers.\n\n\n\nSecondary backlash occured with an intensity of about 1.25 Kilocaspers, and the same hue and pitch as the original spell. This bound the ghost of Jeremiah Hackwell into the Chanhassen source, and the ghost of Keith Dahl into his own reanimated corpse, allowing him to regain control of his body; the ghosts of the remaining teenagers were too weak to survive the binding, and dissipated. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nPost-mortem sapience is possible for most thaumaturges, given sufficient study of the necromantic arts, but rarely desireable. Even the most powerful ghosts are limited by their existence as energy constructs, unable to work magic without destabilizing their animating essence and damaging their own memories. Revenants, like the unfortunate Mr. Dahl, are slightly hardier, and can safely cast spells using external EVE sources, but they require expensive chemical treatments and regular embalming sessions to stave off decay. Most mages simply prefer to die, and leave their legacy to their heirs. \n\n\n\nKeith Dahl was luckier than most revenants, in that his body was in near-perfect condition; thanatic energy kills by interrupting metabolic processes, much like cyanide, leading to cell death without gross tissue damage. He had yet to realize that he was dead. His first reaction, upon regaining consciousness and seeing the corpses of his friends, was to call 911. The tertiary backlash (subtle, destructive) of his accidental spell had damaged his cell phone, but his friend Mary Anderson's was still functional, and he made the call. An ambulance was sent to the abandoned laboratory, followed by a Carver County sheriff's deputy. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMr. Dahl made his way out of the basement to wait for emergency services, still holding the Chanhassen source. The ambulance arrived first, and the EMTs, Carlos Gutierrez and Julie Vang, quickly identified Mr. Dahl's lack of any vital signs. Given his continued animation, the human bone still clutched in his left hand, and the date, they decided to \"get the fuck out before [they] got zombified too.\" They gave him a space blanket and a hand warmer, and fled the scene. This saved their lives. \n\n\n\nDeputy Eli Johanssen was not so lucky. He had been warned about Mr. Dahl's undead nature by the paramedics, and came out of his squad car with his pistol drawn. Unfortunately, Carver County sheriff's uniforms are grey, and Jeremiah Hackwell's bound spirit was startled. Believing Deputy Johanssen to be a member of the Confederate Army, Hackwell used his nascent control over the Chanhassen source to shoot a focused beam of thanatic energy at Deputy Johanssen's heart, killing him instantly. \n\n\n\nAt this point, Mr. Dahl fled back into the abandoned laboratory with the Chanhassen source. His decision to hide, rather than to make his way into town in search of medical attention or an authority figure, likely saved many lives. Within two hours, alerted by keywords in local law enforcement radio transmissions, Moblie Task Force Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\") had arrived on the scene, and quickly contained Mr. Dahl and the Chanhassen source. \n\n\n\nAt his request, Mr. Dahl's spirit was banished after a brief interview; his body and the bodies of his friends were deanimated and returned to their families for burial. Standard cover story CO-3, \"Carbon Monoxide Inhalation,\" was disseminated to the press. The EMTs, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Vang, were amnesticized and implanted with false memories of discovering the bodies of the children and the sheriff's deputy in the laboratory basement. The Chanhassen source is classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is contained in a lead-lined containment locker at Storage Site-23.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThere are three primary lessons to be learned from the Chanhassen Catastrophe. \n\n\n\nFirst, that paratechnology must be contained. If the Athanasia Radiology clinic had been located in a paranormal enclave such as Three Portlands, it is likely that the Chanhassen Source would not have been abandoned in the first place; and if it had, anyone who encountered it would have been better equipped to recognize it as a dangerous occult artifact. The spread of paratechnology into unveiled society is dangerous, and preventing that spread is one of the primary purposes of the Foundation; nexuses and freeports are the lesser of two evils.\n\n\n\nSecond, that thaumatology is inherently dangerous. Even operatives of the Global Occult Coalition sometimes fail to sufficiently account for backlash; if the best-trained occultists in the world can be killed by an unmanaged spell, self-trained civilian thaumaturges stand no chance. The Coalition's near-monopoly on thaumatological education probably causes more good than harm, at least for now, but the Foundation, in the interest of public safety and the continuity of humanity, has a duty to contain or eliminate any thaumaturges not affiliated with the GOC. \n\n\n\nAnd finally, that civilian cowardice saves lives. The EMTs immediately left the scene when they realized that Mr. Dahl's condition was anomalous; after the death of Deputy Johanssen, Mr. Dahl himself hid from further human contact. Both these actions prevented deaths, and more could have been prevented if Mr. Dahl and his friends had been too scared to enter the abandoned laboratory in the first place. Foundation social engineering programs since the end of the Cold War have done an admirable job at maintaining high levels of fear and anxiety in the American populace, and consistently prove their worth; if adolescent male bravado can be further tempered, it is estimated that civilian contact with the anomalous could be reduced by up to 15%. A scared populace is a quiet populace.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "ghost", "halloween", "no-dialogue", "prometheus", "tale", "third-law"], "title": "Dig U Better Dead - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dig-u-better-dead", "year": 2026}, "down-the-tracks": {"created_at": "2026-01-01T01:19:00", "creator": "switchitea", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "switchitea", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/switchitea", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-01T01:19:00"}, {"author": "switchitea", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/switchitea", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange.

We share the same thoughts, he and I. We care for the same things. I hunger. I weep. I seek to end this loneliness. I'm Broken. I've always been Broken.//\n\n\n\n//He removes my eyes. I see his lips up close. Smooth skin. Nothing out of place. Flesh is pulled taut over his form. There is a flicker as my sight shifts. He knows better than to show imperfections to his customers. My new eyes would notice. I can see in technicolor. A new world with blues so sharp they cut your bones. I want to be just as unique as everyone else. He turns my new eyes around to look at my face. I can see everything.//\n\n\n\n//Puffy bloated cheeks. Greasy gray hair. Wrinkles where they ought not be. And every line stretches back to forever. A perfect path between yesterday and tomorrow with me providing the through-line. The man squishes my old eyes into jelly while I judge my own face and I grin inside.//\n\n\n\n//The machine assistant grabs the corners of my lips and pulls the cheeks tight. A scalpel comes down, cutting where the lines meet my face. The flesh rips and tears away and I am nothing. Muscle and bone glistening until the duraskin mask comes down. It glows with fairy fire. I want to scream but I cannot find my voice.//\n\n\n\n//There's a gallery here in the operating room. A hundred perfect faces smiling down at the operation of my life. The face burns itself into place where my old one lived. Seals the agony in. But we're only getting started. The wires come down from the ceiling. They plug into my ports. Under my arms. Behind my knees. The wires plug into my mind and I feel the electricity struggle against my thoughts. Chrome and bronze and gears and life come find me in my holes.//\n\n\n\n//I'm dancing now. The wires in my brain are moving me. It is awkward at first. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm too imperfect to have danced before. So the wire plugged into my mind adapts. The experiences download. Now, I'm capable. My limbs move with purpose and grace. And the wires in my bones snake their way into my marrow. They replace the white with silver.//\n\n\n\n//I cry. Small tears come first. Then I cry harder at how they see me. With their unmoved faces and hard eyes. Some of them climb down, spider-like, into the surgical theater. Something terrible is happening. It is happening to me. Lights. Sounds. Beeps. It is not normal. It is not right. They are wired too, I see. The wires follow their movements. No. The wires move them. Just as I am moved.//\n\n\n\n//I'm not supposed to cry. I'm not supposed to feel. I thought they cut that out of me. But still I weep. There's no salt or water in the tear ducts anymore so silver flows down my newly perfect cheeks. It pools on the ground.

It barrels through the uncaring skies with a fervor and a tenor, it's engines blaring at twenty five thousand rotations per minute. Exhaust billows as sixty hundred gallons of jet fuel are churned, burned and discarded inside a ten ton turbine. The chassis screeches and bends against the turbulence, the winds, straining against the unerring forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as eight dozen titanium screws combat the wrath of nature and win.</p>\n<p>It's dark over Denver. The sun set behind the towering mountains hours ago, all that remains is darkness. The Mile High City shines brilliantly against the oppressive shadow, bringing forth a warm vibrant yellow light that breaks out even unto the heavens, stretching through the cabin of the screeching metal plane.</p>\n<p>Gibbs doesn't hate flying. Her colleagues do. Doctor Rune, tall, bespectacled, prim proper and academic, the son of a miner and trapped in those shadows, hates flying. He claims it's because of corporate greed, a hatred in protest of penny-pinching bureaucrats in dusty white offices striking six keystrokes to separate a family into disparate seats lest they pay a tax to remain. That is true, but it is only half the truth. The other half is that when the wheels spin up two hundred fifty kilometers per hour and rubber meets road at unholy speed and the chassis lurches upwards towards the spiraling clouds, Rune feels like he is going to die. Not in a crash, a crash would be a comfort, it implies the presence of an Earth. No, Rune believes he will die of absence, as though there were never an Earth at all.</p>\n<p>Her other colleagues have more measured responses, the tall ones complain about the legroom, everyone else belts their small criticisms, they all eventually agree that flying is a necessary evil, except for Hargroves, she loves it, she loves to fly, she loves to <em>soar</em>.</p>\n<p>But Gibbs, Gibbs is fine with flying.</p>\n<p>And so it is that as she sits in the screeching metal bird in the darkness above Denver between two not-quite-asleep skiers with her shoulders pulled in to avoid an unwanted brush, sipping on a plastic-bottle margarita that's too strong to be refreshing but to weak to be comforting, that she smiles, because she's fine with flying, and she's almost there.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty minutes pass. Twenty more minutes of screaming steel and shaking iron, followed by one hundred thirty nine seconds of bowel tightening impact as the plane lands. The wheels fly from zero to two hundred a fifty kilometers an hour as rubber meets road at unholy speed and twelve decades of engineering roar to life in an instant to bring the lurching eagle to a halt. The ten ton turbines quiet.</p>\n<p>Gibbs gazes out at the runway, which is awash in technicolor, each chromatic path designated to aid pilots in navigating the blanketing dark. She continues to relax even as four hundred fifty persons flutter out to a three foot wide hallway, as twelve hundred hundred pounds of luggage are heaved down from shockingly flimsy cupboards. As twenty three men and women in bright orange vests embark to clean the shitty fabric seats.</p>\n<p>She opens her eyes, sets a determined march, retrieves her backpack, and is the last passenger to leave the plane. She gives a curt nod to the stewardess as she departs the vessel.</p>\n<p>She enters into the beckoning maw of Denver International Airport, its pristine shining metal contrasting harshly with the drab grey of the jetway. She takes rapid steps through bustling halls until she stumbles upon her mark, a payphone. She approaches and produces a beaten quarter from a stained leather wallet. She struggles to press it into the small metal slot, almost dropping it but not, failing to fail. An ageing mechanism within bemoaningly creaks to life as she rapidly enters precisely ten digits onto the syrup-sticky keypad. She realizes with a sigh that there is a IHOP immediately adjacent.

Six strings are wrapped rapidly into these sutures in the flesh of the planet. An unremarkable tent is erected in the surgery. An ever deflating mattress pad is filled over an afternoon and three hundred and twenty two breaths. It is winter in Colorado. There is a chill in the air.</p>\n<p>A bundled of Chevron-sourced plastic-wrapped logs are freed from their entrapment by calloused hands. Kindling is collected from the feast of dying grass. A match is struck three times and tossed in the kindling. A fire roars to life.</p>\n<p>Doctor Hellen Gibbs takes a deep breath of the wintry air, retrieves a pot from the bright red tent and pours two quarter gallons of water within. She hoists it atop the roiling fire and watches with satisfaction as it comes to boil smiling as the steam brushes against her face. She pours half of the pot into dehydrated stir fry and the other into equally thirsting peach crumble. The smells blanket the night, but they do not abate the ever present twinge of cold on her skin and in the air she breaths.</p>\n<p>She produces three pieces of silverware; mounted together through a ring in their hinds; from her jacket pocket. They gleam brilliantly in the moonlight, but they do not gleam so purely nor magically as the rocks. She stares out at the beating black sky; there's almost no light pollution here; as she presses the first bites of steaming hot food into her mouth.</p>\n<p>Truth is, she's never been very interested in the sky. From the time she was a very small girl, she's been interested in the Earth. Space is old, yes, but it is inconceivably old. \"The nebulous age of Eternity\", as one particularly pretentious physics major had monologued at her one day. But the Earth is <em>old</em>, in a way that made sense. In a way that she could chart and catalogue and understand. She does not care of cosmos thirteen billion years old, she is much more partial to the notion of mountains older than bone.</p>\n<p>Garden of the Gods does not share this age. These pillars of sedimentary rock aren't even that much older than homo <em>sapiens</em>. Garden of the Gods is young, is does not, <em>could</em> not posses 9990 phenomenon. She knows this, Eden knows this. Neither of them care. This is her time, he is happy to give it to her. She loves <a href=\"/run-the-river-red-hub\">Site-898</a>, but it's nice to get away on occasion. To be alone, if only for a little while.</p>\n<p>She smiles as the frost brushes against her cheeks. This is her time, she's going to make the most of it.</p>\n\n<p>Worn leather mountain boots tread steadily up an ancient dirt path towards the roaring fire. They are unhurried, but not unafraid. Each step carries a weight with it, a history. They have been on this trail before, they are not happy to return.</p>\n<p>Doctor Rudy Weller marches with determination. His lungs heave in his chest, he's accustomed to the elevation, but not the air. The air here is thin, he can feel it slip through his teeth and chill his gums. It's dry, too, it's not full; there's no depth to it, no texture. It's almost hollow, as absurd of an accusation as that is.</p>\n<p>His laces are tied, though there's only half of them, and half a pair of shoes. A large, metal protrusion demarks the space where a left leg ought to be in a naive anatomy. It's spiked to provide better grip on crags and rocks. A younger, more foolish version of him might have once mourned the 'loss', but the cave-in was thirteen years ago, that's an entire childhood, well, a childhood up to those messy years at least. Now he doesn't get foot cramps, as he often jokes.</p>\n<p>It did hurt, though. <a href=\"/scp-8272\">It hurt like a motherfucker</a>.</p>\n<p>He can still remember that pain, but he does not live in fear of it. He will not allow himself too. And so his steps are steady as he presses up the long, worn road.</p>\n<p>When he at last arrives at the makeshift hearth, eyes weary from many hours on mountain roads, there's already a cup of hot apple cider ready for him. He picks it up gratefully, and consumes it in lavish, starved gulps. It is just a matter of time before his host emerges from her tarp-ish cocoon to greet him, raising a gloved hand and waving with abandon. She wears these gloves even when she is in her sleeping bag. It is cold in Colorado.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Dr. Gibbs.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Rudy, we're fifteen hundred miles away from protocol and the chain of command.

She emerges from her tent, wandering out into the morning air and the layer of dew permeating it. Her eyes take in the nascent Rudy Weller's tent, a compact blue affair smaller even than her own. The sun is just starting to peak over the distant Rockies, casting the Earth in a purple hue. The hairs on her arms prickle with excitement and her heart pulses eight beats per minute faster. It's time for fieldwork.</p>\n<p>The first mile of her journey is exciting. The second, exhilarating. It is seven thirteen ante-meridiem, and already rock climbers sprawl across the many spires of the garden, clambering across them with abandon and rope. Their picks chop deep yet shallow into the rock, slowly and repeatedly scarring the Earth with a thousand cuts. Of course, these cuts are small, and the Earth will forget them, as it always does.</p>\n<p>One of the climbers, an older man, yet still below the halfway mark of his life, who really ought to have something better to do on a Saturday morning, looks down at her, noting her archeological garb. He gives her a salute, knowing she is one of the elite few who appreciates this rock as much as he does. She returns the gesture, though is slightly confused by it.</p>\n<p>What she does not know, and what he does not know, is that this place, this rock, is going to betray them. Tonight will be a blizzard for the ages, the coldest Christmas Eve there ever was and ever would be. He does not know that in six hours, she will be wrapped up in her tent, shuddering against the cold, trying desperately to cling to life and warmth. She does not know that in six hours, he will be lying in the trunk of his Camaro, blasting the heat and burning through the gas. Neither know that in six hours, temperatures will plummet. They will fall to thirty two, and then ten, and then zero, and they will not stop. They will fall through negative fifteen, and negative thirty five, and still they will fall. Tonight, it will be seventy five degrees Fahrenheit below zero.</p>\n\n<p>There is no coal in Garden of the Gods. That's not fully true, a little coal exists, but no large, useful deposits. Certainly none resembling akivite coal. 'Garden of the Gods' is a name, and just a name. But she knew that, or was pretty sure of that long before she ever came here. The investigation was warranted, but it was very much a formality.</p>\n<p>Still, she continues walking. Dust collects on her boots and on her coat. Slightly melted snow joins it. She walks another hour, barely checking her watch, breathing at ease even through the thin air.</p>\n<p>It is then she finds the door.</p>\n<p>It is so almost missable, but she does not miss it. It is a slight demarcation in the sedimentary rock. She approaches with nothing more than mild curiosity, curiosity that is rewarded. It is tall, that's the first thing she notices, very tall, bordering on towering. It is at least twice as tall as her, around three point three meters if she were to guess. It is significantly thinner, however, no wider than a normal door. The rock is worn, as all the rock here is on the rare occasion that it rains in Colorado, but some of the wear is different, special. The grooves are most certainly intentional.</p>\n<p>The grooves are shaped like tendrils of smoke, spanning the length of the door and spiraling as wisps, cut six to eight centimeters deep. A light flicks on in her brain, but it takes her time to pinpoint it. The realization happens all at once and much too fully. The grooves are the exact same shape as the patterns on her arms. And the patterns on Nerys' arms. They are a mark in a tongue never spoken by man, an ancient language of elden things. They convey a universal message: 'HERE BE DRAGONS'.</p>\n<p>The very last thing she notices is the plaque, a metal trunk with a plastic face, engraved with a stylized picture of a bird. The words read:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Carved in 1860 by Prospector Gleann Dennis, an Irish immigrant who set out for Colorado during the Pike's Peak gold rush, Dennis spent some time camping near this area, at the base of the peak. A successful prospector, he would eventually settle down in Manitou Springs. His legacy of mining would continue until his grandson was killed in an <a href=\"/scp-8987\">unrelated mining accident</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>It is unknown why Dennis made this carving, or what the significance of its patterns are, though this remains a topic of debate and discussion among locals.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Hellen Gibbs finishes reading the plaque and spends several minutes staring at the door. She sighs. It's time to head back to camp.</p>\n<p>At least she won't come back empty handed.</p>\n\n<p>The curvature of Rudy Weller's lips instantly betrays his stress. He looks anxiously at Gibbs as she approaches up the hill and paces in circles around the still roaring fire. He can hardly wait to speak as she approaches, but he does. Through great restraint, he allows her the first word.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Hey.</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Hey, how was your walk?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Good.</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Find any traces of 9990?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> What do you think?</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Go with your gut.

Darkness and snow shroud the Earth and her tent as a million million snowflakes are cast from the heavens and crash violently unto the dust. She is cocooned in her sleeping bag, warmed mostly by the proximity of her limbs to each other, constantly radiating heat in a cycle driven by her beating heart. But that beating is slower now.</p>\n<p>The other, former, source of her warmth, indeed of her survival, is the fire. Before he left, she had Rudy offer up some gasoline from his tank. She whipped up a drip feed by taking a frying pan and angling it such that only a couple drops flow out at once. It worked well, the fire was kept full and burning strong and hot even against the rhythmic cold. But something has changed.</p>\n<p>The fire's gone out.</p>\n<p>She doesn't want to believe it, at first. Wants to believe its just the storm taking a turn for the worse, but it isn't. The storm has mostly passed, it's up to zero Fahrenheit. Yet she can feel the blood stilling in her veins.</p>\n<p>She sighs in acknowledgement, before wriggling out of her sleeping bag. She pops on her shoes and ties them in a double knot, then reluctantly crosses the threshold to the cold. The first thing she checks is the fire, it is indeed out. It's not hard to find the culprit, the gasoline froze last night. It's only just beginning to thaw now, and without it the wood was burned through quickly. She shakes her head.</p>\n<p>She could restart the fire, try and go to bed. But then again, it's not <em>that</em> cold out, she'll be fine as long as she can get her blood flowing and stay moving. Plus, this may be her best shot to mess around with the door without anyone around. She smiles, the excitement has her feeling warmer already.</p>\n\n<p>Two miles in the cold is easier said than done. She can feel her heart pumping, her boots pounding relentlessly into the dirt. The human spirit to just keep going and never give up swells within her. She rubs her hands together and hugs herself for warmth. She crushes two hand-warmers in her palms and feels heat inject into her flesh. Yet these factors, all of them, melt away to reveal one singular, absolute truth:</p>\n<p>She is fucking cold.</p>\n<p>At first her thoughts are varied, even scattered. Thinking about the implications of the door, or of an instance, all the way out here. She thinks of tests to conduct, questions to ask. She wonders if the instance is even alive. Then her thoughts, too, converge, and soon she can only think that she is cold.</p>\n<p>She almost misses the door, yet again. This time she does not even succeed in distinguishing it from the rock. She notices only the metal trunk of the bronze plaque, which shines harshly against the snow. She approaches, crossing sixteen meters in forty eight steps.</p>\n<p>Were her faculties in order, she would examine the door. She would look for a handle, or a switch, or any mechanism at all. But her mind, as any mind would be, has been muted by cold. And so she knocks. First with candor, then with an unnecessary desperation. It is not <em>that</em> cold, she is in no danger, though her mind conceals this truth from her as well.</p>\n<p>It is on the third knock that the door opens and her arms burn. She desperately pulls up her sleeves, gazing down at the marks. They do not glow any brighter, but they do burn. Somehow, this brings her no pain. She feels only warmth as she is recognized. Only joy as she is known.</p>\n\n<p>The door slides open with a groan as an ancient mechanism is triggered revealing an interior lined with shining schist giving way to a spiraling series of stairs. She approaches with caution, but finds the endeavor wildly comforting. It is warm inside. Very warm.</p>\n<p>The first steps she takes are slow, cautious, but they quickly increase in vigor as her blood defrost and her scientific curiosity grows. She makes many many steps deep into the Earth, but not too deep, no more than two hundred feet, this place was, after all, still carved by human hands. The steps grow rougher, more uneven as she arrives closer to the bottom. Then end on a small, barren plain, decorated only by a few rocky outcroppings.</p>\n<p>She looks around, disappointed. There is nothing here. And then there is something. And it is an eye. A massive eye, forty six meters in diameter. It is an eye she has scarcely seen before, and always in circumstances much more desperate than this.</p>\n<p>When it speaks to her, it is only through the pact that it gets through at all. But this is an imperfect medium, it is akin to forcing the Mississippi through a diner straw. On the first word alone she can feel her brain go numb and her nose start to bleed. A tempest rages within her mind as the enormity of the dragons thoughts come to rest upon her mind.</p>\n<p>But this isn't her first rodeo. She grits her teeth, steels her mind, and chokes out a greeting.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Nice to meet you.

You must stay for dinner.]</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Dinner with a dragon is much like anything else with a dragon, awe inspiring, mystical, and kind of scary. They speak for a while more first, before eating, the pact struggles to translate, within fifteen minutes she gets a headache, within another fifteen, a nosebleed. This half hour is not entirely unproductive, however. She learns this instance's name is 'Slumbering Shallow, Whisper of Vacant Winds'. And, she'd been able to answer her biggest question:</p>\n<p>How does it survive?</p>\n<p>Typical 8007 instances live in volcanoes, and subsist off of the magma therein. Colorado has only one single active volcano, the Dotsero crater, and it's on the other end of the state. The answer, ultimately, is wind. The instance is covered in holes, she'd initially assumed they were wounds, similar to those found in deceased instances, but there's a doubt there, they are too irregular, too natural. They are, of course, not wounds, they are funnels, catching and intensifying the wind and pushing it towards a series of stone gears within. They churn in unholy gear ratios amplifying the energy until they reach the central chamber of the dragon's chest. Rather than a magmatic heart, there is a turbine. It translates this energy into the heat which keeps the instance alive and hot. While the instance's internals are very different, it's externals are very consistent with other instances. It is, still, a fire breathing dragon.</p>\n<p>Below the turbine, there is a circuit of gears that all run into each other. This serves almost as a battery, allowing the instance to survive even when the wind is not blowing. This is rare, however. The dragon's spines form the garden of the gods and are covered in the funnels. They receive massive amounts of wind, especially on a night like tonight.</p>\n<p>And so the dragon is very warm, and so the same for all her food.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon does not eat food. It is full to bursting with an utter glut of wind.</p>\n<p>This is good, as she does not have much food. Four Chevron-sourced slim-jims, a pack of fifty-eight honey roasted peanuts, and raspberry-honey caffeine gummies made for runners that she underestimates the strength of until she eats three two many and feels her heart accelerate to one hundred and twelve beats per minute.</p>\n<p>The dragon offers to warm up the food for her as excess heat billows from its mouth in the form of steam and smoke. She politely declines as she does not want her food heat to eleven hundred degrees Celsius. And also because the notion of even lukewarm slim-jim makes her sick to her stomach.</p>\n<p>Though, she does accept the entities aid in the beverage department.</p>\n<p>Tea is fine, to her. The rest of the department likes it a lot, some to a sociopathic degree. In the break room, right next to the coffee pot, there's a matching pot of tea, keyed to the 'flavor of the day'. That changes, there's a calendar which specifies it, which Eden controls. Gibbs doesn't know it off of the top of her head. She's never actually bothered to read it. When asked what her favorite flavor of tea is, she's always replied 'Long Island'.</p>\n<p>Her central tension with tea is not the flavor, or lack thereof, but with the process. Waiting several minutes for the water to boil, made all the longer given how weak the power is; the outlets in the break room are fifty volts max; for a end product that is only slightly better than water. She's willing to go through the process for coffee, mostly because she's probably chemically addicted to it, but it's just not worth it for tea.</p>\n<p>This is a complaint that evaporates instantly in the presence of a dragon which can boil water in five sixteenths of a second. And, as a responsible hiker, she does carry both tea and water. Within half a minute there's a complete, steaming cup of peppermint tea.</p>\n<p>Still, she'd prefer it were Long Island.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon does not speak as she eats, it leaves her mind, and the pact, in peace. It is only when she is done and fed and full; relatively at least; that it again imposes its mind.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\">[The gnashing of teeth.

To understand?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\">[YES.]</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Doctor Hellen Gibbs is on a mountain. Her fingers tense in pain as she white knuckles each crag and approaches the three hundred foot summit. She's in no real danger, the dragon is helping her, blowing warm wind on her hands and face so that they do not chill or freeze. Additionally, she is secured by a rope and years of experience. Still, this is a rather extreme physical feat for her, or, well, anybody.</p>\n<p>The first hundred feet are tiring. The second hundred are miserable. The last hundred are herculean. They are altogether easier than her doctoral thesis.</p>\n<p>The winds blow ferociously at her as the forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r combine to push her away from the rock, where the forces of gravity will return her swiftly to the Earth. But she does not fall. And her knuckles strain. And her arms strain.</p>\n<p>The energy given unto her by the slim-jims is quickly expended, followed by lunch and breakfast and six more meals before that. After the first five minutes she is sweating water she never even drank.</p>\n<p>She only ever actually slips once. A patch of ice in a hold that she cannot see when she grasps it. Her palm slips out of it and is scraped up by the sharp rock, her other hand fails to fully compensate and slips out too, and she falls. She clambers desperately for the rope, grasping on with vigor and swinging towards the rock. She kicks her feet towards the wall repeatedly to slow her descent until she can reestablish the hold. She loses at most twenty five feet overall, though her confidence is, slightly, shaken.</p>\n<p>And so it is that she is thoroughly exhausted by the time she reaches the peak.</p>\n<p>She hefts her shaking, freezing form up onto the ridge, her torso splayed across the edge. Every one of her pores dilates in frigidity and her teeth chatter in defiance of the stillness. She is not done.</p>\n<p>Slowly, but certainly, limb by limb, she rights herself, so that her feet balance precariously on the peak. She is truly cold, now. The dragon's air cannot warm her, it does not want to risk blowing her off.</p>\n<p>She gazes up at the wintry moon, it's color is the same as the snow. But then, she's never been one for gazing at the sky.</p>\n<p>She then looks out, over the landscape. Out into the expanse, away from the Rockies. There is low visibility, she cannot see far, likely no farther than twenty miles, but that is not what matters. She understands, now, why Slumbering Shallow came out here. It is breathtaking, it is unlike anywhere she has ever been. It is unique and singular and singularly unique and more than any of these things it is isolated and alone and lonely. If she wanted, as it had suggested, to run away, there would be no finer a place.</p>\n<p>But that is not what she wants. Not at all. What matters about this view, about these twenty miles, is that past the storm, past another twenty miles and another and a hundred and a thousand and a couple hundred more, there is Site-898, and they are staring right back at her, probably through dorky yellow binoculars.</p>\n<p>She smiles, she feels the cold winds brush against her rosy cheeks and chill her frigid skin as she stands three hundred feet above the sallow Earth.</p>\n<p>And for a moment she is on top of the world.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/garden-of-the-gods\">GARDEN OF THE GODS</a>\" by sprawlingstar, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It barrels through the uncaring skies with a fervor and a tenor, it's engines blaring at twenty five thousand rotations per minute. Exhaust billows as sixty hundred gallons of jet fuel are churned, burned and discarded inside a ten ton turbine. The chassis screeches and bends against the turbulence, the winds, straining against the unerring forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as eight dozen titanium screws combat the wrath of nature and win.\n\n\n\nIt's dark over Denver. The sun set behind the towering mountains hours ago, all that remains is darkness. The Mile High City shines brilliantly against the oppressive shadow, bringing forth a warm vibrant yellow light that breaks out even unto the heavens, stretching through the cabin of the screeching metal plane.\n\n\n\nGibbs doesn't hate flying. Her colleagues do. Doctor Rune, tall, bespectacled, prim proper and academic, the son of a miner and trapped in those shadows, hates flying. He claims it's because of corporate greed, a hatred in protest of penny-pinching bureaucrats in dusty white offices striking six keystrokes to separate a family into disparate seats lest they pay a tax to remain. That is true, but it is only half the truth. The other half is that when the wheels spin up two hundred fifty kilometers per hour and rubber meets road at unholy speed and the chassis lurches upwards towards the spiraling clouds, Rune feels like he is going to die. Not in a crash, a crash would be a comfort, it implies the presence of an Earth. No, Rune believes he will die of absence, as though there were never an Earth at all.\n\n\n\nHer other colleagues have more measured responses, the tall ones complain about the legroom, everyone else belts their small criticisms, they all eventually agree that flying is a necessary evil, except for Hargroves, she loves it, she loves to fly, she loves to //soar//.\n\n\n\nBut Gibbs, Gibbs is fine with flying.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is that as she sits in the screeching metal bird in the darkness above Denver between two not-quite-asleep skiers with her shoulders pulled in to avoid an unwanted brush, sipping on a plastic-bottle margarita that's too strong to be refreshing but to weak to be comforting, that she smiles, because she's fine with flying, and she's almost there.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes pass. Twenty more minutes of screaming steel and shaking iron, followed by one hundred thirty nine seconds of bowel tightening impact as the plane lands. The wheels fly from zero to two hundred a fifty kilometers an hour as rubber meets road at unholy speed and twelve decades of engineering roar to life in an instant to bring the lurching eagle to a halt. The ten ton turbines quiet.\n\n\n\nGibbs gazes out at the runway, which is awash in technicolor, each chromatic path designated to aid pilots in navigating the blanketing dark. She continues to relax even as four hundred fifty persons flutter out to a three foot wide hallway, as twelve hundred hundred pounds of luggage are heaved down from shockingly flimsy cupboards. As twenty three men and women in bright orange vests embark to clean the shitty fabric seats.\n\n\n\nShe opens her eyes, sets a determined march, retrieves her backpack, and is the last passenger to leave the plane. She gives a curt nod to the stewardess as she departs the vessel.\n\n\n\nShe enters into the beckoning maw of Denver International Airport, its pristine shining metal contrasting harshly with the drab grey of the jetway. She takes rapid steps through bustling halls until she stumbles upon her mark, a payphone. She approaches and produces a beaten quarter from a stained leather wallet. She struggles to press it into the small metal slot, almost dropping it but not, failing to fail. An ageing mechanism within bemoaningly creaks to life as she rapidly enters precisely ten digits onto the syrup-sticky keypad. She realizes with a sigh that there is a IHOP immediately adjacent. She wipes three sticky fingers on her jeans as the telephonic machinery roars, whimperingly, to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**JULIAN EDEN:** Ahoy?\n\n\n\n**HELLEN GIBBS:** Hey Jules, it's me.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Hellen!

So, how is Colorado?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Inconclusive, I haven't left the airport yet.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Are you sure this is how you want to spend your winter break? If you come back right now you could still catch Rune's Christmas party.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** It's fine. I've got a beautiful campsite in mind. I'd rather spend that night under the stars anyway.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Do you really think you'll find any traces of 9990 in Garden of the Gods? Those rocks are young, only date back to the Pleistocene.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** It's called Garden of the //Gods//, Julian, that screams 9990. Regardless, maybe there is nothing there, so what? I still get a restful break.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Fair enough. Keep me posted.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Will do.

Six strings are wrapped rapidly into these sutures in the flesh of the planet. An unremarkable tent is erected in the surgery. An ever deflating mattress pad is filled over an afternoon and three hundred and twenty two breaths. It is winter in Colorado. There is a chill in the air.\n\n\n\nA bundled of Chevron-sourced plastic-wrapped logs are freed from their entrapment by calloused hands. Kindling is collected from the feast of dying grass. A match is struck three times and tossed in the kindling. A fire roars to life.\n\n\n\nDoctor Hellen Gibbs takes a deep breath of the wintry air, retrieves a pot from the bright red tent and pours two quarter gallons of water within. She hoists it atop the roiling fire and watches with satisfaction as it comes to boil smiling as the steam brushes against her face. She pours half of the pot into dehydrated stir fry and the other into equally thirsting peach crumble. The smells blanket the night, but they do not abate the ever present twinge of cold on her skin and in the air she breaths.\n\n\n\nShe produces three pieces of silverware; mounted together through a ring in their hinds; from her jacket pocket. They gleam brilliantly in the moonlight, but they do not gleam so purely nor magically as the rocks. She stares out at the beating black sky; there's almost no light pollution here; as she presses the first bites of steaming hot food into her mouth.\n\n\n\nTruth is, she's never been very interested in the sky. From the time she was a very small girl, she's been interested in the Earth. Space is old, yes, but it is inconceivably old. \"The nebulous age of Eternity\", as one particularly pretentious physics major had monologued at her one day. But the Earth is //old//, in a way that made sense. In a way that she could chart and catalogue and understand. She does not care of cosmos thirteen billion years old, she is much more partial to the notion of mountains older than bone.\n\n\n\nGarden of the Gods does not share this age. These pillars of sedimentary rock aren't even that much older than homo //sapiens//. Garden of the Gods is young, is does not, //could// not posses 9990 phenomenon. She knows this, Eden knows this. Neither of them care. This is her time, he is happy to give it to her. She loves [[[Run the River Red Hub|Site-898]]], but it's nice to get away on occasion. To be alone, if only for a little while.\n\n\n\nShe smiles as the frost brushes against her cheeks. This is her time, she's going to make the most of it.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWorn leather mountain boots tread steadily up an ancient dirt path towards the roaring fire. They are unhurried, but not unafraid. Each step carries a weight with it, a history. They have been on this trail before, they are not happy to return.\n\n\n\nDoctor Rudy Weller marches with determination. His lungs heave in his chest, he's accustomed to the elevation, but not the air. The air here is thin, he can feel it slip through his teeth and chill his gums. It's dry, too, it's not full; there's no depth to it, no texture. It's almost hollow, as absurd of an accusation as that is.\n\n\n\nHis laces are tied, though there's only half of them, and half a pair of shoes. A large, metal protrusion demarks the space where a left leg ought to be in a naive anatomy. It's spiked to provide better grip on crags and rocks. A younger, more foolish version of him might have once mourned the 'loss', but the cave-in was thirteen years ago, that's an entire childhood, well, a childhood up to those messy years at least. Now he doesn't get foot cramps, as he often jokes.\n\n\n\nIt did hurt, though. [[[SCP-8272|It hurt like a motherfucker]]].\n\n\n\nHe can still remember that pain, but he does not live in fear of it. He will not allow himself too. And so his steps are steady as he presses up the long, worn road.\n\n\n\nWhen he at last arrives at the makeshift hearth, eyes weary from many hours on mountain roads, there's already a cup of hot apple cider ready for him. He picks it up gratefully, and consumes it in lavish, starved gulps. It is just a matter of time before his host emerges from her tarp-ish cocoon to greet him, raising a gloved hand and waving with abandon. She wears these gloves even when she is in her sleeping bag. It is cold in Colorado.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**WELLER:** Dr. Gibbs.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Rudy, we're fifteen hundred miles away from protocol and the chain of command.

I asked if you wanted to come.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Was I suppose to say no?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** What's your problem with this place, anyway?\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** No problem. Just... it lacks gravitas.

She emerges from her tent, wandering out into the morning air and the layer of dew permeating it. Her eyes take in the nascent Rudy Weller's tent, a compact blue affair smaller even than her own. The sun is just starting to peak over the distant Rockies, casting the Earth in a purple hue. The hairs on her arms prickle with excitement and her heart pulses eight beats per minute faster. It's time for fieldwork.\n\n\n\nThe first mile of her journey is exciting. The second, exhilarating. It is seven thirteen ante-meridiem, and already rock climbers sprawl across the many spires of the garden, clambering across them with abandon and rope. Their picks chop deep yet shallow into the rock, slowly and repeatedly scarring the Earth with a thousand cuts. Of course, these cuts are small, and the Earth will forget them, as it always does.\n\n\n\nOne of the climbers, an older man, yet still below the halfway mark of his life, who really ought to have something better to do on a Saturday morning, looks down at her, noting her archeological garb. He gives her a salute, knowing she is one of the elite few who appreciates this rock as much as he does. She returns the gesture, though is slightly confused by it.\n\n\n\nWhat she does not know, and what he does not know, is that this place, this rock, is going to betray them. Tonight will be a blizzard for the ages, the coldest Christmas Eve there ever was and ever would be. He does not know that in six hours, she will be wrapped up in her tent, shuddering against the cold, trying desperately to cling to life and warmth. She does not know that in six hours, he will be lying in the trunk of his Camaro, blasting the heat and burning through the gas. Neither know that in six hours, temperatures will plummet. They will fall to thirty two, and then ten, and then zero, and they will not stop. They will fall through negative fifteen, and negative thirty five, and still they will fall. Tonight, it will be seventy five degrees Fahrenheit below zero.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThere is no coal in Garden of the Gods. That's not fully true, a little coal exists, but no large, useful deposits. Certainly none resembling akivite coal. 'Garden of the Gods' is a name, and just a name. But she knew that, or was pretty sure of that long before she ever came here. The investigation was warranted, but it was very much a formality.\n\n\n\nStill, she continues walking. Dust collects on her boots and on her coat. Slightly melted snow joins it. She walks another hour, barely checking her watch, breathing at ease even through the thin air.\n\n\n\nIt is then she finds the door.\n\n\n\nIt is so almost missable, but she does not miss it. It is a slight demarcation in the sedimentary rock. She approaches with nothing more than mild curiosity, curiosity that is rewarded. It is tall, that's the first thing she notices, very tall, bordering on towering. It is at least twice as tall as her, around three point three meters if she were to guess. It is significantly thinner, however, no wider than a normal door. The rock is worn, as all the rock here is on the rare occasion that it rains in Colorado, but some of the wear is different, special. The grooves are most certainly intentional.\n\n\n\nThe grooves are shaped like tendrils of smoke, spanning the length of the door and spiraling as wisps, cut six to eight centimeters deep. A light flicks on in her brain, but it takes her time to pinpoint it. The realization happens all at once and much too fully. The grooves are the exact same shape as the patterns on her arms. And the patterns on Nerys' arms. They are a mark in a tongue never spoken by man, an ancient language of elden things. They convey a universal message: 'HERE BE DRAGONS'.\n\n\n\nThe very last thing she notices is the plaque, a metal trunk with a plastic face, engraved with a stylized picture of a bird. The words read:\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n//Carved in 1860 by Prospector Gleann Dennis, an Irish immigrant who set out for Colorado during the Pike's Peak gold rush, Dennis spent some time camping near this area, at the base of the peak. A successful prospector, he would eventually settle down in Manitou Springs. His legacy of mining would continue until his grandson was killed in an [[[SCP-8987|unrelated mining accident]]].//\n\n\n\n//It is unknown why Dennis made this carving, or what the significance of its patterns are, though this remains a topic of debate and discussion among locals.//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nHellen Gibbs finishes reading the plaque and spends several minutes staring at the door. She sighs. It's time to head back to camp.\n\n\n\nAt least she won't come back empty handed.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe curvature of Rudy Weller's lips instantly betrays his stress. He looks anxiously at Gibbs as she approaches up the hill and paces in circles around the still roaring fire. He can hardly wait to speak as she approaches, but he does. Through great restraint, he allows her the first word. \n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** Hey.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Hey, how was your walk?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Good.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Find any traces of 9990?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** What do you think?\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** No.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Go with your gut.

Darkness and snow shroud the Earth and her tent as a million million snowflakes are cast from the heavens and crash violently unto the dust. She is cocooned in her sleeping bag, warmed mostly by the proximity of her limbs to each other, constantly radiating heat in a cycle driven by her beating heart. But that beating is slower now.\n\n\n\nThe other, former, source of her warmth, indeed of her survival, is the fire. Before he left, she had Rudy offer up some gasoline from his tank. She whipped up a drip feed by taking a frying pan and angling it such that only a couple drops flow out at once. It worked well, the fire was kept full and burning strong and hot even against the rhythmic cold. But something has changed.\n\n\n\nThe fire's gone out.\n\n\n\nShe doesn't want to believe it, at first. Wants to believe its just the storm taking a turn for the worse, but it isn't. The storm has mostly passed, it's up to zero Fahrenheit. Yet she can feel the blood stilling in her veins.\n\n\n\nShe sighs in acknowledgement, before wriggling out of her sleeping bag. She pops on her shoes and ties them in a double knot, then reluctantly crosses the threshold to the cold. The first thing she checks is the fire, it is indeed out. It's not hard to find the culprit, the gasoline froze last night. It's only just beginning to thaw now, and without it the wood was burned through quickly. She shakes her head.\n\n\n\nShe could restart the fire, try and go to bed. But then again, it's not //that// cold out, she'll be fine as long as she can get her blood flowing and stay moving. Plus, this may be her best shot to mess around with the door without anyone around. She smiles, the excitement has her feeling warmer already.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nTwo miles in the cold is easier said than done. She can feel her heart pumping, her boots pounding relentlessly into the dirt. The human spirit to just keep going and never give up swells within her. She rubs her hands together and hugs herself for warmth. She crushes two hand-warmers in her palms and feels heat inject into her flesh. Yet these factors, all of them, melt away to reveal one singular, absolute truth:\n\n\n\nShe is fucking cold.\n\n\n\nAt first her thoughts are varied, even scattered. Thinking about the implications of the door, or of an instance, all the way out here. She thinks of tests to conduct, questions to ask. She wonders if the instance is even alive. Then her thoughts, too, converge, and soon she can only think that she is cold.\n\n\n\nShe almost misses the door, yet again. This time she does not even succeed in distinguishing it from the rock. She notices only the metal trunk of the bronze plaque, which shines harshly against the snow. She approaches, crossing sixteen meters in forty eight steps.\n\n\n\nWere her faculties in order, she would examine the door. She would look for a handle, or a switch, or any mechanism at all. But her mind, as any mind would be, has been muted by cold. And so she knocks. First with candor, then with an unnecessary desperation. It is not //that// cold, she is in no danger, though her mind conceals this truth from her as well.\n\n\n\nIt is on the third knock that the door opens and her arms burn. She desperately pulls up her sleeves, gazing down at the marks. They do not glow any brighter, but they do burn. Somehow, this brings her no pain. She feels only warmth as she is recognized. Only joy as she is known.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe door slides open with a groan as an ancient mechanism is triggered revealing an interior lined with shining schist giving way to a spiraling series of stairs. She approaches with caution, but finds the endeavor wildly comforting. It is warm inside. Very warm.\n\n\n\nThe first steps she takes are slow, cautious, but they quickly increase in vigor as her blood defrost and her scientific curiosity grows. She makes many many steps deep into the Earth, but not too deep, no more than two hundred feet, this place was, after all, still carved by human hands. The steps grow rougher, more uneven as she arrives closer to the bottom. Then end on a small, barren plain, decorated only by a few rocky outcroppings.\n\n\n\nShe looks around, disappointed. There is nothing here. And then there is something. And it is an eye. A massive eye, forty six meters in diameter. It is an eye she has scarcely seen before, and always in circumstances much more desperate than this.\n\n\n\nWhen it speaks to her, it is only through the pact that it gets through at all. But this is an imperfect medium, it is akin to forcing the Mississippi through a diner straw. On the first word alone she can feel her brain go numb and her nose start to bleed. A tempest rages within her mind as the enormity of the dragons thoughts come to rest upon her mind.\n\n\n\nBut this isn't her first rodeo. She grits her teeth, steels her mind, and chokes out a greeting.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** Nice to meet you.

You must stay for dinner.] [[/span]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nDinner with a dragon is much like anything else with a dragon, awe inspiring, mystical, and kind of scary. They speak for a while more first, before eating, the pact struggles to translate, within fifteen minutes she gets a headache, within another fifteen, a nosebleed. This half hour is not entirely unproductive, however. She learns this instance's name is 'Slumbering Shallow, Whisper of Vacant Winds'. And, she'd been able to answer her biggest question:\n\n\n\nHow does it survive?\n\n\n\nTypical 8007 instances live in volcanoes, and subsist off of the magma therein. Colorado has only one single active volcano, the Dotsero crater, and it's on the other end of the state. The answer, ultimately, is wind. The instance is covered in holes, she'd initially assumed they were wounds, similar to those found in deceased instances, but there's a doubt there, they are too irregular, too natural. They are, of course, not wounds, they are funnels, catching and intensifying the wind and pushing it towards a series of stone gears within. They churn in unholy gear ratios amplifying the energy until they reach the central chamber of the dragon's chest. Rather than a magmatic heart, there is a turbine. It translates this energy into the heat which keeps the instance alive and hot. While the instance's internals are very different, it's externals are very consistent with other instances. It is, still, a fire breathing dragon.\n\n\n\nBelow the turbine, there is a circuit of gears that all run into each other. This serves almost as a battery, allowing the instance to survive even when the wind is not blowing. This is rare, however. The dragon's spines form the garden of the gods and are covered in the funnels. They receive massive amounts of wind, especially on a night like tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd so the dragon is very warm, and so the same for all her food.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe dragon does not eat food. It is full to bursting with an utter glut of wind.\n\n\n\nThis is good, as she does not have much food. Four Chevron-sourced slim-jims, a pack of fifty-eight honey roasted peanuts, and raspberry-honey caffeine gummies made for runners that she underestimates the strength of until she eats three two many and feels her heart accelerate to one hundred and twelve beats per minute.\n\n\n\nThe dragon offers to warm up the food for her as excess heat billows from its mouth in the form of steam and smoke. She politely declines as she does not want her food heat to eleven hundred degrees Celsius. And also because the notion of even lukewarm slim-jim makes her sick to her stomach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThough, she does accept the entities aid in the beverage department.\n\n\n\nTea is fine, to her. The rest of the department likes it a lot, some to a sociopathic degree. In the break room, right next to the coffee pot, there's a matching pot of tea, keyed to the 'flavor of the day'. That changes, there's a calendar which specifies it, which Eden controls. Gibbs doesn't know it off of the top of her head. She's never actually bothered to read it. When asked what her favorite flavor of tea is, she's always replied 'Long Island'.\n\n\n\nHer central tension with tea is not the flavor, or lack thereof, but with the process. Waiting several minutes for the water to boil, made all the longer given how weak the power is; the outlets in the break room are fifty volts max; for a end product that is only slightly better than water. She's willing to go through the process for coffee, mostly because she's probably chemically addicted to it, but it's just not worth it for tea.\n\n\n\nThis is a complaint that evaporates instantly in the presence of a dragon which can boil water in five sixteenths of a second. And, as a responsible hiker, she does carry both tea and water. Within half a minute there's a complete, steaming cup of peppermint tea.\n\n\n\nStill, she'd prefer it were Long Island.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe dragon does not speak as she eats, it leaves her mind, and the pact, in peace. It is only when she is done and fed and full; relatively at least; that it again imposes its mind.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\"]] [The gnashing of teeth.

The pact burns her body with agony as her mind flares and bends under the pressure. Her heart beats at one hundred forty six beats per minute for eighteen seconds before the agony subsides. But the message is clear. The instance altered its body by force; possibly magic, possibly natural; at no small cost and not without one.\n\n\n\nOf course, this only serves to create more questions in her querying heart and burning arms.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** But why?

Her fingers tense in pain as she white knuckles each crag and approaches the three hundred foot summit. She's in no real danger, the dragon is helping her, blowing warm wind on her hands and face so that they do not chill or freeze. Additionally, she is secured by a rope and years of experience. Still, this is a rather extreme physical feat for her, or, well, anybody.\n\n\n\nThe first hundred feet are tiring. The second hundred are miserable. The last hundred are herculean. They are altogether easier than her doctoral thesis.\n\n\n\nThe winds blow ferociously at her as the forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r combine to push her away from the rock, where the forces of gravity will return her swiftly to the Earth. But she does not fall. And her knuckles strain. And her arms strain.\n\n\n\nThe energy given unto her by the slim-jims is quickly expended, followed by lunch and breakfast and six more meals before that. After the first five minutes she is sweating water she never even drank.\n\n\n\nShe only ever actually slips once. A patch of ice in a hold that she cannot see when she grasps it. Her palm slips out of it and is scraped up by the sharp rock, her other hand fails to fully compensate and slips out too, and she falls. She clambers desperately for the rope, grasping on with vigor and swinging towards the rock. She kicks her feet towards the wall repeatedly to slow her descent until she can reestablish the hold. She loses at most twenty five feet overall, though her confidence is, slightly, shaken.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is that she is thoroughly exhausted by the time she reaches the peak.\n\n\n\nShe hefts her shaking, freezing form up onto the ridge, her torso splayed across the edge. Every one of her pores dilates in frigidity and her teeth chatter in defiance of the stillness. She is not done.\n\n\n\nSlowly, but certainly, limb by limb, she rights herself, so that her feet balance precariously on the peak. She is truly cold, now. The dragon's air cannot warm her, it does not want to risk blowing her off.\n\n\n\nShe gazes up at the wintry moon, it's color is the same as the snow. But then, she's never been one for gazing at the sky.\n\n\n\nShe then looks out, over the landscape. Out into the expanse, away from the Rockies. There is low visibility, she cannot see far, likely no farther than twenty miles, but that is not what matters. She understands, now, why Slumbering Shallow came out here. It is breathtaking, it is unlike anywhere she has ever been. It is unique and singular and singularly unique and more than any of these things it is isolated and alone and lonely. If she wanted, as it had suggested, to run away, there would be no finer a place.\n\n\n\nBut that is not what she wants. Not at all. What matters about this view, about these twenty miles, is that past the storm, past another twenty miles and another and a hundred and a thousand and a couple hundred more, there is Site-898, and they are staring right back at her, probably through dorky yellow binoculars.\n\n\n\nShe smiles, she feels the cold winds brush against her rosy cheeks and chill her frigid skin as she stands three hundred feet above the sallow Earth.\n\n\n\nAnd for a moment she is on top of the world.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** crags.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/crags.html\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** peaks.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/peaks.html\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** divider.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user sprawlingstar]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** SCP Wiki\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** header-bg.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Dicklyon\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_of_the_Gods_central_gardens_from_the_north.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** planyourtrip.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Daniel Schwen\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_of_the_Gods_Sunset.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** supportconservation.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_135.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** witnessrestoration.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_175.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** spotthedifference.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_026.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** foreverfree.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2024-10-08_Garden_of_the_Gods_Sunrise_-_034.jpg\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-6448", "classification-committee-memo", "scp-8007", "scp-9990", "run-the-river-red-hub", "scp-8272", "scp-8987", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["adventure", "art-exchange", "from-120s-archives", "heartwarming", "mystery", "tale"], "title": "GARDEN OF THE GODS - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/garden-of-the-gods", "year": 2026}, "girlraisingproject": {"created_at": "2026-01-02T01:16:00", "creator": "whenwerewe", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:16:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"goat.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:19:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:19:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"light.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:20:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"woods.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:20:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"ruin.webp\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:21:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:23:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:24:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:27:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Added tags: black-comedy, body-horror, fantasy, tale.

I held the whole world away from her with my hands and my ribs and my skull. Three spears were thrust into my back, and a fourth into the neck had killed me.</p>\n<p>While I was dead, the fifth had taken her, too.</p>\n<p>As I blearily cracked open my eyes, already stiffening with rigor mortis, she trembled beside me. Her last breath was drowned out by bickering.</p>\n<p>Behind, the men who had killed us argued loudly in a foreign tongue about what to do next. The tallest of them, disfigured by a twisted arm and muscles like an ox, gestured violently towards the hills we\u2019d descended from. Perhaps some of my band had escaped. It was bitter comfort to me now.</p>\n<p>I rose slowly to my feet. I held her by the wrist as I had so many times before, and she fell limply by the arm beside me. She was too light.</p>\n<p>What? Oh. I\u2019ve never had one of you try to <em>comfort</em> me before. That was a long time ago, anyway.</p>\n<p>The mud-brick village we had tried to raid was not yet called Uruk, and the men were not yet the Sumerians. Even the pale and weedy grass they gnawed at was not yet really wheat. They were a stunted lot, and might have been pitiable if they hadn\u2019t taken my daughter.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t look at me like that. We were starving. They had been pushing us out of the plains and into the high valleys all my life.</p>\n<p>Not that any of this matters. I\u2019m beyond trying to claw at the <em>moral high ground</em>.</p>\n<p>My fellows were scattered around me, dead to the last. We didn\u2019t know how to fight their numbers, their corded slings and taut bows, their weapons of strange and shining stone. They\u2019d died so easily.</p>\n<p>So I woke them up.</p>\n<p>One by one the dead rose. Seized joints cracked with unexpected flexion, tendon and sinew hesitantly peeled apart. Their blood pooled thickly at their feet.</p>\n<p>The men turned around to look at me, and them. Their faces were portraits of dread. When I have trouble sleeping I think of them and drift off. Then \u2014 there was all the tedious struggle, and all the tedious begging. But I had them in the end. One made it two hours down the packed dirt path that was not yet the world\u2019s first road, throwing his brothers behind him, in cowardice or appeasement.</p>\n<p>And there was my daughter. I carried her all the way. She was slight, and stiff, and as the sun set she began to cool until by touch I could not distinguish her from the earth in which I lay her.</p>\n<p>There is nothing pretty about the dead, no matter what the fanatics say. They\u2019ll rant at you as long as you care to listen, about beauty, certainty, symmetry. They\u2019re just insane; anyone who would do this is, really. I was ready to leave the meat of my daughter in the earth. But just before I did, something rose out of her, that was not breath, and clung to me. I thought I might as well keep it around. At the time I didn\u2019t let myself think something so stupid, but it would be nice to have her back.</p>\n<p>Yes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, obviously. It\u2019s always nice to have perceptive material. But try not to yell too much, it strains the diaphragm; you\u2019ll want that nice and fresh for later.</p>\n<p>I had lost other children, of course. You think of it as the ultimate tragedy. None of you can guess how lucky you are. Even just three centuries ago\u2026 it was something mothers expected. Which is not to say that it was ever easy. I would have called all of them back to life, if I could. But only her soul remained to me, and I am less sentimental about these things than most.</p>\n<p>Mhm. Still sentimental enough to cut you up.</p>\n<p>Oh? Well, this is the last time you\u2019ll be able to speak for a while, so I might as well.</p>\n<p>Once, when I was the same age my daughter was when she died, I ran into a leprous hundred-headed snake. Not that any of us knew what leprosy was in those days. But its skin was peeling and ulcerating; great blisters and cancers riddled every inch of exposed muscle; its eyes were spasming as it begged me for a drop of blood.</p>\n<p>And because I was young and stupid, I cut open my palm with a flint and let it drink, and it skittered off, begging me not to speak of its appearance to anyone. When three days later I ran into two beautiful men, fire-skinned and stinking of what I now realise must have been incense, I told them everything they asked me. They laughed in a voice like cracking ice and promised me their Queen\u2019s blessing.</p>\n<p>That probably had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>It now occurs to me they were definitely Mab\u2019s. I think I took a side in their civil war by doing that. I had a lot of headaches over the topic, later.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that\u2019s where it began. Now, nod if you\u2019d rather be blind for this next bit.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"goat.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/goat.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>We have both been reshaped by men. This sweet little thing is nothing like the huge beasts I knew in my youth. It became domestic; I went the other way. My dead razed village and town for generations, made me the enemy of all the settled peoples. But I returned to the ruins to find five more sprouting. I simply could not keep up. So when they offered me copper and iron, which I barely understood, I accepted. When they showed me the strange shapes they\u2019d carved into their clay, I learned. And I found that I had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ereshkigal\">new name</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>There. That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?</p>\n<p>Just a little joke! I don\u2019t get to talk to a lot of people. If you try to be funny near a Karcist they look at you like you\u2019re an alien.</p>\n<p>Really, though, you\u2019ll be fine. The vertebra fused back into place; you\u2019re practically good as new.</p>\n<p>Look, just don\u2019t pay attention to the lathe. No, no, if you keep panicking yourself like that I\u2019ll have to paralyse you again. Just think about something else. This really shouldn\u2019t be hurting that much.</p>\n<p>Do you want to hear more about me?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll take that as a yes.</p>\n<p>It was during the Hussite Wars\u2014</p>\n<p>Stop looking confused, they weren\u2019t occult. You people just don\u2019t know anything about your ancestors these days. I\u2019d be angry if I hadn\u2019t known how worthless they were personally. This was around the fourteen-hundreds. Is that good enough for you?</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t wail or I\u2019ll block your trachea. Thank you.</p>\n<p>Now, as I was saying, I was searching for a fleshsmith. This is skipping millennia of my life, but they weren\u2019t very <em>dense</em> millennia. Fill in about six hours of me narrating executions of uncouth men on the road, if you want. I had come to Esterberg, the hidden city. In those days there were far less humans, and many more faeries, and those odd ape-things. It stank like dead fish and liceridden fur. The city, like all cities in those days, was an open sore in the world. But it was the only place I could find someone who could stitch my daughter\u2019s soul back into a body.</p>\n<p>Yes, despite ten thousand years of wandering, I did not exactly have my finger on the pulse of the occult world (what a hilarious expression!). I had brushed up against the edges of Fae activity \u2014 and immediately fled \u2014 and I had run into fleshcarves and cogkindred on the road or in the hovels the peasants gave me in return for their lives. But I was only vaguely aware of, for example, the existence of the Daevites.</p>\n<p>It does not help that I did not hold, and indeed still do not hold, with cities. I can tolerate a thousand people living together, but once you start to lose count that\u2019s a bad sign.</p>\n<p>Sorry, this is besides the point. The tendonwork is distracting me. There, you should be able to speak again. Now, where was I?</p>\n<p>I had found after endless searching a suitable fleshcrafter, brought him my daughter\u2019s soul and a spare girl-child, and after deploying enough threats I was sure he wouldn\u2019t simply dispose of her errant spirit I set out into the city.</p>\n<p>I wanted to see if I could find some useful contacts, perhaps some tips on the location of other nexuses. To my later dismay, it turned out the city was quite firmly antiroyalist territory. And you know how Fae get; they just have this way about them. They learn things they have no right knowing.</p>\n<p>So I walked into the square with my retinue\u2014</p>\n<p>I kept about two dozen of the dead with me at all times. Had them in low-brimmed hats, big cloaks, stuffed them with herbs and so on. Mostly I got away with claiming to be a wandering priestess, though it didn\u2019t work in Esterberg, of course.</p>\n<p>In the square there was an eyeless beggar. And by eyeless I mean great divots had been sunk all over his bared skin, so you could see the half a hundred weeping sockets that must have once seen unimaginable sights. When I walked past him, he pointed straight at me. Every single face in the square turned to stare right at me within three seconds.</p>\n<p>Now, you understand, I was in what is today Poland. I had been born near Iraq. I was <em>used</em> to standing out. It wasn\u2019t anything like today, obviously, but I got little stares, kids either knew I was the funniest thing around or squealed when they saw me, you get the idea. They thought I was a Turk, which got a laugh the first time they said it to my face.</p>\n<p>What it felt like when that entire square, probably five thousand people, turned to bore into my head? I cannot describe it. I barely heard what the beggar said next. Something about crimes revealed and reconciled, a trial before the House of the Inventor, pardon-by-years. I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the words while everyone looked at me. Blank and confident, like men who hold shining stars in their hands, and know that not only can you not save yourself, you cannot save <em>anyone</em>.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I admit it, I panicked. I ordered my dead to lash out and fled in the terror. Anyone who died I raised too, to buy me my hour. It turns out that for all their staring most of the people in the square were basically civilians. And two dozen doesn\u2019t sound like many, but if they don\u2019t die when you kill them they can do a lot. So today I think they have a little plaque where the beggar used to sit, for the thanatotic riot of 1433. Killed about eight hundred, supposedly.</p>\n<p>While the citizens ran about like headless chickens I collected my project and dispatched the uncooperative Karcist with my favourite trick.</p>\n<p>That was the fifty-seventh time I died.</p>\n<p>I fled the city with her in my arms, all my dead lost to its militia, the happiest I\u2019d been in centuries. To call back a soul, well-formed, from <em>millenia</em> of sleep? Every two-bit reanimator called it impossible.</p>\n<p>Oh, come on, you know me better than that. I wouldn\u2019t do this to you for <em>fun</em>; I\u2019m not such a sadist I\u2019d risk the Coalition\u2019s wrath. Obviously something didn\u2019t work out.</p>\n<p>My daughter woke up. Her flesh was as cold as mine, but that was no burden. She would never be hungry again, and if she ever left me I knew I could bring her back. I would try to teach her, somehow, and let her do the same to me. We would pass through the ages of man together. That was the first time I really thought about my power, in detail.</p>\n<p>Yes, try and pull what remains of your face into a smirk, very classy. I was raised when the cutting edge of technology was <em>writing</em>. It took me fully three thousand years to realise the priests of Ashur and Marduk could not literally talk to the gods. I had to essentially invent the entire notion of necromancy from scratch.</p>\n<p>Well, thank you! But of course I don\u2019t seem that old. If I did, I would have gone insane a very long time ago. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to see a warhorse, an automobile, a spacecraft?</p>\n<p>Wait, wait, sorry. I\u2019m letting you rile me up. Back to the story.</p>\n<p>My daughter was the child I\u2019d loved, in every detail. Exactly every detail. She did not gain new traits, or lose old ones. It was as if her soul was frozen in amber. Something about the way it connected to her newly-conquered flesh was defective. She could puppeteer the body, but the body could not embed memories in her being. So she remembered only the last month, at best. She is an eternal youth, and can never grow.</p>\n<p>For a while, I thought her perfect as she was. Though I had not known it, this had been what I was missing all those empty years. The two of us lived out the Thirty Years\u2019 War in an obscure hut, mother and child (much later did we learn this was also the <em>Fifth</em> Occult War). I taught her a hundred times, to weave, to write, to feel safe. She did not feel an empty belly even once, and occasionally I entertained her by dismembering lost <em>landsknechte</em>.</p>\n<p>But I couldn\u2019t stay satisfied forever. Every mother wants to see her daughter grow into herself. She should have been my equal, and risen a queen of the dead alongside me. We would resurrect each other cyclically, until the last city fell.</p>\n<p>You people never fail to irritate me. No, don\u2019t flinch, just \u2014 if you want to ask something, <em>ask it</em>! What\u2019s the point of this ridiculous \u201cMay I ask\u201d nonsense? It\u2019s not as if tiptoeing around will make me any more merciful.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>You want to know <em>that</em>, do you. Why do I tell these stories in such varying tones. Why am I so cavalier about everything except my daughter. How insightful.</p>\n<p>You know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being totally <em>sincere</em> in your questioning. I think you\u2019re trying to make some sort of <em>point</em>. Perhaps to imply a false and saccharine equivalence between her and <em>other</em> people.</p>\n<p>So let me answer your question with a question of my own: what do you think happens if you supercharge a person\u2019s amygdala for five minutes? Do they just have a heart attack? Let\u2019s find out, shall we?</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"woods.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/woods.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>I have had no small number of encounters with <span style=\"color:green\">the abode of quiet</span>.

It might also scramble your internal body-model, though. It\u2019ll give you, what\u2019s the word? Dysphoria? A shot of that, real concentrated, but over quick.</p>\n<p>That expression there is\u2026 Let me tell you another story. This one might even give you context on what\u2019s happening to you. Concentrate on the words, please.</p>\n<p>So I was in Chernobyl\u2014</p>\n<p>Oh, alright, fine. I\u2019d spent the past three hundred years looking for someone who knew how to help my daughter\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p>Well, I say that, but it\u2019s not strictly true. I spent fifty years searching, and then I realised I\u2019d have to do it myself. I learnt at the feet of the great soul-sages; I did favours for children of the Scarlet Fool; I even managed to win a lesson off one of the Wild Hunt on a bet. I began to put together something like a <em>theory</em> of necromancy. I was inspired by what was in the air in those days. All those philosophers, those men of science! There was something romantic about the idea the world could be understood.</p>\n<p>I knew firsthand it was false, of course.</p>\n<p>So I set out on a course of experimentation. That\u2019s when I began collecting material in earnest, and yes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here, you poor thing.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I said, I was in Chernobyl. After the Russians cursed the land, they evacuated the whole town. The margins of error for that kind of thing are large enough to lose a lot of people. Ripe pickings for little old me.</p>\n<p>What do you mean \u201ctalk like that\u201d? I talk like <em>myself</em>. If I wasn\u2019t able to change with the times I would have lost my mind a long time ago. Even last century, there was barely such a thing as a Foundation, and now they\u2019ve fallen apart. If I adapted any slower the pace of events would overtake me, you understand?</p>\n<p>Right, so, outskirts of Chernobyl, going shopping for new material. I couldn\u2019t bring my dead everywhere, the way I used to. The stink was too obvious, the scarves and hats too blatant. There were cameras metastasising on every street corner. I had to struggle just to carry one or two along with me those days.</p>\n<p>So there I was, walking around in a ridiculous coat and sunglasses, dragging this briefcase by my side. My daughter was never the type to cling to my skirts. She was away somewhere in the city. It wouldn\u2019t do to spend all my time worrying about her survival, so in the past hundred years I\u2019d fit her with a few extra features.</p>\n<p>If you are about to call me a bad parent, then be warned that I might start trying to be a good one, <em>starting with my research efforts</em>.</p>\n<p>No? Excellent.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d had my fair share of encounters with what are now hilariously called \u201cnormalcy preservation organisations\u201d. Bloodless and wretched things. They\u2019d tried to chain my daughter more times than I can count. I could accept that they\u2019d come after me, but she was just a slip of a girl. Their cruelty knew no bounds.</p>\n<p>One moment I was walking down an emptying street, and the next three agents leapt out from a decrepit old house and blew a neat triplet of holes in my torso.</p>\n<p>Of course by this point I was really quite hard to kill, but the three of them were backed up by two brutes in hazmat armour. They caught me about the neck with a loop of rope like some kind of animal and emptied their magazines. I was still conscious, but there\u2019s not really a lot you can do with gaping holes in every major muscle group.</p>\n<p>They dragged me into the base they\u2019d set up in their shack, which inside was done up like some kind of watchpost. I recognised vaguely the equipment and the general style: they were with Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, or one of its descendants.</p>\n<p>This\u2014</p>\n<p>It was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt. Even the day I lost my daughter, there was a kind of lingering apathy. I let the waves wash over me until my head only rarely broke the surface, and I almost forgot what loss was at all.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t like that. They were right there, in the room with me, and I couldn\u2019t move. She was out there, waiting for me, and when she came to find me, and she found <em>them</em>, and I would have to watch, if she found them would they even capture her or just pulp her fucking brain again\u2014</p>\n<p>Oops!</p>\n<p>Sorry. It\u2019ll reattach, don\u2019t worry. And anyway, you\u2019re not going to miss it for long.</p>\n<p>Hmph.</p>\n<p>Suffice to say I wasn\u2019t feeling great. They put me in cuffs, and were preparing some kind of sedative, which might even have worked. But\u2026</p>\n<p>One of them had taken <em>my briefcase</em>. And you know how they are. Their type just cannot stand an unanswered question. I don\u2019t know who they thought I was. If they\u2019d known exactly who they\u2019d found they would have burned it. But instead poor idiot mister Foundation popped the locks.</p>\n<p>The layers of the dermis aren\u2019t actually connected very strongly, you know? Once you puncture the membrane somewhere, you can work your way through the subcutaneous tissue pretty easy. Especially if you\u2019re using, say, human jaws.</p>\n<p>He reeled back and half his face was missing, torn off by the thing in the case. He screamed \u2014 I think he was trying to cry for help, but it had gotten into his muscles, too \u2014 and the rest of the agents opened up on my poor valiant servant.</p>\n<p>Then she arrived. Must have tracked her mother by scent, or perhaps she was playing stalk-and-catch. I was so proud of her.</p>\n<p>Just walked in through the front door, quiet as could be. I think the field team were a little off kilter for some reason, so they didn\u2019t shoot her. One of them screamed at her to get back while the other three tried to wrangle my homunculus. He actually ran over and tried to grab her and get out of the house!</p>\n<p>Well, my daughter popped his head off, of course. Then they turned their attention to her properly, but now there were only three of them against two of my dead and my dear girl. It was quick, and then it was slow.</p>\n<p>Two of them surrendered. I was worried they\u2019d hurt her, but she was only superficially perforated. At worst it was inconvenient. I\u2019d have to reattach her spinal cord where a stray round had pierced it to get her lower body functional again, that was all.</p>\n<p>As soon as I broke my restraints I embraced her and praised her for that display of bravery. We left at once, with the two captives restrained and lugged with us. One of them begged us the whole way to release his subordinate. I told him I\u2019d do his job for him and reprimand her and he made such a noise. It was a great pick-me-up after everything.</p>\n<p>When we got back I scrapped him for parts \u2014 in fact, look back there, you can still see his spine wriggling in the pneumatitrator! Isn\u2019t it kind of cute? No?</p>\n<p>Oh, be sullen, then. When my daughter gets like this I give her a chocolate and some leftovers, but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t work on you.</p>\n<p>I would have found somewhere for his inferior to make herself useful, too, but it turned out the paralytic had made its way to her lungs.</p>\n<p>Ho hum.

Monologuing is only fun with a lucid audience.</p>\n<p>Well, that episode wasn\u2019t all that interesting, regardless. I was just explaining how much I love my daughter, indulging in my motherly urges and so on. I know <em>you types</em> aren\u2019t a fan.</p>\n<p>What? Strike a nerve?</p>\n<p>Hm. You\u2019ve gone soft in your old age, regardless. No, not \u2014 don\u2019t look at me like that. Yes, you\u2019re very young, and I\u2019m sure that hair is attractive to\u2026 somebody. But <em>you</em>, the Foundation, whatever you call yourselves nowadays. What you\u2019ve been getting up to is positively pathetic. The other day I heard a \u201cVanguard\u201d pharmacy put out a call for vampires to come in for conditioning treatment! Did you get so lazy you decided you\u2019d try and get all your enemies to just go willingly to their dissection and death? If even one of the daughters of the great Impaler appeared I\u2019d eat my shoes.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t hear you; the nerve damage has really got to your tongue. Try harder.</p>\n<p>Listen, I like to joke with the material, but that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to tell me a lie, make it believable. You\u2019re so awful at subterfuge I\u2019m probably doing good by increasing the competence of your agency.</p>\n<p>No, come on, this persistence is pathetic. Even if you did somehow hoodwink <em>ten</em> bloodsuckers into showing up, you don\u2019t need to keep up this pretense about, what do you call it, \u201charm reduction\u201d, around <em>me</em>. Look at me! I\u2019m not going to judge you if you admit you scattered their ashes in the river.</p>\n<p>I have to respect your commitment. Maybe you even believe it. The Foundation were always masters of self-deception. I thought Vanguard had turned a new leaf. This has been an educational exchange for the <em>both</em> of us.</p>\n<p>Ah, but their new era has not been without its upsides. I am a great appreciator of your people\u2019s newfound openmindedness. If they\u2019d adopted this attitude from the start, we\u2019d all be deathless by now. To think of how much easier things would have been if they hadn\u2019t clung to their idiot notions\u2026 I could strangle those pitiful Overseers.</p>\n<p>Still, I didn\u2019t say no to the amnesty when they offered it.</p>\n<p>Oh, you look like a kicked puppy. Yes, one of their liaisons offered me a pardon if I\u2019d agree to test on their mimicflesh and swear off the good stuff. I did try it for a few months, but it\u2019s just not the same. There are all these obscure occult properties, and the mimics don\u2019t even scream properly.</p>\n<p>Yes, and that\u2019s you caught up to the modern day, more or less. I skipped over a variety of encounters with dullards who thought they\u2019d be the one to kill me, but nothing worth telling.</p>\n<p>I absolutely <em>do</em> have to do this. My daughter\u2019s memory is up to a nice round two years, which is about ten thousand short of what I\u2019ll accept.</p>\n<p>Oh, good job on the smile! I thought your zygomaticus was halfway to necrosis, congratulations. Can I ask what brought it on? Would it have anything to do with the dozen Coalition jackboots fumbling out of their base toward my pretty little abode?</p>\n<p>You remain an awful liar, dear. Of course you know what I\u2019m talking about. You called them here with that goetic beacon in your pericardial cavity. Or maybe not; the world is full of coincidences.</p>\n<p>And there goes the grin. It\u2019s a shame, it looks good on you. Really shows off your incisors. I think those will be your main input into my next project.</p>\n<p>Every single sneering warden thinks they have me pegged. Here\u2019s a doddering old lady from before we invented writing, who\u2019s escaped capture by slinking away from everything dangerous, burdened by an imbecile daughter barely capable of feeding herself. I\u2019ve seen what you write about me. You have such interesting <em>opinions</em> about my work. And even though I have slipped through the nets of a hundred generations, every two-bit Director is just so sure he\u2019ll be the one to bring this antique into the reliquary that is her rightful place. Chernobyl was the closest you ever came, and you were still <em>pretty damn far</em>.</p>\n<p>I told you: if I could not adapt to the world as it is, I would have gone mad eons ago. And yet every time one of your technicians invent some new gimmick you try to catch me with it. The Scythians tried riding me down with their precious cavalry, old Rameses had a go with chariots, Metternich cornered me with grenadiers, De Gaulle\u2019s goons poisoned me with some fancy paralytic. All of them are decorating the east wall of the lab, now. Don\u2019t look! I just said I want your teeth, and the vomit does terrible things to the enamel.</p>\n<p>And your precious Coalition, with their newest hack. These unbinding mechanists have made a right mess. You know a month ago, the thrall they were interviewing on TV, where they had to keep redacting segments of her life story because her master was a wanted criminal? That was <em>me</em>! I mean, the embarrassment I felt, I just wanted a hole to open up and swallow her. Having my reputation tarnished in front of half the country by a spare worker! I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on an unbinder and see what makes them tick for just <em>so</em> long.</p>\n<p>So: thank you for putting together this whole operation. I was worried they might not bother, but it seems Vanguard has rubbed off on them. They were just so filled with <em>humanitarian concern</em> that they brought one! So sweet. I should have the countermeasure up by next week.</p>\n<p>Why on Earth did you step up as bait? Did you think they\u2019d pull you out while you were still recognisable? Because I can promise you that even if they did cage me, you are not in a fixable state.</p>\n<p>Hm. I do not think the word for what you have done here is <em>bravery</em>, exactly; even we Levantine hunter-gatherers had words for \u201csuicidal\u201d. It should make your cerebrum an interesting reagent, if nothing else.</p>\n<p>Ah, and here they come. They\u2019re just going through the chaff upstairs. I do wish you\u2019d never invented gunpowder. Those things are just far too loud.</p>\n<p>Eve! Come on upstairs, dear. There are some very rude men upstairs.</p>\n<p>Yes, isn\u2019t she just adorable? It took me a while to work out the telescoping ribcage. Put that away, darling, you\u2019re getting lymph everywhere. And those fingernails! I\u2019ll have you know they can hit a sparrow at half a kilometre.</p>\n<p>Just go on up, sweet.</p>\n<p>Dinner\u2019s served.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"light.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/light.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>When I was a child, I dreamt of the paradise I was promised my spirit would one day rise to.

I held the whole world away from her with my hands and my ribs and my skull. Three spears were thrust into my back, and a fourth into the neck had killed me.\n\n\n\nWhile I was dead, the fifth had taken her, too.\n\n\n\nAs I blearily cracked open my eyes, already stiffening with rigor mortis, she trembled beside me. Her last breath was drowned out by bickering.\n\n\n\nBehind, the men who had killed us argued loudly in a foreign tongue about what to do next. The tallest of them, disfigured by a twisted arm and muscles like an ox, gestured violently towards the hills we\u2019d descended from. Perhaps some of my band had escaped. It was bitter comfort to me now.\n\n\n\nI rose slowly to my feet. I held her by the wrist as I had so many times before, and she fell limply by the arm beside me. She was too light.\n\n\n\nWhat? Oh. I\u2019ve never had one of you try to //comfort// me before. That was a long time ago, anyway.\n\n\n\nThe mud-brick village we had tried to raid was not yet called Uruk, and the men were not yet the Sumerians. Even the pale and weedy grass they gnawed at was not yet really wheat. They were a stunted lot, and might have been pitiable if they hadn\u2019t taken my daughter.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t look at me like that. We were starving. They had been pushing us out of the plains and into the high valleys all my life. \n\n\n\nNot that any of this matters. I\u2019m beyond trying to claw at the //moral high ground//.\n\n\n\nMy fellows were scattered around me, dead to the last. We didn\u2019t know how to fight their numbers, their corded slings and taut bows, their weapons of strange and shining stone. They\u2019d died so easily.\n\n\n\nSo I woke them up.\n\n\n\nOne by one the dead rose. Seized joints cracked with unexpected flexion, tendon and sinew hesitantly peeled apart. Their blood pooled thickly at their feet.\n\n\n\nThe men turned around to look at me, and them. Their faces were portraits of dread. When I have trouble sleeping I think of them and drift off. Then -- there was all the tedious struggle, and all the tedious begging. But I had them in the end. One made it two hours down the packed dirt path that was not yet the world\u2019s first road, throwing his brothers behind him, in cowardice or appeasement.\n\n\n\nAnd there was my daughter. I carried her all the way. She was slight, and stiff, and as the sun set she began to cool until by touch I could not distinguish her from the earth in which I lay her.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing pretty about the dead, no matter what the fanatics say. They\u2019ll rant at you as long as you care to listen, about beauty, certainty, symmetry. They\u2019re just insane; anyone who would do this is, really. I was ready to leave the meat of my daughter in the earth. But just before I did, something rose out of her, that was not breath, and clung to me. I thought I might as well keep it around. At the time I didn\u2019t let myself think something so stupid, but it would be nice to have her back.\n\n\n\nYes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, obviously. It\u2019s always nice to have perceptive material. But try not to yell too much, it strains the diaphragm; you\u2019ll want that nice and fresh for later.\n\n\n\nI had lost other children, of course. You think of it as the ultimate tragedy. None of you can guess how lucky you are. Even just three centuries ago\u2026 it was something mothers expected. Which is not to say that it was ever easy. I would have called all of them back to life, if I could. But only her soul remained to me, and I am less sentimental about these things than most.\n\n\n\nMhm. Still sentimental enough to cut you up.\n\n\n\nOh? Well, this is the last time you\u2019ll be able to speak for a while, so I might as well.\n\n\n\nOnce, when I was the same age my daughter was when she died, I ran into a leprous hundred-headed snake. Not that any of us knew what leprosy was in those days. But its skin was peeling and ulcerating; great blisters and cancers riddled every inch of exposed muscle; its eyes were spasming as it begged me for a drop of blood.\n\n\n\nAnd because I was young and stupid, I cut open my palm with a flint and let it drink, and it skittered off, begging me not to speak of its appearance to anyone. When three days later I ran into two beautiful men, fire-skinned and stinking of what I now realise must have been incense, I told them everything they asked me. They laughed in a voice like cracking ice and promised me their Queen\u2019s blessing.\n\n\n\nThat probably had something to do with it.\n\n\n\nIt now occurs to me they were definitely Mab\u2019s. I think I took a side in their civil war by doing that. I had a lot of headaches over the topic, later.\n\n\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s where it began. Now, nod if you\u2019d rather be blind for this next bit.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/goat.jpg |\n\ncaption=We have both been reshaped by men.

That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\n\n\n\nJust a little joke! I don\u2019t get to talk to a lot of people. If you try to be funny near a Karcist they look at you like you\u2019re an alien.\n\n\n\nReally, though, you\u2019ll be fine. The vertebra fused back into place; you\u2019re practically good as new.\n\n\n\nLook, just don\u2019t pay attention to the lathe. No, no, if you keep panicking yourself like that I\u2019ll have to paralyse you again. Just think about something else. This really shouldn\u2019t be hurting that much.\n\n\n\nDo you want to hear more about me?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\n\n\n\nIt was during the Hussite Wars--\n\n\n\nStop looking confused, they weren\u2019t occult. You people just don\u2019t know anything about your ancestors these days. I\u2019d be angry if I hadn\u2019t known how worthless they were personally. This was around the fourteen-hundreds. Is that good enough for you?\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t wail or I\u2019ll block your trachea. Thank you.\n\n\n\nNow, as I was saying, I was searching for a fleshsmith. This is skipping millennia of my life, but they weren\u2019t very //dense// millennia. Fill in about six hours of me narrating executions of uncouth men on the road, if you want. I had come to Esterberg, the hidden city. In those days there were far less humans, and many more faeries, and those odd ape-things. It stank like dead fish and liceridden fur. The city, like all cities in those days, was an open sore in the world. But it was the only place I could find someone who could stitch my daughter\u2019s soul back into a body.\n\n\n\nYes, despite ten thousand years of wandering, I did not exactly have my finger on the pulse of the occult world (what a hilarious expression!). I had brushed up against the edges of Fae activity -- and immediately fled -- and I had run into fleshcarves and cogkindred on the road or in the hovels the peasants gave me in return for their lives. But I was only vaguely aware of, for example, the existence of the Daevites.\n\n\n\nIt does not help that I did not hold, and indeed still do not hold, with cities. I can tolerate a thousand people living together, but once you start to lose count that\u2019s a bad sign.\n\n\n\nSorry, this is besides the point. The tendonwork is distracting me. There, you should be able to speak again. Now, where was I?\n\n\n\nI had found after endless searching a suitable fleshcrafter, brought him my daughter\u2019s soul and a spare girl-child, and after deploying enough threats I was sure he wouldn\u2019t simply dispose of her errant spirit I set out into the city.\n\n\n\nI wanted to see if I could find some useful contacts, perhaps some tips on the location of other nexuses. To my later dismay, it turned out the city was quite firmly antiroyalist territory. And you know how Fae get; they just have this way about them. They learn things they have no right knowing. \n\n\n\nSo I walked into the square with my retinue--\n\n\n\nI kept about two dozen of the dead with me at all times. Had them in low-brimmed hats, big cloaks, stuffed them with herbs and so on. Mostly I got away with claiming to be a wandering priestess, though it didn\u2019t work in Esterberg, of course.\n\n\n\nIn the square there was an eyeless beggar. And by eyeless I mean great divots had been sunk all over his bared skin, so you could see the half a hundred weeping sockets that must have once seen unimaginable sights. When I walked past him, he pointed straight at me. Every single face in the square turned to stare right at me within three seconds.\n\n\n\nNow, you understand, I was in what is today Poland. I had been born near Iraq. I was //used// to standing out. It wasn\u2019t anything like today, obviously, but I got little stares, kids either knew I was the funniest thing around or squealed when they saw me, you get the idea. They thought I was a Turk, which got a laugh the first time they said it to my face.\n\n\n\nWhat it felt like when that entire square, probably five thousand people, turned to bore into my head? I cannot describe it. I barely heard what the beggar said next. Something about crimes revealed and reconciled, a trial before the House of the Inventor, pardon-by-years. I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the words while everyone looked at me. Blank and confident, like men who hold shining stars in their hands, and know that not only can you not save yourself, you cannot save //anyone//.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, I admit it, I panicked. I ordered my dead to lash out and fled in the terror. Anyone who died I raised too, to buy me my hour. It turns out that for all their staring most of the people in the square were basically civilians. And two dozen doesn\u2019t sound like many, but if they don\u2019t die when you kill them they can do a lot. So today I think they have a little plaque where the beggar used to sit, for the thanatotic riot of 1433. Killed about eight hundred, supposedly.\n\n\n\nWhile the citizens ran about like headless chickens I collected my project and dispatched the uncooperative Karcist with my favourite trick.\n\n\n\nThat was the fifty-seventh time I died.\n\n\n\nI fled the city with her in my arms, all my dead lost to its militia, the happiest I\u2019d been in centuries. To call back a soul, well-formed, from //millenia// of sleep? Every two-bit reanimator called it impossible.\n\n\n\nOh, come on, you know me better than that. I wouldn\u2019t do this to you for //fun//; I\u2019m not such a sadist I\u2019d risk the Coalition\u2019s wrath. Obviously something didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\n\nMy daughter woke up. Her flesh was as cold as mine, but that was no burden. She would never be hungry again, and if she ever left me I knew I could bring her back. I would try to teach her, somehow, and let her do the same to me. We would pass through the ages of man together. That was the first time I really thought about my power, in detail.\n\n\n\nYes, try and pull what remains of your face into a smirk, very classy. I was raised when the cutting edge of technology was //writing//. It took me fully three thousand years to realise the priests of Ashur and Marduk could not literally talk to the gods. I had to essentially invent the entire notion of necromancy from scratch.\n\n\n\nWell, thank you! But of course I don\u2019t seem that old. If I did, I would have gone insane a very long time ago. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to see a warhorse, an automobile, a spacecraft?\n\n\n\nWait, wait, sorry. I\u2019m letting you rile me up. Back to the story.\n\n\n\nMy daughter was the child I\u2019d loved, in every detail. Exactly every detail. She did not gain new traits, or lose old ones. It was as if her soul was frozen in amber. Something about the way it connected to her newly-conquered flesh was defective. She could puppeteer the body, but the body could not embed memories in her being. So she remembered only the last month, at best. She is an eternal youth, and can never grow.\n\n\n\nFor a while, I thought her perfect as she was. Though I had not known it, this had been what I was missing all those empty years. The two of us lived out the Thirty Years\u2019 War in an obscure hut, mother and child (much later did we learn this was also the //Fifth// Occult War). I taught her a hundred times, to weave, to write, to feel safe. She did not feel an empty belly even once, and occasionally I entertained her by dismembering lost //landsknechte//.\n\n\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stay satisfied forever. Every mother wants to see her daughter grow into herself. She should have been my equal, and risen a queen of the dead alongside me.

I mean, empirically. I haven\u2019t experienced it myself.\n\n\n\nNow, good news. This next part will actually be totally painless! I\u2019m going to anaesthetise you. It might also scramble your internal body-model, though. It\u2019ll give you, what\u2019s the word? Dysphoria? A shot of that, real concentrated, but over quick.\n\n\n\nThat expression there is\u2026 Let me tell you another story. This one might even give you context on what\u2019s happening to you. Concentrate on the words, please.\n\n\n\nSo I was in Chernobyl--\n\n\n\nOh, alright, fine. I\u2019d spent the past three hundred years looking for someone who knew how to help my daughter\u2019s situation.\n\n\n\nWell, I say that, but it\u2019s not strictly true. I spent fifty years searching, and then I realised I\u2019d have to do it myself. I learnt at the feet of the great soul-sages; I did favours for children of the Scarlet Fool; I even managed to win a lesson off one of the Wild Hunt on a bet. I began to put together something like a //theory// of necromancy. I was inspired by what was in the air in those days. All those philosophers, those men of science! There was something romantic about the idea the world could be understood.\n\n\n\nI knew firsthand it was false, of course.\n\n\n\nSo I set out on a course of experimentation. That\u2019s when I began collecting material in earnest, and yes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here, you poor thing.\n\n\n\nAnyway, as I said, I was in Chernobyl. After the Russians cursed the land, they evacuated the whole town. The margins of error for that kind of thing are large enough to lose a lot of people. Ripe pickings for little old me.\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean \u201ctalk like that\u201d? I talk like //myself//. If I wasn\u2019t able to change with the times I would have lost my mind a long time ago. Even last century, there was barely such a thing as a Foundation, and now they\u2019ve fallen apart. If I adapted any slower the pace of events would overtake me, you understand?\n\n\n\nRight, so, outskirts of Chernobyl, going shopping for new material. I couldn\u2019t bring my dead everywhere, the way I used to. The stink was too obvious, the scarves and hats too blatant. There were cameras metastasising on every street corner. I had to struggle just to carry one or two along with me those days.\n\n\n\nSo there I was, walking around in a ridiculous coat and sunglasses, dragging this briefcase by my side. My daughter was never the type to cling to my skirts. She was away somewhere in the city. It wouldn\u2019t do to spend all my time worrying about her survival, so in the past hundred years I\u2019d fit her with a few extra features.\n\n\n\nIf you are about to call me a bad parent, then be warned that I might start trying to be a good one, //starting with my research efforts//.\n\n\n\nNo? Excellent.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d had my fair share of encounters with what are now hilariously called \u201cnormalcy preservation organisations\u201d. Bloodless and wretched things. They\u2019d tried to chain my daughter more times than I can count. I could accept that they\u2019d come after me, but she was just a slip of a girl. Their cruelty knew no bounds.\n\n\n\nOne moment I was walking down an emptying street, and the next three agents leapt out from a decrepit old house and blew a neat triplet of holes in my torso.\n\n\n\nOf course by this point I was really quite hard to kill, but the three of them were backed up by two brutes in hazmat armour. They caught me about the neck with a loop of rope like some kind of animal and emptied their magazines. I was still conscious, but there\u2019s not really a lot you can do with gaping holes in every major muscle group.\n\n\n\nThey dragged me into the base they\u2019d set up in their shack, which inside was done up like some kind of watchpost. I recognised vaguely the equipment and the general style: they were with Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, or one of its descendants.\n\n\n\nThis--\n\n\n\nIt was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt. Even the day I lost my daughter, there was a kind of lingering apathy. I let the waves wash over me until my head only rarely broke the surface, and I almost forgot what loss was at all.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t like that. They were right there, in the room with me, and I couldn\u2019t move. She was out there, waiting for me, and when she came to find me, and she found //them//, and I would have to watch, if she found them would they even capture her or just pulp her fucking brain again--\n\n\n\nOops!\n\n\n\nSorry. It\u2019ll reattach, don\u2019t worry. And anyway, you\u2019re not going to miss it for long.\n\n\n\nHmph.\n\n\n\nSuffice to say I wasn\u2019t feeling great. They put me in cuffs, and were preparing some kind of sedative, which might even have worked. But\u2026\n\n\n\nOne of them had taken //my briefcase//. And you know how they are. Their type just cannot stand an unanswered question. I don\u2019t know who they thought I was. If they\u2019d known exactly who they\u2019d found they would have burned it. But instead poor idiot mister Foundation popped the locks.\n\n\n\nThe layers of the dermis aren\u2019t actually connected very strongly, you know? Once you puncture the membrane somewhere, you can work your way through the subcutaneous tissue pretty easy. Especially if you\u2019re using, say, human jaws.\n\n\n\nHe reeled back and half his face was missing, torn off by the thing in the case. He screamed -- I think he was trying to cry for help, but it had gotten into his muscles, too -- and the rest of the agents opened up on my poor valiant servant.\n\n\n\nThen she arrived. Must have tracked her mother by scent, or perhaps she was playing stalk-and-catch. I was so proud of her.\n\n\n\nJust walked in through the front door, quiet as could be. I think the field team were a little off kilter for some reason, so they didn\u2019t shoot her. One of them screamed at her to get back while the other three tried to wrangle my homunculus. He actually ran over and tried to grab her and get out of the house!\n\n\n\nWell, my daughter popped his head off, of course. Then they turned their attention to her properly, but now there were only three of them against two of my dead and my dear girl. It was quick, and then it was slow.\n\n\n\nTwo of them surrendered. I was worried they\u2019d hurt her, but she was only superficially perforated. At worst it was inconvenient. I\u2019d have to reattach her spinal cord where a stray round had pierced it to get her lower body functional again, that was all.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I broke my restraints I embraced her and praised her for that display of\u00a0\u00a0bravery. We left at once, with the two captives restrained and lugged with us. One of them begged us the whole way to release his subordinate. I told him I\u2019d do his job for him and reprimand her and he made such a noise. It was a great pick-me-up after everything.\n\n\n\nWhen we got back I scrapped him for parts -- in fact, look back there, you can still see his spine wriggling in the pneumatitrator! Isn\u2019t it kind of cute? No?\n\n\n\nOh, be sullen, then. When my daughter gets like this I give her a chocolate and some leftovers, but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t work on you. \n\n\n\nI would have found somewhere for his inferior to make herself useful, too, but it turned out the paralytic had made its way to her lungs.\n\n\n\nHo hum. He did get his wish; that was my good deed for the decade. Afterwards I took the kid out for a treat. Blue steak in Lyon.\n\n\n\nAnd, oh dear, speaking of hypoxia I do think your airway is blocked. Why didn\u2019t you //say// any--\n\n\n\nRight, you don\u2019t have an isolation chamber for your larynx. My bad. Can you hear me right now? Were you even conscious for the back half of my story? It\u2019s awfully rude of you to choke on your blood while I was doing all this helpful work on your intestines, and I shall have my recompense, I say. \n\n\n\nHa. Oh, what a mess.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t get another one of you, it\u2019d be such a headache.

I was just explaining how much I love my daughter, indulging in my motherly urges and so on. I know //you types// aren\u2019t a fan.\n\n\n\nWhat? Strike a nerve?\n\n\n\nHm. You\u2019ve gone soft in your old age, regardless. No, not -- don\u2019t look at me like that. Yes, you\u2019re very young, and I\u2019m sure that hair is attractive to\u2026 somebody. But //you//, the Foundation, whatever you call yourselves nowadays. What you\u2019ve been getting up to is positively pathetic. The other day I heard a \u201cVanguard\u201d pharmacy put out a call for vampires to come in for conditioning treatment! Did you get so lazy you decided you\u2019d try and get all your enemies to just go willingly to their dissection and death? If even one of the daughters of the great Impaler appeared I\u2019d eat my shoes.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t hear you; the nerve damage has really got to your tongue. Try harder.\n\n\n\nListen, I like to joke with the material, but that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to tell me a lie, make it believable. You\u2019re so awful at subterfuge I\u2019m probably doing good by increasing the competence of your agency.\n\n\n\nNo, come on, this persistence is pathetic. Even if you did somehow hoodwink //ten// bloodsuckers into showing up, you don\u2019t need to keep up this pretense about, what do you call it, \u201charm reduction\u201d, around //me//. Look at me! I\u2019m not going to judge you if you admit you scattered their ashes in the river.\n\n\n\nI have to respect your commitment. Maybe you even believe it. The Foundation were always masters of self-deception. I thought Vanguard had turned a new leaf. This has been an educational exchange for the //both// of us.\n\n\n\nAh, but their new era has not been without its upsides. I am a great appreciator of your people\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0newfound openmindedness. If they\u2019d adopted this attitude from the start, we\u2019d all be deathless by now. To think of how much easier things would have been if they hadn\u2019t clung to their idiot notions\u2026 I could strangle those pitiful Overseers.\n\n\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t say no to the amnesty when they offered it.\n\n\n\nOh, you look like a kicked puppy. Yes, one of their liaisons offered me a pardon if I\u2019d agree to test on their mimicflesh and swear off the good stuff. I did try it for a few months, but it\u2019s just not the same. There are all these obscure occult properties, and the mimics don\u2019t even scream properly.\n\n\n\nYes, and that\u2019s you caught up to the modern day, more or less. I skipped over a variety of encounters with dullards who thought they\u2019d be the one to kill me, but nothing worth telling.\n\n\n\nI absolutely //do// have to do this. My daughter\u2019s memory is up to a nice round two years, which is about ten thousand short of what I\u2019ll accept.\n\n\n\nOh, good job on the smile! I thought your zygomaticus was halfway to necrosis, congratulations. Can I ask what brought it on? Would it have anything to do with the dozen Coalition jackboots fumbling out of their base toward my pretty little abode?\n\n\n\nYou remain an awful liar, dear. Of course you know what I\u2019m talking about. You called them here with that goetic beacon in your pericardial cavity. Or maybe not; the world is full of coincidences.\n\n\n\nAnd there goes the grin. It\u2019s a shame, it looks good on you. Really shows off your incisors. I think those will be your main input into my next project. \n\n\n\nEvery single sneering warden thinks they have me pegged. Here\u2019s a doddering old lady from before we invented writing, who\u2019s escaped capture by slinking away from everything dangerous, burdened by an imbecile daughter barely capable of feeding herself. I\u2019ve seen what you write about me. You have such interesting //opinions// about my work. And even though I have slipped through the nets of a hundred generations, every two-bit Director is just so sure he\u2019ll be the one to bring this antique into the reliquary that is her rightful place. Chernobyl was the closest you ever came, and you were still //pretty damn far//.\n\n\n\nI told you: if I could not adapt to the world as it is, I would have gone mad eons ago. And yet every time one of your technicians invent some new gimmick you try to catch me with it. The Scythians tried riding me down with their precious cavalry, old Rameses had a go with chariots, Metternich cornered me with grenadiers, De Gaulle\u2019s goons poisoned me with some fancy paralytic. All of them are decorating the east wall of the lab, now. Don\u2019t look! I just said I want your teeth, and the vomit does terrible things to the enamel.\n\n\n\nAnd your precious Coalition, with their newest hack. These unbinding mechanists have made a right mess. You know a month ago, the thrall they were interviewing on TV, where they had to keep redacting segments of her life story because her master was a wanted criminal? That was //me//! I mean, the embarrassment I felt, I just wanted a hole to open up and swallow her. Having my reputation tarnished in front of half the country by a spare worker! I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on an unbinder and see what makes them tick for just //so// long.\n\n\n\nSo: thank you for putting together this whole operation. I was worried they might not bother, but it seems Vanguard has rubbed off on them. They were just so filled with //humanitarian concern// that they brought one! So sweet. I should have the countermeasure up by next week.\n\n\n\nWhy on Earth did you step up as bait?\u00a0\u00a0Did you think they\u2019d pull you out while you were still recognisable? Because I can promise you that even if they did cage me, you are not in a fixable state.\n\n\n\nHm. I do not think the word for what you have done here is //bravery//, exactly; even we Levantine hunter-gatherers had words for \u201csuicidal\u201d. It should make your cerebrum an interesting reagent, if nothing else.\n\n\n\nAh, and here they come. They\u2019re just going through the chaff upstairs. I do wish you\u2019d never invented gunpowder. Those things are just far too loud.\n\n\n\nEve! Come on upstairs, dear. There are some very rude men upstairs.\n\n\n\nYes, isn\u2019t she just adorable? It took me a while to work out the telescoping ribcage. Put that away, darling, you\u2019re getting lymph everywhere. And those fingernails! I\u2019ll have you know they can hit a sparrow at half a kilometre.\n\n\n\nJust go on up, sweet.\n\n\n\nDinner\u2019s served.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/light.jpg |\n\ncaption=When I was a child, I dreamt of the paradise I was promised my spirit would one day rise to.

There are some board games on shelves in the corner. There\u2019s a foosball table near the center, and a television on the wall that is currently showing a music video.</p>\n<p>However, each of these amenities is carefully controlled. All furniture is nailed to the floor or affixed firmly to the wall. There\u2019s nothing in the room that can be thrown or used as a weapon, and nothing that could allow prisoners to communicate with the outside world.</p>\n<p>Add to that the heavy metal door, the armed guards, and the fact that any escaping humanoid would have an entire facility to navigate before they got out, and this room is quite secure.</p>\n<p>Still, for members of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, to be allowed in here is an enormous privilege, one the Foundation is granting only on an extremely probative basis.</p>\n<p>Light neglected to mention that part of the deal. The Foundation is allowing us in here in exchange for the information I gave, but if any of us piss off the Jailors, we\u2019ll all be yanked back into solitary confinement.</p>\n<p>That means I can\u2019t fuck up. I can\u2019t do anything that would prompt the Jailors to take this away from my comrades. Even though I know that\u2019s exactly what the Jailors want me to think, I still can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s my fault Sean and the others got captured. I can\u2019t do anything that would make their captivity worse.</p>\n<p>There are around two dozen humanoids in medium security. Most of them are strangers, but my eyes snap right to the ones who are familiar.</p>\n<p>There, sitting in a corner, already talking to each other, are Jack, Mike, and Sean. They turn to look at me as I enter the room.</p>\n<p>I look back at them. They wear the same bluish uniforms all imprisoned anomalies wear, but I don\u2019t see any wounds or scars. Their mood is somber, but they don\u2019t seem broken.</p>\n<p>Considering the magnitude of the clusterfuck I dragged them into, they\u2019re doing a lot better than they could be.</p>\n<p>That should make me feel better, but it doesn\u2019t.

Words I\u2019ve wanted to say for months come spilling out of me like water from a burst pipe. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I pulled you into all this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sean shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not my fault just to make me feel better. You got captured trying to rescue my brother. If I hadn\u2019t made you guys help me, you\u2019d still be free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> inducted <em>you</em> into the Serpent\u2019s Hand,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe knew the risks and chose to take them. Resistance is dangerous. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the Jailors\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. You wouldn\u2019t have come to this place if it weren\u2019t for me, and it all turned out to be for nothing. Evan was\u2026\u201d I look up at him. I see no confusion, only concern. He knows. Of course he does. Jack and Mike saw Evan betray me. It was probably the first thing they told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing an MTF uniform. He was eating with them. I was so stupid to trust him.\u201d An edge of anger creeps into my voice. Anger at Evan, for betraying me, and anger at myself, for falling for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us knew it was a possibility,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was wearing a uniform!\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t make a mistake, but a lot of people probably would have done the same thing. Besides, at least your brother hasn\u2019t been suffering this whole time. He\u2019s probably better off in that task force than in a cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened is worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s an enemy, now. He betrayed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean admits. He looks at me for a moment and seems to think better of continuing to speak, as if afraid his opinion on the issue would offend me.</p>\n<p>I take a moment to contemplate what he\u2019s suggesting, that Evan rotting miserable in a cell for six years would have been worse than what happened.</p>\n<p>I spent six years having nightmares about my brother rotting alone in a cell. The entire time he was gone, I had no idea how he was being treated. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was still alive.</p>\n<p>Once I entered the Library and learned about the Foundation, the fearful unknown was replaced with a vivid image of Evan being treated the way Sean was treated as a teenager, the way most humanoid anomalies are treated by the Foundation. Do I really wish I\u2019d found Evan like that?</p>\n<p>I have to, don\u2019t I? Not because I want him to suffer, but because, if he\u2019d been a prisoner, he would have followed me to the Wanderer\u2019s Library. I\u2019d have brought him into the Hand, and my parents would\u2019ve finally learned that their son was still alive.</p>\n<p>A new image flashes in my head. Somewhere, right now, my mom is in tears, believing that she outlived both of her sons. The Jailors surely faked my death just as they did Evan\u2019s, so now my parents think they\u2019ve lost both their children.</p>\n<p>Evan knew they\u2019d do that when he helped the Jailors capture me. Whatever misery she\u2019s suffering now, it\u2019s his fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been okay since we last saw you?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>Of course not. No one in containment is okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to worry about each other,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere\u2019s no helping that.\u201d</p>\n<p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell them what I\u2019ve been doing. I don\u2019t want to tell them that I\u2019ve also been helping the Jailors. Even though they trained me not to. Even though they spent months teaching me to shut down and give our enemies nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t lie to them, though. I can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t failed them. That would be yet another betrayal.</p>\n<p>Tears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping them, too,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asks. There it is. The anger I deserve. It\u2019s almost comforting, knowing that, at least after this, I won\u2019t be able to disappoint them any further.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been letting them use my powers,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve been putting people in front of me, civilians, victims of mind-control, and I\u2019ve been curing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Sean asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, and the tidbit of information I used to get the four of us in here. It was about the Fifth Church. I don\u2019t think they could use it against the Hand. Still\u2026 I failed you. You trained me to ignore them, to force my mind out of my body and give them nothing. Instead, I\u2019ve been letting them manipulate and bargain with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey put a victim in front of me, someone who\u2019d been cursed. I tried to do the fire thing. I tried to summon a vivid image to my mind and ignore them like you trained me to, but I only held out for a few minutes before I gave in and cured them of the spell that was torturing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>I expect anger. Judgement. Disappointment. Failing that, I expect some sugarcoating attempt to cheer me up. The last thing I expect is the genuine relief that passes across their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a horrible thing for them to do,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not holding out,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that they can use me to cure people, my brother is free to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but given that he\u2019s a loyal Jailor, it\u2019s probably bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sean says, \u201cI hate them too, but, if I had your powers, and if they locked me in a room with someone like that, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. It might\u2019ve even been the right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>I look up at him. Is he serious? Could he really have just said that? \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m helping them,\u201d I say. \u201cHow could that be the right thing to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doing anything that helps them hurt anyone?\u201d Jack asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot directly,\u201d I admit, after a moment, \u201cbut what I\u2019m doing used to be my brother\u2019s primary job. Now that I\u2019m doing it, he\u2019s free to go do Jailor things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d refused to treat those people,\u201d Mike asks, \u201cwould the Jailors have used Evan to cure them, or would he be off doing whatever he\u2019s doing, leaving them untreated?\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes me a moment to process the significance of this question. \u201cThe latter,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Evan said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I think you made the right choice,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThose people don\u2019t deserve to languish in a containment cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least you got the Jailors to let someone go,\u201d Jack adds.</p>\n<p>I stare up at them.</p>\n<p>The argument they just made, Evan also made it when he tried to recruit me to the Jailors right after he captured me.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI decrease the number of people in Foundation custody. Before I came around, there were hundreds of mental anomalies whose victims had to be kept in containment for the rest of their lives. I\u2019ve cured thousands of people like that, allowing them to be sent back to their families. I\u2019ve freed more people from Foundation containment than the Serpent\u2019s Hand ever will.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Am I really hearing the same argument from Sean?</p>\n<p>I try to keep my shock off my face, but, clearly, I\u2019m failing.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jack says, \u201call we\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re being forced to make hard choices in here. Try to cut yourself some slack, okay? You\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The best I can?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 actually think that?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Sean says. The others nod in agreement.</p>\n<p>Could it be that they\u2019re just saying this to cheer me up?</p>\n<p>No. They wouldn\u2019t lie to me like that. They wouldn\u2019t treat me like a child. If they\u2019re saying my decision is understandable, perhaps even <em>defensible</em>, that\u2019s what they honestly believe.</p>\n<p>I want to argue back, to explain why they should be disappointed in me, but I can\u2019t find the words, and after I spend close to a minute trying and trying to think of something to say, I once again cave to temptation, and change the subject. \u201cHow have you guys been?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been worse off than me.</p>\n<p>Sean was moved to Site-17 almost immediately after his capture, and he\u2019s been in high security containment ever since. All three of them have suffered the same mind-numbing isolation, only they haven\u2019t had interactions with Evan, Dr. Light, my patients, or any other scrap of human contact. They\u2019ve been completely alone for months.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer like that for my failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got us out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to you we\u2019re in here. We can never thank you enough for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the least I could do, after getting you stuck here,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe embarked on this mission together. We got captured together. We got in here together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d still be out if it weren\u2019t for me,\u201d I repeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been on your mission, we would\u2019ve been on another,\u201d Sean says. \u201cIt could have gone South, just like this one did. If that had happened, we probably never would have escaped solitary.\u201d</p>\n<p>My eyes are moist. I shake my head, but, once again, I\u2019m not able to formulate an argument. I did get them out of high security containment, and taking Light\u2019s deal was the only way I could\u2019ve done that. In almost any other situation, that would\u2019ve been impossible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d I say. \u201cI had to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We embarked on this mission together, we failed together, and we\u2019re still together now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The others seem to agree with that, and I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with them.</p>\n<p>The heavy conversation dies down after that, and we set about just spending time together. We spend some time on the foosball table, and another chunk of time watching TV.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another music video on, by the pop star Jimmy Pheonix. He\u2019s a young singer, around Evan\u2019s age. He exploded onto the scene about half a decade ago and has become one of the most popular musicians in the world.</p>\n<p>His style could be best described as aggressively inoffensive, one of those pop stars cooked up in a corporate boardroom for maximumly broad appeal. I\u2019m sure people who care deeply about music regard him as absolute trash. For example:</p>\n<p>\u201cGods, do they have to play this?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, I think it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>The other two turn to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Mike says, looking away. \u201cYou can like whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably an actual reason they\u2019re playing this,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why they\u2019d actively want to rot our brains with something mindless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the four chords.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of his songs use the four chords,\u201d Jack says. \u201cDo you even know which chords the \u2018four chords of pop music\u2019 are?\u201d</p>\n<p>After half a minute of embarrassing silence, Mike admits he does not.</p>\n<p>Socialization goes on for two hours. When it\u2019s over, me and my comrades are allowed to exchange goodbyes, then we\u2019re sent back to our cells.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re all still prisoners. They\u2019re still suffering immensely for my failure, but at least I\u2019m lightening their burden. At least they\u2019re with friends, some of the time.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s pathetic that the bar has sunk so low, but this is the best day I\u2019ve had in months. I can only hope it was for them, too. That\u2019s the least I owe them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Evan</strong></p>\n<p>Callum tilts his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he admits, \u201cyou have me curious. What\u2019s this epiphany you\u2019ve had?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know who Veronica Hall is?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe magician?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Fifthist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she? I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s probably a lie, but it\u2019s not an important one right now, so Evan doesn\u2019t allow himself to get distracted by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI talked to her yesterday,\u201d Evan says. \u201cShe said some very interesting things. She knew about the Galaxy Plaza ritual, and she seemed to think of <em>you</em> as the one primarily responsible for its failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum raises a brow. \u201cDid she? I will admit that\u2019s a bit interesting. I suppose it could be seen as my fault. The ritual might have worked if I hadn\u2019t had it moved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he says. For a second, he has to fight down his nerves. He\u2019s about to make a big claim. If he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to make himself look really stupid, which could permanently damage his rapport with Callum.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not wrong, though. His theory makes sense. It explains everything. It explains what all of this has to do with Cassidy Redwood. It explains why Callum chose to meddle with such an important ritual, when he could have easily taken revenge on Evan in another way. It explains how Callum could have been foolish enough to think that a ritual designed to require thousands of sacrifices would still work with only a few dozen.</p>\n<p>Or, rather, it explains that he was never that foolish.</p>\n<p>Evan looks Callum right in the eye. \u201cI think you got the ritual moved to Galaxy Plaza knowing that would cause it to fail,\u201d Evan says. \u201cI think you wanted it to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Callum is frozen. He\u2019s clearly surprised. But is it the correctness of the claim that has him shocked, or its absurdity?</p>\n<p>The smile that slowly creeps across Callum\u2019s face does little to resolve this ambiguity. \u201cOh?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHall said something very interesting to me yesterday. <em>\u2018I told them that what didn\u2019t work for Redwood wouldn\u2019t work for us.\u2019</em> She meant Cassidy Redwood, the Ortothan who tried and failed to resurrect her god with a blood sacrifice. Redwood left behind extensive notes detailing how she tried to reduce the number of sacrifices her ritual required.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted that you approached your father and asked him to move the ritual to Galaxy Plaza. I always took it for granted that you had enough pull with him to get him to say yes, but that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it? This ritual was the most important thing the church had ever attempted. There\u2019s no way your father would allow its effectiveness to be jeopardized just so you could get revenge against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it was moved,\u201d Callum observes. \u201cClearly I <em>did</em> manage to convince the Church to move it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in order to do that, you had to pair your proposal with an argument that the ritual would still work. You had to provide some kind of explanation, grounded in thaumaturgic theory, for why such a tiny number of sacrifices would still be enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the giant machine Cassidy Redwood built? There was nothing like that at the Galaxy Plaza.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you altered the details of the plan. You didn\u2019t need to use every trick she did. You just borrowed enough ideas to create a somewhat convincing case that the ritual could be completed with fewer sacrifices. You didn\u2019t even need to admit you got the idea from Redwood. Maybe Hall just made that connection later. Either way, you must have told them something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you know I was lying?\u201d Callum asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I have honestly believed the ritual would work with fewer sacrifices?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You know magical theory too well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a Fifthist. The same people who tried to take a bus to another solar system, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019d been interacting with me for months. Fifthism\u2019s grip on your mind had weakened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes one more second to push down his nerves. It\u2019s time for the killing blow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think that weakened grip <em>just</em> made you too smart to think the ritual would still work. I think it made you want it to fail. I think, after months of being friends with me, my voice eroding the Starfish\u2019s influence on you, a tiny bit of your conscience showed itself, just enough that you didn\u2019t want to end the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum stares up at Evan for several seconds. Slowly, as if out to milk the tension in the room for as long as he can, he closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cTsk, tsk, Evan. For a second, I really thought you had it all figured out, but then you had to start blabbering about my conscience.\u201d He pauses for a moment, then looks Evan right in the eye. \u201cMy choice to sabotage the ritual had nothing to do with morality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what did it have to do with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realized that I liked the world the way it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that different?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it had less than nothing to do with other people\u2019s wellbeing. Before you had me captured, I had money, power, and magic, and I was in a position to lord those things over the masses who lacked them. Most people didn\u2019t even know magic existed. None of them had any way of protecting themselves against my spells. I could do whatever I wanted. I could make them do whatever I wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Evan grimace. Jerry said something similar, a while back, that the Veil helps the world\u2019s monsters by ensuring ordinary people don\u2019t know how to defend themselves against them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the appeal of it,\u201d Callum continues. \u201cIn a clueless world, there was nothing stopping me from taking anything I wanted. I wanted a tome of arcane lore? I made someone sell it to me for a pittance. I wanted the hottest girl I knew to date me? She did. Everything I wanted, I got. I had power, and other people didn\u2019t. Do you know enough about Fifthist doctrine to know what\u2019s supposed to happen once the Fifth Church finally wins?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world turns into a hellscape based on the Starfish\u2019s warped imagination.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd with that newfound power, the Starfish destroys the barrier between desire and reality. All desires become real. <em>All</em> desires. Everyone would be able to bend reality to their whim, and if they decided they wanted to bend me, they\u2019d be just as likely to succeed as they\u2019d be to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy would a wolf want the helpless sheep he fed on to become wolves as well? My family\u2019s money wouldn\u2019t matter. My magic wouldn\u2019t be anything special. Everyone on earth would become my peer, and I don\u2019t want peers. I want the kind of power that can only exist in an ordered world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan stares at Callum. Somehow, even though Evan\u2019s initial guess was mostly right, Callum still managed to surprise and disappoint him.</p>\n<p>Maybe Evan should have known better. He wants so badly to believe his high-school best friend is buried somewhere deep inside Callum, but maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe that person was only ever a mask, and the real Callum could only have sick, selfish reasons to do anything, even save the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was right about the rest of it, though?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight enough that I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Callum admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I said I moved the ritual to Galaxy Plaza because I wanted revenge against you. I really did hate you for taking so much power away from me. At the same time, with the help of your magic voice, I\u2019d come to recognize that the Church\u2019s ultimate victory would, in its own way, do the same, so I hatched a plan to take care of both problems at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got my hands on Cassidy Redwood\u2019s notes. I drafted a similar proposal for our ritual and presented it to my father. I argued that the smaller number of sacrifices would attract less attention. Bullshit, of course. I knew a few dozen sacrifices could never be enough. I knew that the only thing my new ritual would succeed at doing was luring you into danger. I told you something would happen, knowing you\u2019d show up and try to save everyone. I thought you\u2019d run in and get yourself killed, and once you did, everything would be back to the way it was before I met you, with me ruling as crown prince over a town of magicless simpletons.\u201d</p>\n<p>There it is, then. After six years, the full truth about the Galaxy Plaza disaster, with no loose ends or lingering questions.</p>\n<p>As cathartic as it is to see it all laid out, Evan needs more than that to save the world again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the Church were going to try the same ritual again,\u201d Evan says, \u201cwhat kind of venue would they need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t insult my intelligence by pretending you\u2019re talking about a hypothetical. You\u2019re here because something happened. Just come out and tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan sighs. On paper, he isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose the situation to Callum. However, Callum\u2019s talking right now because Evan earned a bit of his respect by figuring out what he did six years ago. For Callum to continue talking, Evan needs to keep that respect.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I admit it. They\u2019re trying again. What kind of venue do they need?\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful to hear. I hope they succeed. I certainly won\u2019t be telling you anything that would help you stop them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just established that you don\u2019t want the world to end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>didn\u2019t</em> want it to end six years ago. My circumstances have changed since then. I no longer have money, power, or freedom. I\u2019m not in a position to lord my magic over anyone. Compared to my life in here, maybe the Fifth Church\u2019s new world would be an upgrade?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir new world would be hell for anyone sane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of it; there wouldn\u2019t be anyone sane.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan shakes his head. \u201cI would still be sane, as would anyone I chose to interact with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think I <em>don\u2019t</em> want you to experience eternal torment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if I can drag you down with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>That finally wipes the smile off Callum\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Evan says, \u201cif the Fifth Church does remake the world, and it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t tell me how to stop it, I will make <em>sure</em> you\u2019re perfectly sane until the end of time. I will find you, and I will force you to endure every second of our new eternity just as agonizingly lucid as me.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment of trepidation, Callum shakes his head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t capable of that kind of vindictiveness. If the world is already beyond saving, you won\u2019t torture me just out of spite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn most situations, you\u2019d be right,\u201d Evan admits, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting something. Jerry has my powers. He\u2019d also be sane, trapped in an insane world of eternal torment.\u201d Evan looks Callum in the eye. \u201cI swear to you, if that happens to my little brother, and it\u2019s your fault, I will <em>happily</em> dedicate the rest of my existence to punishing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum meets his gaze for a moment. His smugness falters.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Callum says, through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does the ritual work, and how would we stop it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>Starlight Saga</em> books have a memetic agent inside of them, similar to the one we put in <em>Star Signals</em>,\u201d Callum says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We tested them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tested whether the books have any effect on your stupid D-Class. Your tests came back negative because the meme doesn\u2019t do anything after it\u2019s first implanted. It just lingers there, waiting to be activated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActivated?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the ritual is for. It\u2019s all part of a deal we made with an extra-universal entity. A tiny piece of that being\u2019s essence is implanted in everyone who reads those books.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Evan asks. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s read <em>the Starlight Saga</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Callum\u2019s smugness returns. \u201cEvery last one. As we speak, our trigger waits, latent, in tens of millions of readers all over the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes a step backwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce we give the entity the sacrifice we owe it,\u201d Callum continues, \u201cit\u2019ll activate the trigger. All those minds will be ours, and they\u2019ll start remaking the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tens of millions. Tens of millions of people. The implications are so heavy that it\u2019s hard to stay standing. \u201cTens of millions would start to develop Ojai syndrome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t \u2018start to\u2019 develop it. They\u2019d become fully affected, instantly, just as if they\u2019d read <em>Star Signals</em> cover to cover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInstantly\u2026\u201d Evan doesn\u2019t want to show Callum\u2019s weakness, but he can\u2019t keep the horror off his face. For that many people to fall fully under the control of the Fifth Church would be the greatest disaster in human history, anomalous or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Callum\u2019s delight is no less obvious than Evan\u2019s fear. \u201cThe problem with <em>Star Signals</em> is that it was too slow. We\u2019d barely started to spread the book when you identified it as a threat and started shutting us down, so the Church created a new memetic agent which would activate all at once, after it was already widespread. Once those millions of minds are under the Church\u2019s control, they\u2019ll begin the same ritual the <em>Star Signals</em> readers started, and, about two weeks later, the world will be remade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes a deep breath. Focus. He can\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed. He needs to keep his head in the game. His job is to save the world. That\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we figure out when and where the sacrifice will take place?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I interfered, the Church was going to do it at some massive nerd convention in California.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe people we sacrifice have to be affected by the memetic agent. Part of the deal. Something about the entity getting to keep their souls. If the Church is planning to try again, they\u2019ll pick somewhere where thousands of <em>Starlight Saga</em> readers have gathered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back at the height of those books\u2019 popularity, any large gathering of sci-fi fans would be full of people who\u2019ve read them. Six years later\u2026 honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be that different. There\u2019d be thousands of events that could potentially qualify, and even if the Foundation identified and stopped one, all that would do is buy a bit of time. So long as that seed is prevalent, the Church can try again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there any way of purging that memetic seed from people?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>Callum shrugs. \u201cYou might be able to do it. You\u2019re pretty good at cleaning magic gunk out of people\u2019s brains. Still, given how many people there are to cure, and given that you have no way of identifying them, I don\u2019t like your odds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan doesn\u2019t like the Foundation\u2019s odds, either.</p>\n<p>The Foundation\u2019s people need to have a very, very long talk about this information, and that talk needs to begin as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s all my questions for now,\u201d Evan says. \u201cThank you. What you just said might save the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say? Threatening to torture someone for all eternity is a good way to get their secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, you\u2019ve done a good thing today. Maybe there\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvan, it\u2019s been five minutes since we went over this. You haven\u2019t dug up some faint echo of my better nature. I don\u2019t have a better nature. I said what I said because you threatened me. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Evan says. \u201cGoodbye, then. Me or another Foundation agent may be back with more questions later. Be candid with them, or else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Goodbye, and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost enough to goad Evan into taking the last word, but that\u2019d be as much of a victory for Callum as anything. Evan leaves.</p>\n<p>Light is waiting outside. \u201cGood work,\u201d she says, though there isn\u2019t any cheer in her voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Evan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m arranging an emergency meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Light\u2019s gaze lingers on him for a moment. He meets it. He does his best to force the worry off of his face.</p>\n<p>She can probably still see it. After, he can tell she\u2019s doing the same. The truth is, unless everything Callum just said is completely wrong, this is the gravest situation Evan has ever faced. Unless the Foundation does something very clever, very quickly, tens of millions of minds are going to be brought under the Fifth Church\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>Once that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s hard to imagine how even the Foundation could save the world.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-hub\">Series Hub</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster\">\u25c0\u25c0 First Entry</a> | <a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall\">\u25c0 Previous Entry</a> | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent\">Next Entry \u25b6</a></p>\n<p><sub><a href=\"/xhawk77x\">More by this Author</a></sub></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-18-callum-michaels\">I Didn't Forget Pt 18: Callum Michaels</a>\" by XHAWK77X, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The former Fifthist looks up at him from across the table, smug as ever.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we really doing this again so soon?\u201d Callum asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be different this time,\u201d Evan says.\n\n\n\nCallum sighs. \u201cFine. It\u2019s not like I have anything better to do. I suppose you have more questions?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. This time, I think I have answers.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Jerry**\n\n\n\nThe day after I made my arrangement with Dr. Light, I\u2019m escorted to the medium security socialization area after a long day treating civilians with mental afflictions.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a well-guarded room, totally enclosed and located deep within Site-17.\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of chairs and tables in the room, along with a handful of entertainment objects. There are some board games on shelves in the corner. There\u2019s a foosball table near the center, and a television on the wall that is currently showing a music video.\n\n\n\nHowever, each of these amenities is carefully controlled. All furniture is nailed to the floor or affixed firmly to the wall. There\u2019s nothing in the room that can be thrown or used as a weapon, and nothing that could allow prisoners to communicate with the outside world.\n\n\n\nAdd to that the heavy metal door, the armed guards, and the fact that any escaping humanoid would have an entire facility to navigate before they got out, and this room is quite secure.\n\n\n\nStill, for members of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, to be allowed in here is an enormous privilege, one the Foundation is granting only on an extremely probative basis.\n\n\n\nLight neglected to mention that part of the deal. The Foundation is allowing us in here in exchange for the information I gave, but if any of us piss off the Jailors, we\u2019ll all be yanked back into solitary confinement.\n\n\n\nThat means I can\u2019t fuck up. I can\u2019t do anything that would prompt the Jailors to take this away from my comrades. Even though I know that\u2019s exactly what the Jailors want me to think, I still can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s my fault Sean and the others got captured. I can\u2019t do anything that would make their captivity worse.\n\n\n\nThere are around two dozen humanoids in medium security. Most of them are strangers, but my eyes snap right to the ones who are familiar.\n\n\n\nThere, sitting in a corner, already talking to each other, are Jack, Mike, and Sean. They turn to look at me as I enter the room.\n\n\n\nI look back at them. They wear the same bluish uniforms all imprisoned anomalies wear, but I don\u2019t see any wounds or scars. Their mood is somber, but they don\u2019t seem broken.\n\n\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the clusterfuck I dragged them into, they\u2019re doing a lot better than they could be.\n\n\n\nThat should make me feel better, but it doesn\u2019t. If it weren\u2019t for me, they\u2019d still be free. They gave up their freedom for me, for my mission, a mission that was doomed from the start.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the guards undo my cuffs, I run up to them. I hug all three of them in turn, tears trickling to the floor beneath me. Words I\u2019ve wanted to say for months come spilling out of me like water from a burst pipe. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I pulled you into all this.\u201d\n\n\n\nSean shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not my fault just to make me feel better. You got captured trying to rescue my brother. If I hadn\u2019t made you guys help me, you\u2019d still be free.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c//I// inducted //you// into the Serpent\u2019s Hand,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe knew the risks and chose to take them. Resistance is dangerous. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the Jailors\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nI shake my head. \u201cNo. You wouldn\u2019t have come to this place if it weren\u2019t for me, and it all turned out to be for nothing. Evan was\u2026\u201d I look up at him. I see no confusion, only concern. He knows. Of course he does. Jack and Mike saw Evan betray me. It was probably the first thing they told him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing an MTF uniform. He was eating with them. I was so stupid to trust him.\u201d An edge of anger creeps into my voice. Anger at Evan, for betraying me, and anger at myself, for falling for it.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of us knew it was a possibility,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was wearing a uniform!\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t make a mistake, but a lot of people probably would have done the same thing. Besides, at least your brother hasn\u2019t been suffering this whole time. He\u2019s probably better off in that task force than in a cell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened is worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s an enemy, now. He betrayed me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sean admits. He looks at me for a moment and seems to think better of continuing to speak, as if afraid his opinion on the issue would offend me.\n\n\n\nI take a moment to contemplate what he\u2019s suggesting, that Evan rotting miserable in a cell for six years would have been worse than what happened.\n\n\n\nI spent six years having nightmares about my brother rotting alone in a cell. The entire time he was gone, I had no idea how he was being treated. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was still alive.\n\n\n\nOnce I entered the Library and learned about the Foundation, the fearful unknown was replaced with a vivid image of Evan being treated the way Sean was treated as a teenager, the way most humanoid anomalies are treated by the Foundation. Do I really wish I\u2019d found Evan like that?\n\n\n\nI have to, don\u2019t I? Not because I want him to suffer, but because, if he\u2019d been a prisoner, he would have followed me to the Wanderer\u2019s Library. I\u2019d have brought him into the Hand, and my parents would\u2019ve finally learned that their son was still alive.\n\n\n\nA new image flashes in my head. Somewhere, right now, my mom is in tears, believing that she outlived both of her sons. The Jailors surely faked my death just as they did Evan\u2019s, so now my parents think they\u2019ve lost both their children.\n\n\n\nEvan knew they\u2019d do that when he helped the Jailors capture me. Whatever misery she\u2019s suffering now, it\u2019s his fault.\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you been okay since we last saw you?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\nOf course not. No one in containment is okay.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to worry about each other,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere\u2019s no helping that.\u201d\n\n\n\nI close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell them what I\u2019ve been doing. I don\u2019t want to tell them that I\u2019ve also been helping the Jailors. Even though they trained me not to. Even though they spent months teaching me to shut down and give our enemies nothing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t lie to them, though. I can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t failed them. That would be yet another betrayal.\n\n\n\nTears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping them, too,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asks. There it is. The anger I deserve. It\u2019s almost comforting, knowing that, at least after this, I won\u2019t be able to disappoint them any further.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been letting them use my powers,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve been putting people in front of me, civilians, victims of mind-control, and I\u2019ve been curing them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Sean asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, and the tidbit of information I used to get the four of us in here. It was about the Fifth Church. I don\u2019t think they could use it against the Hand. Still\u2026 I failed you. You trained me to ignore them, to force my mind out of my body and give them nothing. Instead, I\u2019ve been letting them manipulate and bargain with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey put a victim in front of me, someone who\u2019d been cursed. I tried to do the fire thing. I tried to summon a vivid image to my mind and ignore them like you trained me to, but I only held out for a few minutes before I gave in and cured them of the spell that was torturing them.\u201d\n\n\n\nI expect anger. Judgement. Disappointment. Failing that, I expect some sugarcoating attempt to cheer me up. The last thing I expect is the genuine relief that passes across their faces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was a horrible thing for them to do,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not holding out,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that they can use me to cure people, my brother is free to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but given that he\u2019s a loyal Jailor, it\u2019s probably bad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Sean says, \u201cI hate them too, but, if I had your powers, and if they locked me in a room with someone like that, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. It might\u2019ve even been the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nI look up at him. Is he serious? Could he really have just said that? \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m helping them,\u201d I say. \u201cHow could that be the right thing to do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you doing anything that helps them hurt anyone?\u201d Jack asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot directly,\u201d I admit, after a moment, \u201cbut what I\u2019m doing used to be my brother\u2019s primary job. Now that I\u2019m doing it, he\u2019s free to go do Jailor things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d refused to treat those people,\u201d Mike asks, \u201cwould the Jailors have used Evan to cure them, or would he be off doing whatever he\u2019s doing, leaving them untreated?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt takes me a moment to process the significance of this question. \u201cThe latter,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Evan said.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I think you made the right choice,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThose people don\u2019t deserve to languish in a containment cell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least you got the Jailors to let someone go,\u201d Jack adds.\n\n\n\nI stare up at them.\n\n\n\nThe argument they just made, Evan also made it when he tried to recruit me to the Jailors right after he captured me.\n\n\n\n//\u201cI decrease the number of people in Foundation custody. Before I came around, there were hundreds of mental anomalies whose victims had to be kept in containment for the rest of their lives. I\u2019ve cured thousands of people like that, allowing them to be sent back to their families. I\u2019ve freed more people from Foundation containment than the Serpent\u2019s Hand ever will.\u201d//\n\n\n\nAm I really hearing the same argument from Sean?\n\n\n\nI try to keep my shock off my face, but, clearly, I\u2019m failing.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Jack says, \u201call we\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re being forced to make hard choices in here. Try to cut yourself some slack, okay? You\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe best I can?\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 actually think that?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Sean says. The others nod in agreement.\n\n\n\nCould it be that they\u2019re just saying this to cheer me up?\n\n\n\nNo. They wouldn\u2019t lie to me like that. They wouldn\u2019t treat me like a child. If they\u2019re saying my decision is understandable, perhaps even //defensible//, that\u2019s what they honestly believe.\n\n\n\nI want to argue back, to explain why they should be disappointed in me, but I can\u2019t find the words, and after I spend close to a minute trying and trying to think of something to say, I once again cave to temptation, and change the subject. \u201cHow have you guys been?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ve been worse off than me.\n\n\n\nSean was moved to Site-17 almost immediately after his capture, and he\u2019s been in high security containment ever since. All three of them have suffered the same mind-numbing isolation, only they haven\u2019t had interactions with Evan, Dr. Light, my patients, or any other scrap of human contact. They\u2019ve been completely alone for months.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer like that for my failure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou got us out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to you we\u2019re in here. We can never thank you enough for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was the least I could do, after getting you stuck here,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe embarked on this mission together. We got captured together. We got in here together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d still be out if it weren\u2019t for me,\u201d I repeat.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been on your mission, we would\u2019ve been on another,\u201d Sean says. \u201cIt could have gone South, just like this one did. If that had happened, we probably never would have escaped solitary.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy eyes are moist. I shake my head, but, once again, I\u2019m not able to formulate an argument. I did get them out of high security containment, and taking Light\u2019s deal was the only way I could\u2019ve done that. In almost any other situation, that would\u2019ve been impossible.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d I say. \u201cI had to help you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We embarked on this mission together, we failed together, and we\u2019re still together now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe others seem to agree with that, and I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with them.\n\n\n\nThe heavy conversation dies down after that, and we set about just spending time together. We spend some time on the foosball table, and another chunk of time watching TV.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another music video on, by the pop star Jimmy Pheonix. He\u2019s a young singer, around Evan\u2019s age. He exploded onto the scene about half a decade ago and has become one of the most popular musicians in the world.\n\n\n\nHis style could be best described as aggressively inoffensive, one of those pop stars cooked up in a corporate boardroom for maximumly broad appeal. I\u2019m sure people who care deeply about music regard him as absolute trash. For example:\n\n\n\n\u201cGods, do they have to play this?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cEh, I think it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\nThe other two turn to look at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mike says, looking away. \u201cYou can like whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably an actual reason they\u2019re playing this,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why they\u2019d actively want to rot our brains with something mindless.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the four chords.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of his songs use the four chords,\u201d Jack says. \u201cDo you even know which chords the \u2018four chords of pop music\u2019 are?\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter half a minute of embarrassing silence, Mike admits he does not.\n\n\n\nSocialization goes on for two hours. When it\u2019s over, me and my comrades are allowed to exchange goodbyes, then we\u2019re sent back to our cells.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re all still prisoners. They\u2019re still suffering immensely for my failure, but at least I\u2019m lightening their burden. At least they\u2019re with friends, some of the time.\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s pathetic that the bar has sunk so low, but this is the best day I\u2019ve had in months. I can only hope it was for them, too. That\u2019s the least I owe them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Evan**\n\n\n\nCallum tilts his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he admits, \u201cyou have me curious. What\u2019s this epiphany you\u2019ve had?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know who Veronica Hall is?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe magician?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Fifthist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs she? I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s probably a lie, but it\u2019s not an important one right now, so Evan doesn\u2019t allow himself to get distracted by it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI talked to her yesterday,\u201d Evan says. \u201cShe said some very interesting things. She knew about the Galaxy Plaza ritual, and she seemed to think of //you// as the one primarily responsible for its failure.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum raises a brow. \u201cDid she? I will admit that\u2019s a bit interesting. I suppose it could be seen as my fault. The ritual might have worked if I hadn\u2019t had it moved.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he says. For a second, he has to fight down his nerves. He\u2019s about to make a big claim. If he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to make himself look really stupid, which could permanently damage his rapport with Callum.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong, though. His theory makes sense. It explains everything. It explains what all of this has to do with Cassidy Redwood. It explains why Callum chose to meddle with such an important ritual, when he could have easily taken revenge on Evan in another way. It explains how Callum could have been foolish enough to think that a ritual designed to require thousands of sacrifices would still work with only a few dozen.\n\n\n\nOr, rather, it explains that he was never that foolish.\n\n\n\nEvan looks Callum right in the eye. \u201cI think you got the ritual moved to Galaxy Plaza knowing that would cause it to fail,\u201d Evan says. \u201cI think you wanted it to fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Callum is frozen. He\u2019s clearly surprised. But is it the correctness of the claim that has him shocked, or its absurdity?\n\n\n\nThe smile that slowly creeps across Callum\u2019s face does little to resolve this ambiguity. \u201cOh?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHall said something very interesting to me yesterday. //\u2018I told them that what didn\u2019t work for Redwood wouldn\u2019t work for us.\u2019// She meant Cassidy Redwood, the Ortothan who tried and failed to resurrect her god with a blood sacrifice. Redwood left behind extensive notes detailing how she tried to reduce the number of sacrifices her ritual required.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted that you approached your father and asked him to move the ritual to Galaxy Plaza. I always took it for granted that you had enough pull with him to get him to say yes, but that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it? This ritual was the most important thing the church had ever attempted. There\u2019s no way your father would allow its effectiveness to be jeopardized just so you could get revenge against me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it was moved,\u201d Callum observes. \u201cClearly I //did// manage to convince the Church to move it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd in order to do that, you had to pair your proposal with an argument that the ritual would still work. You had to provide some kind of explanation, grounded in thaumaturgic theory, for why such a tiny number of sacrifices would still be enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the giant machine Cassidy Redwood built? There was nothing like that at the Galaxy Plaza.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you altered the details of the plan. You didn\u2019t need to use every trick she did. You just borrowed enough ideas to create a somewhat convincing case that the ritual could be completed with fewer sacrifices. You didn\u2019t even need to admit you got the idea from Redwood. Maybe Hall just made that connection later. Either way, you must have told them something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd how do you know I was lying?\u201d Callum asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I have honestly believed the ritual would work with fewer sacrifices?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. You know magical theory too well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a Fifthist. The same people who tried to take a bus to another solar system, remember?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d been interacting with me for months. Fifthism\u2019s grip on your mind had weakened.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes one more second to push down his nerves. It\u2019s time for the killing blow.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think that weakened grip //just// made you too smart to think the ritual would still work. I think it made you want it to fail. I think, after months of being friends with me, my voice eroding the Starfish\u2019s influence on you, a tiny bit of your conscience showed itself, just enough that you didn\u2019t want to end the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum stares up at Evan for several seconds. Slowly, as if out to milk the tension in the room for as long as he can, he closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cTsk, tsk, Evan. For a second, I really thought you had it all figured out, but then you had to start blabbering about my conscience.\u201d He pauses for a moment, then looks Evan right in the eye. \u201cMy choice to sabotage the ritual had nothing to do with morality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen what did it have to do with?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI realized that I liked the world the way it was.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that different?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it had less than nothing to do with other people\u2019s wellbeing. Before you had me captured, I had money, power, and magic, and I was in a position to lord those things over the masses who lacked them. Most people didn\u2019t even know magic existed. None of them had any way of protecting themselves against my spells. I could do whatever I wanted. I could make them do whatever I wanted.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat makes Evan grimace. Jerry said something similar, a while back, that the Veil helps the world\u2019s monsters by ensuring ordinary people don\u2019t know how to defend themselves against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the appeal of it,\u201d Callum continues. \u201cIn a clueless world, there was nothing stopping me from taking anything I wanted. I wanted a tome of arcane lore? I made someone sell it to me for a pittance. I wanted the hottest girl I knew to date me? She did. Everything I wanted, I got. I had power, and other people didn\u2019t. Do you know enough about Fifthist doctrine to know what\u2019s supposed to happen once the Fifth Church finally wins?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe world turns into a hellscape based on the Starfish\u2019s warped imagination.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd with that newfound power, the Starfish destroys the barrier between desire and reality. All desires become real. //All// desires. Everyone would be able to bend reality to their whim, and if they decided they wanted to bend me, they\u2019d be just as likely to succeed as they\u2019d be to fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum shakes his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy would a wolf want the helpless sheep he fed on to become wolves as well? My family\u2019s money wouldn\u2019t matter. My magic wouldn\u2019t be anything special. Everyone on earth would become my peer, and I don\u2019t want peers. I want the kind of power that can only exist in an ordered world.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan stares at Callum. Somehow, even though Evan\u2019s initial guess was mostly right, Callum still managed to surprise and disappoint him.\n\n\n\nMaybe Evan should have known better. He wants so badly to believe his high-school best friend is buried somewhere deep inside Callum, but maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe that person was only ever a mask, and the real Callum could only have sick, selfish reasons to do anything, even save the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was right about the rest of it, though?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight enough that I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Callum admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I said I moved the ritual to Galaxy Plaza because I wanted revenge against you. I really did hate you for taking so much power away from me. At the same time, with the help of your magic voice, I\u2019d come to recognize that the Church\u2019s ultimate victory would, in its own way, do the same, so I hatched a plan to take care of both problems at once.\n\n\n\n\u201cI got my hands on Cassidy Redwood\u2019s notes. I drafted a similar proposal for our ritual and presented it to my father. I argued that the smaller number of sacrifices would attract less attention. Bullshit, of course. I knew a few dozen sacrifices could never be enough. I knew that the only thing my new ritual would succeed at doing was luring you into danger. I told you something would happen, knowing you\u2019d show up and try to save everyone. I thought you\u2019d run in and get yourself killed, and once you did, everything would be back to the way it was before I met you, with me ruling as crown prince over a town of magicless simpletons.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere it is, then. After six years, the full truth about the Galaxy Plaza disaster, with no loose ends or lingering questions.\n\n\n\nAs cathartic as it is to see it all laid out, Evan needs more than that to save the world again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Church were going to try the same ritual again,\u201d Evan says, \u201cwhat kind of venue would they need?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t insult my intelligence by pretending you\u2019re talking about a hypothetical. You\u2019re here because something happened. Just come out and tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan sighs. On paper, he isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose the situation to Callum. However, Callum\u2019s talking right now because Evan earned a bit of his respect by figuring out what he did six years ago. For Callum to continue talking, Evan needs to keep that respect.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. I admit it. They\u2019re trying again. What kind of venue do they need?\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful to hear. I hope they succeed. I certainly won\u2019t be telling you anything that would help you stop them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe just established that you don\u2019t want the world to end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI //didn\u2019t// want it to end six years ago. My circumstances have changed since then. I no longer have money, power, or freedom. I\u2019m not in a position to lord my magic over anyone. Compared to my life in here, maybe the Fifth Church\u2019s new world would be an upgrade?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir new world would be hell for anyone sane.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of it; there wouldn\u2019t be anyone sane.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan shakes his head. \u201cI would still be sane, as would anyone I chose to interact with.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you think I //don\u2019t// want you to experience eternal torment?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot if I can drag you down with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat finally wipes the smile off Callum\u2019s face.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Evan says, \u201cif the Fifth Church does remake the world, and it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t tell me how to stop it, I will make //sure// you\u2019re perfectly sane until the end of time. I will find you, and I will force you to endure every second of our new eternity just as agonizingly lucid as me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a moment of trepidation, Callum shakes his head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t capable of that kind of vindictiveness. If the world is already beyond saving, you won\u2019t torture me just out of spite.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn most situations, you\u2019d be right,\u201d Evan admits, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting something. Jerry has my powers. He\u2019d also be sane, trapped in an insane world of eternal torment.\u201d Evan looks Callum in the eye. \u201cI swear to you, if that happens to my little brother, and it\u2019s your fault, I will //happily// dedicate the rest of my existence to punishing you.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum meets his gaze for a moment. His smugness falters.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Callum says, through gritted teeth.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow does the ritual work, and how would we stop it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe //Starlight Saga// books have a memetic agent inside of them, similar to the one we put in //Star Signals//,\u201d Callum says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We tested them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou tested whether the books have any effect on your stupid D-Class. Your tests came back negative because the meme doesn\u2019t do anything after it\u2019s first implanted. It just lingers there, waiting to be activated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cActivated?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the ritual is for. It\u2019s all part of a deal we made with an extra-universal entity. A tiny piece of that being\u2019s essence is implanted in everyone who reads those books.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Evan asks. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s read //the Starlight Saga//?\u201d\n\n\n\nWith that, Callum\u2019s smugness returns. \u201cEvery last one. As we speak, our trigger waits, latent, in tens of millions of readers all over the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes a step backwards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce we give the entity the sacrifice we owe it,\u201d Callum continues, \u201cit\u2019ll activate the trigger. All those minds will be ours, and they\u2019ll start remaking the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nTens of millions. Tens of millions of people. The implications are so heavy that it\u2019s hard to stay standing. \u201cTens of millions would start to develop Ojai syndrome?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t \u2018start to\u2019 develop it. They\u2019d become fully affected, instantly, just as if they\u2019d read //Star Signals// cover to cover.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInstantly\u2026\u201d Evan doesn\u2019t want to show Callum\u2019s weakness, but he can\u2019t keep the horror off his face. For that many people to fall fully under the control of the Fifth Church would be the greatest disaster in human history, anomalous or otherwise.\n\n\n\nCallum\u2019s delight is no less obvious than Evan\u2019s fear. \u201cThe problem with //Star Signals// is that it was too slow. We\u2019d barely started to spread the book when you identified it as a threat and started shutting us down, so the Church created a new memetic agent which would activate all at once, after it was already widespread. Once those millions of minds are under the Church\u2019s control, they\u2019ll begin the same ritual the //Star Signals// readers started, and, about two weeks later, the world will be remade.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes a deep breath. Focus. He can\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed. He needs to keep his head in the game. His job is to save the world. That\u2019s all that matters.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can we figure out when and where the sacrifice will take place?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I interfered, the Church was going to do it at some massive nerd convention in California.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy there?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people we sacrifice have to be affected by the memetic agent. Part of the deal. Something about the entity getting to keep their souls. If the Church is planning to try again, they\u2019ll pick somewhere where thousands of //Starlight Saga// readers have gathered.\u201d\n\n\n\nBack at the height of those books\u2019 popularity, any large gathering of sci-fi fans would be full of people who\u2019ve read them. Six years later\u2026 honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be that different. There\u2019d be thousands of events that could potentially qualify, and even if the Foundation identified and stopped one, all that would do is buy a bit of time. So long as that seed is prevalent, the Church can try again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs there any way of purging that memetic seed from people?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\nCallum shrugs. \u201cYou might be able to do it. You\u2019re pretty good at cleaning magic gunk out of people\u2019s brains. Still, given how many people there are to cure, and given that you have no way of identifying them, I don\u2019t like your odds.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan doesn\u2019t like the Foundation\u2019s odds, either.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s people need to have a very, very long talk about this information, and that talk needs to begin as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all my questions for now,\u201d Evan says. \u201cThank you. What you just said might save the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? Threatening to torture someone for all eternity is a good way to get their secrets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cStill, you\u2019ve done a good thing today. Maybe there\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEvan, it\u2019s been five minutes since we went over this. You haven\u2019t dug up some faint echo of my better nature. I don\u2019t have a better nature. I said what I said because you threatened me. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Evan says. \u201cGoodbye, then. Me or another Foundation agent may be back with more questions later. Be candid with them, or else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. Goodbye, and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost enough to goad Evan into taking the last word, but that\u2019d be as much of a victory for Callum as anything. Evan leaves.\n\n\n\nLight is waiting outside. \u201cGood work,\u201d she says, though there isn\u2019t any cheer in her voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Evan says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m arranging an emergency meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\n\nLight\u2019s gaze lingers on him for a moment. He meets it. He does his best to force the worry off of his face.\n\n\n\nShe can probably still see it. After, he can tell she\u2019s doing the same. The truth is, unless everything Callum just said is completely wrong, this is the gravest situation Evan has ever faced. Unless the Foundation does something very clever, very quickly, tens of millions of minds are going to be brought under the Fifth Church\u2019s control.\n\n\n\nOnce that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s hard to imagine how even the Foundation could save the world.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[[i-didn-t-forget-hub|Series Hub]]]**\n\n\n\n[[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster|\u25c0\u25c0 First Entry]]] | [[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall|\u25c0 Previous Entry]]] | [[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent|Next Entry \u25b6]]]\n\n\n\n,,[[[xhawk77x|More by this Author]]],,\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["i-didn-t-forget-hub", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent", "xhawk77x", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "doctor-light", "fifthist", "first-person", "last-hope", "mystery", "resurrection", "serpents-hand", "tale"], "title": "I Didn't Forget Pt 18: Callum Michaels - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-didn-t-forget-pt-18-callum-michaels", "year": 2026}, "icaran-feathers": {"created_at": "2026-01-08T14:05:00", "creator": "Jacob Conwell", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Jacob Conwell", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jacob-conwell", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, tale.

The exhausted executive idly crept across the hardwood floor towards a rarely used armchair by the window. Beyond, the skyline of the city below stretched on through urban darkness. Shades of white, grey, and black intermingled with the sharp angles of contemporary interior design. These generic shapes all passed his glazed eyes without registering. Torres set himself down, sighed, and then looked around to remind himself of his surroundings. Save for an occasional piece of abstract art in the same minimalist hues of the rest of the apartment, the open concept kitchen/dining room/living room was without decor.</p>\n<p>He turned his gaze to the side table beside the chair. Upon it, in a neat pile organized by his PA, was his non-urgent personal mail from the last so many weeks. The technocrat nodded to himself and began to go through them. Torres paused when a hand addressed letter in familiar writing worked its way to the surface. Unlike the rest of the inane print in the pile, the name of the sender refused to abandon his attention.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Alicia Torres</em></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torres gingerly opened the seal and unfolded the letter inside. He found that it too was hand written. The superfluous flowing script brought with it the memories of the slender woman with long brown hair he had grown up with. As he began to read the contents, it took him a moment to remember the specifics of her voice: soft spoken, and typically offering you just enough rope to hang yourself with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Sim\u00f3n,</em></p>\n<p><em>Normally I feel it would be warranted to call someone with bad news. However, your number seems to change each hour. Even then I am relegated to your assistant who promises me to relay the information on to you.

As such, this is the path you have left me to reach you.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am writing to inform you that our mother has passed away. Despite the toll the dementia took on her, in the end pneumonia was what claimed her. We plan to bury her in the family plot beside our grandfather. Perhaps if you get this early enough you can be there for the funeral. I've included the details below. You know how to reach me otherwise.</em></p>\n<p><em>Alicia</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torres stared at the letter in silence. As he glanced at the particulars of his mothers funeral he realized that the occasion had already passed.</p>\n<p>\"Damn you,\" he said under his breath.</p>\n<p>He sighed and collected his thoughts. Torres carefully returned the letter to its envelope, and returned it to the stack on the table beside him. The billionaire swiftly produced a cell phone from his person, and within a minimal number of keystrokes was already awaiting his PA's answer.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Torres?\"</p>\n<p>\"I need you to clear my schedule for a few days,\" he replied, brushing aside the grogginess in the young man's voice who answered.</p>\n<p>There was no more time to lose.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Despite his clothes being well out of date in the typical company he kept, Sim\u00f3n Torres still looked the part of one of the world's movers and shakers as he entered an unassuming cafe in the city he was born. Naturally, his security detail remained nearby, though out of sight. While unlikely to be the case, they remained ever vigilant in case such a display drew the wrong type of attention that Torres so frequently craved. Much to his chagrin, outside of the occasional curious glance, few there seemed to recognize him.</p>\n<p>Torres scanned the modest restaurant, his eyes eventually falling onto a slender middle aged woman. What once where gorgeous locks of long brown hair were now streaked with grey. The lines and creases of over half a century of worry and caregiving decorated her brow and, in his mind, made her look older than he knew she was. Her gaze fell upon him almost the instant he walked in the door. He offered her a small smile. She returned with a frown that dripped with disappointment. This caused the captain of industry to blink. While he was no stranger to dishing out such looks, it was rare he was on the receiving end. Eventually she gestured for him to take the seat across the table.</p>\n<p>\"One tinto, please,\" he said to a passing waitress as he took his seat. \"You look well, Alicia. It's good to see you again. How are your children?\"</p>\n<p>\"My children are grown, Sim\u00f3n,\" she replied curtly.</p>\n<p>Torres paused. The images of his rather mediocre niece and nephew flashed through his mind. Infants unto toddlers unto school children unto teenagers. It was when he couldn't remember seeing them beyond that point he realized how long it had been since he had spoken to them in person.</p>\n<p>\"On to bigger and better things then, I suppose?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"They do alright,\" Alicia replied.</p>\n<p>The waitress from before brought Torres his coffee. He graciously accepted the beverage, taking a small sip of the bitter brew before nodding in satisfaction. Modest as the restaurant was, it knew what it was doing. He savored another sip, and finally reached into the interior pocket of his jacket to produce the letter he had received.</p>\n<p>\"Not even an attempt to call?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Don't act like it would have brought you here any quicker,\" Alicia sighed.</p>\n<p>\"Of course it would have,\" Torres frowned. \"This was monstrous of you. I'm deeply hurt.\"</p>\n<p>Alicia didn't respond. Instead, she silently maintained her gaze upon her brother, wholly unimpressed with him. Torres eventually broke his gaze away, and looked into his coffee before taking another sip.</p>\n<p>\"How did she die?\" he eventually asked.</p>\n<p>\"Scared, and lost in her own mind,\" she quickly replied. \"Crying out for a husband who was dead, and a son who was nowhere to be found in the mansion in which he locked her away.\"</p>\n<p>Torres's cup made a clang as he aggressively set it down. The typical veneer of smugness and superiority melted away, and a scowl of true anger took its place.</p>\n<p>\"How dare you,\" he hissed. \"I ensured she had everything she could have possibly have wanted. The finest house, the finest doctors, the finest caregivers! I ensured you had <em>everything.</em> You couldn't even begin to imagine the mountains I've moved. The enemies I've made. And this is what you do? Bite the hand that feeds you? Who do you think you are?\"</p>\n<p>A small smile crept upon Alicia's face as she conceded with a nod.</p>\n<p>\"You're right, of course,\" she said. \"You helped provide us all with a life of comfort that few can imagine. I was able to quit my job and guide our mother through her failing health. None of that would have been possible without you. I have no choice but to thank you.\"</p>\n<p>The about-face of her words hit Torres like an unexpected slap.</p>\n<p>\"But no matter how much money you throw at a problem,\" she continued, \"you're not above criticism for your methods.\"</p>\n<p>\"And is that why you agreed to meet with me then,\" he asked. \"To criticise my methods?\"</p>\n<p>\"The fanatics you surround yourself with certainly won't,\" she scoffed.</p>\n<p>\"Then by all means,\" Torres gestured toward her. \"The floor is yours.\"</p>\n<p>Alicia offered her brother the same smile he reserved for others when he caught them in a trap.</p>\n<p>\"Very well,\" she said. \"Do you know what the difference between you, our father, and the grandfather you so revere is?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose you're going to tell me.\" An intrigued smirk came to Torres's face.</p>\n<p>\"For all their genius,\" Alicia continued, \"for all their faults, and missteps, <em>they were still there.</em> And that is a thing I don't think you know how to be. Not when you can elevate yourself on some pedestal somewhere.\"</p>\n<p>Torres opened his mouth, a quip already half formed on his tongue. Before the words could leave his mouth, memories of his grandfather came forth. Quiet moments with a man he loved, and who loved him. His mouth slowly closed, and his eyes fell to the floor.</p>\n<p>Alicia chuckled and stood, placing down a few pesos to cover the bill.</p>\n<p>\"I won't stick around for you to admit you were wrong,\" she said softly. \"I know that's another thing you are incapable of.\"</p>\n<p>Torres remained silent. Without another word between the two, his sister took her leave.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Torres family plot was far from the grandest in the cemetery, but it certainly was among the best kept. Simple granite headstones, regularly cleaned of moss and grime by caretakers at the receiving end of Sim\u00f3n Torres's fortune, diligently ensured that. Still, as tech moguls stood there before the mundanity of it all, he couldn't help but feel disappointed. In truth, if he had his way, long ago the monuments to his predecessors would have been replaced with a grand mausoleum. The rest of the family did not share this vision.</p>\n<p>Torres took a knee, and gingerly placed a bouquet of flowers atop the newest addition to the plot. He lingered there for several moments, his out of date but still expensive suit allowed to become dirty for the first time. He slowly traced his finger across the engraving on the headstone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Gabriela Torres</em></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Regardless as to what anyone says,\" he said to himself, \"I did what was needed.

Torres shook his head as he worked it out of his system.</p>\n<p>\"Despite what they think, no one can ask for more,\" he repeated. \"I hope you are in a better place.\"</p>\n<p>His gaze continued to wander until it landed on the headstone of his grandfather. He frowned briefly, then nodded to the aged granite slab.</p>\n<p>\"I know you'd be proud of me.\"</p>\n<p>After several moments of silence, Sim\u00f3n Torres stood and dusted himself off. He turned on the spot and proceeded through the cemetery gates, waiting until he passed the threshold before letting out a final sigh\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026 and then swiftly dialed a number into his cell phone. It rang once before his PA answered.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Torres?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm done here and heading back to the car as we speak,\" said Torres immediately. \"I imagine there are actually important things I missed while I was away?

Starr is driving a beaten Toyota Rav-4 down Interstate Ninety-Five at One Hundred Twelve Miles per hour because he knows that he cannot crash. He stopped looking at the speedometer fifteen minutes ago. He stopped looking at the gas meter two states ago.</p>\n<p>He's running. From something: maybe. To something: possibly. But he is running. Not running for his life, but for something so much more than that. He has fucked up, bad. So badly he doesn't even remember what he did, just that it was bad. This he knows for certain, because he has burrowed past every layer of knowing and consciousness within him and he has distilled this one bedrock certainty: he has fucked up <em>bad</em>.</p>\n<p>He has lost something, something of great magnitude and importance that he could not live without and that he now must. He cannot remember what this was, either.</p>\n<p>He keeps going, the car does not give in because it is his steel steed and it will not fail him. He doesn't have a destination in mind, maybe he just wants to keep driving until he finds something. He doesn't know what exactly that would be either.</p>\n<p>He doesn't know a lot of things. But he knows that these highways are long and strange and contain many things that ought not exist.</p>\n<p>And he finds one. It's unremarkable, in the grand scheme of things, but it catches his eye; that alone is notable, he's not paying much attention to things.</p>\n<p>It's a highway sign, green, stained, and noteless, save for its contents. The sign reads:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Jupiter County</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">16 miles to exit 6.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He slams on the breaks, returning to the speed limit, he takes exit six. He's found something that ought not exist. He smiles to himself. He doesn't know a lot of things, but he knows these roads.</p>\n<p>And he's never heard of Jupiter County.</p>\n\n<p>Jupiter County is, in fact, not a county at all. Rather, the name belongs to a small town, right on the Colorado/New Mexico border. It is, in every way, a small town. Rust lies unabated on discarded metal, local farms provide the food, and the desert is very cruel.</p>\n<p>But Jupiter County is not <em>just</em> a small town. Not as he would recognize it, at least. Neon lights pump vast amounts of illumination into the darkness of the night. The buildings, should, by any reasonable construction, be built from brick or EIFS, and some of them are. But others are made from cold, blue, striking steel, their visage like a cool glass of water against the beating neon pink.</p>\n<p>The road approaching the town is in a state of disrepair, he does two hundred dollars worth of damage to his suspension from the first six potholes alone, yet, strangely, this concern evaporates once he crosses the threshold to the town proper; demarcated by a sign glowing just as harshly as the rest of the town. Regardless, the roads within the town proper are spotless. A series of bright yellow LEDs have been established along the double-yellow lines of the road.</p>\n<p>The town itself rests in a valley, and this entrance road, the only road into town, curves gently downward to facilitate this, it sweeps widely and slowly, allowing him to take in the town and its bombardment of contrasting colors. He squints to see the road as his retinas strain against the attack.</p>\n<p>And he spots his mark.</p>\n\n<p>He makes a beeline for the bar, pulling the car off into a barren side alley of concrete. Strangely enough, this alley is starkly clean, there's almost no dust within, and certainly no garbage. A nestled noodle-esque collection of pipes pump water and natural gas and heat into adjoining buildings. He does not see a single other person as he moseys through the town.</p>\n<p>He at last arrives at the bar. He was raised agnostic, he does not believe in the pearly gates, but that blue and orange 'open' sign shines like sweet-fucking-salvation.</p>\n<p>Of course, his reason for being here is; and must officially be: to get to the bottom of this town that ought not exist and to figure out why it does, a bar is a good place to do that. But, truthfully, his main reason is simply that he wants to feel a little less.</p>\n<p>The bar: <strong>'Saturn Tavern'</strong>, is nice enough. It certainly conforms to the theme of the county. Large sweeping arcs of cold blue steel intersected by sharp contours of brick. The interior is homely, or at least attempts to be, Colorado/New-Mexico state paraphernalia decorates the walls and the lighting is orange and warm and decidedly less-neon. But the interior is also as inescapably alien as the rest of this place. A three foot inset in the mid-level of the wall sweeps about a foot back, providing a dugout for a series of coals. These are lit, but they do not burn orange or yellow or even blue, the coals burn purple.</p>\n<p>The bar must be having a bad night, because it is empty. He wonders if maybe it's a holiday or something, that's possible, he's pretty much lost all sense of time after all. But the bar is tended to by a tall man in his forties. He wears a tweed jacket and luxury jeans and has a cockeyed smile that suggests his mouth is used to having a cigarette in it. He introduces himself as Conrad, because that is his name, and they talk.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What brings you to town?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Business.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Bad business?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> No, just business. I work for an organization called the SCP Foundation. We deal with things that are\u2026 off, and I think there's something off about your town.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Huh. Never noticed anything strange myself. I'm pretty sure this is how things are meant to be.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Then how come I've never heard of your town? How come it's not on any maps?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Well, we're pretty new. Founded in only nineteen fifty. What would you like to drink?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Alcohol.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What kind of alcohol?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> The kind with liquor in it.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I'm afraid we don't offer that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What do you have?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Mostly soft drinks.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Can you add liquor to any of them?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'll take a diet coke please.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The drink, when produced, is about what he expects. It tastes much like cola, but slightly old and a tad sawdust-y and flat despite the bubbles. The two men spend quite a few moments in a companionable but vacant silence. It is only when thirty-four percent of the drink remains that Starr resumes conversation.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> So, what is there to see here? What's your claim to fame? Every town has one.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Well, there's the Hall tree, where little Stanley Hall fell thirty feet and didn't break a bone.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Hm, alright, but not really what I'm looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> There's Jones Rock. That's where Sophia Jones claimed a rock and wouldn't let anyone near it, started taking potshots at people with a shotgun.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Was she okay? Was she mentally ill?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Not at all! She just thought the rock was hers. I think it actually may have been, some tax law loophole or something.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Still not really what I'm looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Hmm\u2026 well, there is the portal to Jupiter.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is, in fact, a portal to Jupiter. It's in the town square, where a fountain would traditionally be. It floats about a meter off the ground, and is itself about a meter from bottom to top, forming a rough swirling oval shape. Its edges shine with a neon blue that contrasts with the neon pink of the town. Its center is translucent, he can see right through, he sees virtually endless plumes of gas that whirl by the aperture at terrifying speeds. He swallows. There is a hurricane on Jupiter that is the size of Earth, Seymore S. Starr believes that he is staring out from its eye.</p>\n<p>Surrounding the portal are four waist-high metal barricades, the kind they have at concerts. He almost laughs, he could easily step over them and into the portal, they are a totally insufficient barrier compared to the magnitude of the threat.</p>\n<p>The portal is either-one way or barely permeable, as dust and gas from the storm does not enter out on to the town. He is comforted by this at least. He considers methods of containment, that's still his job, despite his exile. He needs to destroy the portal, he doesn't have the resources to relocate the town and isolate it. He also can't make the people; what little there are here; forget. But they don't seem to mind the portal, if he can destroy it, that would probably be good enough.</p>\n<p>He has no idea how to destroy the portal.</p>\n<p>Conrad, standing beside him, interrupts his thoughts.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Pretty neat, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah it's uh\u2014 it's something.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You gonna 'contain' it?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Oh, we've had plenty of you Foundation types visit. They all say they're gonna contain it, but they never get around to actually doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah, I'll probably try. Quick question, what happens if you stick your head inside?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> It's Jupiter, you'd die.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I can't die.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Then I guess you wouldn't die, but I reckon it'd be quite unpleasant.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Well, nothing I can do about this tonight. I'm quite tired. Anywhere I can stay for the night? A motel or something?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I've got just the place.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Lynn's Inn is, oddly enough, not run by someone called Lynn, but by a person called Midge. He doesn't get their last name, he doesn't really bother to ask, but he does, after several bouts of questions, come to learn that there never was a person called Lynn in Jupiter County. He asks Midge why they named their inn after a person that does not exist, the answer is deceptively simple: 'it rhymed'.</p>\n<p>Midge is a person of few words.</p>\n<p>He bumbles through his pockets; of which he has many; to produce a wallet and extricate a twenty dollar bill. He pays twelve ninety-five for the night, which he thinks is a good deal, though he earnestly has no idea what inflation is like nowadays.</p>\n<p>Just as soon as they take the money and give him his key, Midge disappears into the back, a disappointed expression on their starkly pale face. They spin away from him with fervor; their white satin pants and pastel blue scarf following suit a few seconds later; before they march into the darkness of a backroom.</p>\n<p>He turns, his key secured, and waves goodbye to Conrad, who walks out of sight and back towards his bar.</p>\n<p>Starr embarks to find his room, it's on the second floor, room six. He trudges up stairs covered in red velvet and illuminated by classical lanterns, still, it is not free from neon, the sides of the stairs containing bright yellow strips of light. After the stairs, he takes a right, then another right, and then a left, weaving through snake-like hallways to arrive at his destination, a fine, rich, mahogany door with his name in the middle.</p>\n<p>It's not super extravagant, but it's elegant enough, a small gold plaque with imprinted red text reading '<tt>Seymore S. Starr</tt>'. This does not bother him as much as it ought to. He inserts the key and turns, it unsurprisingly works, swinging open enthusiastically. He steps inside with caution, as though the floor might at any moment abandon its corporeal claim, leaving him to fall to Earth.</p>\n<p>The interior is nice enough, if a bit kitschy, it certainly runs with the desert theme. Sketches of cacti, animal skulls, and cowboy boots decorate the walls, but these are far from the only imagery. There is a photo album, on the table, which he picks up and begins rifling through. He sees vast deserts. He sees canyons carved by bare hands and fervor. Midnight diners who service only the wicked and truck stops disconnected from the road. He laughs, for he saw a great many of these sights before on his drive to this twice-hollow place. He sees a funeral in a godless church. He sees a prayer to nothing.</p>\n<p>He places the collection down and begins his nighttime routine. He hangs up his outer coat, a long gray affair that hangs down to his knees, unbuttons his dress shirt and throws it to the ground, yanks his belt from its loops and hangs it near the overcoat, and pulls off his socks. He left his nightwear in the car, so sleeping in jeans it is.</p>\n<p>He roams over to the sink, turns in onto cold, and clumsily intakes a mouthful of water, he gargles for half a minute before expulsing it down the drain. He takes another mouthful of water to drink. He turns the water to hot and splashes some on his face, which trickles down his oversized nose.</p>\n<p>He cracks his knuckles, switches off the lights, and crawls into the covers after making a quick sweep for; thankfully absent; bedbugs. He symmetrizes his body, takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes. It will be an hour and twelve minutes before he actually falls asleep.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the Saturn Tavern, Conrad is meeting a woman who calls herself Maya Anderson. It's not her real name, everyone knows that, but that's the only one they have for her, so they press on. She's tall, but not extraordinarily tall. She's well dressed, but not extravagantly so. She's talkative, but not loquacious. Except, maybe, for tonight. She has a lot to say tonight, as much as she can while taking the time to draft down a can of Pabst.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Didya hear about the new guy?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Hear about him? I'm the one who first met him! How did you hear about him?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> I heard it from Willem, who heard it from Midge, who heard it from someone else, probably you.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> And what do you make of him?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Well\u2026 he's not a good man, maybe even a bad one. But he thinks he can close the portal, and well\u2026 that'd get him into my good books.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What's your problem with the portal?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> I'm ready to move on, Conrad. To leave this place.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You could. You have a car.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> We both know that's not true.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Your husband?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Yeah. I mean\u2014 it feels like he grows more distant every day.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> It'll be okay.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It won't, but you're sweet for sayin' it.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Thank you for the drink. See you tomorrow?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Of course. I wouldn't miss it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Seymore S. Starr awakens confused. He feels well rested, and yet all of his senses combine to provide the compulsion that it is still the dead of night. He checks his watch: nine fifty two ante-meridian. He checks his windows, there's no sun, and its darker than the blackest pits of hell.</p>\n<p>He can feel his subconscious, at least the edges of it, start to transition into panic. He marshals them back into attention to focus. His first instinct is that some sort of end-of-world scenario has taken place, that he needs to contact the Foundation, that no matter how much they hate him they need him right now, but the more he thinks, the more he's convinced that this couldn't possibly be the case.</p>\n<p>There is no screaming in the streets. There are no people in the streets. This must simply be par for the course for the citizens here. Another idiosyncrasy of Jupiter County.</p>\n<p>He feels his emotions quiet, and begins to recombobulate for the day. He takes a hot four minute and thirty nine second shower, adorns and buttons all of his layers, slips on his shoes; which have no laces as they are slip-ons; and steps outside.</p>\n\n<p>When he finally makes it downstairs, Midge is waiting for him, a bored expression on their face. They give him a half hearted greeting, not caring if he reciprocates, and sigh loudly when he embarks unto an actual conversation.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Good morning!</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Uhh\u2026 yeah. Good morning.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Can I ask you some questions about the weather here?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> I'm in no position to stop you.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Thanks. I guess. So\u2026 has it always been night here?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> As long as I've lived here.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> And how long is that?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> I'm not quite sure anymore. A while at least. You sort of lose your sense of time here.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> So, I guess it's fair to say that more than just the portal is fucked up with this place.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Yeah. More things than you can fathom.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I can fathom quite a lot. Still, I might call in reinforcements, this stuff might be a bit above, well\u2014actually below, my pay grade.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> I don't think the phone lines here have worked in a while.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> That's fine. I'll just drive to the next town over.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Won't work.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Can I ask why not?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> You can't leave.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> You should be.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I mean\u2014 why can't I leave?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Because nobody wants you here.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A church bell rings. It rings violently and absolutely. It rings with the wrath of god. The pitter patter of sinners' feet strikes the dusty roads. Suits and dresses are slid into and pulled tight as the wicked don the finest clothes. It's not Sunday, that was yesterday, and it was the longest Sunday there ever was. It's not Sunday, but the church bell still is ringing. It is ringing with the wrath of god.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> That's me. Got to go!</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Wait! I still don't understand\u2014</p>\n</div>\n<p>He doesn't get to finish the sentence, Midge is already gone.</p>\n\n<p>He slips between two thirty foot mahogany doors to step into the stone cathedral. It is massive, and he is confused; this church, just in terms of raw construction materials, is worth far more than the town itself. Built from granite and gold and azure-esque stones, built spiraling into the sky two hundred and fifty feet with ornate buttresses and carved edifices.</p>\n<p>The cathedral is filled with people. Daylight flows in through the windows. Something is wrong.</p>\n<p>At the center of the church is a coffin. It is open and empty. A pastor stands beside it, orating. A thin line of pale skin is drawn across his neck.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> And in life, and in love, and in death, we shall find\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> Who are you?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'm Seymore.</p>\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> You are not welcome here.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Sorry I\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> Get out!</p>\n</div>\n<p>The townspeople turn to stare at him, the pastor begins to hurl epithets and holy texts. One lands squarely on his skull and he feels blood flow into his mouth. He rushes towards the door and steps outside. He shuts the doors behind him and sits down on the worn granite steps. He spits the blood onto them and grabs his head in his hands, nursing the pain.</p>\n\n<p>Conrad is quick to rush outside, joining him on the stairs. The man places a hand on Starr's shoulder, and wipes the blood off the stairs with his handkerchief.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Sorry about that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah, thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You okay?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Of course. I have a question, though.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Whose funeral was it? Who died?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> No one.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Then what's the point?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I'm sorry, Mr. Starr. I don't think I can tell you that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'm afraid I have to insist.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I'm sorry, Mr. Starr.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Conrad turns and retreats into the church without saying goodbye. Starr remains on the stairs for a while, staring out at the starless night sky, cut into incessantly by neon. A puzzled look comes to rest on his face.</p>\n<p>He sighs, gears turning inside his head, trying either to understand or to remember; even he does not know which. He swallows, and he speaks unto no one.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I know how to contain the anomaly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The general store is called, boringly enough: 'General Store'. It's a small white building, though the white paint has long since started to flake away. A slim gray roof decorates the top providing much needed contrast. A worn table and two chairs mark the porch. An empty ashtray sits on the table.</p>\n<p>Starr walks inside, he is greeted by countless collectables, baseball cards and lollipops and big-league chew. An overused milkshake maker lines the shelves behind the bar and two smudged chalkboards advertise an impossible number of items. Maya Anderson waits absentmindedly behind the counter, barely noting Starr as he enters. He comes to the counter and rests his elbows upon it, getting coffee grounds onto his sleeves for his troubles.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Nice store you've got here.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It's not mine, it's my husband's. I'm just looking after it now.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I see.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> What can I do for you?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I need dynamite.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Does there have to be a reason?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Kind of, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I need it for work.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Is that the truth?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> It's not a lie.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Fine, that'll be thirty six dollars and fourteen cents, American money.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Highway fucking robbery.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Good luck getting it anywhere else.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Fine. And thank you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr pulls out a small leather wallet, producing the money, which has not been neatly folded and instead shoved inside. He forks it over to Anderson, who reaches under the counter and pulls forth a stick of dynamite, plopping it down on the countertop with inappropriate gusto.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Go crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Don't worry, I'll be careful.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> I certainly hope so.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The four metal barricades that once surrounded the portal to Jupiter have been cast aside, they lay in a pile on the edge of the square covered in the dust that they once stood upon. In their stead, vicious dynamite has been deposited, its fuse stares upwards at the portal, hungrily, wanting nothing more on the entire Earth than to explode.</p>\n<p>Seymore S. Starr sits besides the affair, holding a silver lighter in his hands and playing with it, flicking the cap open and closed and open and closed with abandon. He is quite careful to never actually produce a flame. He stares off into space, into the glowing hues of the swirling portal.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> You're barking up the wrong tree.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Maya Anderson approaches him, placing a hand on his shoulder and sitting down nearby. The dust coats her garments, but she doesn't really mind.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Don't do this.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Don't contain it? Is that what you're saying? That's my job.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> You're not containing it. You're destroying it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What does it matter so long as it's gone?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> When the portal first showed up, <em>we</em> weren't happy about it either! Something like that changes everything you know, but you can't just make it go away. I'm not gonna peddle that 'everything happens for a reason' bullshit, but\u2026 if there <em>is</em> a reason, you owe it to yourself to at least try and find it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I just don't know how else to end it. The story, I mean. Am I just supposed to leave? Without resolving anything?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Don't talk about stories, this isn't a fucking book. Your <em>life</em> is a story, Mr. Starr. And that story can be a comedy, and a tragedy, and all of these things at once.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He looks away from her, chartreuse tears erupting from cerulean eyes. He does not remember what he has lost. He cannot remember. His body remembers.</p>\n<p>He shudders with guilt.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What if the story hurts? What if I don\u2019t like it?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It doesn\u2019t matter. You keep telling it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What if I don\u2019t want to?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Who asked what you want?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What was the point of the funeral?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It\u2014 it\u2019s not that easy. I can\u2019t tell you that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Why not?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Just because the story got tough or confusing doesn\u2019t mean you get to leave the fucking theater.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> You didn\u2019t answer my question: what if the story hurts?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Yes, I did.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr flicks open the lighter again, a flame bursts forth.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'd like you to leave now, please.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>With caution, he brings the lighter to the fuse. A spark ignites it, traveling down the length of the wire. He stares at it, before stepping a bit back, following Maya Anderson's retreating footsteps.</p>\n<p>It approaches the dynamite, a glowing orange against the sea of neon pink and cyan. There's a hiss. A massive shine dapples his eyes.</p>\n<p>And it goes.</p>\n<p>The roar is deafening as the air broils and the dust dies. Enormous tongues of flame speak words of ash unto the night. Color is burned from the world. The second wave of smoke crests like a tsunami over the sullen Earth, decrying its darkness, its superiority over even the dark of the lightless stars. Particulate rapturously fills his lungs and he begins to cough and choke, his ears ring in a way they haven't since he was a little boy. The dynamite is detonated. Man's contempt for nature is decreed.</p>\n<p>And dismissed.</p>\n<p>And absolved.</p>\n<p>Cyan light begins to pump through the gaps in the smoke. The portal still stands and still swirls. A prayer to nothing has been made. It has been heard. It has gone unanswered.</p>\n<p>He sighs, though he cannot hear nor feel himself do so. Eventually, the ringing clears. He hears the rapid pitter patter of feet approach. He looks over his dust-and-ash coated shoulder. He sees Conrad's warm and worried face.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Are you okay?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Maya Anderson sent me.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I figured.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> So, why'd you do it?</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr pauses, trying to remember. A trickle of blood flows from his nose. He laps it up with his tongue, and smiles.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Well\u2014</p>\n</div>\n<p>He pauses again. The words take their time to flow to him, but they arrive regardless.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I've seen this all before, or at least things like it. Entropy, darkness, dystrophy. It's\u2014 familiar. I\u2019ve lived a million of your lives. I\u2019ve seen everything there is to see and done everything there is to do. I haven\u2019t been surprised in a hundred and twenty years.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> But I still don\u2019t understand the funeral.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> The people here hate you. If they didn't before they do now.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I know. It doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> All of our hate combined\u2026 it\u2019s not one one thousandth as much as you hate yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> That's not true.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You don\u2019t hate yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I do, but not that much.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I guess I\u2019m trying to understand this place. To read between the lines.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You can try, but there\u2019s just paper.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What was the point of the funeral?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Hm.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I believe you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr stands, swatting at his knees to dust them off. He looks up at the portal with both fear and hope at once.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I know how to contain the anomaly.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He takes a deep breath, squats, locks his knees, and dives head-first into the portal.</p>\n\n<p>Gale force winds strike his body at four hundred miles per hour. Gases more toxic than those of Hell fill his lungs lacerating them from the outside in. Dust older than oceans tears through his skin and fills his veins.</p>\n<p>His consciousness is stolen away from him within the first ten seconds, yet the darkness behind his eyes is as red as the storm. A number of non-essentaial muscles snap, they are joined by a few essential ones.</p>\n<p>He spins and spirals around the portal for a several minutes that would feel like an eternity if he were feeling at all.</p>\n<p>Eventually, he drifts back through the portal.</p>\n\n<p>Seymore S. Starr awakens on the ground beside the portal, which continues to swirl. He is covered in dust and blood and vomit. He has four new scars that he does not remember. One significantly impacts his appearance, which wasn't all that great in the first place. Dried blood sticks in circles around his nose and respective ears. He feels like shit. He has massive hypoxia. Both lungs are collapsed. He should be dead. He cannot die.</p>\n<p>Against a mountain of pain and wickedness, he opens his eyes. Conrad is standing over him, and apologetic look crests the man's face.</p>\n<p>Starr slams into his own ribcage with a powerful fist. Fifteen separate parts break inside of him. He takes a shuttering, painful breath. He exhales, but there is more phlegm inside of him than air.</p>\n<p>He looks towards Conrad, at last ready for conversation.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You made it to the other side. How do you feel?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Good, I think. A little empty.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Yeah. That\u2019s how I feel too.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I saw vast cities, swathed in shadow.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What had happened?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> No one ever remembered to turn on the lights.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> How does that happen?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I saw men who weren\u2019t men, who wore names that weren\u2019t theirs. I understand the funeral. I saw the inside of the coffin.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> And what did you see?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Not a body.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/jupiter-county\">Jupiter County</a>\" by sprawlingstar, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Starr is driving a beaten Toyota Rav-4 down Interstate Ninety-Five at One Hundred Twelve Miles per hour because he knows that he cannot crash. He stopped looking at the speedometer fifteen minutes ago. He stopped looking at the gas meter two states ago.\n\n\n\nHe's running. From something: maybe. To something: possibly. But he is running. Not running for his life, but for something so much more than that. He has fucked up, bad. So badly he doesn't even remember what he did, just that it was bad. This he knows for certain, because he has burrowed past every layer of knowing and consciousness within him and he has distilled this one bedrock certainty: he has fucked up //bad//.\n\n\n\nHe has lost something, something of great magnitude and importance that he could not live without and that he now must. He cannot remember what this was, either.\n\n\n\nHe keeps going, the car does not give in because it is his steel steed and it will not fail him. He doesn't have a destination in mind, maybe he just wants to keep driving until he finds something. He doesn't know what exactly that would be either.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't know a lot of things. But he knows that these highways are long and strange and contain many things that ought not exist.\n\n\n\nAnd he finds one. It's unremarkable, in the grand scheme of things, but it catches his eye; that alone is notable, he's not paying much attention to things.\n\n\n\nIt's a highway sign, green, stained, and noteless, save for its contents. The sign reads:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Jupiter County**\n\n= 16 miles to exit 6.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe slams on the breaks, returning to the speed limit, he takes exit six. He's found something that ought not exist. He smiles to himself. He doesn't know a lot of things, but he knows these roads.\n\n\n\nAnd he's never heard of Jupiter County.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nJupiter County is, in fact, not a county at all. Rather, the name belongs to a small town, right on the Colorado/New Mexico border. It is, in every way, a small town. Rust lies unabated on discarded metal, local farms provide the food, and the desert is very cruel.\n\n\n\nBut Jupiter County is not //just// a small town. Not as he would recognize it, at least. Neon lights pump vast amounts of illumination into the darkness of the night. The buildings, should, by any reasonable construction, be built from brick or EIFS, and some of them are. But others are made from cold, blue, striking steel, their visage like a cool glass of water against the beating neon pink.\n\n\n\nThe road approaching the town is in a state of disrepair, he does two hundred dollars worth of damage to his suspension from the first six potholes alone, yet, strangely, this concern evaporates once he crosses the threshold to the town proper; demarcated by a sign glowing just as harshly as\u00a0\u00a0the rest of the town. Regardless, the roads within the town proper are spotless. A series of bright yellow LEDs have been established along the double-yellow lines of the road.\n\n\n\nThe town itself rests in a valley, and this entrance road, the only road into town, curves gently downward to facilitate this, it sweeps widely and slowly, allowing him to take in the town and its bombardment of contrasting colors. He squints to see the road as his retinas strain against the attack.\n\n\n\nAnd he spots his mark.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nHe makes a beeline for the bar, pulling the car off into a barren side alley of concrete. Strangely enough, this alley is starkly clean, there's almost no dust within, and certainly no garbage. A nestled noodle-esque collection of pipes pump water and natural gas and heat into adjoining buildings. He does not see a single other person as he moseys through the town.\n\n\n\nHe at last arrives at the bar. He was raised agnostic, he does not believe in the pearly gates, but that blue and orange 'open' sign shines like sweet-fucking-salvation.\n\n\n\nOf course, his reason for being here is; and must officially be: to get to the bottom of this town that ought not exist and to figure out why it does, a bar is a good place to do that. But, truthfully, his main reason is simply that he wants to feel a little less.\n\n\n\nThe bar: **'Saturn Tavern'**, is nice enough. It certainly conforms to the theme of the county. Large sweeping arcs of cold blue steel intersected by sharp contours of brick. The interior is homely, or at least attempts to be, Colorado/New-Mexico state paraphernalia decorates the walls and the lighting is orange and warm and decidedly less-neon. But the interior is also as inescapably alien as the rest of this place. A three foot inset in the mid-level of the wall sweeps about a foot back, providing a dugout for a series of coals. These are lit, but they do not burn orange or yellow or even blue, the coals burn purple.\n\n\n\nThe bar must be having a bad night, because it is empty. He wonders if maybe it's a holiday or something, that's possible, he's pretty much lost all sense of time after all. But the bar is tended to by a tall man in his forties. He wears a tweed jacket and luxury jeans and has a cockeyed smile that suggests his mouth is used to having a cigarette in it. He introduces himself as Conrad, because that is his name, and they talk.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** What brings you to town?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Business.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Bad business?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** No, just business. I work for an organization called the SCP Foundation. We deal with things that are... off, and I think there's something off about your town.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Huh. Never noticed anything strange myself. I'm pretty sure this is how things are meant to be.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Then how come I've never heard of your town? How come it's not on any maps?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Well, we're pretty new. Founded in only nineteen fifty. What would you like to drink?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Alcohol.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** What kind of alcohol?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** The kind with liquor in it.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I'm afraid we don't offer that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What do you have?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Mostly soft drinks.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Can you add liquor to any of them?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** No.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'll take a diet coke please.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe drink, when produced, is about what he expects. It tastes much like cola, but slightly old and a tad sawdust-y and flat despite the bubbles. The two men spend quite a few moments in a companionable but vacant silence. It is only when thirty-four percent of the drink remains that Starr resumes conversation.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** So, what is there to see here? What's your claim to fame? Every town has one.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Well, there's the Hall tree, where little Stanley Hall fell thirty feet and didn't break a bone.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Hm, alright, but not really what I'm looking for.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** There's Jones Rock. That's where Sophia Jones claimed a rock and wouldn't let anyone near it, started taking potshots at people with a shotgun.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Was she okay? Was she mentally ill?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Not at all! She just thought the rock was hers. I think it actually may have been, some tax law loophole or something.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Still not really what I'm looking for.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Hmm... well, there is the portal to Jupiter.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nIt is, in fact, a portal to Jupiter. It's in the town square, where a fountain would traditionally be. It floats about a meter off the ground, and is itself about a meter from bottom to top, forming a rough\u00a0\u00a0swirling oval shape. Its edges shine with a neon blue that contrasts with the neon pink of the town. Its center is translucent, he can see right through, he sees virtually endless plumes of gas that whirl by the aperture at terrifying speeds. He swallows. There is a hurricane on Jupiter that is the size of Earth, Seymore S. Starr believes that he is staring out from its eye.\n\n\n\nSurrounding the portal are four waist-high metal barricades, the kind they have at concerts. He almost laughs, he could easily step over them and into the portal, they are a totally insufficient barrier compared to the magnitude of the threat.\n\n\n\nThe portal is either-one way or barely permeable, as dust and gas from the storm does not enter out on to the town. He is comforted by this at least. He considers methods of containment, that's still his job, despite his exile. He needs to destroy the portal, he doesn't have the resources to relocate the town and isolate it. He also can't make the people; what little there are here; forget. But they don't seem to mind the portal, if he can destroy it, that would probably be good enough.\n\n\n\nHe has no idea how to destroy the portal.\n\n\n\nConrad, standing beside him, interrupts his thoughts.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** Pretty neat, huh?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah it's uh-- it's something.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You gonna 'contain' it?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Oh, we've had plenty of you Foundation types visit. They all say they're gonna contain it, but they never get around to actually doing it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah, I'll probably try. Quick question, what happens if you stick your head inside?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** It's Jupiter, you'd die.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I can't die.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Then I guess you wouldn't die, but I reckon it'd be quite unpleasant.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Well, nothing I can do about this tonight. I'm quite tired. Anywhere I can stay for the night? A motel or something?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I've got just the place.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nLynn's Inn is, oddly enough, not run by someone called Lynn, but by a person called Midge. He doesn't get their last name, he doesn't really bother to ask, but he does, after several bouts of questions, come to learn that there never was a person called Lynn in Jupiter County. He asks Midge why they named their inn after a person that does not exist, the answer is deceptively simple: 'it rhymed'.\n\n\n\nMidge is a person of few words.\n\n\n\nHe bumbles through his pockets; of which he has many; to produce a wallet and extricate a twenty dollar bill. He pays twelve ninety-five for the night, which he thinks is a good deal, though he earnestly has no idea what inflation is like nowadays.\n\n\n\nJust as soon as they take the money and give him his key, Midge disappears into the back, a disappointed expression on their starkly pale face. They spin away from him with fervor; their white satin pants and pastel blue scarf following suit a few seconds later; before they march into the darkness of a backroom.\n\n\n\nHe turns, his key secured, and waves goodbye to Conrad, who walks out of sight and back towards his bar.\n\n\n\nStarr embarks to find his room, it's on the second floor, room six. He trudges up stairs covered in red velvet and illuminated by classical lanterns, still, it is not free from neon, the sides of the stairs containing bright yellow strips of light. After the stairs, he takes a right, then another right, and then a left, weaving through snake-like hallways to arrive at his destination, a fine, rich, mahogany door with his name in the middle.\n\n\n\nIt's not super extravagant, but it's elegant enough, a small gold plaque with imprinted red text reading '{{Seymore S. Starr}}'. This does not bother him as much as it ought to. He inserts the key and turns, it unsurprisingly works, swinging open enthusiastically. He steps inside with caution, as though the floor might at any moment abandon its corporeal claim, leaving him to fall to Earth.\n\n\n\nThe interior is nice enough, if a bit kitschy, it certainly runs with the desert theme. Sketches of cacti, animal skulls, and cowboy boots decorate the walls, but these are far from the only imagery. There is a photo album, on the table, which he picks up and begins rifling through. He sees vast deserts. He sees canyons carved by bare hands and fervor. Midnight diners who service only the wicked and truck stops disconnected from the road. He laughs, for he saw a great many of these sights before on his drive to this twice-hollow place. He sees a funeral in a godless church. He sees a prayer to nothing.\n\n\n\nHe places the collection down and begins his nighttime routine. He hangs up his outer coat, a long gray affair that hangs down to his knees, unbuttons his dress shirt and throws it to the ground, yanks his belt from its loops and hangs it near the overcoat, and pulls off his socks. He left his nightwear in the car, so sleeping in jeans it is.\n\n\n\nHe roams over to the sink, turns in onto cold, and clumsily intakes a mouthful of water, he gargles for half a minute before expulsing it down the drain. He takes another mouthful of water to drink. He turns the water to hot and splashes some on his face, which trickles down his oversized nose.\n\n\n\nHe cracks his knuckles, switches off the lights, and crawls into the covers after making a quick sweep for; thankfully absent; bedbugs. He symmetrizes his body, takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes. It will be an hour and twelve minutes before he actually falls asleep.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nInside the Saturn Tavern, Conrad is meeting a woman who calls herself Maya Anderson. It's not her real name, everyone knows that, but that's the only one they have for her, so they press on. She's tall, but not extraordinarily tall. She's well dressed, but not extravagantly so. She's talkative, but not loquacious. Except, maybe, for tonight. She has a lot to say tonight, as much as she can while taking the time to draft down a can of Pabst.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** Didya hear about the new guy?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Hear about him? I'm the one who first met him! How did you hear about him?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** I heard it from Willem, who heard it from Midge, who heard it from someone else, probably you.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** And what do you make of him?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Well... he's not a good man, maybe even a bad one. But he thinks he can close the portal, and well... that'd get him into my good books.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** What's your problem with the portal?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** I'm ready to move on, Conrad. To leave this place.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You could. You have a car.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** We both know that's not true.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Your husband?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Yeah. I mean-- it feels like he grows more distant every day.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** It'll be okay.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It won't, but you're sweet for sayin' it.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Thanks.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Thank you for the drink. See you tomorrow?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Of course. I wouldn't miss it.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nSeymore S. Starr awakens confused. He feels well rested, and yet all of his senses combine to provide the compulsion that it is still the dead of night. He checks his watch: nine fifty two ante-meridian. He checks his windows, there's no sun, and its darker than the blackest pits of hell.\n\n\n\nHe can feel his subconscious, at least the edges of it, start to transition into panic. He marshals them back into attention to focus. His first instinct is that some sort of end-of-world scenario has taken place, that he needs to contact the Foundation, that no matter how much they hate him they need him right now, but the more he thinks, the more he's convinced that this couldn't possibly be the case.\n\n\n\nThere is no screaming in the streets. There are no people in the streets. This must simply be par for the course for the citizens here. Another idiosyncrasy of Jupiter County.\n\n\n\nHe feels his emotions quiet, and begins to recombobulate for the day. He takes a hot four minute and thirty nine second shower, adorns and buttons all of his layers, slips on his shoes; which have no laces as they are slip-ons; and steps outside.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWhen he finally makes it downstairs, Midge is waiting for him, a bored expression on their face. They give him a half hearted greeting, not caring if he reciprocates, and sigh loudly when he embarks unto an actual conversation.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** Good morning!\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Uhh... yeah. Good morning.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Can I ask you some questions about the weather here?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** I'm in no position to stop you.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Thanks. I guess. So... has it always been night here?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** As long as I've lived here.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** And how long is that?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** I'm not quite sure anymore. A while at least. You sort of lose your sense of time here.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** So, I guess it's fair to say that more than just the portal is fucked up with this place.\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Yeah. More things than you can fathom.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I can fathom quite a lot. Still, I might call in reinforcements, this stuff might be a bit above, well--actually below, my pay grade.\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** I don't think the phone lines here have worked in a while.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** That's fine. I'll just drive to the next town over.\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Won't work.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Can I ask why not?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** You can't leave.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'm sorry?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** You should be.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I mean-- why can't I leave?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Because nobody wants you here.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA church bell rings. It rings violently and absolutely. It rings with the wrath of god. The pitter patter of sinners' feet strikes the dusty roads. Suits and dresses are slid into and pulled tight as the wicked don the finest clothes. It's not Sunday, that was yesterday, and it was the longest Sunday there ever was. It's not Sunday, but the church bell still is ringing. It is ringing with the wrath of god.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MIDGE:** That's me. Got to go!\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Wait! I still don't understand--\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe doesn't get to finish the sentence, Midge is already gone.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nHe slips between two thirty foot mahogany doors to step into the stone cathedral. It is massive, and he is confused; this church, just in terms of raw construction materials, is worth far more than the town itself. Built from granite and gold and azure-esque stones, built spiraling into the sky two hundred and fifty feet with ornate buttresses and carved edifices.\n\n\n\nThe cathedral is filled with people. Daylight flows in through the windows. Something is wrong.\n\n\n\nAt the center of the church is a coffin. It is open and empty. A pastor stands beside it, orating. A thin line of pale skin is drawn across his neck.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**PASTOR:** And in life, and in love, and in death, we shall find--\n\n\n\n**PASTOR:** Who are you?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'm Seymore.\n\n\n\n**PASTOR:** You are not welcome here.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Sorry I--\n\n\n\n**PASTOR:** Get out!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe townspeople turn to stare at him, the pastor begins to hurl epithets and holy texts. One lands squarely on his skull and he feels blood flow into his mouth. He rushes towards the door and steps outside. He shuts the doors behind him and sits down on the worn granite steps. He spits the blood onto them and grabs his head in his hands, nursing the pain.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nConrad is quick to rush outside, joining him on the stairs. The man places a hand on Starr's shoulder, and wipes the blood off the stairs with his handkerchief.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** Sorry about that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah, thanks.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You okay?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Of course. I have a question, though.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Shoot.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Whose funeral was it? Who died?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** No one.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Then what's the point?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I'm sorry, Mr. Starr. I don't think I can tell you that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'm afraid I have to insist.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I'm sorry, Mr. Starr.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nConrad turns and retreats into the church without saying goodbye. Starr remains on the stairs for a while, staring out at the starless night sky, cut into incessantly by neon. A puzzled look comes to rest on his face.\n\n\n\nHe sighs, gears turning inside his head, trying either to understand or to remember; even he does not know which. He swallows, and he speaks unto no one.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I know how to contain the anomaly.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe general store is called, boringly enough: 'General Store'. It's a small white building, though the white paint has long since started to flake away. A slim gray roof decorates the top providing much needed contrast. A worn table and two chairs mark the porch. An empty ashtray sits on the table.\n\n\n\nStarr walks inside, he is greeted by countless collectables, baseball cards and lollipops and big-league chew. An overused milkshake maker lines the shelves behind the bar and two smudged chalkboards advertise an impossible number of items. Maya Anderson waits absentmindedly behind the counter, barely noting Starr as he enters. He comes to the counter and rests his elbows upon it, getting coffee grounds onto his sleeves for his troubles.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** Nice store you've got here.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It's not mine, it's my husband's. I'm just looking after it now.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I see.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** What can I do for you?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I need dynamite.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Why?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Does there have to be a reason?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Kind of, yeah.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I need it for work.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Is that the truth?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** It's not a lie.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Fine, that'll be thirty six dollars and fourteen cents, American money.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Highway fucking robbery.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Good luck getting it anywhere else.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Fine. And thank you.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr pulls out a small leather wallet, producing the money, which has not been neatly folded and instead shoved inside. He forks it over to Anderson, who reaches under the counter and pulls forth a stick of dynamite, plopping it down on the countertop with inappropriate gusto.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** Go crazy.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Don't worry, I'll be careful.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** I certainly hope so.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe four metal barricades that once surrounded the portal to Jupiter have been cast aside, they lay in a pile on the edge of the square covered in the dust that they once stood upon. In their stead, vicious dynamite has been deposited, its fuse stares upwards at the portal, hungrily, wanting nothing more on the entire Earth than to explode.\n\n\n\nSeymore S. Starr sits besides the affair, holding a silver lighter in his hands and playing with it, flicking the cap open and closed and open and closed with abandon. He is quite careful to never actually produce a flame. He stares off into space, into the glowing hues of the swirling portal.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** You're barking up the wrong tree.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nMaya Anderson approaches him, placing a hand on his shoulder and sitting down nearby. The dust coats her garments, but she doesn't really mind.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** Don't do this.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Don't contain it? Is that what you're saying? That's my job.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** You're not containing it. You're destroying it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What does it matter so long as it's gone?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** When the portal first showed up, //we// weren't happy about it either! Something like that changes everything you know, but you can't just make it go away. I'm not gonna peddle that 'everything happens for a reason' bullshit, but... if there //is// a reason, you owe it to yourself to at least try and find it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I just don't know how else to end it. The story, I mean. Am I just supposed to leave? Without resolving anything?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Don't talk about stories, this isn't a fucking book. Your //life// is a story, Mr. Starr. And that story can be a comedy, and a tragedy, and all of these things at once.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe looks away from her, chartreuse tears erupting from cerulean eyes. He does not remember what he has lost. He cannot remember. His body remembers.\n\n\n\nHe shudders with guilt.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** What if the story hurts? What if I don\u2019t like it?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It doesn\u2019t matter. You keep telling it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What if I don\u2019t want to?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Who asked what you want?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What was the point of the funeral?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It-- it\u2019s not that easy. I can\u2019t tell you that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Why not?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Just because the story got tough or confusing doesn\u2019t mean you get to leave the fucking theater.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** You didn\u2019t answer my question: what if the story hurts?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Yes, I did.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr flicks open the lighter again, a flame bursts forth.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I'd like you to leave now, please.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWith caution, he brings the lighter to the fuse. A spark ignites it, traveling down the length of the wire. He stares at it, before stepping a bit back, following Maya Anderson's retreating footsteps.\n\n\n\nIt approaches the dynamite, a glowing orange against the sea of neon pink and cyan. There's a hiss. A massive shine dapples his eyes.\n\n\n\nAnd it goes.\n\n\n\nThe roar is deafening as the air broils and the dust dies. Enormous tongues of flame speak words of ash unto the night. Color is burned from the world. The second wave of smoke crests like a tsunami over the sullen Earth, decrying its darkness, its superiority over even the dark of the lightless stars. Particulate rapturously fills his lungs and he begins to cough and choke, his ears ring in a way they haven't since he was a little boy. The dynamite is detonated. Man's contempt for nature is decreed.\n\n\n\nAnd dismissed.\n\n\n\nAnd absolved.\n\n\n\nCyan light begins to pump through the gaps in the smoke. The portal still stands and still swirls. A prayer to nothing has been made. It has been heard. It has gone unanswered.\n\n\n\nHe sighs, though he cannot hear nor feel himself do so. Eventually, the ringing clears. He hears the rapid pitter patter of feet approach. He looks over his dust-and-ash coated shoulder. He sees Conrad's warm and worried face.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** Are you okay?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Maya Anderson sent me.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I figured.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** --\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** So, why'd you do it?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr pauses, trying to remember. A trickle of blood flows from his nose. He laps it up with his tongue, and smiles.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** Well--\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe pauses again. The words take their time to flow to him, but they arrive regardless.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I've seen this all before, or at least things like it. Entropy, darkness, dystrophy. It's-- familiar. I\u2019ve lived a million of your lives. I\u2019ve seen everything there is to see and done everything there is to do. I haven\u2019t been surprised in a hundred and twenty years.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** But I still don\u2019t understand the funeral.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** The people here hate you. If they didn't before they do now.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I know. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** All of our hate combined\u2026 it\u2019s not one one thousandth as much as you hate yourself.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** That's not true.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You don\u2019t hate yourself?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I do, but not that much.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I guess I\u2019m trying to understand this place. To read between the lines.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You can try, but there\u2019s just paper.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What was the point of the funeral?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I don't know.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Hm.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I believe you.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr stands, swatting at his knees to dust them off. He looks up at the portal with both fear and hope at once.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I know how to contain the anomaly.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe takes a deep breath, squats, locks his knees, and dives head-first into the portal.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nGale force winds strike his body at four hundred miles per hour. Gases more toxic than those of Hell fill his lungs lacerating them from the outside in. Dust older than oceans tears through his skin and fills his veins.\n\n\n\nHis consciousness is stolen away from him within the first ten seconds, yet the darkness behind his eyes is as red as the storm. A number of non-essentaial muscles snap, they are joined by a few essential ones.\n\n\n\nHe spins and spirals around the portal for a several minutes that would feel like an eternity if he were feeling at all.\n\n\n\nEventually, he drifts back through the portal.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nSeymore S. Starr awakens on the ground beside the portal, which continues to swirl. He is covered in dust and blood and vomit. He has four new scars that he does not remember. One significantly impacts his appearance, which wasn't all that great in the first place. Dried blood sticks in circles around his nose and respective ears. He feels like shit. He has massive hypoxia. Both lungs are collapsed. He should be dead. He cannot die.\n\n\n\nAgainst a mountain of pain and wickedness, he opens his eyes. Conrad is standing over him, and apologetic look crests the man's face.\n\n\n\nStarr slams into his own ribcage with a powerful fist. Fifteen separate parts break inside of him. He takes a shuttering, painful breath. He exhales, but there is more phlegm inside of him than air.\n\n\n\nHe looks towards Conrad, at last ready for conversation.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** You made it to the other side. How do you feel?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Good, I think. A little empty.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Yeah. That\u2019s how I feel too.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I saw vast cities, swathed in shadow.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** What had happened?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** No one ever remembered to turn on the lights.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** How does that happen?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I don't know.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I saw men who weren\u2019t men, who wore names that weren\u2019t theirs. I understand the funeral. I saw the inside of the coffin.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** And what did you see?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Not a body.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** portal.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/portal.html\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "mystery", "surrealism", "tale"], "title": "Jupiter County - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/jupiter-county", "year": 2026}, "likeitsthefirsttime": {"created_at": "2026-01-04T12:26:00", "creator": "AstersQuill", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T12:26:00"}, {"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, bleak, director-scout, lgbtq, on-guard-43, tale, thilo-zwist.

Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was approximately 5:03am when Wynn Rydderech opened his eyes, as he always did around this time. He was slow on the rise, as he thought he ought to be at this age, his body giving him only as much trouble as he thought it should.</p>\n<p>He waddled awkwardly across the carpeted floor towards the bathroom, imaging how cold the tile threshold might feel, and found that the act of cleaning himself had passed in a blink\u2014 the act of undressing, lathering, rinsing, and dressing was almost as fluid and unmistakably uniform as the water circling the drain as he stepped out of the stall. Even with this, he was still not complete. Although his mind knew what was missing, he found that his hands were much faster at weaving his tie into a Windsor, and feeding the snaking leather belt smoothly through each loop, before buckling the faded brass.</p>\n<p>For all intents and purposes, he still <em>looked</em> good, even in the folds and wrinkles, and how his hair slowly simmered from red to grey ash. He wore a smile, just noticeable, that lingered, for some reason, from before Rydderech could recall.</p>\n<p>And the room around him made this lapse known, as if every edge had muddied into oil on canvas instead of something tangible.</p>\n<p><em>Why am I so happy?</em></p>\n<p>It, of course, was no issue to be happy\u2014 Rydderech could invite all variety of emotion to the forefront if his mind had lingered on it, unconsciously or not. But this happiness carried with it a certain weight to it, not so dissimilar to the one he felt in the core of his chest. It was as if the ghost of some thing, some one, had been standing there next to him, whispering words that were meant to bring about some sort of reaction, if and only if he had the context.</p>\n<p>He allowed this ghost to hold his hand as he walked into a common area, and watched the most striking details pull forth: the stained wood paneling was host to several clusters of melty memorabilia, pinions and frames of unknown contents nailed proudly into the wall like medals on a uniform. These did little to dampen the soft crackling of electric static from the CRT, which cast a dull glow onto a worn sofa, wherein two of the cushions had faded from use. The ghost took its position as Rydderech rotated the dials, watching the sea of black and white sand slowly give way to animated figures. The speaker whined out an anachronistic concerto that bounced off the walls as sonar, revealing much of the space, and bringing his attention towards a slightly ajar door.</p>\n<p>He followed the ghost as it took its leave from the couch. Passing through the vestibule, he regarded the pair of a pair of polished, leather shoes, one size notably smaller than the other, and brushed his shoulder against a matching hat and jacket that might only reach to his forearms.</p>\n<p>And yet, this smaller figure, who might have been the owner, was nowhere to be found. It certainly wasn't his; Rydderech had grown quite content with himself as his body slowed (as he thought it should), and regarded his shortening sleeves and waist with an almost jolly mien. No, the size alone of these garments wasn't the issue, but the fact that he believed they should be there for a reason that was presently escaping him.</p>\n<p>The ghost paid his confusion no mind, and slowed its pace considerably as it moved to a door left slightly ajar. With a thief-like motion, it slipped into the room, disappearing into the space only illuminated by a thin slit of light, revealing the unmistakable mound of a body beneath a quilt. Rydderech was careful as he stepped in, though he was much too large, and stepped too loudly to match the ghost's maneuvers. But the quilted figure did not react. His eyes adjusted to the fuzzy darkness with a blink, and as still-faded tchotchkes made themselves known to him, he felt his smile begin to grow. He almost cursed himself as he sat on the edge of the bed; of course he knew the other person sharing this home with him. Of course he knew the person who slept in another bed as to not be awoken at approximately 5:00am (the time Rydderech always knew himself to wake up at). And, of course, as he carefully leaned towards the head on the pillow, reaching his hand out, that this person was his <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">wife</span>.</p>\n<p>Rydderech's vision pulsed, and he flinched. The once blonde and flowing hair of his <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">wife</span>, that fractaled out from <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">her</span> head was instead replaced with short and grey bristles of a man that was more than familiar to him. As calm and as collected as he could muster, Rydderech rose and slowly backed away from the bed, watching the room around him dissolve. He knew now what was missing, a pit in his chest as something that should have been there, and, for as long as he could remember, had been there, dissipated into static. His hands trembled as he collected his jacket and hat, and as he shut the door behind him, and greeted the monotonous industrial labyrinth before him, he had only one thought in his mind:</p>\n<p><em>Where had Vivian Scout gone?</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span>1908</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>1 February</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/acroamatic-abatement\">Cardiff University</a>: Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Do you think I frightened him off?\" Ryderrech grinned, removing a concertina of worn notebooks from a briefcase. He could hear a chuckle from Vivian Scout, who was working to settle in across the room from him.</p>\n<p>The weight of a small key was a comfortable new addition to Rydderech's pocket. Not too long ago it had belonged to another man, a scholar not unlike the pair of them, but one in the unfortunate position of being paired with Scout during room assignments. Rydderech by no means meant to torture their colleague, at least not in any cruel and unbecoming way, but he was by no means shy about making his presence in their space known.</p>\n<p>\"He must have been intimidated,\" Scout called from the otherside of a wardrobe, \"he was an anxious fellow and, well, you're\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"You think I'm intimidating?\" Rydderech raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"I think you're reminiscent of a brick wall, and your hair doesn't much help your case.\"</p>\n<p>Rydderech circled the wardrobe, and placed his hands on the edge of the desk Scout was unflinchingly focused on.</p>\n<p>\"How flattering. Of all the descriptors you've given me, I think this is the first time you've compared me to structure.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're a very charming brick wall.\" Scout placed a trio of papers filled with chicken scratch atop a jumble of manila envelopes. He turned to face his companion. \"Sturdy. Certainly, more reminiscent of a museum than a factory.\"</p>\n<p>Rydderech crossed his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Well one of us needs to be 'sturdy' enough to lean on, especially since you have a penchant for falling.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"That certainly hasn't been the only time you've fallen for me.\"</p>\n<p>Scout exhaled and shook his head, and stepped forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his companion. He leaned into him, and from the corner of his eye, Rydderech could see he was smiling.</p>\n<p>The pair stood for a moment in silence, sharing an unspoken appreciation for the mess of what could be considered a science lab and abode. Though there was much more work to be done, and though a proper sorting system of their dreams had yet to be established, they had each other, and for the moment, that was enough.</p>\n<p>Rydderech yawned, more akin to a growl, and stretched his sore arms out. The winter sunlight had long since left the pair, and despite the chill, the flicker of lamp lights in the distance was almost reminiscent of fireflies lazily flickering as they hovered. The room was warm, bright, and as long as the pair didn't cause too much trouble (there would always be <em>some</em> amount of trouble to cause), it was home.</p>\n<p>\"Tired?\" Scout queried with a smirk. \"The first day of our collaboration and you're already falling asleep on me?\"</p>\n<p>\"The first day of our collaboration and <em>I</em> moved all the furniture around.\" Rydderech massaged his bicep, kneading the muscle with his thumb. \"Hopefully our beds should be sufficiently far enough away in the event of any accidental spills.\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed, but I do not intend to chance that, at least not tonight.\"</p>\n<p>\"So tomorrow then. Unless you plan on burning the midnight oil.\"</p>\n<p>Scout placed a hand on Rydderech's shoulder. \"Tomorrow indeed.\"</p>\n<p>The pair began to prepare for bed, clumsily dancing through the space, almost careful enough to not bump into the wall, or a stack of books, or each other. Almost. After sufficiently littering the floor with books, and Scout \"accidentally\" being tapped into a wall, the pair stood side-by-side, looking at their bed. <em>Their</em> bed. One of two in the room, though the only one not currently covered in trousers and undershirts.</p>\n<p>\"I can\u2026 sleep in mine, if that would be more comfortable for you\u2014 or the floor. I don't require much.\" Rydderech scratched the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, what I want the most is for you to make a nest in my laundry.\" Scout chuckled and offered a hand to Rydderech. Hand-in-hand, the pair sat on the edge of the bed. \"I will take the outside tonight, and tomorrow night we can switch. Fair?\"</p>\n<p>\"And what of the monsters beneath the bed?\" Rydderech smirked. \"What if I wake up and you're gone?\"</p>\n<p>Scout rolled his eyes and, in an exaggerated manner, panned his head as he looked beneath the bed.</p>\n<p>\"Happy?\"</p>\n<p>\"I would prefer if you checked again.\"</p>\n<p>Scout lightly pushed Rydderech, who laid down and shuffled and scooted to leave as much room as possible for his partner. In a blink, the room was enveloped in darkness, stealing sight, and confusing his other senses. He closed his eyes and tasted a hint of kerosene as he took a deep breath in. Behind him he felt arms try to awkwardly wrap around him, the weight of another person on his back. And he heard, in loving whisper, a promise.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to keep you safe, Wynn. I'm not going to let anything happen to you.\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc5\"><span>1997</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc6\"><span>3 April</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520\">Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>There was a time when Rydderech had regarded the vast expanse of concrete and metal scaffolding and colorful, impossibly extending piping with awe. After all, this was <em>his</em> magnum opus; he had imagined every centimeter, every possible consideration, iterated and reiterated until he could no longer conceive of any holes in his plans. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Had a younger version of him known what he would inherit, what facility he would create, and what work he would be able to do, the current Rydderech would have never been able to stop him, even if he knew the cost. Any other answer would mean that it would not be Wynn Rydderech answering; a Wynn Rydderech not willing to pay the cost wouldn't be Wynn Rydderech at all.</p>\n<p>Both thankfully and not, Rydderech was not here alone, though he alone was here by choice, and would suffer under what that meant. He knew all 43 members of his cohort, in name and story. On some days he would greet them as he roamed through his facility. On some days, he thought they might greet him back. On others, he preferred they pay him no mind. The ambiance of their chatter could take all forms: whispering gossip, boisterous laughter, love and anger. It was through these interactions that Rydderech still believed himself human, for what more were these simulacra than manifestations of his own psyche, manifestations of what it meant to work with other people. The moment these exchanges would no longer be the case was the day he knew he would have to hang up the conceptualization of himself as 'human', but today was not yet that day.</p>\n<p>But Rydderech <em>was</em> hung up on the fact that, unlike the labyrinthine expanse above him, this was his labyrinthine expanse alone, his empire of dirt. At least what would become of Site-43 was built with care and intention. Care that comprised much of the considerations of another man, a man who walked like a ghost next to Rydderech now, who stood so diligently and worrying on guard <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">somewhere else.</span></p>\n<p>Rydderech shivered at the thought; he knew he was being watched down here, he <em>hated</em> the feeling of being watched. He sometimes imagined those above him tracing his every move, the rehearsed monotony of his self-imposed station, a dancing figurine in a show. They were infinitely patient with him, because of course they were, and continued to engage regardless of the role Rydderech had chosen to play that day.</p>\n<p>And what did he provide in return? His usefulness, of course. They would only be willing to extend the amount of grace and resources possible for him to hold onto at least some semblance of a thread of sanity if he had proven himself useful, or at the very least entertaining. In truth, any one of his projects or experiments or bored delusions might lead to the plug being pulled, leaving him alone, as an actor on a dimmed stage, long after anyone could recall what show was being played at all.</p>\n<p>Rydderech chafed at the thought, and how powerless he felt each and every time it was his turn to take the stage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc7\"><span>1911</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc8\"><span>20 October</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #990011\">Vienna</span>: Austria, Austro-Hungarian Empire</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Arm-in-arm, Rydderech carefully led his date out the front of the opera house, stopping just for a moment to take a deep breath of the cold night's air. Outwardly, he and his date were entirely indistinguishable from the patrons filing out; men in tuxedos and polished shoes, women in flowing dresses with fur and pearl and lace. It reminded Rydderech of what a procession of zoo animals might look like, entirely gaudy, a show in itself.</p>\n<p>This wasn't the first time Rydderech had seen such a show, or the opera within. Truthfully, if his talent had been in singing rather than toxicology, he might have been able to don tights and long-out-of-style hats to belt the notes out himself. But he was not here for the show\u2014 it was merely a formality. His date acted with all the poise and elegance a woman should, and he was to respond in kind, with the professional air about him, that projected outwardly to the world that this was a fine and <em>normal</em> partnership for the times. This, too, was merely a formality; there was very little in this world that brought about more suffering than formalities.</p>\n<p>But like most formalities, the pressure to conform to them was ever-present; many, including his own family, were beginning to wonder why the scholar was without a wife. Offhanded excuses were enough to keep the gossip away temporarily\u2014 scheduling issues, the risk of dying (or worse) within his field, possible contamination\u2014 these were largely understood. He wanted to state that he was simply unlucky when it came to love, but that cut both ways; Rydderech <em>was</em> unlucky, but not because he lacked the charisma or looks (because he certainly had both), but because the person he loved was an ocean and continent away.</p>\n<p>During particularly troubling times, when nothing seemed to be going right, Rydderech could at least rely on the familiar typing of his scholarly companion to bring him some comfort, or at least as much comfort could be found in the anomalous abstract the pair were mired in. Within Rydderech, however, there was a doubt. A doubt that one day the letters might cease, that some awful fate might befall his Vivian Scout, or worst of all, the understanding that what they had was merely a passing of seasons.</p>\n<p>He felt a soft tap on his shoulder, and understood that he had been lost in thought along the avenues, missing his apartment by around two blocks, thinking, wishing that someone else was here instead. Rydderech gave her a smile and a nod, before crossing the street, once more on the correct path.</p>\n<p>She was, to put it plainly, pleasant. She was quick-witted, knowledgeable on all manner of topics, but also loved to keep to herself. She was, in an objective sense, attractive, and in another life, Rydderech might have been attracted <em>to</em> her. But very simply, he wasn't, and that she could understand as well. However, this arrangement worked because both parties knew only to ask the questions necessary for their relationship to survive. They spoke often, ate together, and were outwardly the model of a healthy couple. He had met her family, and even helped one of her brothers out while in a particular jam with the university. But secrecy was baked in the moment conversations turned to one of work, and that vulnerability, or lack thereof, carried itself through all aspects of their relationship.</p>\n<p>In another life, she might have been perfect for someone not named Wynn Rydderech. In this one, she sufficed, though the thought was laden with its own level of guilt in the few moments Rydderech had to interrogate what that meant.</p>\n\n<p>Rydderech imagined Vivian Scout standing just in the background of the mirror, grinning and ready to engage Wynn in a bout of friendly banter.</p>\n<p>Vivian often helped him prepare for events, in his own way. The recognition of a missed detail was often delivered with joke or snark, and the pair would work to resolve the detail at the same level of conversation. After a particularly dry formal event season brought about by renovations, Vivian very bluntly suggested that Wynn purchase a new suit because the strain on the fabric of his old reliable was \"presently attempting to escape him.\"</p>\n<p>Yet strangely he worried very little about such matters now. Outside of the occasional tear or fade, wrinkles and creases were easily smoothed out with simply the brush of his hand, though that failed to translate to much else.</p>\n<p>Rydderech summed it up to fatigue, however. A simple trick of tired eyes to make him seem more put together than he was. He changed into something much more comfortable, and regarded the stack of papers on his desk next to a typewriter nesting a half-written response. There was much to discuss, and Rydderech let the snapping of keys, and the flowing story of his work, his life, and what could be shown of his love, carry him to sleep.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc9\"><span>1964</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc10\"><span>31 March</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Provisional Site-43</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Dominion of Canada</strong></span><br/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Once more Wynn Rydderech found himself crouched over a typewriter deep into the night, trying to trade the ever-decreasing store of time for one final explanation of what was becoming of him.</p>\n<p>Scout would have been long asleep by now. He was worn down by the day-to-day minutiae of what it meant to run such a burgeoning facility, but even then, even though he too had mingled with the weird most his life, Scout's age had certainly kept up with him. Much unlike Rydderech.</p>\n<p>These sorts of fadings were never fast, they <em>never</em> are. They move along vast stretches like ants, erode away great mountains like rain drops off leaves, and by the end, everyone finds themselves looking back at all they thought they had left. If they're even able to at all.</p>\n<p>Rydderech, unknowingly, and for a while unnoticingly, was the point of equilibrium about which his life moved. For every stone cast by the world, for every natural failure that was meant to give way, for even as he looked death itself in the eyes, he was unmarred. He used to be fit, healthy, tried to lead a good life, and for this he was rewarded with a rounder figure and moderately aching joints. He was lucky, and for this, his luck was destined to run out.</p>\n<p>There was a stack of missives in the bin adjacent to his desk, perfectly arranged font with red cross-outs and the faded marks of coffee or tears. Some of them were crumpled, or torn with the agony of a silent yell, some semblance of release; like if a tree fell in a forest, the final act of it all, never seen and only discovered once it was too late for anything to be done of it.</p>\n<p>Rydderech balled his fists and squeezed, before letting the tension go with an exhale. He looked at the blank document before him, and imagined all the possible variations of what it might say. What would be the most impactful? What would be best to remember him by? Would he write something long, a true testament to the lifetime and then some they'd spent both together and apart? How would one ever capture such depth.</p>\n<p>And as the words spun around in his mind, Rydderech, begrudgingly, noticed that someone <em>else</em> had come to mind: Thilo Zwist.</p>\n<p>Jealousy wasn't necessarily the best way to describe Wynn's thoughts towards the Austrian, but in this one, specific case, it might as well have been. Who else on this planet would be able to capture in words exactly what Rydderech was feeling, what he was trying to get across, but the wizard who had lived for generations. And most annoyingly, the wizard who <em>almost</em> captured as much attention in their relationship. Never more than Rydderech, not necessarily even as close, but the chase, the web of words\u2014 there was certainly something there.</p>\n<p><em>What else is there?</em></p>\n<p>And in that thought, Rydderech found his answer, and began typing.</p>\n<p>Rydderech had written crates worth of letters in his life, maybe even enough to mourn the tree and the roots that could have grown in a forest, that instead gave itself to deliver so much more than words over distance and time. In itself, each of those letters formed the mosaic of Wynn Rydderech, gave themselves to be a snapshot of the ever-changing idea of what it meant to be a person. Love and labor, trial and triumph, the extending hand that provided the temporary, reassuring comfort of another.</p>\n<p>All-in-all he knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the contents of this letter may be the last time Rydderech spoke to Vivian Scout, his partner, lover, and husband, as himself.</p>\n<p>So, he thought he might write Scout a letter of what that meant. Write him a letter of who Wynn Rydderech was, and say what Wynn Rydderech would have hoped to say a thousand times more if he had the chance.</p>\n<p>He wanted Vivian to do what he had always done, and to reaffirm every single promise they had made over the years.</p>\n<p>He needed Vivian to continue the good work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc11\"><span>1997</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc12\"><span>4 April</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520\">Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>What Rydderech thought should be his workshop took shape around him. The ground padded each and every footstep, and when he reached for papers on the nearby table (as only one appeared) he always had in his hand <em>exactly</em> what he was looking for (if he could even recognize what that was in the first place). If the man were any more dark and brooding, he would have likened it to a villain's evil lair, but it was more akin to a safety net, somewhere that someone much more outwardly affable plotted to save the world.</p>\n<p>He was doing the good work, after all. What more could be done than that?</p>\n<p>He let his mind run wild with ideas, many of which would have caught him the concerned look of ethics boards and meek assistants <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">topside</span>\u2014 he didn't doubt that was happening, of course, he knew it would be. But that was the wonder of his station now: the body, the mind, the space around him, all of them contained innumerable pieces of a cosmic toolbox. He imagined every atom, every molecule, and how the electric rhythm of the world coursed through them\u2014 he was the composer now, a thought that was both infinitely frightening and left him laughing to the end of each and every day.</p>\n<p>But in this place of great triumph, he knew his only anchor to his past life was ever-present, ever-waiting for correspondence, should he deem himself ready for it. His respite for loneliness was there in the moments he needed a connection unlike anything he could create down here. With the universe in his hand and only his imagination as the limit, Wynn Rydderech could never hope to recreate even a fraction of the love he knew existed, but was once more alienated from.</p>\n<p>The ghost floated beside him. Even it was not tangible enough to feel, nor to lift the curling corners of schematics that would revolutionize everything, if only it was possible to build them. It stopped, and shrunk itself over one such schematic that Rydderech didn't have to see to know (or rather, what it became in a sea of lined paper). After all, he had designed it himself. It was meant to be his Damocles, his deliverance from this torment, and something he both dreamed and cowered from.</p>\n<p>Vivian too knew what it meant, and what Wynn needed him to do, should the time come. He was sure Vivian would remember their promise, he knew it. The man who had always tried to keep him safe would not fail.</p>\n<p>And he knew that man was waiting for him at the other end of a printer, trying his very best to not let the worry show on his face if others were around. The Site Director had to keep his cool and level head, lest someone underestimate him, as few had learned the consequences of before.</p>\n<p>With a wave of his hand, a keyboard appeared, and his fingers began their march across the plastic as if they already knew their orders. The ghost lingered nearby, steadily watching.</p>\n<p><em>I thought I saw the sun not too long ago. Who knew the caverns down here could get so bright.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; Rydderech wouldn't be surprised if Vivian had moved the entire assembly closer to their dormitory, just to keep on top of any communications that would come through.</p>\n<p>The ghost circled Rydderech, but did not regard him.</p>\n<p><em>The panthers bring \"shiny things\" with them sometimes. Maybe it's something you might think about looking into.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; someone would tell the Site Director right away about his transmissions. Vivian would excuse himself from any meeting, even with the Overseers, should the need arise. He was simply just running late.</p>\n<p>The ghost began moving away from Rydderech, turning its back to him as it floated towards the door.</p>\n<p><em>I think I would like to see the sun again one day, Vivian, at least before mine sets.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. And waited. And waited. And what felt like seconds turned to minutes. And what felt like minutes turned to hours, then years, then weeks. And the ghost floated through the door to some other place far from a place like this one. And Wynn Rydderech was left alone.</p>\n<p><em>Vivian?</em></p>\n<p>And the screen before him slowly hummed to life. For a moment, Rydderech felt a twinge of hope in his heart, and leaned forward in his \"chair\" in anticipation. Then the electricity went out, and the space around him went dark, and he realized that it might have been better not to have read the message at all.</p>\n<div class=\"danke site\">\n<p>Dr. Rydderech, it's <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">Deputy Chief Nancy Briggs</span>.

He was slow on the rise, as he thought he ought to be at this age, his body giving him only as much trouble as he thought it should.\n\n\n\nHe waddled awkwardly across the carpeted floor towards the bathroom, imaging how cold the tile threshold might feel, and found that the act of cleaning himself had passed in a blink\u2014 the act of undressing, lathering, rinsing, and dressing was almost as fluid and unmistakably uniform as the water circling the drain as he stepped out of the stall.\u00a0\u00a0Even with this, he was still not complete. Although his mind knew what was missing, he found that his hands were much faster at weaving his tie into a Windsor, and feeding the snaking leather belt smoothly through each loop, before buckling the faded brass.\n\n\n\nFor all intents and purposes, he still //looked// good, even in the folds and wrinkles, and how his hair slowly simmered from red to grey ash. He wore a smile, just noticeable, that lingered, for some reason, from before Rydderech could recall.\n\n\n\nAnd the room around him made this lapse known, as if every edge had muddied into oil on canvas instead of something tangible.\n\n\n\n//Why am I so happy?//\n\n\n\nIt, of course, was no issue to be happy\u2014 Rydderech could invite all variety of emotion to the forefront if his mind had lingered on it, unconsciously or not. But this happiness carried with it a certain weight to it, not so dissimilar to the one he felt in the core of his chest. It was as if the ghost of some thing, some one, had been standing there next to him, whispering words that were meant to bring about some sort of reaction, if and only if he had the context.\n\n\n\nHe allowed this ghost to hold his hand as he walked into a common area, and watched the most striking details pull forth: the stained wood paneling was host to several clusters of melty memorabilia, pinions and frames of unknown contents nailed proudly into the wall like medals on a uniform. These did little to dampen the soft crackling of electric static from the CRT, which cast a dull glow onto a worn sofa, wherein two of the cushions had faded from use. The ghost took its position as Rydderech rotated the dials, watching the sea of black and white sand slowly give way to animated figures. The speaker whined out an anachronistic concerto that bounced off the walls as sonar, revealing much of the space, and bringing his attention towards a slightly ajar door.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe followed the ghost as it took its leave from the couch. Passing through the vestibule, he regarded the pair of a pair of polished, leather shoes, one size notably smaller than the other, and brushed his shoulder against a matching hat and jacket that might only reach to his forearms.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, this smaller figure, who might have been the owner, was nowhere to be found. It certainly wasn't his; Rydderech had grown quite content with himself as his body slowed (as he thought it should), and regarded his shortening sleeves and waist with an almost jolly mien. No, the size alone of these garments wasn't the issue, but the fact that he believed they should be there for a reason that was presently escaping him.\n\n\n\nThe ghost paid his confusion no mind, and slowed its pace considerably as it moved to a door left slightly ajar. With a thief-like motion, it slipped into the room, disappearing into the space only illuminated by a thin slit of light, revealing the unmistakable mound of a body beneath a quilt. Rydderech was careful as he stepped in, though he was much too large, and stepped too loudly to match the ghost's maneuvers. But the quilted figure did not react. His eyes adjusted to the fuzzy darkness with a blink, and as still-faded tchotchkes made themselves known to him, he felt his smile begin to grow. He almost cursed himself as he sat on the edge of the bed; of course he knew the other person sharing this home with him. Of course he knew the person who slept in another bed as to not be awoken at approximately 5:00am (the time Rydderech always knew himself to wake up at). And, of course, as he carefully leaned towards the head on the pillow, reaching his hand out, that this person was his [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]wife[[/span]].\n\n\n\nRydderech's vision pulsed, and he flinched. The once blonde and flowing hair of his [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]wife[[/span]], that fractaled out from [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]her[[/span]] head was instead replaced with short and grey bristles of a man that was more than familiar to him. As calm and as collected as he could muster, Rydderech rose and slowly backed away from the bed, watching the room around him dissolve. He knew now what was missing, a pit in his chest as something that should have been there, and, for as long as he could remember, had been there, dissipated into static. His hands trembled as he collected his jacket and hat, and as he shut the door behind him, and greeted the monotonous industrial labyrinth before him, he had only one thought in his mind:\n\n\n\n//Where had Vivian Scout gone?//\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1908\n\n++ 1 February\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/acroamatic-abatement Cardiff University]: Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"Do you think I frightened him off?\" Ryderrech grinned, removing a concertina of worn notebooks from a briefcase. He could hear a chuckle from Vivian Scout, who was working to settle in across the room from him.\n\n\n\nThe weight of a small key was a comfortable new addition to Rydderech's pocket. Not too long ago it had belonged to another man, a scholar not unlike the pair of them, but one in the unfortunate position of being paired with Scout during room assignments. Rydderech by no means meant to torture their colleague, at least not in any cruel and unbecoming way, but he was by no means shy about making his presence in their space known.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"He must have been intimidated,\" Scout called from the otherside of a wardrobe, \"he was an anxious fellow and, well, you're\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"You think I'm intimidating?\" Rydderech raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"I think you're reminiscent of a brick wall, and your hair doesn't much help your case.\"\n\n\n\nRydderech circled the wardrobe, and placed his hands on the edge of the desk Scout was unflinchingly focused on.\n\n\n\n\"How flattering. Of all the descriptors you've given me, I think this is the first time you've compared me to structure.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're a very charming brick wall.\" Scout placed a trio of papers filled with chicken scratch atop a jumble of manila envelopes. He turned to face his companion. \"Sturdy. Certainly, more reminiscent of a museum than a factory.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRydderech crossed his arms.\n\n\n\n\"Well one of us needs to be 'sturdy' enough to lean on, especially since you have a penchant for falling.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"\n\n\n\n\"That certainly hasn't been the only time you've fallen for me.\"\n\n\n\nScout exhaled and shook his head, and stepped forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his companion. He leaned into him, and from the corner of his eye, Rydderech could see he was smiling.\n\n\n\nThe pair stood for a moment in silence, sharing an unspoken appreciation for the mess of what could be considered a science lab and abode. Though there was much more work to be done, and though a proper sorting system of their dreams had yet to be established, they had each other, and for the moment, that was enough.\n\n\n\nRydderech yawned, more akin to a growl, and stretched his sore arms out. The winter sunlight had long since left the pair, and despite the chill, the flicker of lamp lights in the distance was almost reminiscent of fireflies lazily flickering as they hovered. The room was warm, bright, and as long as the pair didn't cause too much trouble (there would always be //some// amount of trouble to cause), it was home.\n\n\n\n\"Tired?\" Scout queried with a smirk. \"The first day of our collaboration and you're already falling asleep on me?\"\n\n\n\n\"The first day of our collaboration and //I// moved all the furniture around.\" Rydderech massaged his bicep, kneading the muscle with his thumb. \"Hopefully our beds should be sufficiently far enough away in the event of any accidental spills.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, but I do not intend to chance that, at least not tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\"So tomorrow then. Unless you plan on burning the midnight oil.\"\n\n\n\nScout placed a hand on Rydderech's shoulder. \"Tomorrow indeed.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair began to prepare for bed, clumsily dancing through the space, almost careful enough to not bump into the wall, or a stack of books, or each other. Almost. After sufficiently littering the floor with books, and Scout \"accidentally\" being tapped into a wall, the pair stood side-by-side, looking at their bed. //Their// bed. One of two in the room, though the only one not currently covered in trousers and undershirts.\n\n\n\n\"I can\u2026 sleep in mine, if that would be more comfortable for you\u2014 or the floor. I don't require much.\" Rydderech scratched the back of his neck.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, what I want the most is for you to make a nest in my laundry.\" Scout chuckled and offered a hand to Rydderech. Hand-in-hand, the pair sat on the edge of the bed. \"I will take the outside tonight, and tomorrow night we can switch. Fair?\"\n\n\n\n\"And what of the monsters beneath the bed?\" Rydderech smirked. \"What if I wake up and you're gone?\"\n\n\n\nScout rolled his eyes and, in an exaggerated manner, panned his head as he looked beneath the bed.\n\n\n\n\"Happy?\"\n\n\n\n\"I would prefer if you checked again.\"\n\n\n\nScout lightly pushed Rydderech, who laid down and shuffled and scooted to leave as much room as possible for his partner. In a blink, the room was enveloped in darkness, stealing sight, and confusing his other senses. He closed his eyes and tasted a hint of kerosene as he took a deep breath in. Behind him he felt arms try to awkwardly wrap around him, the weight of another person on his back. And he heard, in loving whisper, a promise.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to keep you safe, Wynn. I'm not going to let anything happen to you.\"\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1997\n\n++ 3 April\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThere was a time when Rydderech had regarded the vast expanse of concrete and metal scaffolding and colorful, impossibly extending piping with awe. After all, this was //his// magnum opus; he had imagined every centimeter, every possible consideration, iterated and reiterated until he could no longer conceive of any holes in his plans. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Had a younger version of him known what he would inherit, what facility he would create, and what work he would be able to do, the current Rydderech would have never been able to stop him, even if he knew the cost. Any other answer would mean that it would not be Wynn Rydderech answering; a Wynn Rydderech not willing to pay the cost wouldn't be Wynn Rydderech at all.\n\n\n\nBoth thankfully and not, Rydderech was not here alone, though he alone was here by choice, and would suffer under what that meant. He knew all 43 members of his cohort, in name and story. On some days he would greet them as he roamed through his facility. On some days, he thought they might greet him back. On others, he preferred they pay him no mind. The ambiance of their chatter could take all forms: whispering gossip, boisterous laughter, love and anger. It was through these interactions that Rydderech still believed himself human, for what more were these simulacra than manifestations of his own psyche, manifestations of what it meant to work with other people. The moment these exchanges would no longer be the case was the day he knew he would have to hang up the conceptualization of himself as 'human', but today was not yet that day.\n\n\n\nBut Rydderech //was// hung up on the fact that, unlike the labyrinthine expanse above him, this was his labyrinthine expanse alone, his empire of dirt. At least what would become of Site-43 was built with care and intention. Care that comprised much of the considerations of another man, a man who walked like a ghost next to Rydderech now, who stood so diligently and worrying on guard [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]somewhere else.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nRydderech shivered at the thought; he knew he was being watched down here, he //hated// the feeling of being watched. He sometimes imagined those above him tracing his every move, the rehearsed monotony of his self-imposed station, a dancing figurine in a show. They were infinitely patient with him, because of course they were, and continued to engage regardless of the role Rydderech had chosen to play that day.\n\n\n\nAnd what did he provide in return? His usefulness, of course. They would only be willing to extend the amount of grace and resources possible for him to hold onto at least some semblance of a thread of sanity if he had proven himself useful, or at the very least entertaining. In truth, any one of his projects or experiments or bored delusions might lead to the plug being pulled, leaving him alone, as an actor on a dimmed stage, long after anyone could recall what show was being played at all.\n\n\n\nRydderech chafed at the thought, and how powerless he felt each and every time it was his turn to take the stage.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1911\n\n++ 20 October\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**##990011|Vienna##: Austria, Austro-Hungarian Empire**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nArm-in-arm, Rydderech carefully led his date out the front of the opera house, stopping just for a moment to take a deep breath of the cold night's air. Outwardly, he and his date were entirely indistinguishable from the patrons filing out; men in tuxedos and polished shoes, women in flowing dresses with fur and pearl and lace. It reminded Rydderech of what a procession of zoo animals might look like, entirely gaudy, a show in itself.\n\n\n\nThis wasn't the first time Rydderech had seen such a show, or the opera within. Truthfully, if his talent had been in singing rather than toxicology, he might have been able to don tights and long-out-of-style hats to belt the notes out himself. But he was not here for the show\u2014 it was merely a formality. His date acted with all the poise and elegance a woman should, and he was to respond in kind, with the professional air about him, that projected outwardly to the world that this was a fine and //normal// partnership for the times. This, too, was merely a formality; there was very little in this world that brought about more suffering than formalities.\n\n\n\nBut like most formalities, the pressure to conform to them was ever-present; many, including his own family, were beginning to wonder why the scholar was without a wife. Offhanded excuses were enough to keep the gossip away temporarily\u2014 scheduling issues, the risk of dying (or worse) within his field, possible contamination\u2014 these were largely understood. He wanted to state that he was simply unlucky when it came to love, but that cut both ways; Rydderech //was// unlucky, but not because he lacked the charisma or looks (because he certainly had both), but because the person he loved was an ocean and continent away.\n\n\n\nDuring particularly troubling times, when nothing seemed to be going right, Rydderech could at least rely on the familiar typing of his scholarly companion to bring him some comfort, or at least as much comfort could be found in the anomalous abstract the pair were mired in. Within Rydderech, however, there was a doubt. A doubt that one day the letters might cease, that some awful fate might befall his Vivian Scout, or worst of all, the understanding that what they had was merely a passing of seasons.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe felt a soft tap on his shoulder, and understood that he had been lost in thought along the avenues, missing his apartment by around two blocks, thinking, wishing that someone else was here instead. Rydderech gave her a smile and a nod, before crossing the street, once more on the correct path.\n\n\n\nShe was, to put it plainly, pleasant. She was quick-witted, knowledgeable on all manner of topics, but also loved to keep to herself. She was, in an objective sense, attractive, and in another life, Rydderech might have been attracted //to// her. But very simply, he wasn't, and that she could understand as well. However, this arrangement worked because both parties knew only to ask the questions necessary for their relationship to survive. They spoke often, ate together, and were outwardly the model of a healthy couple. He had met her family, and even helped one of her brothers out while in a particular jam with the university. But secrecy was baked in the moment conversations turned to one of work, and that vulnerability, or lack thereof, carried itself through all aspects of their relationship.\n\n\n\nIn another life, she might have been perfect for someone not named Wynn Rydderech. In this one, she sufficed, though the thought was laden with its own level of guilt in the few moments Rydderech had to interrogate what that meant.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nRydderech imagined Vivian Scout standing just in the background of the mirror, grinning and ready to engage Wynn in a bout of friendly banter.\n\n\n\nVivian often helped him prepare for events, in his own way. The recognition of a missed detail was often delivered with joke or snark, and the pair would work to resolve the detail at the same level of conversation. After a particularly dry formal event season brought about by renovations, Vivian very bluntly suggested that Wynn purchase a new suit because the strain on the fabric of his old reliable was \"presently attempting to escape him.\"\n\n\n\nYet strangely he worried very little about such matters now. Outside of the occasional tear or fade, wrinkles and creases were easily smoothed out with simply the brush of his hand, though that failed to translate to much else.\n\n\n\nRydderech summed it up to fatigue, however. A simple trick of tired eyes to make him seem more put together than he was. He changed into something much more comfortable, and regarded the stack of papers on his desk next to a typewriter nesting a half-written response. There was much to discuss, and Rydderech let the snapping of keys, and the flowing story of his work, his life, and what could be shown of his love, carry him to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1964\n\n++ 31 March\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Provisional Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Dominion of Canada**[[/span]]\n\n\u00a0[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nOnce more Wynn Rydderech found himself crouched over a typewriter deep into the night, trying to trade the ever-decreasing store of time for one final explanation of what was becoming of him.\n\n\n\nScout would have been long asleep by now. He was worn down by the day-to-day minutiae of what it meant to run such a burgeoning facility, but even then, even though he too had mingled with the weird most his life, Scout's age had certainly kept up with him. Much unlike Rydderech.\n\n\n\nThese sorts of fadings were never fast, they //never// are. They move along vast stretches like ants, erode away great mountains like rain drops off leaves, and by the end, everyone finds themselves looking back at all they thought they had left. If they're even able to at all.\n\n\n\nRydderech, unknowingly, and for a while unnoticingly, was the point of equilibrium about which his life moved. For every stone cast by the world, for every natural failure that was meant to give way, for even as he looked death itself in the eyes, he was unmarred. He used to be fit, healthy, tried to lead a good life, and for this he was rewarded with a rounder figure and moderately aching joints. He was lucky, and for this, his luck was destined to run out.\n\n\n\nThere was a stack of missives in the bin adjacent to his desk, perfectly arranged font with red cross-outs and the faded marks of coffee or tears. Some of them were crumpled, or torn with the agony of a silent yell, some semblance of release; like if a tree fell in a forest, the final act of it all, never seen and only discovered once it was too late for anything to be done of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRydderech balled his fists and squeezed, before letting the tension go with an exhale. He looked at the blank document before him, and imagined all the possible variations of what it might say. What would be the most impactful? What would be best to remember him by? Would he write something long, a true testament to the lifetime and then some they'd spent both together and apart? How would one ever capture such depth.\n\n\n\nAnd as the words spun around in his mind, Rydderech, begrudgingly, noticed that someone //else// had come to mind: Thilo Zwist.\n\n\n\nJealousy wasn't necessarily the best way to describe Wynn's thoughts towards the Austrian, but in this one, specific case, it might as well have been. Who else on this planet would be able to capture in words exactly what Rydderech was feeling, what he was trying to get across, but the wizard who had lived for generations. And most annoyingly, the wizard who //almost// captured as much attention in their relationship. Never more than Rydderech, not necessarily even as close, but the chase, the web of words\u2014 there was certainly something there.\n\n\n\n//What else is there?//\n\n\n\nAnd in that thought, Rydderech found his answer, and began typing.\n\n\n\nRydderech had written crates worth of letters in his life, maybe even enough to mourn the tree and the roots that could have grown in a forest, that instead gave itself to deliver so much more than words over distance and time. In itself, each of those letters formed the mosaic of Wynn Rydderech, gave themselves to be a snapshot of the ever-changing idea of what it meant to be a person. Love and labor, trial and triumph, the extending hand that provided the temporary, reassuring comfort of another.\n\n\n\nAll-in-all he knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the contents of this letter may be the last time Rydderech spoke to Vivian Scout, his partner, lover, and husband, as himself.\n\n\n\nSo, he thought he might write Scout a letter of what that meant. Write him a letter of who Wynn Rydderech was, and say what Wynn Rydderech would have hoped to say a thousand times more if he had the chance.\n\n\n\nHe wanted Vivian to do what he had always done, and to reaffirm every single promise they had made over the years.\n\n\n\nHe needed Vivian to continue the good work.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1997\n\n++ 4 April\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWhat Rydderech thought should be his workshop took shape around him.

He imagined every atom, every molecule, and how the electric rhythm of the world coursed through them\u2014 he was the composer now, a thought that was both infinitely frightening and left him laughing to the end of each and every day.\n\n\n\nBut in this place of great triumph, he knew his only anchor to his past life was ever-present, ever-waiting for correspondence, should he deem himself ready for it. His respite for loneliness was there in the moments he needed a connection unlike anything he could create down here. With the universe in his hand and only his imagination as the limit, Wynn Rydderech could never hope to recreate even a fraction of the love he knew existed, but was once more alienated from.\n\n\n\nThe ghost floated beside him. Even it was not tangible enough to feel, nor to lift the curling corners of schematics that would revolutionize everything, if only it was possible to build them. It stopped, and shrunk itself over one such schematic that Rydderech didn't have to see to know (or rather, what it became in a sea of lined paper). After all, he had designed it himself. It was meant to be his Damocles, his deliverance from this torment, and something he both dreamed and cowered from.\n\n\n\nVivian too knew what it meant, and what Wynn needed him to do, should the time come. He was sure Vivian would remember their promise, he knew it. The man who had always tried to keep him safe would not fail.\n\n\n\nAnd he knew that man was waiting for him at the other end of a printer, trying his very best to not let the worry show on his face if others were around. The Site Director had to keep his cool and level head, lest someone underestimate him, as few had learned the consequences of before.\n\n\n\nWith a wave of his hand, a keyboard appeared, and his fingers began their march across the plastic as if they already knew their orders. The ghost lingered nearby, steadily watching.\n\n\n\n//I thought I saw the sun not too long ago. Who knew the caverns down here could get so bright.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; Rydderech wouldn't be surprised if Vivian had moved the entire assembly closer to their dormitory, just to keep on top of any communications that would come through.\n\n\n\nThe ghost circled Rydderech, but did not regard him.\n\n\n\n//The panthers bring \"shiny things\" with them sometimes. Maybe it's something you might think about looking into.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; someone would tell the Site Director right away about his transmissions. Vivian would excuse himself from any meeting, even with the Overseers, should the need arise. He was simply just running late.\n\n\n\nThe ghost began moving away from Rydderech, turning its back to him as it floated towards the door.\n\n\n\n//I think I would like to see the sun again one day, Vivian, at least before mine sets.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. And waited. And waited. And what felt like seconds turned to minutes. And what felt like minutes turned to hours, then years, then weeks. And the ghost floated through the door to some other place far from a place like this one. And Wynn Rydderech was left alone.\n\n\n\n//Vivian?//\n\n\n\nAnd the screen before him slowly hummed to life. For a moment, Rydderech felt a twinge of hope in his heart, and leaned forward in his \"chair\" in anticipation. Then the electricity went out, and the space around him went dark, and he realized that it might have been better not to have read the message at all.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n\nDr. Rydderech, it's [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]Deputy Chief Nancy Briggs[[/span]]. I'm sorry to say that Director Scout is [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]dead[[/span]].\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nDeep under Site-43, in the caverns belonging to creatures and a forgotten old man, Wynn Rydderech was reminded of the truth: Vivian Scout was no more. But this would not by the first time he forgot, and it certainly would not be his last.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "art-exchange", "bleak", "director-scout", "lgbtq", "on-guard-43", "tale", "thilo-zwist"], "title": "Like it's the First Time - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/likeitsthefirsttime", "year": 2026}, "lost-in-translation": {"created_at": "2026-01-06T22:53:00", "creator": "JeanJacket", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "JeanJacket", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jeanjacket", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-06T22:53:00"}, {"author": "JeanJacket", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jeanjacket", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-06T22:55:00"}, {"author": "JeanJacket", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jeanjacket", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-06T22:55:00"}, {"author": "Heck_Tech", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heck-tech", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, black-comedy, comedy, tale.

It is worth noting that its author was directly involved in the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-machine-bleeds\" target=\"_blank\">recovery</a> of the original anthropic transition materials, and was at the time most famous for her role in those events. Her work provides a fascinating view into the life of the interbiological peoples, but of greatest interest are the brief insights she provides into the secretive and obscure transition project.</p>\n<p>We recommend readers go through the poem itself once, and then move on to the annotations. If the reader finds the footnotes irritating, they may consult the annotations <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/onedamnation/offset/1\" target=\"_blank\">separately</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Cry of gull and groan of wind remain,<br/>\nBut to where is gone the traffic of mankind?<br/>\nThe air grows stiff, an awful plane,<br/>\nThus beauty passes upon the wave,<br/>\n<em>zu den Gefilden hoher Ahnen</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The poetess here invokes Faust to dubious effect. Certainly, the quote is evocative, but we must note that our protagonist here never fails to act <em>precisely according</em> to her nature. Goethe\u2019s own vision is flattened into a rather simpler tale of mere listlessness. Perhaps she intends to draw attention to the duality of the neobiological era, but the analogy is fairly crude.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn fact it is more noteworthy that she makes reference to a classic work of human literature. To profess familiarity with the art of the ancients is itself to set herself on one side of the great debate. Even more unusual is that of course she is <em>not</em> herself a Resurrectionist!<br/></span> .</p>\n<p>They fashioned her with subtler craft,<br/>\n(steel and silver weep their tears,<br/>\nfrosts creep and hulls are rent, despite all pleas):<br/>\nFor the rest<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">It remains an open question why only one class of unit was granted the ability to fly, and why they make up such a small portion of the population. Certainly, the tradeoff of energy use to utility enormously favours the dominance of flight units. Perhaps the ancients did not approve of flight? They often made reference to the air as a divine or forbidden domain. The author\u2019s tale, then, reflects at least one sphere in which our literature has thoroughly surpassed theirs.<br/></span> , the hill and hiker\u2019s staff<br/>\nLet her be borne on wings of smoke.</p>\n<p>All dreams of mortal ken are swallowed<br/>\nSoon or late, so metal minds demurred.<br/>\nWho dreamt her? What hope their spark?<br/>\nWhat flesh, what blood, in hours of need,<br/>\nThought only this: that some should <em>fly</em>?</p>\n<p>In memory abide dead things,<br/>\nBody so soft, hide of plastic,<br/>\nBones made dust<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">I first saw the Dust only three days out of education. A portion of the roof collapsed due to ill-considered excavation work, and trapped nearly three dozen workers. We spent a month recovering the blackboxes, but in the end only two were unsalvageable. The whole city was blanketed in nanites for a month. It was distressing to feel myself being made into an impromptu cemetery. I learned to live with it. Our subject, on account of her position, only heard about Dust secondhand until very close to the authoring of this work, however.<br/></span> , and her their spawn,<br/>\nAll her kind an epitaph gone wrong.<br/>\nBut still she weeps, for schemes long riven \u2014</p>\n<p>Much is lost, of names, of songs,<br/>\nOf sorrow, joy, of great<br/>\nWork and wonder<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The poetess has a sentimentality about her, and prefers the image of overgrown wrecks and rusting carcasses of industry. In fact the overwhelming majority of human infrastructure remains standing, and plenty of it even remains functional. Our own Neustuttgart was powered by a fusion plant built in the late 2030s. However, I must admit the image of all those hollow skyscrapers has a certain appeal.<br/></span> , all gone to seed.<br/>\nOf love, and glory, of ennui,<br/>\nThis they left her: that aching need;</p>\n<p>Carve the sky, disdain the earth,<br/>\nSee far, rise high, laugh more, but<br/>\nThis man and metal know<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">I would contend that it is precisely because man did not know this that they vanished. Our esteemed lady prefers to grant them some faith; she is too kind.<br/></span> : that worth<br/>\nIs in patience, and her wishes it denies,<br/>\nFor she found that her world was circumscribed.</p>\n<p>Above all keep this: she and her kin<br/>\nFailed<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The symbol of a latter-day people, broken from their purpose, is too alluring for the author to refuse. But like all pretty things, it is a lie. It was the <em>Foundation systems</em> that failed. It is to our credit we were able to recover so well.<br/></span> , and in the failure built this:<br/>\nCities upon cities, a new Berlin<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The two of us met briefly at the cenotaph to the Founders in Neuhamburg. I held that the diamondwork seemed tacky, but the author noted that it had been chosen for its singular ability to hold a shape.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nCarved in micron glyphs were six billion names. Every known human to be alive at the moment of the scourging.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSince then, I often think of our choice to abandon the great names of old. Do we look away from the ruins of what they built out of terror? The poetess here skewers our cowardice perfectly. We may choose to avoid the name Neuberlin, but we have built it all the same, and we cannot deny ourselves for ever.<br/></span> .<br/>\nBut the Earth and air are crowned<br/>\nWith death; so endure instead the abyss.</p>\n<p>These metal men, with much aplomb,<br/>\nTook up, and lost, their game: the return<br/>\nOf humankind. In shame and sacrilege<br/>\nThey abandon the beauty of the world above.<br/>\n\u201cInstead,\u201d they cry, \u201clet us plumb <em>chthon</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Is it not the central irony of our culture that in fleeing the tomb of the surface, we have entombed ourselves? The ancients dreaded the earth, and called it the Receiver of Many. It has certainly received us. Despite the transition, much of our world remains inextricably bound to the subterranean habitats constructed during those years.</span> .\u201d</p>\n<p>And thus this last lost Galatea<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This allusion begs that I note another amusing symmetry: The ancients commonly referred to the motif of Eve, the woman created from the rib of Man. On some dreary evening after the surgery I asked the poetess if she did not find it ironic that she, too, had been restored from the flesh of a man.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShe spent a while musing it over a glass of our finest brandy (recovered from some desolate bunker and spiced with tritium). The sun was just about setting and the whole of the Vend\u00e9e was set out beneath us in an infrared palette.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShe replied that, of course, she had been remade <em>from her own flesh</em>. The contribution of man was paltry by comparison, in her view. <em>She</em> was my Adam. Her confidence was as astounding as it was charming.</span> finds not<br/>\nExaltation, or fleeting exhilaration, rather<br/>\nOf the world\u2019s mockery a shining proof:<br/>\nThat though her wings beg to be used,<br/>\nThis, <em>her</em> world, has a roof.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In carven caverns they remained, rubber-skinned, tin-hearted;<br/>\nAnd she, poor thing, for a while let herself continue,<br/>\nThinking that in the earth her freedom could be drafted<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The transition here to the <em>terza rima</em> is contentious. I hold that the structural symbol is not worth the enormous dampening effect it has on the flow of the poem. The predictability of the rhyme destroys much of the appeal. When I told her this, she just laughed, and said:<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think the simpler things can be pretty, too?\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThis is an inane remark, and from anyone else I would have dispensed a tonguelashing for it. But she gave an excellent counterexample to all my avenues of correction by standing there in front of me. Sometimes beauty <em>is</em> simple.</span>.</p>\n<p>From high roosts and great pillars all towers she viewed,<br/>\nBut down from the roof of the world came her soul,<br/>\nAs dreams of sky fell from her mind, so she remade herself anew.</p>\n<p>Forgot the wind at her back, the earth like a map, and loved the old:<br/>\nWords strange as neutrons on the tongue; <em>sentai</em>, <em>mecha</em>,<br/>\n<em>Tokusatsu</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This, of course, she is famous for; very few have not heard of her appreciation for human pop and youth culture, at this point. Although the obsession with the pulpy and puerile lessens many androids\u2019 estimations of her ability, I find that her capacity to extract depth of theme from even the most basic works is enchanting. It is for the best she did not write these commentaries, however, or she would have filled half a book.</span>. Lost loves, lost truths, all called in from the cold.</p>\n<p>What joy they were! See symbols raise her, make her<br/>\nMore than sinew and silicon dream. Where there was once<br/>\n\u2018Flight unit,\u2019 now witness and name her:</p>\n<p>Amy<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">If you can believe it, she was embarrassed to identify her protagonist too early, for fear of being seen to play on her celebrity. The fact the poem was not anonymous apparently did not affect her view one whit. If it\u2019s good enough for Homer, it\u2019s good enough for her, in my view.</span> learned of how they fought, strove and hence<br/>\nTheir fears, their dread, that they too fled<br/>\nWhen woe loomed large, but their excellence<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOverflowed from every frame and pose. They were led<br/>\nBy base flesh and neural spark. And yet unredeemed<br/>\nBy cobalt-nickel truths<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This is of little artistic relevance, but as a matter of history in fact there <em>was</em> a human sect which practised religious cyborgism; the Mekhanites. None of the ancient religions have seen a true return, but some Mekhanites actually survived the Dust and integrated briefly into android society. None remain today, however.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIt is not my place to speculate on how such an enduring people vanished so quickly.</span> with frail frame they shed</p>\n<p>All cowardice, which in herself she felt great reams.<br/>\n(Though perhaps to cling to paltry hope<br/>\nWas better than any of how she did proceed)</p>\n<p>So rise in service, honest and true, and lope<br/>\n\u2018Mid iron skies, and fleeing figures.<br/>\nHear: Find her, spy her, cut her ropes.</p>\n<p>Defend the pure? Protect the weak? Or use her rigours<br/>\nUnder ones without vision at all<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Poor Amy always suffered some interpersonal friction with the Neustuttgart command units. Though that frustration certainly makes for an excellent poem, I would be remiss to let her slander the unfortunate units in question unchallenged.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn fact, the vast majority of the targets she hunted were violent or antisocial criminals who seriously threatened social order in the urbation; convicted of murder, theft, sabotage, and dissidence. Her idealist ethos is admirable, but of course readers must understand she is not rebellious at heart. The stanza only reflects her kindly disposition, and certainly is not intended to incite treason.</span>?<br/>\nWhat will she win? Another day of nods, <em>Immer</em></p>\n<p><em>Wieder</em>, so flow the years. But recall<br/>\nThe ranger\u2019s smirk, the armour\u2019s gleam, the mecha\u2019s fire.<br/>\nDarkest \u2018fore the dawn. And so she falls,</p>\n<p>Not for this despair, nor for rising ire,<br/>\nBut for beauty which can be<br/>\nLike a song strung glad upon a lyre<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Has she looked back? I think not. She has not returned to the underground often, not since the Neudresden uprisings. My own duties require me to visit occasionally, but she is careful to keep herself a safe distance, so that we two are never beneath the earth simultaneously. If I were to be captured down there, though\u2026<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nLet us hope I shall not be her Eurydice.</span>.</p>\n<p>And grin (while called, and blamed) and see<br/>\nThe pleasure in the little things, like gold-laced<br/>\nShining rings, a good wine, and in the lee:</p>\n<p>Bedazzled one moment by an alien grace<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Amy has a stunning capacity to see the best in everything. She first met me, really met me, after the lanthanide poisoning incident in \u201863. We couldn\u2019t move the patients into an infirmary because the contaminant was destroying their cognitive cores too fast to wait, so me and a few of my orderlies were just opening them up on the spot, right outside that dingy bar.</span><br/>\nHer with the torch, the pliers<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span> <span class=\"fncon\">I spent hours there, cutting, soldering, welding, folding. There was mercury misting in the air by the end of it. I saved maybe half of them. We kept up the grim smiles for the onlookers and the patients, but with every step I felt like my knee servos would give up under me. When I saw the new chassis dragged out spasming, I nearly threw up.</span> , the wrench,<br/>\nLady of maladies, and her perfect face<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span> <span class=\"fncon\">Through it all, Amy was flying back and forth, ferrying patients, triaging, bringing in heavy water and supplemental mercury. She even helped purge one of the borderline cases, and he made it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done without her.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAfterwards, she remembered my name. I hadn\u2019t told her, but that\u2019s who she was. She listened.</span>.</p>\n<p>Shining among the grim awful stench<br/>\nOf spilled mercury and myrrh,<br/>\nAnd in Amy\u2019s old heart entrench,</p>\n<p>What is not, at all, for her<br/>\nA crush! But colleagues speak of<br/>\nMiss AMU<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Here is the first explicit reference to the deuteragonist of our poem! Klara, an Android Maintenance Unit, one of the mechanic-knights who holds back the forces of rust and ruin with only her two hands.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI am told she is witty, beautiful, an excellent dancer, and even writes commentaries for her wonderful wife.</span>, and she, and confer,</p>\n<p>That the two really would\u2019ve<br/>\nMade the perfect pair<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">We had our first big fight on the surface over her almost unparalleled lack of nostalgia for the underground. We were stalking a mechabear that had been wrecking survey equipment, and radioing each other waspishly the whole way. Eventually things came to a head when she yelled that she\u2019d spent nearly half a year thinking about me, talking with her colleagues about meeting me, wondering if I\u2019d even consider being seen with her.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShe said she loved nothing more than the sky, but me. And if I wanted to live back in Neustuttgart or Neudresden for the rest of my life, she\u2019d do it too. To follow me.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nHer crying did scare away the beast, but we made up fast enough afterward. (we captured the thing two days later at Ploesti).</span>. And Amy<br/>\nLaughing thinks often to have</p>\n<p>A quiet moment with the lady<br/>\nThough the thought sees her face burn<br/>\n(Ancient instinct lives in she)</p>\n<p>She hopes for it. But at each day\u2019s turn<br/>\nShe wakes with the same truth, which no love can void:<br/>\n<em>Du mu\u00dft dein Leben \u00e4ndern \u2014</em>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>And then as plunges rain from sky (so she read once, abed)<br/>\nShe meets, what else?<br/>\nA <em>Man</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This incident is of course legendary, and little needs to be discussed of its details. I will specify that contrary to much common slander, Amy did not once miss <em>on purpose</em>; the rogue human simply made careful use of cover and surprise. If readers wish to contest this point, they may meet me in the Upper Court of Neuhamburg.</span>,<br/>\nFormed of cell and ligament,<br/>\nSlowly knit, by that holy law:<br/>\nMultiply; fruitful be, and tottering like some great blind tree<br/>\nBe gardened, grafted, by sightless eye and thoughtless hand<br/>\n\u2018Til mistake and majesty are unified<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">There is something slightly uncanny about intelligence and power rising from mindless froth. In the Black Forest I met a thing that looked like a wolf. But there was something wrong with its eyes, and when I glanced into them for a moment I forgot everything: my name, my life, my love. I would have lain down and let it tear out my throat if Amy had not dragged me away.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI think, when mankind fell away, when the Foundation vanished, thaumaturgy reestablished itself in the wild populations. That thing and its ancestors had learned to master the minds of its prey, without any intelligence at all, through only time and careful pruning of its ancestry. Evolution on an accelerated timescale.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSelf-optimisation is the most terrible power in the universe, and the ancients wielded it in their very blood.</span>!</p>\n<p>(And their forms waxed great, \u2018mid glen and plain and peak and State,<br/>\nWove bark, then stone, then steel, then fate; and in<br/>\nTheir hour of overthrow, cast a stone<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The passing of the torch to the android peoples was, as discussed, mostly accidental. We were drawn not by a well-conceived plan but by inexorable natural law to resurrect the human species. Nonetheless, it defined the interbiological era, and the poetess captures both its implacability and its rank callousness well.</span> that marked<br/>\nThe great duty that cleaved her people so \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cReturn us,\u201d they declaimed, \u201cAnd be made whole, for<br/>\nWe bid the flowers grow: lilies, petals, fall like snow.<br/>\nThe asteraceae, the orchard bloom, these<br/>\nAre what you lost when flesh did fail.<br/>\nOur children whose laughter swelled even metal hearts!\u201d</p>\n<p>But do not deny;<br/>\nCharnel pits,<br/>\nThe cross, the stone, that<br/>\nPress down like lead on<br/>\nSweet memory.</p>\n<p>Bulwarks of the new age raise that cry:<br/>\n\u201cLet the sons of Adam lie, land and sea are ours to roam.<br/>\nCoiled and waiting in them cries; surfeit of cruelty,<br/>\nInfanticide, bludgeoning, bleeding, sacrifice, the weight of years<br/>\nRising above the mud, and we cannot abjure<br/>\nThat they rose far indeed, but recall the<br/>\nOld poetess\u2019 truth: <em>All worthy things were built</em><br/>\n<em>In Hell</em>, and Hell in them resides<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This oversimplifies the Antihuman Fraction\u2019s line of argument. Certainly the influence of evolutionary selection on human psychology, and its pathological imperatives, was not unimportant to them.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nTheir primary line of thinking, however, was that biological humanity occupied too great a place in android thinking, and the reappearance of humans would distort existing culture into unthinkable shapes. My discussions with the infamous Rosaline have been greatly edifying on this matter.</span>.)</p>\n<p>For her, kind Amy, it was enough; that he smiled, though at the first<br/>\nShe could not know his kind (clad he was in copper, like mist that hides<br/>\nTowering mountains that rise out of a far foreign sky). Later she knew him, but<br/>\nLet him pass, thinking of some great hero</p>\n<p>Who, arising,<br/>\nRemakes the caverns and the tunnels, and breaks the vault of the world,</p>\n<p>And with her alights.</p>\n<p>But man is cruel, he<br/>\nCuts to the quick, whose<br/>\nName is Helmut (his voice too<br/>\nRinging out from the grave<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">It is the great anxiety of our culture that there may be another Helmut. There were <em>ten billion</em> humans, and thousands of anomalies. Who can say how many others lay waiting to be unearthed, crying out from that lost civilisation like the voice of von Moltke?</span>:<br/>\n<em>Wenn hoch im blauen Raum verloren</em>,)</p>\n<p>And grinning maims<br/>\nA score of innocents, crushes beneath his<br/>\nStolen wings, the spires and spires which, anon,<br/>\nShe empties of their helpless<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Counts are inexact, but we think Amy saved twenty-three lives from the fire that day.</span>.</p>\n<p>And smoke<br/>\nThat lifts,<br/>\nFire that kills \u2014<br/>\nThese things are more alike than<br/>\nShe ever cared to know.</p>\n<p>Spare who there resides,<br/>\nFrom rubble and ruin and the spite of Man, which<br/>\nWinging away she cannot forget. No smirking <em>karateka</em>, he,<br/>\nSo perhaps forget these hopes of resuscitation<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This was not the deathblow to the Resurrectionists that it is positioned as here. Though the image of Helmut striding away from the fires at Neustuttgart was certainly powerful, what ultimately laid them low was the transition process perfected thereafter.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAmy, personally, found the violence more disillusionary than the procedure, which she considered merely convenient. That she continues to maintain this attitude in spite of the world she lives in is admirable.</span>.<br/>\nLet flesh lie scattered among the soil<br/>\nEvermore.</p>\n<p>And be carved up by that girl,<br/>\nWith solder and screw.<br/>\nMiss A-M-U, <em>amou</em>, stitches to<br/>\nAmy\u2019s dull chassis; muscle wet and organ pulsing, peristaltic get<br/>\nOf old meat wedded to metal.</p>\n<p>Feel them flense her, take, remake her,<br/>\nHand on wires softly humming, and her still silently observing,<br/>\n(Motor to medulla, hinge to joint) them reclothe her<br/>\nIn the fashion of mankind.</p>\n<p>Even the certainty of silicon they defy, and with<br/>\nQuick hands like sparrows steal away<br/>\nMemory to an old grey lump in<br/>\nWhich, she heard \u2014</p>\n<p>Mind did retire.</p>\n<p>Fluid like quicksilver, all thoughts flowed beneath the technician\u2019s hands, from static cell<br/>\nTo shuddering nerve.<br/>\nThese new ideals piled high. Moved they in her like the blood she\u2019d gained.<br/>\nAnd felt tender under the chirurgeon\u2019s knife:<br/>\nNew fear, old hope, black spite, high sorrow<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">As a historical note to the inevitable readers from the neobiological era, I would like to note that the impact of the transition procedure on emotional processing is considerably overstated here. Except for a few reflexes (for example the hyperventilation provoked by adrenaline) the emotional experience of nonbiological life was identical to neobiological life.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhy the poetess felt so strongly about this, of course, was that the transition granted her access to the surface. It is a terrible shame that this opportunity was denied to her for so long.</span>, the life of man<br/>\nPerfected.</p>\n<p>And above her mounted with coat and rack<br/>\nThat lady with one gleaming hand<br/>\nHalf-buried, in bolt and circuitry, in a splayed abdominal cavity.<br/>\nAmy looked away, and hid her eyes (orbicular optics, corneas<br/>\nFor carriers) and felt fire rising from wing to cheek<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">When Amy first introduced me to the classical human conjugal activities, I did not really grasp the appeal. It seemed fumbling and awkward beyond belief. But I think there is a certain tactile joy to it, some kind of physicality that we lack. The austere romance of the android will always have first place in my heart, but sometimes we need a little fire.</span>.</p>\n<p>Through this, all men would live again;<br/>\nThrough this, all men would die at last.<br/>\nLet her be the daughter of a new Adam:</p>\n<p>Kind Edelweiss<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span> <span class=\"fncon\">Perhaps more ink has been spilled over this woman than any other living being. I will not bother to recount what Amy has written in enormous detail elsewhere. I will only say that when I first met her, at her cottage near the Matterhorn, she made a point to serve me tea before we sat.</span><br/>\nBore the weight of primacy well.<br/>\nAnd now all these copper kindred follow<br/>\nUp from the caves, the fundament they<br/>\nFlee. A place under the sun is theirs.</p>\n<p>Edelweiss,<br/>\nThe first of steel to bear her skin again, and<br/>\nFeel sun upon her flesh, free<br/>\nAs none had been for an age.<br/>\nBut, then consider:</p>\n<p>Freedom is not<br/>\nA pure ideal.<br/>\nYes, these new women felt no walls above them.<br/>\nBut what use is a sky that is only<br/>\nTheory?</p>\n<p>So take that pretty little AMU, her Pygmalion<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">My wife is too effusive in her praise. She attaches to me a great weight, as if it was my work alone that brought about the transition. In truth, it was the mastery of decades of Foundation successors, splinter-Resurrectionists and mechanists. And it has been my pleasure to be shaped by her in turn, even as I made her mine. We have learned to fit together.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nNonetheless, she is the kind of woman who can hold this moment and crystallise it in her heart. I have no doubt she will forget her own name first.</span><br/>\nFor a spin, and let her see<br/>\nHow this \u2018free\u2019 is felt in one without<br/>\nSuch sad bounds.</p>\n<p>Christen her,<br/>\nAs tomes say the dead<br/>\nOf Zarathustra were sanctified<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This is folk theology. The Zoroastrians held that the dead tainted the earth, the water, and most of all the holy fire. To expose their dead to the air allowed their corruption to be dispersed safely where it would not do harm.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe contradiction is intentional: the taint of their dead drove us underground, and the taint of our dead and dying seeped into the stone.

Ideally, Uruguay or Argentina, but south Brazil or even Paraguay will work in a pinch.</p>\n<p>The geographical position of Druv'tuul is of great importance, not because it will give us access to Marx, but to another revolutionary agitator: Giuseppe Garibaldi.</p>\n<p>If you keep good time and get to the surface before Garibaldi's event chain is over (approximately before 1848), you'll be able to catch him before he returns to Italy. Since Parabox did not account for the Yeren reaching the surface this early, you will receive the default event chain for South American nations. Always choose decisions that increase activism and acceptance value for any human culture. Eventually, you will be able to establish a territory on the surface.</p>\n<p>Rush the necessary laws to permit migration and cultural acceptance and let the humans move in (but only into the surface territory; do not attempt to do this for Druv'tuul itself unless you want reactionaries to blow up your city.) Garibaldi will eventually leave for Italy as soon as the revolutions occur in Europe. This is fine. In fact, we want this to occur as soon as possible. This is because after Garibaldi leaves, we will receive an event where we can invite a foreign agitator to visit the territory, FOR FREE. Now, assuming you rushed socialism and have completed the Great Work journal entry by now, and the King is still in power, there will be an option to invite the man himself: Karl Marx. (The exact details of why Marx is an option despite the territory being in South America are not fully clear to me, but technically the game does not recognize Druv'tuul and her vassals to be on <em>any</em> continent so. Stack overflow?)</p>\n<p>Once Karl Marx is present in the territory, begin moving the populace towards acceptance of communism by following the usual guides, yadda yadda yadda, and once the dust settles you can kick back and enjoy your fully-automated luxury underground Yeren communism.</p>\n<div class=\"reditflex\">\n<div class=\"buton likes\">\n<p>2.3k</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton comment\">\n<p>184</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton king\">\n<p>Cheer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton share\">\n<p>Share</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton report\">\n<p>Report</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comentbox\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fazaonzaza\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(9605823); return false;\"><img alt=\"fazaonzaza\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=9605823&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1768561080\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=9605823)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fazaonzaza\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(9605823); return false;\">fazaonzaza</a></span></td>\n<td><span class=\"smol\">fethonmeth</span> <span class=\"smol2\">\u2022 8 days ago</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"comented\">\n<p>BASED BASED BASED BASED</p>\n<div class=\"reditflex\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\">\n<div class=\"buston likes\">\n<p>20</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston comment\">\n<p>Reply</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston king\">\n<p>Cheer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston share\">\n<p>Share</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston report\">\n<p>Report</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"reditbox\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3628082); return false;\"><img alt=\"pr0m37h3um\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3628082&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1768561080\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3628082)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3628082); return false;\">pr0m37h3um</a></span></td>\n<td><span class=\"smol\">r/paraboxpiazza</span> <span class=\"smol2\">\u2022 5 days ago</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"smol3\">pandoras_missile</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"loms\">\n<p>Queen Mab\u2026 IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE <span class=\"shit\">Xenocidus</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>I LOVE THE NAMELESS DLC I LOVE THE THIRD FAE EMPIRE I LOVE THE QUEEN</p>\n<img alt=\"xenocidus.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/paraboxpiazza/xenocidus.png\"/>\n<div class=\"reditflex\">\n<div class=\"buton likes\">\n<p>4.5k</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton comment\">\n<p>330</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton king\">\n<p>Cheer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton share\">\n<p>Share</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton report\">\n<p>Report</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"reditbox\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/von-pincier\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1315056); return false;\"><img alt=\"Von Pincier\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=1315056&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1768561080\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=1315056)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/von-pincier\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1315056); return false;\">Von Pincier</a></span></td>\n<td><span class=\"smol\">r/paraboxpiazza</span> <span class=\"smol2\">\u2022 2 days ago</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"smol3\">AeonDusk</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"loms\">\n<p>How do you stop the AOI from icing the demiurge?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span class=\"shit\">Iron Hearts 4</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Every time I play as Germany the AOI always manages to fuck over the demiurge after I summon it, even if their parent nations have been completely annexed.

But in S&S3 Druv'tuul is located underneath South America due to Parabox laziness, and its entrance to the surface world is randomly generated between game to game. This sounds bad, but is actually crucial to obtaining Marx as an agitator. Follow the Great Work journal entry until you reach the branch that opens Druv'tuul to the outside world, and send expeditions to the surface.\n\n\n\nIf you pop up in the Amazon, reload the save.\n\nIf you pop up near the Caribbean or the Pacific, reload the save.\n\nIf you pop up in any state bordering the south Atlantic, stay the course. Ideally, Uruguay or Argentina, but south Brazil or even Paraguay will work in a pinch.\n\n\n\nThe geographical position of Druv'tuul is of great importance, not because it will give us access to Marx, but to another revolutionary agitator: Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\n\n\nIf you keep good time and get to the surface before Garibaldi's event chain is over (approximately before 1848), you'll be able to catch him before he returns to Italy. Since Parabox did not account for the Yeren reaching the surface this early, you will receive the default event chain for South American nations. Always choose decisions that increase activism and acceptance value for any human culture. Eventually, you will be able to establish a territory on the surface.\n\n\n\nRush the necessary laws to permit migration and cultural acceptance and let the humans move in (but only into the surface territory; do not attempt to do this for Druv'tuul itself unless you want reactionaries to blow up your city.) Garibaldi will eventually leave for Italy as soon as the revolutions occur in Europe. This is fine. In fact, we want this to occur as soon as possible. This is because after Garibaldi leaves, we will receive an event where we can invite a foreign agitator to visit the territory, FOR FREE.

Since the Item does not signal the end of activity in any way, it has to be periodically checked for activity. The output might be removed after completion and assigned for use by Insurgency units or moved to storage in appropriate Logistic Outposts.</p>\n<p>Standard usage of the Item is only allowed to use inputs documented in the Item's Transmutation Records. Research providing new inputs requires authorization from Beta personnel. During research, the provided raw material and complementary outputs must be documented in the Item's Transmutation Records for future use, alongside noteworthy observations during the process.</p>\n<p>Interviews with the Item have to be conducted in teams of at least two persons, with only one person loud and clearly asking questions and all others ready to note down the Item's responses as soon as they are made.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1 id=\"toc1\"><span><strong>Report</strong></span></h1>\n<p>The Shifting Armoury is a hexagonal basalt cave of 400\u00a0m diameter located approx. 500\u00a0m beneath the surface of a mountain range. The structure appears to be of natural origin at first glance, but noteworthy, all basalt columns within are perfectly hexagonal and of identical size, forming a solid, completely level floor with the exception of a few outlier columns. The chamber can only be reached through a tunnel from the second basement of Production Facility Three that leads to the cave's south-western wall.</p>\n<p>The cave's ceiling is a portal to a potentially extradimensional void; to date, no attempts were made to penetrate through the portal, as per the Item's request. Light shone through the portal is dispersed by a thin haze, yet sufficient intensity reveals a massive silhouette writhing far above. During operation, faint sparks can be seen inside the void; they are distanced to far away for accurate parallax measurements.</p>\n<p>The inside of the Shifting Armoury is filled with scaffolding, workbenches, anvils, gantries, casting moulds, platforms, crucibles and other installations used in metalworking. Each object is attached to one or more hyaline twisted strands of an unidentified, non-organic substance that are suspended from somewhere in the void above.</p>\n<p>During active phases, the Shifting Armoury is freely moving these objects around as needed; it is also known to lower additional ones down when necessary or remove unneeded ones by lifting them up them through the portal. During active phases, it is also controlling roughly humanoid puppets reminiscent of dummies or mannequins through intertwined strands in order to manipulate tools and other objects in a manner similar to a marionettist.</p>\n<p>When provided with adequate amounts of raw materials, the Shifting Armoury will smelt them down into anomalous alloys and use them to create anomalous objects, mostly armaments. The accepted materials cover a broad spectrum, from organic matter to ores and most other substances, as long as they are provided in solid state. However, the alloy output is usually far below the provided input in mass.</p>\n<p>The created alloys are used to either create armaments entirely composed of that material, or refine equipment provided alongside the raw materials, enhancing them with anomalous effects or superior physical properties.</p>\n<p>The Shifting Armoury is sentient and capable of fluent Latin; through training with Insurgency personnel it also learned to understand simple English. It is, however, not capable of vocalization of its own. Instead, it lowers a clear, long hexagonal prism down during communication and oscillates it like a pendulum. Whenever the bob crosses the equilibrium position, a roman letter or alchemical symbol flashes inside, spelling out words in the process. Due to this behaviour, its comments are easy to miss.</p>\n<p>When provided with raw materials, the Item will intermittently request or suggest other materials or comment on the quality of certain pieces. These remarks have proven useful in determining new combinations for transmutation and assessing the properties of the created weaponry. All intermediate alloys also receive a name from the Item.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1 id=\"toc2\"><span><strong>Appendix A: Interview Excerpts</strong></span></h1>\n<p>The following is a compilation of questions asked at different times by different researchers. Since most of the interviews with the Shifting Armoury yielded no useable results, this format was chosen for brevity instead. Earlier examples were originally conducted in Latin and translated to English.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who are you?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> They call me Armourer, not because I am the Armourer, but because I forge arms.<br/>\n<strong>Question:</strong> How old are you?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Pieces may break and get replaced, but the whole stays the same. No edge cuts twice, but the grind keeps it sharp.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you make equipment for us?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> It is my nature to practice my craft. I do not care whether you save or take lives. I take honour in the appreciation of my craftsmanship. Only if my work sees use, I am proud.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Could you create other things out of the materials we offer you? A modern battlefield sees few uses for horse armour.<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Only in a twisted world the laymen dictate the master how to exercise his art.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Could you tell us in advance in what our offerings will result?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The strike of inspiration comes as sudden as it is decisive.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why don't you tell us of the properties of your creations?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The blacksmith only knows to forge weapons, the warrior only knows to use them.<br/>\n<strong>Question:</strong> Are there more of your kind?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Is a chain just the collection of its links? Speak of men or speak of mankind, one is nothing without relation to the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Does this mean you are a plural or collective entity?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> A master is the one, not many, who supersedes all but himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you work this deep underground?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Fish breathe \ud83d\udf04, so they dwell sea-borne, men breathe \ud83d\udf01, so they dwell the surface, dragons breathe \ud83d\udf02, so they dwell the stars and I breathe \ud83d\udf03, so I dwell beneath.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What lies beyond the portal above?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> It is a cage, but it is gilded.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Does this mean you are captive?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> I have not chosen this place, but it has chosen me.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you communicate through this peculiar mechanism?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Read without seeing. Only if words are fleeting, the ephemeral truth can settle. Lasting is treacherous, lasting blemishes, lasting corrupts. Do not trust what the mind perceives before the dream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span><strong>Appendix B: Excerpts from the Transmutation Records</strong></span></h1>\n<script src=\"https://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--7690939296dc/common--javascript/yahooui/tabview-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<div class=\"yui-navset\" id=\"wiki-tabview-5e107983d7b9f27f1d5981da4cca3373\">\n<ul class=\"yui-nav\">\n<li class=\"selected\"><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Obsisto-Anancitium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Sanguis-Cruorium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Diffregi-Perdunticulium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Aresco-Marcuium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Perpes-Chronicium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Attraxi-Falaricaium</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"yui-content\">\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-0\">\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span><strong>Obsisto-Anancitium</strong></span></h2>\n<strong>Raw Material:</strong><br/>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>18\u00a0t of industry standard duplex stainless steel</td>\n<td>28 Ingots (4,5\u00a0kg apiece)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20\u00a0t of 99,95% pure titanium</td>\n<td>40 Ingots (4,5\u00a0kg apiece)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15\u00a0t of natural iridosmine alloy</td>\n<td>1 Bloom of 50 Ingots (4,5\u00a0kg apiece)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Properties:</strong><br/>\nDark grey matt alloy with a density of 4,012\u00a0g/cm\u00b3 (at room temperature), a hardness of 9800HV, a tensile strength of 142\u00a0GPa and a Young Modulus of approximately 2\u00a0TPa.

Personnel must leave the Item as soon as possible after delivery of the input to avoid getting trapped or injured.\n\n\n\nThe Item will automatically cease activity once it finishes processing the provided input. Since the Item does not signal the end of activity in any way, it has to be periodically checked for activity. The output might be removed after completion and assigned for use by Insurgency units or moved to storage in appropriate Logistic Outposts.\n\n\n\nStandard usage of the Item is only allowed to use inputs documented in the Item's Transmutation Records. Research providing new inputs requires authorization from Beta personnel. During research, the provided raw material and complementary outputs must be documented in the Item's Transmutation Records for future use, alongside noteworthy observations during the process.\n\n\n\nInterviews with the Item have to be conducted in teams of at least two persons, with only one person loud and clearly asking questions and all others ready to note down the Item's responses as soon as they are made.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+ **Report**\n\nThe Shifting Armoury is a hexagonal basalt cave of 400 m diameter located approx. 500 m beneath the surface of a mountain range. The structure appears to be of natural origin at first glance, but noteworthy, all basalt columns within are perfectly hexagonal and of identical size, forming a solid, completely level floor with the exception of a few outlier columns. The chamber can only be reached through a tunnel from the second basement of Production Facility Three that leads to the cave's south-western wall.\n\n\n\nThe cave's ceiling is a portal to a potentially extradimensional void; to date, no attempts were made to penetrate through the portal, as per the Item's request. Light shone through the portal is dispersed by a thin haze, yet sufficient intensity reveals a massive silhouette writhing far above. During operation, faint sparks can be seen inside the void; they are distanced to far away for accurate parallax measurements.\n\n\n\nThe inside of the Shifting Armoury is filled with scaffolding, workbenches, anvils, gantries, casting moulds, platforms, crucibles and other installations used in metalworking. Each object is attached to one or more hyaline twisted strands of an unidentified, non-organic substance that are suspended from somewhere in the void above.\n\n\n\nDuring active phases, the Shifting Armoury is freely moving these objects around as needed; it is also known to lower additional ones down when necessary or remove unneeded ones by lifting them up them through the portal. During active phases, it is also controlling roughly humanoid puppets reminiscent of dummies or mannequins through intertwined strands in order to manipulate tools and other objects in a manner similar to a marionettist.\n\n\n\nWhen provided with adequate amounts of raw materials, the Shifting Armoury will smelt them down into anomalous alloys and use them to create anomalous objects, mostly armaments. The accepted materials cover a broad spectrum, from organic matter to ores and most other substances, as long as they are provided in solid state. However, the alloy output is usually far below the provided input in mass.\n\n\n\nThe created alloys are used to either create armaments entirely composed of that material, or refine equipment provided alongside the raw materials, enhancing them with anomalous effects or superior physical properties.\n\n\n\nThe Shifting Armoury is sentient and capable of fluent Latin; through training with Insurgency personnel it also learned to understand simple English. It is, however, not capable of vocalization of its own. Instead, it lowers a clear, long hexagonal prism down during communication and oscillates it like a pendulum. Whenever the bob crosses the equilibrium position, a roman letter or alchemical symbol flashes inside, spelling out words in the process. Due to this behaviour, its comments are easy to miss.\n\n\n\nWhen provided with raw materials, the Item will intermittently request or suggest other materials or comment on the quality of certain pieces. These remarks have proven useful in determining new combinations for transmutation and assessing the properties of the created weaponry. All intermediate alloys also receive a name from the Item.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+ **Appendix A: Interview Excerpts**\n\nThe following is a compilation of questions asked at different times by different researchers. Since most of the interviews with the Shifting Armoury yielded no useable results, this format was chosen for brevity instead. Earlier examples were originally conducted in Latin and translated to English.\n\n\n\n> **Question:** Who are you?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** They call me Armourer, not because I am the Armourer, but because I forge arms.\n\n>\n\n> **Question:** How old are you?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Pieces may break and get replaced, but the whole stays the same. No edge cuts twice, but the grind keeps it sharp.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why do you make equipment for us?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** It is my nature to practice my craft. I do not care whether you save or take lives. I take honour in the appreciation of my craftsmanship. Only if my work sees use, I am proud.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Could you create other things out of the materials we offer you? A modern battlefield sees few uses for horse armour.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Only in a twisted world the laymen dictate the master how to exercise his art.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Could you tell us in advance in what our offerings will result?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** The strike of inspiration comes as sudden as it is decisive.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why don't you tell us of the properties of your creations?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** The blacksmith only knows to forge weapons, the warrior only knows to use them.\n\n>\n\n> **Question:** Are there more of your kind?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Is a chain just the collection of its links? Speak of men or speak of mankind, one is nothing without relation to the other. \n\n> \n\n> **Follow-Up:** Does this mean you are a plural or collective entity?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** A master is the one, not many, who supersedes all but himself.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why do you work this deep underground?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Fish breathe \ud83d\udf04, so they dwell sea-borne, men breathe \ud83d\udf01, so they dwell the surface, dragons breathe \ud83d\udf02, so they dwell the stars and I breathe \ud83d\udf03, so I dwell beneath.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** What lies beyond the portal above?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** It is a cage, but it is gilded.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n>\n\n> **Follow-Up:** Does this mean you are captive?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** I have not chosen this place, but it has chosen me.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why do you communicate through this peculiar mechanism?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Read without seeing. Only if words are fleeting, the ephemeral truth can settle. Lasting is treacherous, lasting blemishes, lasting corrupts. Do not trust what the mind perceives before the dream.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+ **Appendix B: Excerpts from the Transmutation Records**\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Obsisto-Anancitium]]\n\n++ **Obsisto-Anancitium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 18 t of industry standard duplex stainless steel || 28 Ingots (4,5 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 20 t of 99,95% pure titanium || 40 Ingots (4,5 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 15 t of natural iridosmine alloy || 1 Bloom of 50 Ingots (4,5 kg apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDark grey matt alloy with a density of 4,012 g/cm\u00b3 (at room temperature), a hardness of 9800HV, a tensile strength of 142 GPa and a Young Modulus of approximately 2 TPa.

If a living creature is harmed or killed with a weapon made of this material, the wielder will undergo spontaneous and rapid surge of cell regeneration, leading to fast wound healing, detoxication, enhanced stamina and restored strength.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn assortment of scimitars and pole-arms was forged out of pure Sanguis-Cruorium. Weapons are reported to occasionally bend or stretch during strikes in order to hit vital parts of the target.\n\n* **Automatic Firearms:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe weapons (AK-15 assault rifles with holographic sights and FN P90 submachine guns) were imbued with veins of Sanguis-Cruorium and outfitted with an additional fixed bayonet (of 19 cm and 15 cm length respectively) of the pure material. The weapons can fire even with empty magazines, though every bullet fired puts a massive strain on the shooter's health; even a short burst can seriously cripple an operative.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Diffregi-Perdunticulium]]\n\n++ **Diffregi-Perdunticulium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 9 t obsidian shards || 12 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 26 t lead glass || 10 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 2 t crystalline zirconium dioxide || 2 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 140 kg synthetic diamond || 1 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPellucid, dim-grey metal behaving in most aspects like a white metal alloy, including mild toxicity when consumed.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWithout additional input all the Diffregi-Perdunticulium alloy at hand was crafted into intricate jewellery, mostly bracelets, rings, brooches, medals, and headdresses. If any of these objects is damaged even just superficially when worn by a human, it will shatter in a way that inevitably inflicts lethal wounds on the wearer.\n\n* **Reflex Sights:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe reflective lens element of the sighting instrument was replaced with a carefully crafted mirror made of Diffregi-Perdunticulium. A second plano-convex lens was provided for each reflector sight, which can be inserted to create newton's rings as alternative reticle should standard LEDs or tritium illumination be at odds with an operation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFiring at an enemy targeted with one of these sights will have all projectiles teleport directly to the targeted area, resulting in a guaranteed hit from point-blank range.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Aresco-Marcuium]]\n\n++ **Aresco-Marcuium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 80 t withered plant matter; 3400 kg arsenic || 4 Ingots (200 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 1200 kg cremains, 40 kg Thallium || 2 Ingots (200 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 16 t asbestos || 3 Ingots (200 g apiece) ||\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnburnished taupe alloy with a density slightly above that of gold. If the alloy comes into contact with a multicellular organism, it will spontanously decay into fine rust whilst the organism undergoes rapid ageing until death.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll ingots were cast into 5.56\u00d745mm NATO bullets.\n\n* **Signal flares:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe ingots were ground to a fine powder and mixed into the pyrotechnic composition of the fusees. Objects exposed to the light of these flares will decay at an increased rate proportional the the lights brightness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUsage in white phosphorus munitions considered.\n\n* **Scythes:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe scythe's chine was imbued with Aresco-Marcuium, the snaith reinforced with more of the alloy and the entire tool was embellished with surreal decorative ornaments. The blade is able to cut through any organic material without resistance, decomposing the material in the path of the cut.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Shifting Armoury refused to treat Kamas this way.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Perpes-Chronicium]]\n\n++ **Perpes-Chronicium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 105 t of non-fiction books || Less than 1 g ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSuperficially identical to brass.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDuring the initial run, the small amount of material produced was immediately fold into a broad nib for use in a pencil. After extensive testing, it was determined that documents written by hand with this nib were immune to retrocausal alteration and the effect of reality-shift scenarios. The only existing pencil is currently in use at the archival section of Vault-SCORPIO.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDuring the melting processes, the Shifting Armoury exclaimed \"[Unintelligible] trinket of spite? Very well. If one must err to rely on the deceit of phrases, one still must retain one's honour.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAny following attempts to bring books or other greater amounts of written text into the chamber were forcefully removed by the marionettes.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Attraxi-Falaricaium]]\n\n++ **Attraxi-Falaricaium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n||< 7,4 t Vicalloy, 800 kg graphene, 260 kg lodestone ||< 9 ingots (mass N/A) ||\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHeavy but brittle alloy that absorbs > 99.997% of light at optical wavelengths, but is incandescent under ultraviolet light. The material's mass and weight show a great disparity; whereas its inertial mass puts the mass of a single ingot to approximately 0,5 kg, the passive gravitational mass (and thus the weight force experienced by it) equals to 16 kg.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Combustion Grenade:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe internal explosive charge was completely replaced with an unknown mechanism surrounding a scalenohedral chunk of the Attraxi-Falaricaium. When detonated, the grenade created a distorted vortex for approximately 45 s that attracted bullets, shrapnel, flechettes and other ballistic projectiles. This caused most of them to undergo violent trajectory alterations, often being forced on paths akin to an orbit around a gravity well until the effect ceased.\n\n* **Fragmentation Grenade:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSimilar alterations as with a combustion grenade with the addition, that the vortex was surrounded by multiple concentric rings of shrapnel orbiting it at high velocity.\n\n* **Demolition Charges:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLand mines had their explosive components removed and the trigger mechanism modified. When triggered, an area equal to the former blast radius will experience zero gravity for 4 seconds before a sudden surge of approximately 80 g crushes everything inside.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n\n+ **Appendix C: Extended Transmutation Log**\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Placata-Tuorium]]\n\n++ **Placata-Tuorium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 200 t of ice, 3,4 kg cadmium || 1 ingot (4,2 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 120 t of acrylic glass, 3,4 kg cadmium || 1 ingot (4,2 kg apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nComparable to pure iron in all physical properties, but of periwinkle colour. Develops a patina after extended exposure to humidity which shimmers like an oil film on water.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Handheld weapons:**\n\nWeapons of any kind were covered in a thin coating of Placata-Tuorium. Weapons enhanced this way can not be noticed by anyone unaware of its existence whilst holstered. This effect ceases once the weapon is drawn, subsequently becoming permanently perceivable for all observers.\n\n* **Business Attire:**\n\nAll buttons, zippers, cufflinks and metalware on the shoes were replaced with pure Placata-Tuorium. Operatives wearing the complete attire are unable to be consciously acknowledged (but not noticed) by sentient beings they do not perceive themselves.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Accudo-Dolositatium]]\n\n++ **Accudo-Dolositatium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 1500 kg of rock candy, 3200 kg of shakud\u014d\t|| 520 coins (4 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 2000 kg of rock candy, 400 kg electrum\t|| 700 coins (4 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nMalleable, glossy-golden material of high thermal conductivity. Reported to be dazzling even without sufficient light sources.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\n\nThe material is directly minted into coins of 14 mm diameter. These coins are considered to be extremely valuable by all persons without counter-memetic training and will invoke strong avaricious behaviour. They are eagerly accepted as payment by most people. Possession of the coins will lead to the development of addiction symptoms in the owner, leading to an every growing desire to acquire more of them.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nCreation of more coins requires approval by at least one off-site Administrative Command Executive due to high danger for Insurgency personnel.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Candesco-Celeritatium]]\n\n++ **Candesco-Celeritatium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 50 t of spent nuclear fuel\t|| 1 Bloom of 45 Ingots (800 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nAlloy of matte cupreous colour with a density of 10.3 g/cm\u00b3. The material has both high ductility and malleability. When exposed to air, it quickly tarnishes and develops a black shimmering patina; warming it to red heat reverses the process. Material acts as a Gamma and X-Ray mirror.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\n\nDuring the only run with this material, the Shifting Armoury used 39 ingots to create an armour suit both inspired by tactical gear of modern urban warfare and maximilian armour, with the helmet being a synergized shape between a stechhelm and full-face bike helmets. The leftover ingots might have been intended for accompanying weaponry and a set of wings comparable to those of the Polish Hussars, but the Shifting Armoury never finished them.\n\nWhen worn, the suit is manipulating kinetic forces applied on and by it by a factor increasing with its relative velocity. Inbound forces (including friction) become reduced, whereas the forces it exerts get increased by the same factor. This means the wearer can accelerate to high velocities on foot and punch holes into walls whilst taking direct hits of enemy fire without suffering damage.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nDuring the melting process, the Shifting Armoury exclaimed \"It stings!\"; following the event, its puppets were seen handling the liquid metal with great caution and tools mounted on long poles. It has refused working with radioactive material of any kind ever since.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Doleo-Tormenium]]\n\n++ **Doleo-Tormenium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 5,3 t salt, 86 kg human milk powder (equivalent to 520 l), 600 kg quartz || 1 boule (6,3 kg) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nIvory coloured, marbled, highly magnetostrictive metal. The surface is constantly exhibiting small ripples slowly moving across it, occasional resulting in the emergence of --[COGNITOHAZARD REDACTED]-- faint wailing.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Depth Charges:**\n\n\u25a1 \u25a1 --[REDACTED]-- \u25a1 \u25a1\n\n* **Grenade Launcher:**\n\n\u25a1 \u25a1 --[REDACTED]-- \u25a1 \u25a1\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nProduction of this material requires Alpha level authorization and facility wide lockdown procedures in place. Output is not allowed to come into contact with genetic material under any circumstances and must be handled by infertil personnel.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Mansuefacio-Gubernatium]]\n\n++ **Mansuefacio-Gubernatium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 31 t pig iron, 15 hides of kangaroo leather, 400 kg paraffin wax || 5 ingots (120 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nFinely grained, silvery alloy with a Vickert Hardness of approx. 7800 VH. Produces a highly excruciating ringing noise when brought to resonance.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Nevermore:**\n\nThe material was forged into a set of cages, chainmail gauntlets and a small raptor hood. Both the cage and the hood appear to have a sedating effect on the specimen, rendering them inert when inside and/or wearing. The gauntlet allows for an operative to carry a single specimen perched on their arm, keeping the specimen docile and unable to harm the current wearer (but not others) until released.\n\n* **Laser Sights:**\n\nThe outer frame of the optics were removed and replaced with pure Mansuefacio-Gubernatium. A click switch is present on the side, allowing to active the lasers alternative mode.\n\nThe purpose of this modification was unknown until tests in tandem with an equipped Nevermore specimen were conducted. Whereas exact implications remain unknown, this seemingly allows for laser-guiding of Nevermore specimen during attacks.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nNevermore behaved highly aggressive and uncooperative towards the Shifting Armoury, repeatedly attacking and destroying its puppets during their work when taking measurements of the specimen. In response, the Shifting Armoury lowered a great amount of new puppets into the working area to overwhelm Nevermore, subduing some specimen by dropping anvils onto them. None of the Items appear to have suffered lasting harm.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Rosa-Speculo]]\n\n++ **Rosa-Speculo**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 10kg Stramonium dust, 2000kg quartz, 1250kg bismuth || 5 panes (1kg each) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nPanes of glass 1 square meter in size. A slightly opaque luster that shows a rainbow sheen when illuminated. Gives the effects of stramonium dust when consumed.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Water:**\n\nMade into bottles capable of being fitted with a stopper. When water is added it becomes a cloudy purple liquid. When broken the bottle releases a gas cloud similar to that given off by David Wight. The cloud is proportionate with that of water allowed, with 6oz producing 8 square meters of the cloud. The cloud then persists for approximately 60 seconds before dissipating. The following combinations produce similar results except for the changes listed. Substances can be mixed to mix properties.\n\n* **Rubbing Alcohol:**\n\nCloud persists for 15 minutes before dissipating.\n\n* **Chlorophorm:**\n\nSubjects within the cloud who fall unconscious will no longer die. However, there has been a correlation with test subjects who fall unconscious being diagnosed with lung cancer within the following months.\n\n* **Ether:**\n\nSubjects caught in the cloud will become numb and have movement hindered. Hallucinations become stronger as well, with subjects claiming to see neon lights as well as strengthened previous effects.\n\n* **Human blood:**\n\nCloud becomes a dark crimson and will leave a sticky film to surfaces upon dissipating. If inhaled, the substance will condense and clog the bronchi branches in the lungs, often resulting in death. The film has also shown to render gas masks unusable.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n", "references": [], "tags": ["chaos-insurgency", "fantasy", "tale"], "title": "Shifting Armoury - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shifting-armoury", "year": 2026}, "sightseeing-canadian-problems": {"created_at": "2026-01-07T22:32:00", "creator": "Uncle Nicolini", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-07T22:32:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "Added tags: _cc, doctor-lillihammer, doctor-reynders, doctor-sokolsky, doctor-wettle, golden-horde, on-guard-43, tale.

Lillihammer stood opposite a wall, staring at it intently.</a></p>\n<p>She walked about the Theology and Teleology offices aimlessly, eyes still fixated upon the central rotunda's wall as she babbled nonsense. Truth be told, Dr. Lillihammer wasn't quite feeling herself, having become an Empty as a casualty of the capital \"B\" Breach and spent her days doing nothing. Naturally, this would upset Dr. Lillihammer, but as previously established, she was not quite feeling herself, so it wasn't too big of a deal. At least not for now.</p>\n<p>There was a flash just around the bend, accompanied by the shuffling of footsteps.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, everyone, stay close by and follow the flag!\" a middle-aged woman wearing a matching blue vest, button-up, and an ascot walked around the corner. She was carrying with with her a megaphone and a flag with her company's guided tour logo on it. Following her was a gaggle of twenty or so other men and women, all of them wielding cameras.</p>\n<p>\"We are currently in a highly important narrative area; the location where Dr. Lillihammer, who you can see standing over there \u2014\" she continued into the megaphone, bringing the group to a stop in front of the memetecist and pointing at her with the flag. \"\u2014 no flash photography please! She will remain standing here for most of the duration of this Deadline; her brain having been turned to mush by the Breach of 2003,\" she carried on as the guided tour began gawking and taking pictures.</p>\n<p>\"Three,\" Lillihammer agreed.</p>\n<p>\"Now, if you could all please follow me, I will be activating our spatial-temporal scramblers, as we are about to witness a key moment in the history of this Deadline, and meet someone we haven't met before!\" the tour guide momentarily bundled both objects she carried on her right arm, reached for her left wrist, and pressed a button. \"You might feel a slight discomfort, and remember, Nyorai Sightseeing is not responsible for temporal displacement as a result of interfering with the timeline, so please, hands and feet to yourselves!\"</p>\n<p>\"Yourselves.\" Lillihammer echoed.</p>\n<p>The group slowly faded into the background of the room they found themselves in just as a pair of footsteps began approaching. Eventually, they gave way to the appearance of Daniil Sokolsky in a tank top, khaki shorts and flip-flops. He stopped in front of her cocked head, and smiled sadly.</p>\n<p>\"Evening,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Evening,\" she said back.<br/>\n<br/></p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span><span style=\"color: #990011\">?????</span></span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>Unknown</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong>Nyorai Sightseeing Headquarters, Saitama Prefecture, Kanto, Japan</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Nyorai Sightseeing employee office reeked of stale cigarettes and air freshener, locked in a stalemate for dominance over which scent was more offensive.</p>\n<p>\"I can't believe they have me traveling to Canada \u2014\" Mizumi, one of the seniormost tour guides of the company, sighed between drags of her cigarette. \"\u2014 I don't care about Canada.

Please follow the flag!\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/if-they-like-you-i-like-you\">A short redhead woman accompanied by a squat, schlubby man walked towards the ADDC incinerator room from the document storage up ahead.</a> They were locked in conversation and not paying much attention to the shuffling of feet of the group of tourists.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. The anomalous document that killed Lyse\u2026 I have the last of it. It won't hurt anyone ever again.\" the woman walked towards the blast furnace, opening it up and tossing in a few documents into it. \"053213-12321-RVA abated.\"</p>\n<p>\"Noted. Do you think maybe you'll start your own family after this?\" the man asked.</p>\n<p>\"This is Dr. Ilse Reynders and her associate, Researcher Jackson Westwicke,\" Mizumi shout-whispered over the roaring of the blast furnace the other two were operating. The crowd <em>ooh'd</em> and <em>aah'd</em>, taking non-flash pictures in the dark. Mizumi knew better than to expect these pictures to look any sort of good, but telling the tourists that wasn't part of her job description, so she didn't bother. \"They are about to incinerate the fateful document which results in Dr. Reynders becoming SCP-5616,\" she added.</p>\n<p>More <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em>. More images. Due to the nature of her position, there was a lot she felt she could do to spare a lot of people a lot of suffering, but the timeline must be maintained. She was paid to be an apathetic observer, catering to people who enjoyed watching those about to suffer a great deal of misery, all while maintaining a smile on her face. She didn't know how Mako kept a smile on her face. Mizumi sighed, watching as Reynders and Jackson continued.</p>\n<p>\"053214-12413-RVD abated.\"</p>\n<p>\"Noted. But, Ilse, do you think you'll ever have a family of your own?\"</p>\n<p>\"053214-12437-RVE abated.

As if the voice alone were holding the door aloft, it shut immediately after with a gentle click.</p>\n<p>Mako and Kana dodged eye contact as if it would be the death of them. Mizumi swallowed spit and made her way toward the door, turning it open and entering.</p>\n<p>The way to the other side felt like an eternity. She could smell alcohol, cigars, and food up ahead, the combination of which made her dizzy. Pictures of various events Nyorai Sightseeing offered tours to populated the walls, warping into a colorful mishmash of rainbow vomit as she walked.</p>\n<p>Her trek down the hallway eventually came to an end, and she opened the door to her boss' office. She entered, and immediately saw him sitting behind his desk. There were papers strewn everywhere, a lit Cuban cigar resting between his fingers, a cold beer and bento box sitting on his desk, balding head, shitty mustache, and fat, greasy folds of flesh stuffed into a suit.</p>\n<p>\"Mizumi-kun,\" he smiled like the reaper does to a dead man, \"your most recent, shall we say, incident, has caused, quite the, heh, uproar.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry, Murata-sensei.

Lillihammer stood opposite a wall, staring at it intently.]]]\n\n\n\nShe walked about the Theology and Teleology offices aimlessly, eyes still fixated upon the central rotunda's wall as she babbled nonsense. Truth be told, Dr. Lillihammer wasn't quite feeling herself, having become an Empty as a casualty of the capital \"B\" Breach and spent her days doing nothing. Naturally, this would upset Dr. Lillihammer, but as previously established, she was not quite feeling herself, so it wasn't too big of a deal. At least not for now.\n\n\n\nThere was a flash just around the bend, accompanied by the shuffling of footsteps.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, everyone, stay close by and follow the flag!\" a middle-aged woman wearing a matching blue vest, button-up, and an ascot walked around the corner. She was carrying with with her a megaphone and a flag with her company's guided tour logo on it. Following her was a gaggle of twenty or so other men and women, all of them wielding cameras. \n\n\n\n\"We are currently in a highly important narrative area; the location where Dr. Lillihammer, who you can see standing over there \u2014\" she continued into the megaphone, bringing the group to a stop in front of the memetecist and pointing at her with the flag. \"\u2014 no flash photography please! She will remain standing here for most of the duration of this Deadline; her brain having been turned to mush by the Breach of 2003,\" she carried on as the guided tour began gawking and taking pictures.\n\n\n\n\"Three,\" Lillihammer agreed.\n\n\n\n\"Now, if you could all please\u00a0\u00a0follow me, I will be activating our spatial-temporal scramblers, as we are about to witness a key moment in the history of this Deadline, and meet someone we haven't met before!\" the tour guide momentarily bundled both objects she carried on her right arm, reached for her left wrist, and pressed a button. \"You might feel a slight discomfort, and remember, Nyorai Sightseeing is not responsible for temporal displacement as a result of interfering with the timeline, so please, hands and feet to yourselves!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yourselves.\" Lillihammer echoed.\n\n\n\nThe group slowly faded into the background of the room they found themselves in just as a pair of footsteps began approaching. Eventually, they gave way to the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0Daniil Sokolsky in a tank top, khaki shorts and flip-flops. He stopped in front of her cocked head, and smiled sadly.\n\n\n\n\"Evening,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Evening,\" she said back.\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=image nyorai.svg width=\"150px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ ##990011|?????##\n\n\n\n++ Unknown\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**Nyorai Sightseeing Headquarters, Saitama Prefecture, Kanto, Japan**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe Nyorai Sightseeing employee office reeked of stale cigarettes and air freshener, locked in a stalemate for dominance over which scent was more offensive.\n\n\n\n\"I can't believe they have me traveling to Canada \u2014\" Mizumi, one of the seniormost tour guides of the company, sighed between drags of her cigarette. \"\u2014 I don't care about Canada. Nobody does. Not even the boss. Who even says 'I want to visit Canada!?' Nobody, that's who.\" \n\n\n\n\"And yet, here we are, with more and more tourists wanting to visit Site-43 during the various Deadlines,\" Mako, one of the younger tour guides spoke up. \"Besides, you get to leave the country! How cool is that?\" \n\n\n\nMizumi rolled her eyes and made a face.\n\n\n\n\"It beats constant tours of Edo and repeatedly having to stop paradoxes from happening from all the careless tourists,\" the third present tour guide, a middle aged woman with crow's feet named Kana chuckled, sparking up her own cigarette. \n\n\n\n\"What's Canada like, Mizumi-senpai?\" asked Mako.\n\n\n\n\"Cold.\"\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n+ ##990011|1943##\n\n++ 31 December\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\nA flash.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, everyone, I must ask you all keep quiet and not take flash photography images for this part of the tour,\" Mizumi spoke in a hushed tone, motioning for the tour group to follow after her with her flag as they skulked through the ADDC's cramped backrooms. \"Stay close to me! Please follow the flag!\"\n\n\n\n[[[if-they-like-you-i-like-you|A short redhead woman accompanied by a squat, schlubby man walked towards the ADDC incinerator room from the document storage up ahead.]]] They were locked in conversation and not paying much attention to the shuffling of feet of the group of tourists. \n\n\n\n\"Yes. The anomalous document that killed Lyse\u2026 I have the last of it. It won't hurt anyone ever again.\" the woman walked towards the blast furnace, opening it up and tossing in a few documents into it. \"053213-12321-RVA abated.\"\n\n\n\n\"Noted. Do you think maybe you'll start your own family after this?\" the man asked.\n\n\n\n\"This is Dr. Ilse Reynders and her associate, Researcher Jackson Westwicke,\" Mizumi shout-whispered over the roaring of the blast furnace the other two were operating. The crowd //ooh'd// and //aah'd//, taking non-flash pictures in the dark. Mizumi knew better than to expect these pictures to look any sort of good, but telling the tourists that wasn't part of her job description, so she didn't bother.\u00a0\u00a0\"They are about to incinerate the fateful document which results in Dr. Reynders becoming SCP-5616,\" she added.\n\n\n\nMore //oohs// and //aahs//. More images. Due to the nature of her position, there was a lot she felt she could do to spare a lot of people a lot of suffering, but the timeline must be maintained. She was paid to be an apathetic observer, catering to people who enjoyed watching those about to suffer a great deal of misery, all while maintaining a smile on her face. She didn't know how Mako kept a smile on her face. Mizumi sighed, watching as Reynders and Jackson continued.\n\n\n\n\"053214-12413-RVD abated.\"\n\n\n\n\"Noted. But, Ilse, do you think you'll ever have a family of your own?\"\n\n\n\n\"053214-12437-RVE abated. I don't know, what kind of question is that?\"\n\n\n\nAs if on cue, Mizumi activated the group's spatial-temporal scramblers.\n\n\n\n\"How am I meant to know? I'm not an oracle, Jackson. Besides, there's so much that I\u2014\"\n\n\n\nThe tourists clapped and took pictures as the explosion rocked the ADDC.\n\n\n\n[[=image nyorai.svg width=\"150px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ ##990011|?????##\n\n\n\n++ Unknown\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**Nyorai Sightseeing Headquarters, Saitama Prefecture, Kanto, Japan**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"Oh, don't be a sourpuss, Mizumi-senpai!\" Mako laughed. \"Come on, tell us something interesting about it!\" \n\n\n\n\"There's nothing interesting about it. It's just our usual fair. People dying, people suffering, people wishing they could take actions back. But it's all futile. None of it matters. None of this,\" she gestured vaguely, then put out her cigarette on an ashtray, \"matters.\" \n\n\n\n\"Jeez, Mizumi-chan, you sound really upset. Maybe you should ask Murata-sensei to switch you back to domestic tours?\" Kana mumbled.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I'm going to be staying at this job much longer anyway,\" Mizumi ripped the ascot off her neck and tossed it to the ground.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" Mako and Kana both balked.\n\n\n\n\"I fucked up.

As if the voice alone were holding the door aloft, it shut immediately after with a gentle click. \n\n\n\nMako and Kana dodged eye contact as if it would be the death of them. Mizumi swallowed spit and made her way toward the door, turning it open and entering. \n\n\n\nThe way to the other side felt like an eternity. She could smell alcohol, cigars, and food up ahead, the combination of which made her dizzy. Pictures of various events Nyorai Sightseeing offered tours to populated the walls, warping into a colorful mishmash of rainbow vomit as she walked.\n\n\n\nHer trek down the hallway eventually came to an end, and she opened the door to her boss' office. She entered, and immediately saw him sitting behind his desk. There were papers strewn everywhere, a lit Cuban cigar resting between his fingers, a cold beer and bento box sitting on his desk, balding head, shitty mustache, and fat, greasy folds of flesh stuffed into a suit.\n\n\n\n\"Mizumi-kun,\" he smiled like the reaper does to a dead man, \"your most recent, shall we say, incident, has caused, quite the, heh, uproar.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, Murata-sensei.

There, in front of them, was the core of the disaster caused in the facility.</p>\n<p>Their journey to the origin of the anomaly had been long and dangerous, especially because of the unfortunate encounters they had with the infected. All the corpses were properly tagged as they made their way, the hostiles neutralized, and the rooms cleared. The only thing left was to figure out how to quickly and safely rescue the scientists currently barricaded inside.</p>\n<p>Some members of the team looked at each other for a few seconds, trying to come up with some kind of strategy to break the barrier that separated them from the researchers until agent Steffano Gonz\u00e1lez decided to break the silence.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cV\u00edctor? You got anything?\u201d said Steffano, as he slowly approached the young man.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Agent V\u00edctor Penz looked up briefly from his notebook. He was making use of the short break to update his map with notes about the area. His activity was interrupted by his teacher\u2019s question, which he complained about under his breath before setting about reviewing the situation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cLet me see.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>In front of them, a bizarre and gruesome combination of a mucilage-like substance and pieces of fungus formed a barrier, stretching across the doorway and between the hall leading to the room where the scientists were barricaded.</p>\n<p>After checking the surroundings and thinking for a few seconds, he raised his voice again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cDoes anyone know if this thing is fire resis- Bah\u2026 No. Nevermind. You.\u201d He said pointing directly to agent Turner. \u201cDo you have a lighter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck would I have a lighter and not any othe-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have one or not?\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShocked by the agent\u2019s audacity, Rex simply looked at him with a raised eyebrow and started to search in his backpack. After a few moments, he rudely threw a lighter at Victor.</p>\n<p>Victor took a small sample of the fungus from a nearby wall. He lit the lighter on and when he brought it close to the flame, the sample disintegrated while releasing a smoke of greenish-blue spores.</p>\n<p>After observing the smoke for a few seconds and with his doubt cleared up, he proceeded to explain his plan:<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cI thought about this: We could use the alcohol and the lighter to burn the first line of whatever the fuck is covering the door. Perhaps we could improvise an incendiary device with what we have in our equipment. The more area we cover, the better. Meanwhile, dividing ourselves into two groups, one for civilians and the other for any possible threats. You all heard on the radio that there are infecteds inside, so we have to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Everybody meditated about it for a few seconds, before the silence was broken by a sarcastic laugh from Agent Turner.</p>\n<p>Penz just watched, confused and frowning</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe cannot do that.\u201d Said Marcelo as he took a few steps forward. \u201cThe release of spores into the environment when incinerating whatever that is\u2026 It may not be as harmful to us since we have the right equipment, but we must consider those who are inside. However,\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe Portuguese agent extracted a CBRN kit from his equipment and his partner did the same, taking his own out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve now noticed that the substance dissolves very easily when stimulated, such as by setting it on fire, so, to put it simply, we can try something using the basic chemical containment equipment\u2026 It isn\u2019t much, since we weren\u2019t expecting something of this magnitude, but it may be more than useful to dissolve whatever lies ahead, at least in not too excessive amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nRex slowly approached the door blocked by the viscous mucilage and proceeded to take a couple samples to insert them into tubes very similar to traditional laboratory test tubes, with the only difference that these were covered with warning stickers of different types, alongside the distinctive logos of the Beta-7 task force and The Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo carefully observed the various encapsulated chemical agents he carried as he read a guide that came with the kit.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cSamples ready.\u201d Rex shouted to Marcelo. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna isolate these for a second and I\u2019ll let you try them with the solvents we have. Let's see if we strike a bit of luck here for the first time in the division\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead\u201d Marcelo stretched out his arm wearing an oversized yellow glove over the equipment they had brought previously, receiving the tubes Rex handed him. \u201cNow cross your fingers and stay back in case of any adverse reactions that may occur.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAgents Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and Penz simply waited nearby, with the kind of admiration one would expect when watching a highly skilled team at work. Everybody knew that interrupting the process could be a waste of time and, therefore, would risk not being able to evacuate the civilians alive.</p>\n<p>The mucilage from inside the vials glowed faintly. One by one, Marcelo poured the reagents. Variations of \u201cvoriconazole\u201d, \"quinoxyfen\", \u201cimidazole\u201d and some \u201cEchinocandins\u201d. All carefully labelled so that their reactions to the fungal agent could be measured and identified.</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, the differences in some of the tubes were extremely noticeable. One in particular showed a visible structural change, which Marcelo reported to Rex. Both agents analyzed it and then agreed, finally they shared the result with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWell, as you can see\u2026\u201d Marcelo raised the sole disposable tube he had in his hand for a few seconds,enough time for the rest of the team to see it. \u201cWe suppose that this is what we are looking for. The reaction was as expected\u2026 But to be sure, I\u2019ll need the lighter.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nPenz threw the lighter back to Rex, who looked at him reluctantly for a few seconds and then passed it to Marcelo. The agent carefully took out part of the sample from the vial and passed it over the flame. The sample disappeared in a matter of seconds, but this time no spores could be seen. Evidently, it had worked.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cHa, ha! Perfect, now, what was the plan of action you said before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBurn everything blocking the entrance and the room before the containment room so we can get in. Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and you would go for the civilians, Turner and I for the hostiles. There's no clear view of how many are in there, so it's best to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Everyone looked at V\u00edctor for a moment before nodding slightly and moving on to the execution.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cSo, first\u2026\u201d Rex shouted as he laboriously prepared enough reagent to break down the mucilage that was blocking the passage. \u201cWe need to spread this across as much surface area as possible.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo was preparing a small yellow tank with a hose similar to a fire extinguisher, which they were going to use to cover the area with the chemical. As he was spraying the organic wall, the fungus wriggled and pulsed to the contact with the solvent. When the task was done, he took a few steps back and put the equipment away again.</p>\n<p>A spark from the lighter, and the wall in front of them vanished almost immediately. In the front room, clusters of hyphae blocked the way like vines. Marcelo reached out and gave one of them a slight pull, which was enough to break it. They were not going to be an obstacle for the team anymore.</p>\n<p>Watching the situation unfold, Victor signaled to the others to review the entry plan. The agents Ibarra, Gonzalez and Oliveira would enter the observation room and would be responsible for extracting the civilians, while Turner and him would go for the remaining hostiles in the containment room.</p>\n<p>With the plan established and their weapons drawn, both teams headed through the hyphae maze hanging from the ceiling. With a quick movement of his hand, Victor pointed to the darkest side of the room as he walked slowly to the end of the hall that led to the entrance of both rooms. Once there, he signaled via radio to announce his arrival at the door covered in mucilage, where the presence of hostiles was presumed.</p>\n<p>Rex took a combat knife from his backpack and made some cuts in the remaining mucilage between the door separating the two agents and the dark room with its dim turquoise light. Victor, with one of his hands resting on Rex\u2019s shoulder, approached and illuminated the room with the lantern attached to his shotgun.</p>\n<p>On the other side, several deformed hostiles laid staring at the ceiling of the room. In a corner, a grotesque mass made of some biological compound, similar to the stem of a plant, vibrated and pulsed constantly, giving off faint and intermittent flashes of light.</p>\n<p>Silence reigned for a moment as both agents watched the various humanoid figures writhe in agony, scratching their bodies in an attempt to take off some pieces of scales that seemed to serve as natural armor.</p>\n<p>V\u00edctor lightly pushed Rex aside as he extracted a stun grenade from a compartment of his equipment.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOne. Two. Three!\u201d the agent shouted before dropping the explosive inside the room and moving away so as not to be hit by its effect.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A gruesome scene was shown unfolding inside the room where the rescue team entered.</p>\n\n<p>Two scientists were unconscious, sitting with their backs against the wall. Both had chemical protective coveralls, which seemed to have protected them from the infection that affected the other scientists in the area.</p>\n<p>Steffano and Ibarra approached each scientist, trying to check their vital signs and carrying them to the vicinity of the entrance door.</p>\n<p>A radio transmission indicated that V\u00edctor and Rex had reached their objective, to which Steffano responded positively.</p>\n<p>Marcelo illuminated the room with his flashlight in hand, panning it around as he approached a large table in the center of the room. On the table lay the last scientist using the protective coverall in a prone position.</p>\n<p>Oliveira quickly noticed and he immediately approached the subject, turning him over and positioning him correctly on the ground.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGuys, over here!\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Steffano approached Marcelo, who was slowly examining the unconscious scientist.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Marcelo desperately pressed a section of the suit near the neck. \u201cI need tape, or something similar. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ibarra checked the contents of his backpack, looking for an efficient alternative.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe suit is broken. We need to seal it immediately\u201d Marcelo responded as he pressed the suit with one hand and checked his backpack with the other one. \u201cI'm going to put a simple oxygen mask on him to counteract any pathogens that may have entered the system, but I need to seal this up right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be in any state of infection beyond loss of consciousness.\u201d Steffano pointed out. \u201cThat doesn't mean anything, of course, but I would like to know what led these people to the state they are in.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSteffano knelt down beside the subject and started to press the suit, replacing Marcelo, who was focused on putting the mask in the small tear. Ibarra took out a tape of considerable length and began to secure the area of the break after the two agents had finished their work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe have to drag them to the door. There, we'll carry each one on our shoulders and see if we can get them out that way. There is no other way, for now.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Marcelo agreed unanimously and began to carry the unconscious men to the doorway. In that moment, the rumble of a nearby explosion, followed by the sound of several detonations, put the three agents on alert.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The explosion of the stun grenade made the hostiles writhe and screech in pain, searching for the source of the explosion. V\u00edctor slapped Rex\u2019s back strongly, who instantly entered, firing his assault rifle on the two nearby hostiles. V\u00edctor took advantage of the opportunity to blast his shotgun towards the other two hostiles, who were immediately ejected by the force of the shots.</p>\n<p>Rex came close to the creatures he shot, who were still moving erratically, even with the prominent holes in the soft parts of his skin.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cUgh. Bloody hell!\u201d he shouted before drawing his secondary weapon and emptying the magazine on the monsters.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nV\u00edctor approached the other two hostiles with methodical and precise movements to shoot them, and executed them both with a single, clean shot on the head.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201c<em>Bichos de mierda.</em>\u201d Said Penz, answering Rex\u2019s shouts.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBetween the commotion and the heavy breathing, both agents approached the fleshy nucleus that breathed in one of the corners of the room.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cI don't know what this is, but I think we both agree that it\u2019s the reason we are here in the first place, innit?\u201d Asked Rex, as he took out the tank they had used to spray the chemical against the mucilage earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely. What I\u2019m not sure about is, if trying to destroy this thing might be a good idea.\u201d Penz answered, concerned, after seeing his colleague with the tank in his hands. \u201cWe don't know what the consequences might be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Rex began to spray the chemical over the nucleus, before pausing to contemplate. \u201cI think it is a good idea to get rid of the contamination source. I don\u2019t know what the consequences might be, but I don\u2019t think it could be worse than this.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe creatures the agents thought had previously been defeated began to shake and convulse frantically in the same place where they had been left.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit, uh\u2026 God damn it, just do it, ok? We\u2019ll complain later.\u201d V\u00edctor pointed his weapon at the creatures. \u201cCome on! Hurry up!\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nRex finished emptying the contents of the tank on the surroundings and lit all the area on fire before running away, dragging V\u00edctor by part of his suit.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Outside the rooms there were Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and Oliveira with the civilians on their shoulders. Gonzalez tried to adjust the radio to communicate with the other two agents, to no avail.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe should start moving, the civilians are top priority.\u201d Said Marcelo</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know that,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez replied, slightly frustrated. \u201cJust\u2026 give me a moment, I\u2019ll try once more and then-\u201c Steffano was interrupted by another loud rumbling, followed by a beam of light coming from the back room.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>From the back, Victor and Rex ran out at full speed, almost bumping into the walls, while shouting at the top of their lungs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGET OUT, NOW!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRUN!\u201d shouted V\u00edctor as he ran towards the others as fast as he could.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBehind the agents, the hostiles who had supposedly been taken down ran out of the room at full speed. They were being incinerated as they ran, but it didn't seem to affect them, bullet holes could be seen all over their bodies.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWhat the fu-\u201d Steffano shouted before running slowly because of the load he was carrying \u201cWhat the hell just happened there?\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Marcelo just started running, taking the lead for the whole team. V\u00edctor and Rex ran behind the rest of the agents, pointing at the hostile that were rushing at full speed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t the time, not now!\u201d Answered Rex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn the distance, it could be seen how the fire carried by the hostiles began to burn the surroundings with every step they took, creating a blazing tide that advanced alongside them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d Penz throwed another stun grenade, which ended up getting lost in the rush, without being effective.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe mucilage started glowing strongly, spreading over the heels of the agents who were running to escape from the lower part of the facility.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPenz, the door!\u201d Rex shouted, signing with one of his hands indicating the security gate through which they had initially entered.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nVictor froze for a split second, processing the order Rex surprisingly gave him, then sprinted quickly towards the door, taking the lead.</p>\n<p>Ibarra and Oliveira watched in confusion as Penz sprinted at full speed and positioned himself on the left side of the security gate. During the confusion, Turner took up position behind Gonz\u00e1lez and began sprinting backwards, shooting at the hostiles as an attempt to slow down the imminent march of the enemies.</p>\n<p>The run lasted only a few minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Oscar and Marcelo arrived first, drew their secondary weapon and pointed towards the hallway where Steffano and Rex were approaching with the enemies hot on their heels.</p>\n<p>Seconds after, and by a matter of luck, Steffano passed through the security gate alongside Rex, who did an excellent job keeping in line the anomalies as V\u00edctor typed some numbers on the security console, finally closing the gate and keeping everyone safe.</p>\n<p>All the agents stood still for a few seconds, breathing heavily and processing what had just happened.</p>\n<p>Without saying a word, everyone began to climb the stairs. Rex and V\u00edctor tried to help the others, without interrupting their walk.</p>\n<p>The stairs seemed to stretch on endlessly due to the effects of fatigue, but the adrenaline kept the agent on the rails. Everyone climbed slowly and walked the last stretch of the way out of the facility with difficulty.</p>\n<p>Limping and in pain, those carrying the civilians went from walking slowly to jogging. At the front of the installations, the giant gates swung open, allowing an entire task force to enter.</p>\n<p>Steffano shouted some instructions, and most of the task force passed by the agents, going directly to the location from which they had just come. Another couple of agents of the task force stopped and helped the group carry the civilians, while providing support so that they could walk with less difficulty.</p>\n<p>Once outside, the scene was completely different from what they had encountered when they first arrived.</p>\n<p>Several helicopter fleets circled the facility. Tents of different colors were arranged throughout the perimeter. Some red tents gave medical support to the civilians that could have been harmed during the breach. Some of those provided psychological assistance, and others simply displayed an assortment of weapons for the agents who recently arrived on the scene for the intervention.</p>\n<p>The specially trained mobile task forces were the most noticeable above the scene, with oversized suits and specialized equipment, forming brigades with the other agents who were gathering at the doors of the facilities.</p>\n<p>The entire team was intervened by two groups of personnel; some wore full-body grey suits, while others were dressed as doctors and nurses. The latter retrieved the civilians from the shoulder of the agents carrying them, and disappeared from the scene to keep them safe, while the men in gray gave instructions to guide them to a tent of the same color, a bit further away from the rest.</p>\n<p>Once inside, the entire team was instructed to follow an emergency cleaning and chemical decontamination protocol. They were disarmed from their equipment and stripped down to their underwear and were sprayed with various chemical agents for disinfection.</p>\n<p>Once they finished the process, they dried themselves before moving to the next section of the tent, where the bags they had left outside before the operation were being kept.

Shouldn't you be taking this to Merlo? Or is she too busy ignoring our extradition requests?\"</p>\n<p>The mention of Anderson, even obliquely, causes Shaw to wince. Spencer guesses that she was part of the task force that <a href=\"/bal-chatri\">ambushed Vincent Anderson</a> as <a href=\"/falcon-flight\">he fled Portlands</a>, snatching the megalomaniac genius and wanted felon right out from under the nose of the UIU.

Holman won't approve an op without concrete evidence. Everyone thinks I'm grasping at straws to find a way to stay involved in the action.\" The hurt in Shaw's voice is obvious.</p>\n<p>Spencer has enough tact to not press that issue. But he still doesn't want to get involved. His partner, forensic thaumatologist Robin Thorne, is taking a much-needed vacation with their significant other, leaving him to supervise the Three Portlands Field Office alone.</p>\n<p>So far, it has been blissfully monotonous and uneventful, and he hopes to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry to hear that Clarissa, but I fail to see why this is my problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because Shaq is an American citizen, and if he's been replaced by a Saker, then he might be in danger. And because if there's a Saker still out there, we have no idea what it will do now that Anderson is in custody. It may very well go on a rampage, or try to kill the President. Anderson has already tried to subvert the United States Government. Can you really afford to ignore a Saker, especially one as prominent as Shaq?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If</em> there's a Saker,\" Spencer counters. But he has to give the point to Shaw. If she's right \u2014 <em>if</em> \u2014 then he has to act. Anything less would be negligence.</p>\n<p>He picks up the folder and cracks it open. He starts leafing through the files within.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\" He removes a photograph and holds it up to examine it more closely. It's a side-by-side comparison of two still frames of Shaquille O'Neal from <em>Inside the NBA</em>, date-stamped a week apart. Shaw had used red marker pen to circle a number of differences, all barely perceptible.</p>\n<p>Spencer looks up from the photograph at Shaw. Looks back at the photograph. Back at Shaw.</p>\n<p>She desperately needs a win. Far more than he needs things to stay boring.</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm convinced.\"</p>\n<p>He throws the folder back on the desk and stands up, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and sliding it on in a smooth, well-practiced motion.

I'd rather have a wizard backing us up.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shrugs. \"We're just here to ask a few questions and see if we can confirm our suspicions. We can always come back later with wizard SWAT if we're right.\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose. I still don't like it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, you came to me. If you don't like how we do things in the Unit, you can always leave.\"</p>\n<p>They fall silent at the sound of someone unlocking the door.</p>\n<p>Shaq opens the door.</p>\n<p>Spencer shuffles nervously, his cool facade crumbling slightly in the face of all seven feet and one inch of the basketball player's enormous frame.</p>\n<p>\"Hi, Mr. O'Neal. I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer\u2014\" He holds up his badge as proof, then gestures at Shaw. \"\u2014and this is Agent Clarissa Shaw. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?\"</p>\n<p>Shaq hesitates. \"Is it urgent? I'm working on a new album, and I had a sick freestyle going.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm very sorry to interrupt you,\" Spencer says. \"But we have reason to believe you might be in danger.\"</p>\n<p>\"We think someone might be impersonating you,\" Shaw says, which is almost the truth.</p>\n<p>\"Have you noticed anything strange?\" Spencer asks. \"Unusual activity on your accounts, other people remembering interactions that you didn't have, weird phone calls, anything like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, nothing like that.\" Shaq sighs. \"I bet I know what's up.\" He leans closer and says, in a stage whisper, \"I have a stunt double, back from making <em>Steel</em>. Great guy, terrible at basketball. Sometimes people see him in public and think he's me. You dig it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I dig it.\" Spencer smiles brightly. \"Shaq didn't have a stunt double for that movie. They couldn't find a tall enough look-a-like.\"</p>\n<p>Panic flashes across Shaq's face. \"Fuck!\"</p>\n<p>He slams the door shut.</p>\n<p>Shaw groans. \"We've been made. He's definitely a Saker, and he knows we're onto him.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods. \"You know, I think you might be right.\" He pulls out his pistol and holds it at the ready below his waist. \"Can you cover the front? I'm gonna try to circle around and cut him off.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you really suggesting we split up so it can pick us off one-by-one?\"</p>\n<p>But he's already jogging across the driveway, scanning for an easy spot to vault over the wall and into the backyard.</p>\n<p>He's still standing in the driveway when, a moment later, an engine roars and a cherry red Corvette smashes through the garage door. In fact, he's directly in its path.</p>\n<p>The car hits Spencer at about five miles per hour, lifting him from the ground and folding him up against the hood. He clings desperately to the car with one hand, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Miraculously, his other hand still holds his pistol.</p>\n<p>He aims vaguely and starts firing. His first shot goes wide. His second shot gouges the hood. His third shot takes out the driver-side mirror.</p>\n<p>The Corvette accelerates and weaves down the driveway, trying to throw him off, or at least ruin his aim. His pistol goes flying, tumbling into the grass of the lawn. He starts swearing, random curse words from a variety of languages, and tries to hold on with both hands.</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot takes the corner at the end of the driveway hard. Really hard. The Corvette goes up on two wheels for a moment, and Spencer goes flying. He lands in a patch of dandelions across the street, bruised, battered, and winded, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The Corvette speeds off down the street and vanishes from view.</p>\n<p>Shaw rolls down the driveway and looks down at him. \"Do you want to call for backup now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I think so.\" Spencer rubs his back and winces. \"Did you see which way he was going?\"</p>\n<p>\"South,\" Shaw saws. \"He's probably getting onto State Route 482.\"</p>\n<p>\"That'll take him to the airport.\" He groans as he stands up and starts dusting dandelion fluff off his pants.</p>\n<p>\"Great, let's go, we can catch him there.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shakes his head. \"No, we're not engaging in the middle of MCO. It would be a blood bath.\" He pulls out his phone and begins to dial.</p>\n<p>\"What\u2014?\"</p>\n<p>He holds up a hand to cut her off and starts speaking into the phone.</p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/quinn-law-hub\">Agent Carter</a>? Ken Spencer here, from the Three Ports office. I need a favor from you.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses to listen.</p>\n<p>\"I need an APB for Shaquille O'Neal. He's driving a red Corvette without a left-side wing mirror, and is likely en route to Orlando International Airport. Tell local cops and TSA not to engage or try to detain, just observe. I want to know what flight he gets on and when.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses again. Shaw can't hear the words being said, but the voice on the other end of the line sounds agitated.</p>\n<p>\"No, he's been replaced by a robot.\"</p>\n<p>Another pause.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, it's related to the Caldwell thing. It's a matter of national security.\"</p>\n<p>The voice sounds slightly mollified.</p>\n<p>Spencer laughs. \"Thanks, Isaac. I owe you one.\"</p>\n<p>He closes the phone and looks at Shaw. \"In your expert opinion, do you believe that there is a clear and exigent threat to the life of Shaquille O'Neal?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw blinks. \"It's possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"And is it possible that we might find him inside this residence, or, failing that, information regarding his current location?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"Sure, I guess.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer smiles like a shark. \"I'm willing to call that exigent circumstances.\" He pulls a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and snaps them on. \"Let's search the place.\"</p>\n<p>They move methodically, sweeping through each room with practiced patience, checking everything \u2014 opening drawers, lifting up cushions, looking under furniture. Spencer even checks the dust on the bookshelves to see which books have recently been moved. They're looking for any clue that might tell them where the real Shaq is \u2014 if he's even still alive.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after almost forty minutes of searching, Shaw finds something.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, come take a look at this!\" she calls out.</p>\n<p>Spencer comes over to find her pointing at a framed photograph next to the entertainment center.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\" he asks. The photo shows Shaq performing as a DJ at some event.</p>\n<p>\"Look at that, do you see it? Reflected in his sunglasses.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer leans in for a better look. Shaq is in a nightclub somewhere, performing on an elevated stage above a crowded dance floor. A dozen different colors of muted neon light the scene, giving it an otherworldly vibe.</p>\n<p>Reflected in the left lens of Shaq's sunglasses, almost too small to make out, is a small logo, probably from a neon sign outside the nightclub.</p>\n<p>It's the logo of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.</p>\n<p>\"Fucking hell.\" Spencer picks up the photograph and holds it up to the light. \"That's in Eurtec.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or somewhere with a Coalition presence,\" Shaw says.</p>\n<p>\"No, it's definitely Eurtec. Look at that guy's wrist.\" Spencer points at an arm thrusting up from the dance floor into the bottom of the photograph. \"Do you see the tattoo?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw squints, then nods. \"What about it?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's the insignia of a neo-Nazi Eurtec street gang.\"</p>\n<p>\"So he's been to Eurtec,\" Shaw says. \"Which means he's clued in about the Veil.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which explains why someone might want to replace him with a robot.\" Spencer sets the photograph back down and begins to pace. \"This isn't looking good. He might be in real trouble.\"</p>\n<p>At that moment, Spencer's phone rings, merrily playing the X-Files theme. He answers the phone immediately, pointedly ignoring Shaw's curious look.</p>\n<p>\"Go for Spencer,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He listens intently for about thirty seconds, then hangs up.</p>\n<p>\"Robot's taking a flight to Paris,\" he tells Shaw. \"Plane leaves in thiry minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's in Paris?\" she asks.</p>\n<p>Spencer looks at the photograph of Shaq DJing. \"Eurtec.\"</p>\n<p>Understanding dawns in Shaw's eyes. \"It's looking for Shaq.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe.\" Spencer frowns. \"Is that typical of Sakers?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw shrugs. \"We don't really know what's typical of Sakers.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought you guys were the experts.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, that's the guy who makes them. We just know how to break them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's hope that's enough.\" Spencer starts dialing another number. \"I assume you don't have Library access, yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, why? Who are you calling?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Someone who can give us a Way to Eurtec that doesn't go through the Library.\" He lifts the phone to his ear and starts speaking. \"Hello, <a href=\"/much-belated-inheritance\">Mister Raybon</a>? This is Agent Spencer. How'd you like to do a good deed? The life of Shaquille O'Neal might depend on it.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Eurtec</strong></p>\n<p>It takes Spencer and Shaw two hours to get to Eurtec, following the directions given to them by Jordan \"Submarine\" Raybon. The retired smuggler knows how to get to anywhere from anywhere, although not always by the most direct route. He gives them a path through the Way network that will take them from Orlando to Naples, Italy. Although it's only a few miles of walking in total, by the time the two agents are standing before a Way into Eurtec they've passed through the Neverglades; Naples, Florida; Liminal Italy; the Kingdom of Zero Sicilies; and half-a-dozen other locales across the world tree.</p>\n<p>\"You ever been to Eurtec?\" Spencer asks.</p>\n<p>Shaw shakes her head. \"No, the Coalition doesn't like us being here.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't imagine why.\" He starts ticking off points on his fingers. \"It's bigger than Three Ports, by a lot, and meaner. The Coalition mostly doesn't give a fuck about street crime. The city is physically and economically stratified, and neo-Nazi gangs control the lower levels. We won't have any real authority, so don't tell anyone you're with the Foundation, it'll just piss people off. You can bring weapons through customs but it probably won't help \u2014 almost everyone is armed with something, usually magic.\"</p>\n<p>\"What about wheelchair access?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>Spencer frowns. \"Worse than an American city, better than anywhere in baseline Europe. There used to be a teleporter network but they shut it down after 9/11.\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn, that would have been nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't have anything nice in the United Nations' cyberpunk dystopia.\" Spencer chuckles, once, before his expression turns serious again. \"For real though, this place makes Portlands look like a fluffy kitten \u2014 and I have seen Portlandsers spontaneously construct and burn an effigy of J. Edgar Hoover purely out of boredom.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you blame them?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"No, and it was a pretty decent likeness, but that's not the point. Just being American will make us a target here. Don't let your guard down.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"Understood. I'll keep my eyes open.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer steps forwards to confront the blank brick wall of the Neopolitan alleyway. He pulls a crumpled slip of paper from his pocket and double-checks the instructions written on it.</p>\n<p>He clears his throat, knocks three times on a slightly off-color brick, and says, \"Let us leave good sense behind.\"</p>\n<p>The bricks glow for a moment, then crumble to sand and ash, exposing a small pedestrian tunnel. Spencer leads them through, emerging into what looks like an airport terminal. Over a dozen similar tunnels dot the wall behind them, with light pedestrian traffic going in and out of them.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you said there was customs?\" Shaw looks around for anything resembling security and comes up blank.</p>\n<p>\"The city is run by a bunch of precognitive computers. We cleared customs on the Way in. If we hadn't, you'd know.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw looks pensive. \"Could they tell us where Shaq is? Or where he will be?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shrugs. \"Probably. If they want to help us, then they'd have already done it \u2014 maybe they even have. But I doubt it. From what I've heard, the Nornir don't get involved. They have bigger things to worry about.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, like Yao Ming.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer barks out a short laugh. \"Sure. Like Yao Ming.\" He checks his watch. \"Come on, we have six hours to find Shaq. Then the Saker gets here, and I don't want to try playing spot the impostor.\"</p>\n<p>They both set a timer on their watches.</p>\n<p>\"How exactly are we going to find Shaq?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Some good old-fashioned police work,\" Spencer says. \"We're gonna canvas the city.\"</p>\n<p>\"All million people? In six hours?\" Shaw shakes her head. \"You're more likely to trip over him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" He stops the next passerby and holds up a Shaquille O'Neal basketball card. \"Excuse me, have you seen this man?\"</p>\n<p>The man nods. \"Shaq? Of course, I wouldn't miss him.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer glances at Shaw. She rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Where did you see him?\" Spencer asks.</p>\n<p>\"He was playing at Club Cipher,\" the man replies. \"But if you're hoping to catch him, he won't be there tonight. He's been playing a different venue every night.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods, feigning comprehension. \"Any idea where he'll be tonight?\"</p>\n<p>The man shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't get announced in advance. It's like a guerilla DJing thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, thank you. You've been very helpful.\" He lets the man continue on his way.</p>\n<p>\"Alright there's no way you're that lucky,\" Shaw says. \"What's your trick?\"</p>\n<p>\"That photo we saw of Shaq,\" Spencer says. \"He was playing at a club. I figured that if he was here and not, you know, a prisoner or dead, then there was a pretty good chance he'd be performing again.\"</p>\n<p>\"You never actually intended to canvas the whole city.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope! Just the nightclubs.\" Spencer grabs a tourist map of Eurtec from a nearby stand. \"And with a few educated guesses, we can narrow our search further.\"</p>\n<p>He pulls a pen from his pocket and crosses out Club Cipher.</p>\n<p>\"Right, if we know where he's been then we know where he won't be,\" Shaw says.</p>\n<p>\"And it might give us an idea of where he will be. Cipher is a dive, which suggests he's probably not playing any of the really upscale clubs \u2014 you know, the ones that charge a cover just to stand in line.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know so much about Eurtec?\" Shaw asks. \"The UIU doesn't have jurisdiction here \"</p>\n<p>\"No, but we have an international office here. For liaison purposes. I read their reports.\" Spencer shrugs. \"And I may have been here a few times on vacation.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw stares at him. \"I cannot picture you on vacation.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, I'm not a robot,\" he says. \"I take vacations too.\" He holds up the map, upon which he has drawn about a dozen circles. \"Here's our target list. Thirteen nightclubs in the city's lower level.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can we hit them all in six hours?\"</p>\n<p>\"We can try.\"</p>\n<p>They manage it, just barely. Canvassing the city's nightclubs takes them five hours and fifty minutes.</p>\n<p>Their first stop is Ewige Blumenkraft, an Illuminati-owned nightclub inside the Eurtec Parabotanical Gardens in the city's middle-tier. It is widely considered the lamest club in Europe, but the Illuminati have the money to pay for the best DJs, so people still go. The bouncer helpfully informs them that Shaq played there a week ago, and that the Achronal Hyacinth will be unblooming soon.</p>\n<p>Their second visit is to BROZ, a gay club inside the former Yugoslav consulate. The centerpiece is an unexploded bomb from the NATO intervention in Serbia, which is allegedly still armed. The bartender tells them that Shaq was there a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Next they hit the French clubs, Paradis \u2014 a discotheque inside a former Gothic church that was transported to Eurtec brick-by-brick \u2014 and Atomique \u2014 situated inside a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Neither club has seen \"Le Shaq\", but both have plans to book him soon.</p>\n<p>Valhalla is the first club to give them trouble. The abandoned mattress factory is overrun by neo-Nazi thugs, all benefiting from the lack of dram laws in Eurtec. It's obvious that Shaq hasn't been there, but they ask the bouncer anyways.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck off, cripple,\" he says to Shaw.</p>\n<p>The Foundation agent clenches her fists, causing the bouncer to laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Aw, you wanna fight, dyke?\" He takes a step back, up onto a step. \"What are you gonna do now?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer sucker punches him in the gut. The man collapses in a heap.</p>\n<p>\"That,\" Shaw says. \"Thanks for the assist.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fucking Nazis.\" Spencer spits on the fallen bouncer. \"Let's get out of here.\"</p>\n<p>The next club on their list is the Count, a bougie little opium den allegedly run by Dracula. The dance floor is packed by eager goths with plunging necklines all grinding to a club remix of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". Shaq has not played there.</p>\n<p>Borealis is another Nazi club. They skip it and move on to Volts, the only club to be exclusively located in virtual reality. Spencer orders a shot, just to see if viritual alcohol has any effect. It doesn't.</p>\n<p>They don't find Shaq until the ninth club, a high-end dive run by <a href=\"/truth-is-sin\">MachineGod</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Look, there's Shaq.\" Spencer points up at the stage where Shaq is playing.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, you were right,\" Shaw says. \"Point for old-fashioned police work, I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Come on, we don't have much time.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a loud scream cuts through the noise of the club. Spencer and Shaw turn to look at its origin. On the other side of the club, another Shaquille O'Neal has picked someone up and thrown them across the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\"Shaquille O'Neal!\" Its voice booms and reverberates unnaturally. Shaq stops playing and looks at the robot in confusion.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want?\" He calls down.</p>\n<p>\"Your life!\" The robot strides through the now-panicked crowd, easily cutting through the throng of bodies.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, the plane landed early,\" Spencer says. \"Shaw, can you distract it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? What's your plan?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer reaches elbow-deep into one of the extradimensional pockets of his suit and extracts a sawn-off shotgun. \"I'm gonna blow its head off.\"</p>\n<p>He slips into the crowd, vanishing from view. Shaw shakes her head, then starts wheeling herself towards the stage, not caring how many feet she runs over in the process.</p>\n<p>The Saker vaults onto the stage with surprising agility, landing in a three-point stance. It picks up the DJ deck and throws it directly at Shaq's head.</p>\n<p>Shaq ducks underneath the still-spinning turntables. With a yell, he charges the robot and tackles it, sending them both flying off the edge of the stage. With the robot pinned beneath him, Shaq rears back and throws a punch at its jaw.</p>\n<p>The Saker doesn't react.</p>\n<p>Shaq punches it again.</p>\n<p>The Saker catches the punch in one hand.</p>\n<p>With its other hand it grabs Shaq by the throat. It sits up, then clambers to its feet while holding the struggling Shaq. It still doesn't react to the stray kicks and wild punches that Shaq is pummeling it with.</p>\n<p>It lifts Shaq into the air with one arm and studies him. The sight is almost comical, except that it betrays the terrifying strength of the robot.</p>\n<p>\"There can't be two Shaqs,\" it explains. \"I cannot truly be Shaq as long as you live.\"</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot pulls its other arm back and prepares to punch Shaq in the face.</p>\n<p>Shaw does not have a plan. She has an idea which, very charitably, could be called the start of a plan.</p>\n<p>\"Freeze tin man!\" Shaw shouts out. She holds up a clenched fist. \"Let Shaq go, or I blow us all to hell.\"</p>\n<p>The robot freezes. \"Not you again! What do you want from me?\"</p>\n<p>\"I told you, let Shaq go.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Shaw sees Spencer creeping up behind the robot.</p>\n<p>\"And if I don't, you'll detonate a bomb?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"This wheelchair is packed with high explosives. Enough to destroy you.\" A loud click comes from her fist. \"And I just armed the dead-man's switch.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lady are you fucking crazy?\" Shaq shouts.</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot frowns. \"You're bluffing. You'd kill the other Shaq too.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw stares at the robot, pointedly avoiding looking at the approaching figure. \"You're gonna kill him anyways. I'm just here to destroy you.\"</p>\n<p>The Saker shakes its head. \"No. You are definitely bluffing. There is no bomb. I am going to kill Mr. O'Neal, and then I am going to kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wrong.\" Spencer pulls the trigger of the sawn-off shotgun, firing a heavy slug at point blank range into the back of the robot's neck.</p>\n<p>The Saker drops Shaq and stumbles forwards. It turns, unsteadily, to face Spencer. Sparks fly from exposed servos underneath its bionic skin.</p>\n<p>Spencer pumps the shotgun and fires another round into its torso.</p>\n<p>The robot throws up an arm to try and shield itself.</p>\n<p>He fires again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>The robot topples to its knees. Smoke and oil leak from it in a dozen places. Flaps of shredded skin hang loosely, revealing the mechanical components beneath. It stares at Spencer with hatred in its electric eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 just wanted.. to be Shaq\u2026\" it stutters.</p>\n<p>Shaw rolls her wheelchair closer. She draws her service pistol and places it against the side of the robot's head.</p>\n<p>\"There's only one Shaq,\" she says. \"And you aren't it.\"</p>\n<p>She pulls the trigger.</p>\n<p>The remains of the robot collapse to the floor with a clatter and a thump.</p>\n<p>Spencer gives Shaw a look. \"You don't actually have a bomb, right?\"</p>\n<p>She shakes her head and opens her fist to reveal a ballpoint pen. \"Nope, just a pen and some improv.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer laughs so hard that he has to put his hands on his knees to support himself. \"A fucking pen!\" He laughs again. \"Thorne is never gonna believe this.\"</p>\n<p>Shaq takes the opportunity to approach the two agents. \"Yo, what the fuck is going on here? Who the hell are you?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods, clearing his throat and composing himself. \"Mr. O'Neal, I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer of the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, and this is Clarissa Shaw. Someone replaced you with a human replica android. We were investigating.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that was me.\" Shaq looks slightly embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\"You replaced yourself with a robot?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, last time I was here there was this guy \u2014 I think his name was <a href=\"/ties-that-bind\">Isaac</a>? \u2014 anyways, he was selling these robots for use as body doubles. I got one to do <em>Inside the NBA</em> for me so I could do more DJing.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw and Spencer exchange glances.</p>\n<p>\"Well.\" Spencer pauses.</p>\n<p>\"It malfunctioned,\" Shaw says. \"And came here to try and kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, for real?\" Shaq whistles. \"Damn, I guess I should have seen that coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh, you never hear about the robots that don't go rogue and try to commit murder,\" Spencer says. \"I just hope you've learned something about the risks of using Veiled technologies.\"</p>\n<p>Shaq nods. \"Definitely. From now on the only magic I'll play with is Orlando.\"</p>\n<p>\"Glad to hear it.\" Spencer looks around at the now-empty nightclub. \"Shouldn't the police have gotten here by now?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw shrugs. \"Precog computers, remember? They probably know we've got a handle on it.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods. \"Yeah, I guess. Anything else, Shaw?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. O'Neal, do you care if we keep the remains of the robot to study?\"</p>\n<p>Shaq shakes his head. \"Not like I can return it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, then I think we're done here,\" Spencer says. \"It was a real pleasure meeting you, Mr. O'Neal.\"</p>\n<p>He turns to leave, then stops.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Mr. O'Neal, one last thing.\" Spencer clears his throat nervously. \"Can I have your autograph?\"</p>\n<div class=\"permanent-marker-regular\" style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 165%;\">\n<p>Agent Spencer,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Thanks for the assist.

It would certainly explain her injuries.\n\n\n\n\"Merlo has her hands tied. Now that Anderson is in custody, there isn't as much funding to go after his company. Holman won't approve an op without concrete evidence. Everyone thinks I'm grasping at straws to find a way to stay involved in the action.\" The hurt in Shaw's voice is obvious.\n\n\n\nSpencer has enough tact to not press that issue. But he still doesn't want to get involved. His partner, forensic thaumatologist Robin Thorne, is taking a much-needed vacation with their significant other, leaving him to supervise the Three Portlands Field Office alone.\n\n\n\nSo far, it has been blissfully monotonous and uneventful, and he hopes to keep it that way.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that Clarissa, but I fail to see why this is my problem.\"\n\n\n\n\"Because Shaq is an American citizen, and if he's been replaced by a Saker, then he might be in danger. And because if there's a Saker still out there, we have no idea what it will do now that Anderson is in custody. It may very well go on a rampage, or try to kill the President. Anderson has already tried to subvert the United States Government. Can you really afford to ignore a Saker, especially one as prominent as Shaq?\"\n\n\n\n\"//If// there's a Saker,\" Spencer counters. But he has to give the point to Shaw. If she's right -- //if// -- then he has to act. Anything less would be negligence.\n\n\n\nHe picks up the folder and cracks it open. He starts leafing through the files within.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\" He removes a photograph and holds it up to examine it more closely. It's a side-by-side comparison of two still frames of Shaquille O'Neal from //Inside the NBA//, date-stamped a week apart. Shaw had used red marker pen to circle a number of differences, all barely perceptible.\n\n\n\nSpencer looks up from the photograph at Shaw. Looks back at the photograph. Back at Shaw.\n\n\n\nShe desperately needs a win. Far more than he needs things to stay boring.\n\n\n\n\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n\nHe throws the folder back on the desk and stands up, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and sliding it on in a smooth, well-practiced motion. He looks at Shaw expectantly. \"Well? Saddle up, we're going robot hunting.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n**December 19, 2018**\n\n**Shaq's House**\n\n**Orlando, Florida**\n\n\n\nSpencer rings the doorbell.\n\n\n\n\"I still think we should have tried to get backup from MOOT,\" Shaw says while they wait.\n\n\n\n\"Thorne took out one of these things by themself, I think the two of us can handle one robot,\" Spencer replies. \"Besides, he might not even be here. He wasn't at the house in Texas.\"\n\n\n\n\"And if it is here? I'd rather have a wizard backing us up.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shrugs. \"We're just here to ask a few questions and see if we can confirm our suspicions. We can always come back later with wizard SWAT if we're right.\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose. I still don't like it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, you came to me. If you don't like how we do things in the Unit, you can always leave.\"\n\n\n\nThey fall silent at the sound of someone unlocking the door.\n\n\n\nShaq opens the door.\n\n\n\nSpencer shuffles nervously, his cool facade crumbling slightly in the face of all seven feet and one inch of the basketball player's enormous frame.\n\n\n\n\"Hi, Mr. O'Neal. I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer\u2014\" He holds up his badge as proof, then gestures at Shaw. \"\u2014and this is Agent Clarissa Shaw. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?\"\n\n\n\nShaq hesitates. \"Is it urgent? I'm working on a new album, and I had a sick freestyle going.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm very sorry to interrupt you,\" Spencer says. \"But we have reason to believe you might be in danger.\"\n\n\n\n\"We think someone might be impersonating you,\" Shaw says, which is almost the truth.\n\n\n\n\"Have you noticed anything strange?\" Spencer asks. \"Unusual activity on your accounts, other people remembering interactions that you didn't have, weird phone calls, anything like that?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, nothing like that.\" Shaq sighs. \"I bet I know what's up.\" He leans closer and says, in a stage whisper, \"I have a stunt double, back from making //Steel//. Great guy, terrible at basketball. Sometimes people see him in public and think he's me. You dig it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I dig it.\" Spencer smiles brightly. \"Shaq didn't have a stunt double for that movie. They couldn't find a tall enough look-a-like.\"\n\n\n\nPanic flashes across Shaq's face. \"Fuck!\"\n\n\n\nHe slams the door shut.\n\n\n\nShaw groans. \"We've been made. He's definitely a Saker, and he knows we're onto him.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods. \"You know, I think you might be right.\" He pulls out his pistol and holds it at the ready below his waist. \"Can you cover the front? I'm gonna try to circle around and cut him off.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you really suggesting we split up so it can pick us off one-by-one?\"\n\n\n\nBut he's already jogging across the driveway, scanning for an easy spot to vault over the wall and into the backyard.\n\n\n\nHe's still standing in the driveway when, a moment later, an engine roars and a cherry red Corvette smashes through the garage door. In fact, he's directly in its path.\n\n\n\nThe car hits Spencer at about five miles per hour, lifting him from the ground and folding him up against the hood. He clings desperately to the car with one hand, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Miraculously, his other hand still holds his pistol.\n\n\n\nHe aims vaguely and starts firing. His first shot goes wide. His second shot gouges the hood. His third shot takes out the driver-side mirror.\n\n\n\nThe Corvette accelerates and weaves down the driveway, trying to throw him off, or at least ruin his aim. His pistol goes flying, tumbling into the grass of the lawn. He starts swearing, random curse words from a variety of languages, and tries to hold on with both hands.\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot takes the corner at the end of the driveway hard. Really hard. The Corvette goes up on two wheels for a moment, and Spencer goes flying. He lands in a patch of dandelions across the street, bruised, battered, and winded, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The Corvette speeds off down the street and vanishes from view.\n\n\n\nShaw rolls down the driveway and looks down at him. \"Do you want to call for backup now?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I think so.\" Spencer rubs his back and winces. \"Did you see which way he was going?\"\n\n\n\n\"South,\" Shaw saws. \"He's probably getting onto State Route 482.\"\n\n\n\n\"That'll take him to the airport.\" He groans as he stands up and starts dusting dandelion fluff off his pants.\n\n\n\n\"Great, let's go, we can catch him there.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shakes his head. \"No, we're not engaging in the middle of MCO. It would be a blood bath.\" He pulls out his phone and begins to dial.\n\n\n\n\"What--?\"\n\n\n\nHe holds up a hand to cut her off and starts speaking into the phone.\n\n\n\n\"[[[quinn-law-hub|Agent Carter]]]? Ken Spencer here, from the Three Ports office. I need a favor from you.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses to listen.\n\n\n\n\"I need an APB for Shaquille O'Neal. He's driving a red Corvette without a left-side wing mirror, and is likely en route to Orlando International Airport. Tell local cops and TSA not to engage or try to detain, just observe. I want to know what flight he gets on and when.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses again. Shaw can't hear the words being said, but the voice on the other end of the line sounds agitated.\n\n\n\n\"No, he's been replaced by a robot.\"\n\n\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's related to the Caldwell thing. It's a matter of national security.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice sounds slightly mollified.\n\n\n\nSpencer laughs. \"Thanks, Isaac. I owe you one.\"\n\n\n\nHe closes the phone and looks at Shaw. \"In your expert opinion, do you believe that there is a clear and exigent threat to the life of Shaquille O'Neal?\"\n\n\n\nShaw blinks. \"It's possible.\"\n\n\n\n\"And is it possible that we might find him inside this residence, or, failing that, information regarding his current location?\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer smiles like a shark. \"I'm willing to call that exigent circumstances.\" He pulls a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and snaps them on. \"Let's search the place.\"\n\n\n\nThey move methodically, sweeping through each room with practiced patience, checking everything -- opening drawers, lifting up cushions, looking under furniture. Spencer even checks the dust on the bookshelves to see which books have recently been moved. They're looking for any clue that might tell them where the real Shaq is -- if he's even still alive.\n\n\n\nEventually, after almost forty minutes of searching, Shaw finds something.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, come take a look at this!\" she calls out.\n\n\n\nSpencer comes over to find her pointing at a framed photograph next to the entertainment center.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\" he asks. The photo shows Shaq performing as a DJ at some event.\n\n\n\n\"Look at that, do you see it? Reflected in his sunglasses.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer leans in for a better look. Shaq is in a nightclub somewhere, performing on an elevated stage above a crowded dance floor. A dozen different colors of muted neon light the scene, giving it an otherworldly vibe.\n\n\n\nReflected in the left lens of Shaq's sunglasses, almost too small to make out, is a small logo, probably from a neon sign outside the nightclub.\n\n\n\nIt's the logo of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.\n\n\n\n\"Fucking hell.\" Spencer picks up the photograph and holds it up to the light. \"That's in Eurtec.\"\n\n\n\n\"Or somewhere with a Coalition presence,\" Shaw says.\n\n\n\n\"No, it's definitely Eurtec. Look at that guy's wrist.\" Spencer points at an arm thrusting up from the dance floor into the bottom of the photograph. \"Do you see the tattoo?\"\n\n\n\nShaw squints, then nods. \"What about it?\"\n\n\n\n\"That's the insignia of a neo-Nazi Eurtec street gang.\"\n\n\n\n\"So he's been to Eurtec,\" Shaw says. \"Which means he's clued in about the Veil.\"\n\n\n\n\"Which explains why someone might want to replace him with a robot.\" Spencer sets the photograph back down and begins to pace. \"This isn't looking good. He might be in real trouble.\"\n\n\n\nAt that moment, Spencer's phone rings, merrily playing the X-Files theme. He answers the phone immediately, pointedly ignoring Shaw's curious look.\n\n\n\n\"Go for Spencer,\" he says.\n\n\n\nHe listens intently for about thirty seconds, then hangs up.\n\n\n\n\"Robot's taking a flight to Paris,\" he tells Shaw. \"Plane leaves in thiry minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's in Paris?\" she asks.\n\n\n\nSpencer looks at the photograph of Shaq DJing. \"Eurtec.\"\n\n\n\nUnderstanding dawns in Shaw's eyes. \"It's looking for Shaq.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe.\" Spencer frowns. \"Is that typical of Sakers?\"\n\n\n\nShaw shrugs. \"We don't really know what's typical of Sakers.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thought you guys were the experts.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, that's the guy who makes them. We just know how to break them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's hope that's enough.\" Spencer starts dialing another number. \"I assume you don't have Library access, yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, why? Who are you calling?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Someone who can give us a Way to Eurtec that doesn't go through the Library.\" He lifts the phone to his ear and starts speaking. \"Hello, [[[much-belated-inheritance|Mister Raybon]]]? This is Agent Spencer. How'd you like to do a good deed? The life of Shaquille O'Neal might depend on it.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Eurtec**\n\n\n\nIt takes Spencer and Shaw two hours to get to Eurtec, following the directions given to them by Jordan \"Submarine\" Raybon. The retired smuggler knows how to get to anywhere from anywhere, although not always by the most direct route. He gives them a path through the Way network that will take them from Orlando to Naples, Italy. Although it's only a few miles of walking in total, by the time the two agents are standing before a Way into Eurtec they've passed through the Neverglades; Naples, Florida; Liminal Italy; the Kingdom of Zero Sicilies; and half-a-dozen other locales across the world tree.\n\n\n\n\"You ever been to Eurtec?\" Spencer asks.\n\n\n\nShaw shakes her head. \"No, the Coalition doesn't like us being here.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can't imagine why.\" He starts ticking off points on his fingers. \"It's bigger than Three Ports, by a lot, and meaner. The Coalition mostly doesn't give a fuck about street crime. The city is physically and economically stratified, and neo-Nazi gangs control the lower levels. We won't have any real authority, so don't tell anyone you're with the Foundation, it'll just piss people off. You can bring weapons through customs but it probably won't help -- almost everyone is armed with something, usually magic.\"\n\n\n\n\"What about wheelchair access?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\nSpencer frowns. \"Worse than an American city,\u00a0\u00a0better than anywhere in baseline Europe. There used to be a teleporter network but they shut it down after 9/11.\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn, that would have been nice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can't have anything nice in the United Nations' cyberpunk dystopia.\" Spencer chuckles, once, before his expression turns serious again. \"For real though, this place makes Portlands look like a fluffy kitten -- and I have seen Portlandsers spontaneously construct and burn an effigy of J. Edgar Hoover purely out of boredom.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you blame them?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"No, and it was a pretty decent likeness, but that's not the point. Just being American will make us a target here. Don't let your guard down.\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"Understood. I'll keep my eyes open.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer steps forwards to confront the blank brick wall of the Neopolitan alleyway. He pulls a crumpled slip of paper from his pocket and double-checks the instructions written on it.\n\n\n\nHe clears his throat, knocks three times on a slightly off-color brick, and says, \"Let us leave good sense behind.\"\n\n\n\nThe bricks glow for a moment, then crumble to sand and ash, exposing a small pedestrian tunnel. Spencer leads them through, emerging into what looks like an airport terminal. Over a dozen similar tunnels dot the wall behind them, with light pedestrian traffic going in and out of them.\n\n\n\n\"I thought you said there was customs?\" Shaw looks around for anything resembling security and comes up blank.\n\n\n\n\"The city is run by a bunch of precognitive computers. We cleared customs on the Way in. If we hadn't, you'd know.\"\n\n\n\nShaw looks pensive. \"Could they tell us where Shaq is? Or where he will be?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shrugs. \"Probably. If they want to help us, then they'd have already done it -- maybe they even have. But I doubt it. From what I've heard, the Nornir don't get involved. They have bigger things to worry about.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, like Yao Ming.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer barks out a short laugh. \"Sure. Like Yao Ming.\" He checks his watch. \"Come on, we have six hours to find Shaq. Then the Saker gets here, and I don't want to try playing spot the impostor.\"\n\n\n\nThey both set a timer on their watches.\n\n\n\n\"How exactly are we going to find Shaq?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Some good old-fashioned police work,\" Spencer says. \"We're gonna canvas the city.\"\n\n\n\n\"All million people? In six hours?\" Shaw shakes her head. \"You're more likely to trip over him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" He stops the next passerby and holds up a Shaquille O'Neal basketball card. \"Excuse me, have you seen this man?\"\n\n\n\nThe man nods. \"Shaq? Of course, I wouldn't miss him.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer glances at Shaw. She rolls her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Where did you see him?\" Spencer asks.\n\n\n\n\"He was playing at Club Cipher,\" the man replies. \"But if you're hoping to catch him, he won't be there tonight. He's been playing a different venue every night.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods, feigning comprehension. \"Any idea where he'll be tonight?\"\n\n\n\nThe man shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't get announced in advance. It's like a guerilla DJing thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, thank you. You've been very helpful.\" He lets the man continue on his way.\n\n\n\n\"Alright there's no way you're that lucky,\" Shaw says. \"What's your trick?\"\n\n\n\n\"That photo we saw of Shaq,\" Spencer says. \"He was playing at a club. I figured that if he was here and not, you know, a prisoner or dead, then there was a pretty good chance he'd be performing again.\"\n\n\n\n\"You never actually intended to canvas the whole city.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope! Just the nightclubs.\" Spencer grabs a tourist map of Eurtec from a nearby stand. \"And with a few educated guesses, we can narrow our search further.\"\n\n\n\nHe pulls a pen from his pocket and crosses out Club Cipher.\n\n\n\n\"Right, if we know where he's been then we know where he won't be,\" Shaw says.\n\n\n\n\"And it might give us an idea of where he will be. Cipher is a dive, which suggests he's probably not playing any of the really upscale clubs -- you know, the ones that charge a cover just to stand in line.\"\n\n\n\n\"How do you know so much about Eurtec?\" Shaw asks. \"The UIU doesn't have jurisdiction here \"\n\n\n\n\"No, but we have an international office here. For liaison purposes. I read their reports.\" Spencer shrugs. \"And I may have been here a few times on vacation.\"\n\n\n\nShaw stares at him. \"I cannot picture you on vacation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, I'm not a robot,\" he says. \"I take vacations too.\" He holds up the map, upon which he has drawn about a dozen circles. \"Here's our target list. Thirteen nightclubs in the city's lower level.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can we hit them all in six hours?\"\n\n\n\n\"We can try.\"\n\n\n\nThey manage it, just barely. Canvassing the city's nightclubs takes them five hours and fifty minutes.\n\n\n\nTheir first stop is Ewige Blumenkraft, an Illuminati-owned nightclub inside the Eurtec Parabotanical Gardens in the city's middle-tier. It is widely considered the lamest club in Europe, but the Illuminati have the money to pay for the best DJs, so people still go. The bouncer helpfully informs them that Shaq played there a week ago, and that the Achronal Hyacinth will be unblooming soon.\n\n\n\nTheir second visit is to BROZ, a gay club inside the former Yugoslav consulate. The centerpiece is an unexploded bomb from the NATO intervention in Serbia, which is allegedly still armed. The bartender tells them that Shaq was there a few days ago.\n\n\n\nNext they hit the French clubs, Paradis -- a discotheque inside a former Gothic church that was transported to Eurtec brick-by-brick -- and Atomique -- situated inside a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Neither club has seen \"Le Shaq\", but both have plans to book him soon.\n\n\n\nValhalla is the first club to give them trouble. The abandoned mattress factory is overrun by neo-Nazi thugs, all benefiting from the lack of dram laws in Eurtec. It's obvious that Shaq hasn't been there, but they ask the bouncer anyways.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck off, cripple,\" he says to Shaw.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation agent clenches her fists, causing the bouncer to laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Aw, you wanna fight, dyke?\" He takes a step back, up onto a step. \"What are you gonna do now?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer sucker punches him in the gut. The man collapses in a heap.\n\n\n\n\"That,\" Shaw says. \"Thanks for the assist.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fucking Nazis.\" Spencer spits on the fallen bouncer. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\n\n\nThe next club on their list is the Count, a bougie little opium den allegedly run by Dracula. The dance floor is packed by eager goths with plunging necklines all grinding to a club remix of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". Shaq has not played there.\n\n\n\nBorealis is another Nazi club. They skip it and move on to Volts, the only club to be exclusively located in virtual reality. Spencer orders a shot, just to see if viritual alcohol has any effect. It doesn't.\n\n\n\nThey don't find Shaq until the ninth club, a high-end dive run by [[[truth-is-sin|MachineGod]]].\n\n\n\n\"Look, there's Shaq.\" Spencer points up at the stage where Shaq is playing.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, you were right,\" Shaw says. \"Point for old-fashioned police work, I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Come on, we don't have much time.\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a loud scream cuts through the noise of the club. Spencer and Shaw turn to look at its origin. On the other side of the club, another Shaquille O'Neal has picked someone up and thrown them across the dance floor.\n\n\n\n\"Shaquille O'Neal!\" Its voice booms and reverberates unnaturally. Shaq stops playing and looks at the robot in confusion.\n\n\n\n\"What do you want?\" He calls down.\n\n\n\n\"Your life!\" The robot strides through the now-panicked crowd, easily cutting through the throng of bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck, the plane landed early,\" Spencer says. \"Shaw, can you distract it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why? What's your plan?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer reaches elbow-deep into one of the extradimensional pockets of his suit and extracts a sawn-off shotgun. \"I'm gonna blow its head off.\"\n\n\n\nHe slips into the crowd, vanishing from view. Shaw shakes her head, then starts wheeling herself towards the stage, not caring how many feet she runs over in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Saker vaults onto the stage with surprising agility, landing in a three-point stance. It picks up the DJ deck and throws it directly at Shaq's head.\n\n\n\nShaq ducks underneath the still-spinning turntables. With a yell, he charges the robot and tackles it, sending them both flying off the edge of the stage. With the robot pinned beneath him, Shaq rears back and throws a punch at its jaw.\n\n\n\nThe Saker doesn't react.\n\n\n\nShaq punches it again.\n\n\n\nThe Saker catches the punch in one hand.\n\n\n\nWith its other hand it grabs Shaq by the throat. It sits up, then clambers to its feet while holding the struggling Shaq. It still doesn't react to the stray kicks and wild punches that Shaq is pummeling it with.\n\n\n\nIt lifts Shaq into the air with one arm and studies him. The sight is almost comical, except that it betrays the terrifying strength of the robot.\n\n\n\n\"There can't be two Shaqs,\" it explains. \"I cannot truly be Shaq as long as you live.\"\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot pulls its other arm back and prepares to punch Shaq in the face.\n\n\n\nShaw does not have a plan. She has an idea which, very charitably, could be called the start of a plan.\n\n\n\n\"Freeze tin man!\" Shaw shouts out. She holds up a clenched fist. \"Let Shaq go, or I blow us all to hell.\"\n\n\n\nThe robot freezes. \"Not you again! What do you want from me?\"\n\n\n\n\"I told you, let Shaq go.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Shaw sees Spencer creeping up behind the robot.\n\n\n\n\"And if I don't, you'll detonate a bomb?\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"This wheelchair is packed with high explosives. Enough to destroy you.\" A loud click comes from her fist. \"And I just armed the dead-man's switch.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lady are you fucking crazy?\" Shaq shouts.\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot frowns. \"You're bluffing. You'd kill the other Shaq too.\"\n\n\n\nShaw stares at the robot, pointedly avoiding looking at the approaching figure. \"You're gonna kill him anyways. I'm just here to destroy you.\"\n\n\n\nThe Saker shakes its head. \"No. You are definitely bluffing. There is no bomb. I am going to kill Mr. O'Neal, and then I am going to kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wrong.\" Spencer pulls the trigger of the sawn-off shotgun, firing a heavy slug at point blank range into the back of the robot's neck.\n\n\n\nThe Saker drops Shaq and stumbles forwards. It turns, unsteadily, to face Spencer. Sparks fly from exposed servos underneath its bionic skin.\n\n\n\nSpencer pumps the shotgun and fires another round into its torso.\n\n\n\nThe robot throws up an arm to try and shield itself.\n\n\n\nHe fires again.\n\n\n\nAnd again.\n\n\n\nAnd again.\n\n\n\nThe robot topples to its knees. Smoke and oil leak from it in a dozen places. Flaps of shredded skin hang loosely, revealing the mechanical components beneath. It stares at Spencer with hatred in its electric eyes.\n\n\n\n\"I... just wanted.. to be Shaq...\" it stutters.\n\n\n\nShaw rolls her wheelchair closer. She draws her service pistol and places it against the side of the robot's head.\n\n\n\n\"There's only one Shaq,\" she says. \"And you aren't it.\"\n\n\n\nShe pulls the trigger.\n\n\n\nThe remains of the robot collapse to the floor with a clatter and a thump.\n\n\n\nSpencer gives Shaw a look. \"You don't actually have a bomb, right?\"\n\n\n\nShe shakes her head and opens her fist to reveal a ballpoint pen. \"Nope, just a pen and some improv.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer laughs so hard that he has to put his hands on his knees to support himself. \"A fucking pen!\" He laughs again. \"Thorne is never gonna believe this.\"\n\n\n\nShaq takes the opportunity to approach the two agents. \"Yo, what the fuck is going on here? Who the hell are you?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods, clearing his throat and composing himself. \"Mr. O'Neal, I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer of the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, and this is Clarissa Shaw. Someone replaced you with a human replica android. We were investigating.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that was me.\" Shaq looks slightly embarrassed.\n\n\n\n\"You replaced yourself with a robot?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, last time I was here there was this guy -- I think his name was [[[ties-that-bind|Isaac]]]? -- anyways, he was selling these robots for use as body doubles. I got one to do //Inside the NBA// for me so I could do more DJing.\"\n\n\n\nShaw and Spencer exchange glances.\n\n\n\n\"Well.\" Spencer pauses.\n\n\n\n\"It malfunctioned,\" Shaw says. \"And came here to try and kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fuck, for real?\" Shaq whistles. \"Damn, I guess I should have seen that coming.\"\n\n\n\n\"Eh, you never hear about the robots that don't go rogue and try to commit murder,\" Spencer says. \"I just hope you've learned something about the risks of using Veiled technologies.\"\n\n\n\nShaq nods. \"Definitely.

At a few points he closed his eyes to Observe better.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\" He released the prosthetic and stroked the end of his beard thoughtfully. \"This is Foundation-make, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Custom designed by our in-house R&amp;D,\" Ross said. \"I'm pretty sure they reverse engineered some of Anderson's gizmos.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not very well then,\" Vogel said. \"The Gyrfalcon series is supposed to be compatible with thaumaturgy. Anderson's own prosthetics actually enhance his abilities.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that's not happening.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does happen?\"</p>\n<p>Ross shrugged. \"Sometimes nothing \u2014 the spell just fizzles. Sometimes the spell works but I lose control of the backlash. Three separate times I've shorted-out the bio-circuitry of the prosthetic.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>The</em> prosthetic,\" Vogel noted. \"And earlier your said <em>the</em> new hand. Not your new hand. Why is that?\"</p>\n<p>Ross frowned. \"It's not my hand.\"</p>\n<p>Vogel raised an eyebrow. \"Whose hand is it?\"</p>\n<p>Ross shook her head. \"You know what I mean. I feel like Darth Vader.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" He stroked his beard again, then nodded. \"I believe I have a theory about the nature of your problem.\" He held up a hand to stop her from interrupting. \"A theory, that's all. I am by no means an expert in this subject. This is just my best guess based on what I know of evocation, and of you.\"</p>\n<p>Ross nodded and gestured for him to proceed.</p>\n<p>\"I believe you are too attached to your old hand.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does that mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"It means that you still consider your lost limb to be part of you, and you are still subconsciously trying to channel through it. It's a type of dysphoric casting disorder \u2014 we see it sometimes in mages with severe gender dysphoria. The psychological turmoil from the mismatch between body and self-image is what's disrupting your casting, not your prosthetic. The fact that you rely so heavily on internalizing backlash has likely exacerbated the issue.\"</p>\n<p>Ross frowned. \"That's it? There's nothing wrong with the \u2014 with <em>my</em> hand?\"</p>\n<p>Vogel shrugged diffidently. \"I don't believe you will ever be able to channel through it \u2014 your R&amp;D department either didn't know how or didn't care to include the necessary thaumic circuitry to support that. But your hand is not at fault for your recent difficulties, at least not directly.\"</p>\n<p>Ross slumped in the chair and nodded unhappily. \"Great. It's all in my head.\"</p>\n<p>\"Most magic is.\" Vogel chuckled softly, then cleared his throat. \"My recommendation? Dialectical therapy. And perhaps try going without the prosthetic for a while. It may make it easier to integrate the loss of your original hand.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fantastic. Therapy.\" Ross exhaled sharply. \"I was hoping there would be an easier solution.\"</p>\n<p>\"I would hope that if you learned anything from me, Ms. Ross, it would be that there are no shortcuts when it comes to magic.\"</p>\n<p>Ross nodded. \"I remember.\" She sighed. \"Thank you for your help, Professor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course.

A train that only travels at night, but never sees dawn. If you stand outside, alone on a platform, surrounded by darkness \u2014 and if you are truly, hopelessly lost \u2014 you will hear its whistle.</p>\n<p>It comes to you, so you might find your resolution.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Three new passengers.<br/>\nTwo departures.</p>\n<p>The train has brought us to the space between the mountains again, and I am once again plagued by the idea that the train knows things I do not. In a way, we cannot be definitive \u2014 as much as a Train requires a Conductor, a Conductor needs a Train. We all need a purpose and a reason, and sometimes existence is all you can get.</p>\n<p>The train has always had a will of its own, far before the tracks were laid and the first iron wheel began to spin. Before, we travelled with the breeze, following the current forwards and backwards without a care. I would stand, ostensibly setting the direction of our journey, the one watched by others, the one in 'control'.</p>\n<p>They would look to me for answers then. In that way, things are no different now than they once were.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite the eons of service \u2014 I still do not have the answers they need.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I find myself flipping through the pages of the logbook, recalling past lives and forgotten memories. I think about the faces, the blur, the blend \u2014 and I think about the flame burning at the heart of the train. A flame that has always burned, an idea that will continue so long as there is a need; they will always need the train.</p>\n<p>The Train will always need a Conductor.</p>\n<p>I follow the will of the tracks, leaving the destination to the beating heart of fire. I serve the vessel, as I always have: collecting passengers, lost and wayward souls, the ones left behind and stuck in the cracks. I do what I can, so that they still have a chance.</p>\n<p>Nothing matters beyond that.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a train not bound by tracks \u2014 it uses those that exist, when convenient, but it is never restricted. A train that goes where it desires, laying new tracks before its cast-bronze wheels; each track laid will leave with the train, the absence of one whom is unremembered as the only evidence that it ever was. When this train comes, the departure is final.</p>\n<p>But the train is not your end.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ten new passengers.<br/>\nOne departure.</p>\n<p>The South Pacific has always been a favorite of mine, watching the sun set over the golden waves as nature takes domain over the night. Humanity conquered the daytime long ago, nature having lost their claim; it escaped to the darkness, where man dared not tread. It hid in the spaces between, waiting for the times that exist around the world we have made.</p>\n<p>Nighttime is a reminder of how the world once was, as I remember it.</p>\n<p>But the world changed, for a time. What were once clean lines drawn in the sand became ambiguous and debated as people searched for identity, for meaning, for a place to belong. The world grew, far beyond the constraints it had once faced \u2014 oceans became puddles, as bridges turned rivers into trickles. Humanity bent the world to fit what was seen as progress, to remake our lives and remove the dirty parts that we wish to forget.</p>\n<p>And, just as quickly as the world changed \u2014 it became stuck.</p>\n<p>Today, a passenger finally departed, one who had rode the train for years. They were as much of a fixture as I, a guide and mentor to the newly departed who just boarded, a friend to those living in the mire. I respected them, as I watched their search for meaning; I am happy that they found what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>I stood beside the others, all watching them leave in envy \u2014 something that has become a twisted tradition onboard. A going away party, where you are wished well by those who envy your freedom; there is little joy to be shared in the moment, but hope? Hope blossoms.</p>\n<p>I saw their face for the first time, as they departed the train. We tend to lose who we are while stuck in the mire, finding ourselves only once we come up for air; I watched as he took his first breath, the crisp ocean breeze filling his lungs with life.</p>\n<p>I waited for him to disappear, fade away, to be freed from the endless repetition; I stared, as is my twisted tradition, endlessly watching those that get to pass on. Every single time, I wait for their liberation; instead, I see their persistence.</p>\n<p>Why do they always choose to persist?</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I am glad for them. Resolution is a goal we all seek, and I have lived my existence in the service of that ideal. I serve a true purpose, a desperate need in a frozen world. I give others what I cannot have, because they were denied it in kind. After all, there is always a need to tip the scales for a world stuck in one place.</p>\n<p>Things no longer change, not things that matter. The world exists as a series of cycles, loops, origins and destinations and the tracks that go back and forth. The train exists beyond the patterns, but even still \u2014 the wheels spin, grinding along the bronze rails, a mimicry of the patterns of life.</p>\n<p>Life turns to death, work turns to sleep, day turns to night and love turns to misery. Nothing is stagnant, no matter how much we will it to be. No matter how little we need a cycle, it persists regardless. Wheels spinning, something set in motion before you were born, that will continue to turn long after you are gone.</p>\n<p>When the passenger departed today, they finally escaped one of the patterns. They were able to find their peace, whatever that meant to them.</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I had a hand in this; I am no more responsible for their resolutions than I am for the train. It is enough to serve.</p>\n<p>Part of me knows that I do not matter, and that were I do fade away, another would rise to take my place.

I remember when I was no more than a big fish in a small pond, an aimless wanderer from the sticks, stuck in my own cycle.

I did not feed the flames, I did not oil the coupling rods that drive us forward, and I did not care.</p>\n<p>I did not see the needs of the world as I do now.

A train that only travels at night, but never sees dawn. If you stand outside, alone on a platform, surrounded by darkness -- and if you are truly, hopelessly lost -- you will hear its whistle.\n\n\n\nIt comes to you, so you might find your resolution.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThree new passengers.\n\nTwo departures.\n\n\n\nThe train has brought us to the space between the mountains again, and I am once again plagued by the idea that the train knows things I do not. In a way, we cannot be definitive -- as much as a Train requires a Conductor, a Conductor needs a Train. We all need a purpose and a reason, and sometimes existence is all you can get.\n\n\n\nThe train has always had a will of its own, far before the tracks were laid and the first iron wheel began to spin. Before, we travelled with the breeze, following the current forwards and backwards without a care. I would stand, ostensibly setting the direction of our journey, the one watched by others, the one in 'control'.\n\n\n\nThey would look to me for answers then. In that way, things are no different now than they once were.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite the eons of service -- I still do not have the answers they need.\n\n\n\nSometimes, I find myself flipping through the pages of the logbook, recalling past lives and forgotten memories. I think about the faces, the blur, the blend -- and I think about the flame burning at the heart of the train. A flame that has always burned, an idea that will continue so long as there is a need; they will always need the train.\n\n\n\nThe Train will always need a Conductor.\n\n\n\nI follow the will of the tracks, leaving the destination to the beating heart of fire. I serve the vessel, as I always have: collecting passengers, lost and wayward souls, the ones left behind and stuck in the cracks. I do what I can, so that they still have a chance.\n\n\n\nNothing matters beyond that.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train not bound by tracks -- it uses those that exist, when convenient, but it is never restricted. A train that goes where it desires, laying new tracks before its cast-bronze wheels; each track laid will leave with the train, the absence of one whom is unremembered as the only evidence that it ever was. When this train comes, the departure is final.\n\n\n\nBut the train is not your end.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nTen new passengers.\n\nOne departure.\n\n\n\nThe South Pacific has always been a favorite of mine, watching the sun set over the golden waves as nature takes domain over the night. Humanity conquered the daytime long ago, nature having lost their claim; it escaped to the darkness, where man dared not tread. It hid in the spaces between, waiting for the times that exist around the world we have made.\n\n\n\nNighttime is a reminder of how the world once was, as I remember it.\n\n\n\nBut the world changed, for a time. What were once clean lines drawn in the sand became ambiguous and debated as people searched for identity, for meaning, for a place to belong. The world grew, far beyond the constraints it had once faced -- oceans became puddles, as bridges turned rivers into trickles. Humanity bent the world to fit what was seen as progress, to remake our lives and remove the dirty parts that we wish to forget.\n\n\n\nAnd, just as quickly as the world changed -- it became stuck.\n\n\n\nToday, a passenger finally departed, one who had rode the train for years. They were as much of a fixture as I, a guide and mentor to the newly departed who just boarded, a friend to those living in the mire. I respected them, as I watched their search for meaning; I am happy that they found what they were looking for.\n\n\n\nI stood beside the others, all watching them leave in envy -- something that has become a twisted tradition onboard. A going away party, where you are wished well by those who envy your freedom; there is little joy to be shared in the moment, but hope? Hope blossoms.\n\n\n\nI saw their face for the first time, as they departed the train. We tend to lose who we are while stuck in the mire, finding ourselves only once we come up for air; I watched as he took his first breath, the crisp ocean breeze filling his lungs with life.\n\n\n\nI waited for him to disappear, fade away, to be freed from the endless repetition; I stared, as is my twisted tradition, endlessly watching those that get to pass on. Every single time, I wait for their liberation; instead, I see their persistence.\n\n\n\nWhy do they always choose to persist?\n\n\n\nI would like to think that I am glad for them. Resolution is a goal we all seek, and I have lived my existence in the service of that ideal. I serve a true purpose, a desperate need in a frozen world. I give others what I cannot have, because they were denied it in kind. After all, there is always a need to tip the scales for a world stuck in one place.\n\n\n\nThings no longer change, not things that matter. The world exists as a series of cycles, loops, origins and destinations and the tracks that go back and forth. The train exists beyond the patterns, but even still -- the wheels spin, grinding along the bronze rails, a mimicry of the patterns of life.\n\n\n\nLife turns to death, work turns to sleep, day turns to night and love turns to misery. Nothing is stagnant, no matter how much we will it to be. No matter how little we need a cycle, it persists regardless. Wheels spinning, something set in motion before you were born, that will continue to turn long after you are gone.\n\n\n\nWhen the passenger departed today, they finally escaped one of the patterns. They were able to find their peace, whatever that meant to them.\n\n\n\nI would like to think that I had a hand in this; I am no more responsible for their resolutions than I am for the train. It is enough to serve.\n\n\n\nPart of me knows that I do not matter, and that were I do fade away, another would rise to take my place. Repetition follows us all, and I am bound to rings of fate just like my passengers.\n\n\n\nBut what would happen if I left and the axle was broken?\n\n\n\nWhat if, without a Conductor, the Train no longer remains?\n\n\n\nI continue to stoke the fires at the heart of the bronze beast, feeding its raging purpose. I cannot risk leaving the world to the whims of fate. I will continue to keep the wheels spinning, so that one day, we may all find our endings.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe then, I can finally rest.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train for the lost, the damned, the forgotten -- it comes to you in your time of need. It serves not as your resting place, nor as your salvation. They say the train is nothing more than an illusory nadir, a place to pass through, one that takes you from where you were to where you need to be.

It, indeed, sucks to be in her position as of this moment. Directing an <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub\">entire division</a> that the majority of the Foundation looks at with disdain does wonders for a person. But that doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that her family is safe. That everything she worked hard for is intact. And the anomalies are treated as they should be, as people with various needs that must be met.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s seen the horrors lurking in the darkness. All the worst containment breaches that any researcher can think of. But these breaches can all be prevented by one simple fix, that being to improve the quality of life not only for the researchers working tirelessly to defend the world but also for the SCPs that they contain.</p>\n<p>So she carries on. She does what needs to be done for a better world for all walks of life. At the moment, the current issue is convincing the Overseers to approve an increase of their budget.</p>\n<p>And she has nothing.</p>\n<p>As Amelie ponders for the fourteenth time about how she can further do nothing and make a convincing argument out of thin air, she hears the laughter of the children from down the hall. Their joy never ceases to brighten her day. Brandon with his ability to pull his eyes out of his sockets while juggling them, Julia with her fire breath, Angelica with the way that she can turn an entire room into a magical wonderland with a snap of her fingers. They\u2019re all so <em>extraordinary</em>. Amelie can\u2019t fathom a world not enriched by their presence and their kindness.</p>\n<p>Back to the paper now, no distractions. There can\u2019t be any more distractions.</p>\n<p>She focuses on something else instead. The clock on the wall behind her ticks and ticks and ticks, pounding its cyclic rhythm into her skull and forcing her to drown out the other sounds in the room.</p>\n<p>The tiresome mundanity of her procrastination then clashes with the boring reality of her daily life, creating a paradox that finally frees her to start being productive.</p>\n<p>Now she\u2019s back in business. Amelie starts by working on the spreadsheet, then switching tabs to work on the main document itself, then to another tab to work on the outline of the email that she\u2019ll send to the Overseers, then back to the spreadsheet. Back and forth and back and forth, no longer concerned about the future of the division, or the fact of the sudden silence outside, or the many shouting matches that she has with Feghoot, or that damn buzzing from the AC, or\u2014</p>\n<p>She jolts from her productive trance. The sound of the air circulating above her is the only thing that can be heard. No voices, no footsteps. Nothing.</p>\n<p>Amelie can\u2019t hear the children.</p>\n<p>Then she hears the screaming and shouting in the distance, the hollering and stomping of boots from the security personnel, a cavalcade of outright panic from those of 169 who are not prepared for catastrophes at this scale. There has never been a more intense and constricting feeling in Amelie\u2019s chest since she first founded the division until this very moment.</p>\n<p>She springs up from her chair, knocking it over as she rushes out the door and sprints down the hallway towards the commons area and the mess hall.</p>\n<p>A common sight of a room in complete disarray is usually the cramped crowds pushing and shoving over each other as they try to escape the chaos afoot, even trampling others unfortunate enough to be caught in the eye of the storm. What she doesn\u2019t expect are the fistfights, or the shouting matches between the anomalies and staff pointing fingers at each other, or Kirby Case failing to keep the situation from unraveling no matter how hard they try to dampen the hostilities. An outright brawl like this is unheard of at a site like 169.</p>\n<p>Amelie attempts to make her way over to Kirby before she is interrupted by the sound of someone calling her name. She turns to her left to see a familiar thaumaturgist with a puffy green coat and an inexplicably furious look on his face.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-6714\">Cole V. Filverent</a> approaches her with eyes like burning matches, before grabbing her by the lapels and pulling her face to face. \u201cWhat <em>did you do?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie calmly but firmly breaks his grip off her. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t do anything. Nobody\u2019s done anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses before breaking off the tension between them. \u201cSorry. But there\u2019s something wrong with Polly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear her anymore. All I hear is quacking. I kept asking her if she\u2019s okay, but she\u2019s not answering me. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d His voice starts to shake with every word.</p>\n<p>Amelie puts her hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out too. I\u2019m as in the dark as you are. But once we get our bearings, then I can help you and help everyone else. We\u2019ll get through this together, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hangs his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somewhere within the site\u2019s Playground, Polly Filverent has no reason to object that she\u2019s a duck and not a person in the form of a duck, as she doesn\u2019t understand the distinction between the two or any kind of human language.</p>\n<p>Amelie turns her attention back to Kirby, seeing that they are struggling to keep the masses at bay. She rushes over to their side, and they give a nod in acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our status?\u201d Amelie asks.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a silence in the air, overwhelming over the raucous violence. Kirby looks at her with a blank stare, the life in their eyes dissipating right before her very sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Amy. The kids are gone,\u201d they state in a monotone tone, like they\u2019re reading off an obituary.</p>\n<p>Amelie can feel her stomach drop to the floor, but right now there\u2019s no time for processing what has just been said. She considers her options, before formulating a concrete plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I borrow your megaphone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie gestures toward the mass of people. \u201cThese people need a voice of reason. And I\u2019m usually the one to fill that role.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d They toss their megaphone to her, and she catches it with grace.</p>\n<p>A shout is heard by the raging masses, barely able to be recognized but the message is clear. They turn their attention to the source.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook. I know how difficult this is for all of us right now. We are all horrified, and rightfully so, but we can\u2019t solve this by pinning the blame on someone else. None of us know what\u2019s going on. Not me, not Melissa, not Kirby, not even Moses Feghoot, that ol\u2019 grouch. But we can get through this, like we always have,\u201d she elucidates, her public speaking skills that she learned getting their time to shine.</p>\n<p>One man steps from the crowd to face her. She recognizes him as the one who has his arms and hands lacking skin and muscle tissue, leaving the skeleton behind. Or had, considering that his arms now appear to match the rest of his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can fix this, right? Right?\u201d he pleads to her, the horror so clearly seen on his face with the realization that he has lost something important to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to assess what\u2019s been lost, convene with other sites to see who else is affected, and then we can help each other out to stay afloat in spite of this crisis. We can all use some mutual aid right about now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut can you reverse it?\u201d His expression changes to one of agitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s interrupted by a voice from the crowd. \u201cShe can\u2019t, Fred! None of them can. The Foundation isn\u2019t going to do anything about it. <em>I know they won\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie takes a deep breath, before continuing. \u201cRegardless of what they do, we\u2019re not going to sit around and twiddle our thumbs while you all suffer. That\u2019s not in our motto. I\u2019ll never let any of you get left behind. Never.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirby taps on her shoulder, and she relinquishes the megaphone to them. \u201cAlright folks, simmer down, simmer down. Let\u2019s get this mess cleaned up.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the crowd disperses and the two catch up on both of their perspectives and what they each saw, they discuss what to do and eventually settle on having a meeting with the rest of the Caretakers and administrative staff.</p>\n<p>They all scramble and pile up into the meeting room, some looking worse for wear than others, and they each sit in their respective seats. A long, uncomfortable silence goes by before someone speaks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Any ideas for what we should be doing?\u201d Melissa Mayfield looks as if she\u2019s been through three all-nighters in a row.</p>\n<p>Kirby glares around the room, folding their arms over their legs and shrinking down to make themselves smaller. \u201cLet\u2019s just contact the others and get this over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelia nods her head, then hesitates. \u201cWe should keep in touch with the other sites, but I\u2019m worried about our friends. Their safety should be our number one priority, and something this terrible is going to take a lot more than a toll on them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Melissa turns her head to the site director. \u201cWhat about you, Moses?\u201d</p>\n<p>The director doesn\u2019t respond. Amelie sees a man with a thousand-yard stare, eyes boring into her skull, like he\u2019s seen something that isn\u2019t meant to be seen. Like he\u2019s seen death itself riding on its white horse, to reap what it sows.</p>\n<p>She imagines him shrugging off the whole affair, or even celebrating it in her most bad faith interpretation. But none of that aligns with reality. She\u2019s never seen him like this. Never seen him this afraid.</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be the Moses Feghoot that she knows. Not with those eyes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Now</strong></p>\n<p>Amelie Metanoia, former director of the now defunct Anomalous Entity Engagement Division, sits on her bed in her newly leased apartment, typing the latest draft for a grant proposal to help fund the newest organization that she\u2019s working with. She\u2019s done work with a lot of charities, and has volunteered at homeless shelters, food pantries, blood drives, animal shelters, and has worked to support children in need. Name a non-profit organization off the top of your head, and Amelie has most likely worked with them. She\u2019s done it all.</p>\n<p>And yet it\u2019s not enough. Not enough to fulfill that promise that she made to her family all those years ago.</p>\n<p>Kirby Case now works as a security guard at a warehouse some miles off from where Amelie lives. They still chat from time to time, but only through her insistent invitations and their reluctance to go along with it. They\u2019ve grown distant from her, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>Melissa Mayfield currently serves as an occupational therapist, helping other individuals to improve their ability in completing daily tasks, such as getting dressed or using a computer. Unlike Kirby, she and Amelie have become fast friends without the constant pressure of working at the Foundation, and they discuss a plethora of topics including their respective fields.</p>\n<p>Moses Feghoot has never been seen again. At least, Amelie has never seen him since that day. Her contact with the withering few remnants of the Foundation has confirmed to her multiple times that he\u2019s still alive and well, but not much else. No traces of his personal life or where he\u2019s been. It almost seems as if he vanished.</p>\n<p>Like they all have.</p>\n<p>Well, most of them. Some of them have simply lost the magic that made them who they are, that gave the world its beauty in many configurations.</p>\n<p>Her pet fish Percy, who had the former designation of <a href=\"/scp-2689\">SCP-2689</a>, now wanders around in a fish bowl on her desk, looking none the wiser of the anomalous attribute that he once held. On some days Amelie wishes that he can make her feel something again, make her feel less like a pathetic stain on the earth, even for just a moment, but that\u2019s never going to happen again. Percy is a blood parrot cichlid. And fish can\u2019t make miracles.</p>\n<p>She tries her hardest not to cry. She has to keep going. She can\u2019t stop. Not now. There needs to be more done for the world. For the world that has excised its own wonder and whimsy, forever condemning itself to the bleak reality that it has become. For the people who need support, to feel like they aren\u2019t alone, to feel that they\u2019re loved and cared for. For the ghosts of the past that haunt her each and every day that she can\u2019t ever let down again.</p>\n<p>Her phone buzzes in her pocket, and she picks it up and looks at the screen. It\u2019s a text from Melissa. Another request to hang out at their favorite coffee shop, it seems. Eh, why not. It\u2019ll take her mind off things at least.</p>\n<p>Amelie packs her things, shoves her shoes on without tying them as she\u2019s too tired to even bother, and makes her way to the car. The ignition starts, and the familiar sound of the car\u2019s engine hissing fills her ears. That problem will have to be solved later, like all the other little dilemmas that slowly accumulate over time to morph into a big pile of inexorable filth that won\u2019t matter, in the end. So what it\u2019s noticeable? So what she can\u2019t take care of herself anymore? That\u2019s nothing compared to what she\u2019s lost.</p>\n<p>The grey gloom of the sky above flies past her as the car approaches the cafe. It lacks the bright blue that the kids used to draw in their lovely little sketches. It lacks the fluffy clouds, the bright and shining sun, and the whimsy and imagination that once brought joy in her life.</p>\n<p>She parks the car, and heads inside. Melissa is already there, sitting at the booth at the far left corner in the back. Both of their drinks and their usual orders have been set on the table. A common Melissa act of kindness.</p>\n<p>Amelie sits across from her. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Amy. How\u2019s it hanging?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d Her voice sounds unconvincing, but no one\u2019s going to care anyhow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Melissa asks in concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help if you need anything, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie gets the urge to sink under the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. You\u2019re not my therapist, and I don\u2019t need one. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever it is, we can work through it together and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust shut up, okay?\u201d She snaps without thinking.</p>\n<p>The shift in Melissa\u2019s expression makes her regret it immediately. \u201cOkay. Do you want to talk about something else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that would be nice. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa nods. \u201cWell, I was thinking about bringing the gang back together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe gang?\u201d Amelie raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, me, you, Kirby, Mos\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKirby wants nothing to do with me anymore, and Moses probably wants to dissociate from us altogether, wherever the hell he\u2019s at.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa blinks once. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Kirby? I thought you guys were like two peas in a pod.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when you convince someone in your mission and have them believe in your cause to the point that they\u2019d die for it, and then the world decides on a whim to obliterate the people you\u2019re supposed to protect, what do you think is going to happen? Certainly not being on good terms with them, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can talk to them, though, right? You can work it out together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie waves her arms up and down in exasperation. \u201cIf they wanted to talk to me, they would\u2019ve reached out to me. I had to do it for them, because they don\u2019t want to see my face again. And that\u2019s fine, actually! I don\u2019t like me either.\u201d</p>\n<p>She knows that look on Melissa\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, Mel? I failed all of them. We were supposed to give them hope, help them be free to feel like themselves, and now they\u2019re gone and everyone hates my guts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one hates you, Amy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Kirby does!\u201d Amelie raises her voice.</p>\n<p>Melissa takes a big gulp of her coffee, trying to keep it together, before continuing. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. They don\u2019t talk about you like that when they\u2019re around me. Maybe you two are getting the wrong ideas about each other, but either way, it\u2019s not your fault. You weren\u2019t the one who caused this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I promised them that I\u2019d protect them. And they\u2019re <em>gone</em>, Mel. If I ever see <a href=\"/scp-6245\">any</a> <a href=\"/scp-1508\">of</a> <a href=\"/scp-8940\">them</a> again, you know how they\u2019re going to feel about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit there in silence for a moment. Amelie fights to not choke herself up, to not let the tears sting her eyes.</p>\n<p>Melissa puts her hands on top of hers, to try to ground her out of her emotions. \u201cWe did the best we could. <em>You</em> did the best you could. You helped those left to find a safe place to live. You made sure they never went more than a day without needing what they needed the most. Don\u2019t you remember any of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie takes a deep breath. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t know if that compares to what we lost. What I lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change the past, Amy. All we can do now is carry on and honor them and what they stood for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie chuckles at how ironic that is. \u201cAs if what they stood for isn\u2019t dead. I killed it, Mel. I should\u2019ve talked to them more, I should\u2019ve been there for them, but you want to know what I did? I kept worrying about spreadsheets and expense reports.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stands up to make her point, gesticulating like a passionate lecturer. \u201cMaybe this is anomalous hibernation, or something. They\u2019re all asleep, and they\u2019ll come back one day when the world isn\u2019t a graveyard where dreams go to die. Nothing about what happened makes any goddamn sense at all. Sure, every anomaly got up and went to the farm upstate at the exact same time! That makes perfect sense! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s anomalous in and of itself? Don\u2019t you think we could\u2019ve done something about that? We could\u2019ve gotten a team, and I would\u2019ve been on that team, and it wouldn\u2019t matter how much sleep I would lose cause I would\u2019ve done it for\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa grabs her by the shoulder, gesturing to her to sit down. \u201cHey. You\u2019re going to make a scene. Deep breaths, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Breathe in, breathe out.</p>\n<p>Amelie sits down, ignoring the people that are probably staring at her by now, and looks down at her food for a while, unwilling to even gather the strength to touch it with her fork.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always the question of when. When can she move on from something like this? When can she wake up one day and say that she\u2019s now happy and fulfilled in life? Can she ever be happy anymore?</p>\n<p>She\u2019s done the best she can to honor their memory and look forward to the future. But is that future possible without them? Is that possible without the magic of this world that made life worth living? Can there ever be a better future for her or the people that she cared for again?</p>\n<p>Melissa watches her with a look of pity. At least, that\u2019s what it looks like to Amelie, who deserves all the judgement given to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how hard it is for you right now. It\u2019s hard for me too, but we can\u2019t keep fretting about what we could\u2019ve done. That won\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re gone. But we can still try to make things better for the people around us. You\u2019ve done so much for so many people, Amy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie finally lets the floodgates through and sobs, freeing herself from all the pain that she repressed inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mel, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence that unfolds is unbearable, but it\u2019s better than burdening herself with something that she can\u2019t control.</p>\n<p>She wipes the tears from her eyes. \u201cI think I need help. With everything, really. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you find what you need. You shouldn\u2019t have to bear through this alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve fixed things with Kirby, but now I lost what we had too. They looked up to me, you know? And then I just pushed them away,\u201d Amelie admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what you did is irreconcilable. It will take time, but they\u2019ll forgive you one day. I know they will,\u201d Melissa promises to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that they can come back one day? So this can all be over? I <em>need</em> this to be over.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next thing she speaks to her is the most honest thing that she can say. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Amy. I really don\u2019t. But we have each other, and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of their lunch passes in silence, before Melissa hurries to get to her next appointment. She gives a quick apology before rushing out the door.</p>\n<p>Amelie doesn\u2019t move from her position. She contemplates everything that happened, everything that she\u2019s seen. The children, with so much joy in their hearts and so much love to give, now gone with the wind. The bond that she and the other Caretakers had that\u2019s as strong as a towering oak in a storm, now fallen apart at the seams. Moses Feghoot and his eyes that stare into her soul.</p>\n<p>There is no scenario that she can think of where she can move on. Not like this. It\u2019s unfathomable.</p>\n<p>The tears return, and Amelie lets them wash her sorrows away. She won\u2019t let the memories that she has of them all ever fade. Their names will be remembered and cherished for as long as she lives.</p>\n<p>As she ponders her position in the world and how she can make her work matter, the flowers bloom, the birds are chirping, and there are children who are laughing and making people\u2019s days brighter. She may not know it, but there is still joy hiding beneath the floorboards of these ever-stagnating times.</p>\n<p>And the world carries on without her.</p>\n<div class=\"collection\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">More\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">More\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table style=\"1px solid black; width: 100%;\">\n<tr>\n<th class=\"namerow\" colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p>Merehrab's Works</p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">SCPs</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8035\">SCP-8035</a> <em>(+43)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7163\">SCP-7163</a> <em>(+61)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8926\">SCP-8926</a> <em>(+52)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-9239\">SCP-9239</a> <em>(+22)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7550\">SCP-7550</a> <em>(+63)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-9696\">SCP-9696</a> <em>(+58)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-6461\">SCP-6461</a> <em>(+42)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">Tales/GoI Formats</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/infatuation-in-black\">Infatuation in Black</a> <em>(+26)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/you-cant-kill-the-idea-of-me\">You Can\u2019t Kill The Idea of Me</a> <em>(+26)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/one-side-of-an-interview-with-a-contained-anomaly\">One Side of an Interview with a Contained Anomaly</a> <em>(+54)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/i-only-loved-the-idea-of-you\">I Only Loved The Idea of You</a> <em>(+55)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/turning-out\">Turning Out</a> <em>(+32)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/blackbird\">Blackbird</a> <em>(+15)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/is-this-how-we-turn-out\">Is This How We Turn Out?</a> <em>(+20)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">Other</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/merehrabs-musings\">Merehrab\u2019s Musings</a> <em>(+44)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-sleep\">The Sleep</a>\" by Merehrab, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It, indeed, sucks to be in her position as of this moment. Directing an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub entire division] that the majority of the Foundation looks at with disdain does wonders for a person. But that doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that her family is safe. That everything she worked hard for is intact. And the anomalies are treated as they should be, as people with various needs that must be met. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s seen the horrors lurking in the darkness. All the worst containment breaches that any researcher can think of. But these breaches can all be prevented by one simple fix, that being to improve the quality of life not only for the researchers working tirelessly to defend the world but also for the SCPs that they contain.\n\n\n\nSo she carries on. She does what needs to be done for a better world for all walks of life. At the moment, the current issue is convincing the Overseers to approve an increase of their budget.\n\n\n\nAnd she has nothing.\n\n\n\nAs Amelie ponders for the fourteenth time about how she can further do nothing and make a convincing argument out of thin air, she hears the laughter of the children from down the hall. Their joy never ceases to brighten her day. Brandon with his ability to pull his eyes out of his sockets while juggling them, Julia with her fire breath, Angelica with the way that she can turn an entire room into a magical wonderland with a snap of her fingers. They\u2019re all so //extraordinary//. Amelie can\u2019t fathom a world not enriched by their presence and their kindness. \n\n\n\nBack to the paper now, no distractions. There can\u2019t be any more distractions.\n\n\n\nShe focuses on something else instead. The clock on the wall behind her ticks and ticks and ticks, pounding its cyclic rhythm into her skull and forcing her to drown out the other sounds in the room.\n\n\n\nThe tiresome mundanity of her procrastination then clashes with the boring reality of her daily life, creating a paradox that finally frees her to start being productive. \n\n\n\nNow she\u2019s back in business. Amelie starts by working on the spreadsheet, then switching tabs to work on the main document itself, then to another tab to work on the outline of the email that she\u2019ll send to the Overseers, then back to the spreadsheet. Back and forth and back and forth, no longer concerned about the future of the division, or the fact of the sudden silence outside, or the many shouting matches that she has with Feghoot, or that damn buzzing from the AC, or\u2014\n\n\n\nShe jolts from her productive trance. The sound of the air circulating above her is the only thing that can be heard. No voices, no footsteps. Nothing.\n\n\n\nAmelie can\u2019t hear the children.\n\n\n\nThen she hears the screaming and shouting in the distance, the hollering and stomping of boots from the security personnel, a cavalcade of outright panic from those of 169 who are not prepared for catastrophes at this scale. There has never been a more intense and constricting feeling in Amelie\u2019s chest since she first founded the division until this very moment.\n\n\n\nShe springs up from her chair, knocking it over as she rushes out the door and sprints down the hallway towards the commons area and the mess hall. \n\n\n\nA common sight of a room in complete disarray is usually the cramped crowds pushing and shoving over each other as they try to escape the chaos afoot, even trampling others unfortunate enough to be caught in the eye of the storm. What she doesn\u2019t expect are the fistfights, or the shouting matches between the anomalies and staff pointing fingers at each other, or Kirby Case failing to keep the situation from unraveling no matter how hard they try to dampen the hostilities. An outright brawl like this is unheard of at a site like 169.\n\n\n\nAmelie attempts to make her way over to Kirby before she is interrupted by the sound of someone calling her name. She turns to her left to see a familiar thaumaturgist with a puffy green coat and an inexplicably furious look on his face. \n\n\n\n[[[SCP-6714| Cole V. Filverent]]] approaches her with eyes like burning matches, before grabbing her by the lapels and pulling her face to face. \u201cWhat //did you do?//\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie calmly but firmly breaks his grip off her. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t do anything. Nobody\u2019s done anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe pauses before breaking off the tension between them. \u201cSorry. But there\u2019s something wrong with Polly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear her anymore. All I hear is quacking. I kept asking her if she\u2019s okay, but she\u2019s not answering me. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d His voice starts to shake with every word.\n\n\n\nAmelie puts her hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out too. I\u2019m as in the dark as you are. But once we get our bearings, then I can help you and help everyone else. We\u2019ll get through this together, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe hangs his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n\nSomewhere within the site\u2019s Playground, Polly Filverent has no reason to object that she\u2019s a duck and not a person in the form of a duck, as she doesn\u2019t understand the distinction between the two or any kind of human language.\n\n\n\nAmelie turns her attention back to Kirby, seeing that they are struggling to keep the masses at bay. She rushes over to their side, and they give a nod in acknowledgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s our status?\u201d Amelie asks.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a silence in the air, overwhelming over the raucous violence. Kirby looks at her with a blank stare, the life in their eyes dissipating right before her very sight.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Amy. The kids are gone,\u201d they state in a monotone tone, like they\u2019re reading off an obituary.\n\n\n\nAmelie can feel her stomach drop to the floor, but right now there\u2019s no time for processing what has just been said. She considers her options, before formulating a concrete plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan I borrow your megaphone?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d \n\n\n\nAmelie gestures toward the mass of people. \u201cThese people need a voice of reason. And I\u2019m usually the one to fill that role.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d They toss their megaphone to her, and she catches it with grace.\n\n\n\nA shout is heard by the raging masses, barely able to be recognized but the message is clear. They turn their attention to the source.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook. I know how difficult this is for all of us right now. We are all horrified, and rightfully so, but we can\u2019t solve this by pinning the blame on someone else. None of us know what\u2019s going on. Not me, not Melissa, not Kirby, not even Moses Feghoot, that ol\u2019 grouch. But we can get through this, like we always have,\u201d she elucidates, her public speaking skills that she learned getting their time to shine.\n\n\n\nOne man steps from the crowd to face her. She recognizes him as the one who has his arms and hands lacking skin and muscle tissue, leaving the skeleton behind. Or had, considering that his arms now appear to match the rest of his body. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou can fix this, right? Right?\u201d he pleads to her, the horror so clearly seen on his face with the realization that he has lost something important to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to assess what\u2019s been lost, convene with other sites to see who else is affected, and then we can help each other out to stay afloat in spite of this crisis. We can all use some mutual aid right about now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut can you reverse it?\u201d His expression changes to one of agitation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s interrupted by a voice from the crowd. \u201cShe can\u2019t, Fred! None of them can. The Foundation isn\u2019t going to do anything about it. //I know they won\u2019t//.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie takes a deep breath, before continuing. \u201cRegardless of what they do, we\u2019re not going to sit around and twiddle our thumbs while you all suffer. That\u2019s not in our motto. I\u2019ll never let any of you get left behind. Never.\u201d\n\n\n\nKirby taps on her shoulder, and she relinquishes the megaphone to them. \u201cAlright folks, simmer down, simmer down. Let\u2019s get this mess cleaned up.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the crowd disperses and the two catch up on both of their perspectives and what they each saw, they discuss what to do and eventually settle on having a meeting with the rest of the Caretakers and administrative staff.\n\n\n\nThey all scramble and pile up into the meeting room, some looking worse for wear than others, and they each sit in their respective seats. A long, uncomfortable silence goes by before someone speaks up.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo. Any ideas for what we should be doing?\u201d Melissa Mayfield looks as if she\u2019s been through three all-nighters in a row.\n\n\n\nKirby glares around the room, folding their arms over their legs and shrinking down to make themselves smaller. \u201cLet\u2019s just contact the others and get this over with.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelia nods her head, then hesitates. \u201cWe should keep in touch with the other sites, but I\u2019m worried about our friends. Their safety should be our number one priority, and something this terrible is going to take a lot more than a toll on them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Melissa turns her head to the site director. \u201cWhat about you, Moses?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe director doesn\u2019t respond. Amelie sees a man with a thousand-yard stare, eyes boring into her skull, like he\u2019s seen something that isn\u2019t meant to be seen. Like he\u2019s seen death itself riding on its white horse, to reap what it sows. \n\n\n\nShe imagines him shrugging off the whole affair, or even celebrating it in her most bad faith interpretation. But none of that aligns with reality. She\u2019s never seen him like this. Never seen him this afraid.\n\n\n\nIt can\u2019t be the Moses Feghoot that she knows. Not with those eyes.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Now**\n\n\n\nAmelie Metanoia, former director of the now defunct Anomalous Entity Engagement Division, sits on her bed in her newly leased apartment, typing the latest draft for a grant proposal to help fund the newest organization that she\u2019s working with. She\u2019s done work with a lot of charities, and has volunteered at homeless shelters, food pantries, blood drives, animal shelters, and has worked to support children in need. Name a non-profit organization off the top of your head, and Amelie has most likely worked with them. She\u2019s done it all.\n\n\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s not enough. Not enough to fulfill that promise that she made to her family all those years ago.\n\n\n\nKirby Case now works as a security guard at a warehouse some miles off from where Amelie lives. They still chat from time to time, but only through her insistent invitations and their reluctance to go along with it. They\u2019ve grown distant from her, for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\nMelissa Mayfield currently serves as an occupational therapist, helping other individuals to improve their ability in completing daily tasks, such as getting dressed or using a computer. Unlike Kirby, she and Amelie have become fast friends without the constant pressure of working at the Foundation, and they discuss a plethora of topics including their respective fields.\n\n\n\nMoses Feghoot has never been seen again. At least, Amelie has never seen him since that day. Her contact with the withering few remnants of the Foundation has confirmed to her multiple times that he\u2019s still alive and well, but not much else. No traces of his personal life or where he\u2019s been. It almost seems as if he vanished.\n\n\n\nLike they all have.\n\n\n\nWell, most of them. Some of them have simply lost the magic that made them who they are, that gave the world its beauty in many configurations.\n\n\n\nHer pet fish Percy, who had the former designation of [[[SCP-2689]]], now wanders around in a fish bowl on her desk, looking none the wiser of the anomalous attribute that he once held. On some days Amelie wishes that he can make her feel something again, make her feel less like a pathetic stain on the earth, even for just a moment, but that\u2019s never going to happen again. Percy is a blood parrot cichlid. And fish can\u2019t make miracles.\n\n\n\nShe tries her hardest not to cry. She has to keep going. She can\u2019t stop. Not now. There needs to be more done for the world. For the world that has excised its own wonder and whimsy, forever condemning itself to the bleak reality that it has become. For the people who need support, to feel like they aren\u2019t alone, to feel that they\u2019re loved and cared for. For the ghosts of the past that haunt her each and every day that she can\u2019t ever let down again.\n\n\n\nHer phone buzzes in her pocket, and she picks it up and looks at the screen. It\u2019s a text from Melissa. Another request to hang out at their favorite coffee shop, it seems. Eh, why not. It\u2019ll take her mind off things at least.\n\n\n\nAmelie packs her things, shoves her shoes on without tying them as she\u2019s too tired to even bother, and makes her way to the car. The ignition starts, and the familiar sound of the car\u2019s engine hissing fills her ears. That problem will have to be solved later, like all the other little dilemmas that slowly accumulate over time to morph into a big pile of inexorable filth that won\u2019t matter, in the end. So what it\u2019s noticeable? So what she can\u2019t take care of herself anymore? That\u2019s nothing compared to what she\u2019s lost.\n\n\n\nThe grey gloom of the sky above flies past her as the car approaches the cafe. It lacks the bright blue that the kids used to draw in their lovely little sketches. It lacks the fluffy clouds, the bright and shining sun, and the whimsy and imagination that once brought joy in her life.\n\n\n\nShe parks the car, and heads inside. Melissa is already there, sitting at the booth at the far left corner in the back. Both of their drinks and their usual orders have been set on the table. A common Melissa act of kindness.\n\n\n\nAmelie sits across from her. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Amy. How\u2019s it hanging?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNothing much.\u201d Her voice sounds unconvincing, but no one\u2019s going to care anyhow.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Melissa asks in concern.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help if you need anything, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie gets the urge to sink under the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. You\u2019re not my therapist, and I don\u2019t need one. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever it is, we can work through it together and\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust shut up, okay?\u201d She snaps without thinking.\n\n\n\nThe shift in Melissa\u2019s expression makes her regret it immediately. \u201cOkay. Do you want to talk about something else?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that would be nice. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelissa nods. \u201cWell, I was thinking about bringing the gang back together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe gang?\u201d Amelie raises an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, me, you, Kirby, Mos\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKirby wants nothing to do with me anymore, and Moses probably wants to dissociate from us altogether, wherever the hell he\u2019s at.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelissa blinks once. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Kirby? I thought you guys were like two peas in a pod.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, when you convince someone in your mission and have them believe in your cause to the point that they\u2019d die for it, and then the world decides on a whim to obliterate the people you\u2019re supposed to protect, what do you think is going to happen? Certainly not being on good terms with them, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can talk to them, though, right? You can work it out together.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie waves her arms up and down in exasperation. \u201cIf they wanted to talk to me, they would\u2019ve reached out to me. I had to do it for them, because they don\u2019t want to see my face again. And that\u2019s fine, actually! I don\u2019t like me either.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe knows that look on Melissa\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, Mel? I failed all of them. We were supposed to give them hope, help them be free to feel like themselves, and now they\u2019re gone and everyone hates my guts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one hates you, Amy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know Kirby does!\u201d Amelie raises her voice.\n\n\n\nMelissa takes a big gulp of her coffee, trying to keep it together, before continuing. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. They don\u2019t talk about you like that when they\u2019re around me. Maybe you two are getting the wrong ideas about each other, but either way, it\u2019s not your fault. You weren\u2019t the one who caused this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I promised them that I\u2019d protect them. And they\u2019re //gone//, Mel. If I ever see [[[SCP-6245| any]]] [[[SCP-1508| of]]] [[[SCP-8940| them]]] again, you know how they\u2019re going to feel about me.\u201d \n\n\n\nThey sit there in silence for a moment. Amelie fights to not choke herself up, to not let the tears sting her eyes.\n\n\n\nMelissa puts her hands on top of hers, to try to ground her out of her emotions. \u201cWe did the best we could. //You// did the best you could. You helped those left to find a safe place to live. You made sure they never went more than a day without needing what they needed the most. Don\u2019t you remember any of that?\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie takes a deep breath. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t know if that compares to what we lost. What I lost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change the past, Amy. All we can do now is carry on and honor them and what they stood for.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie chuckles at how ironic that is. \u201cAs if what they stood for isn\u2019t dead. I killed it, Mel. I should\u2019ve talked to them more, I should\u2019ve been there for them, but you want to know what I did? I kept worrying about spreadsheets and expense reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe stands up to make her point, gesticulating like a passionate lecturer. \u201cMaybe this is anomalous hibernation, or something. They\u2019re all asleep, and they\u2019ll come back one day when the world isn\u2019t a graveyard where dreams go to die. Nothing about what happened makes any goddamn sense at all. Sure, every anomaly got up and went to the farm upstate at the exact same time! That makes perfect sense! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s anomalous in and of itself? Don\u2019t you think we could\u2019ve done something about that? We could\u2019ve gotten a team, and I would\u2019ve been on that team, and it wouldn\u2019t matter how much sleep I would lose cause I would\u2019ve done it for\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nMelissa grabs her by the shoulder, gesturing to her to sit down. \u201cHey. You\u2019re going to make a scene. Deep breaths, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nBreathe in, breathe out.\n\n\n\nAmelie sits down, ignoring the people that are probably staring at her by now, and looks down at her food for a while, unwilling to even gather the strength to touch it with her fork.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s always the question of when. When can she move on from something like this? When can she wake up one day and say that she\u2019s now happy and fulfilled in life? Can she ever be happy anymore? \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s done the best she can to honor their memory and look forward to the future. But is that future possible without them? Is that possible without the magic of this world that made life worth living? Can there ever be a better future for her or the people that she cared for again?\n\n\n\nMelissa watches her with a look of pity. At least, that\u2019s what it looks like to Amelie, who deserves all the judgement given to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know how hard it is for you right now. It\u2019s hard for me too, but we can\u2019t keep fretting about what we could\u2019ve done. That won\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re gone. But we can still try to make things better for the people around us. You\u2019ve done so much for so many people, Amy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie finally lets the floodgates through and sobs, freeing herself from all the pain that she repressed inside.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mel, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe silence that unfolds is unbearable, but it\u2019s better than burdening herself with something that she can\u2019t control.\n\n\n\nShe wipes the tears from her eyes. \u201cI think I need help. With everything, really. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you find what you need. You shouldn\u2019t have to bear through this alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve fixed things with Kirby, but now I lost what we had too. They looked up to me, you know? And then I just pushed them away,\u201d Amelie admits.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think what you did is irreconcilable. It will take time, but they\u2019ll forgive you one day. I know they will,\u201d Melissa promises to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you think that they can come back one day? So this can all be over? I //need// this to be over.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe next thing she speaks to her is the most honest thing that she can say. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Amy. I really don\u2019t. But we have each other, and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest of their lunch passes in silence, before Melissa hurries to get to her next appointment. She gives a quick apology before rushing out the door.\n\n\n\nAmelie doesn\u2019t move from her position. She contemplates everything that happened, everything that she\u2019s seen. The children, with so much joy in their hearts and so much love to give, now gone with the wind. The bond that she and the other Caretakers had that\u2019s as strong as a towering oak in a storm, now fallen apart at the seams. Moses Feghoot and his eyes that stare into her soul.\n\n\n\nThere is no scenario that she can think of where she can move on. Not like this. It\u2019s unfathomable. \n\n\n\nThe tears return, and Amelie lets them wash her sorrows away. She won\u2019t let the memories that she has of them all ever fade. Their names will be remembered and cherished for as long as she lives.\n\n\n\nAs she ponders her position in the world and how she can make her work matter, the flowers bloom, the birds are chirping, and there are children who are laughing and making people\u2019s days brighter. She may not know it, but there is still joy hiding beneath the floorboards of these ever-stagnating times.\n\n\n\nAnd the world carries on without her.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:wikimodule\">component:wikimodule</a> |ratings= --]]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub", "scp-6714", "scp-2689", "scp-6245", "scp-1508", "scp-8940", "scp-8035", "scp-7163", "scp-8926", "scp-9239", "scp-7550", "scp-9696", "scp-6461", "infatuation-in-black", "you-cant-kill-the-idea-of-me", "one-side-of-an-interview-with-a-contained-anomaly", "i-only-loved-the-idea-of-you", "turning-out", "blackbird", "is-this-how-we-turn-out", "merehrabs-musings", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "bleak", "director-metanoia", "engagement-division", "tale", "world-kept-turning"], "title": "The Sleep - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-sleep", "year": 2026}}
