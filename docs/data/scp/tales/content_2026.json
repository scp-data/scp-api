The van belonging to the SCP Foundation parked right outside the convenience store. Its driver, Beau, sighed as he took the keys out of the ignition. Of all the days to get stuck in the field.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve got plans tonight. So being that you\u2019re free, I\u2019m\u2026 <em>delegating</em> this to you. Dee's words echoed in his head. They were the bottom of the SCP Foundation\u2019s totem pole, but then, Beau was the dirt underneath it. If he didn\u2019t want to accept orders from them, his only available option was walking out the door and hanging up his cleaning supplies for good.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have plans for tonight too?\u201d He pocketed his keys. \u201c\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t, but you could have at least considered it.\u201d Beau lamented to himself before getting out of the car. His first step down out of the van splashed his beige uniform with muck and dirt from the wet ground, and he grimaced.</p>\n<p>Grabbing a few basic supplies, he rounded the van and saw a man standing just outside the store. He was, simply described, a messy looking person. Beau less politely thought of him as white trash, seeing his tangled, grungy hair poking out from his flip flop sandals. The white wife beater tank top and sullied blue pants looked just as old and musty as they smelled. His hair clung to the back of his balding scalp for dear life, while his tired expression made him look done with life. He seemed unbothered by the hefty rain. Beau hoped this wasn\u2019t the man who owned the store-</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you, janitor man - you my hookup to get this fuckin\u2019 thing outta my store? I didn\u2019t buy this damn thing to have freaks shittin\u2019 on my floor all night!\u201d</p>\n<p>Goddammit. The janitor shook his head, trying to at least pretend to be willing to do the job of his own volition. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Beau. Beau Larkin of the Safe Cleanup Professionals. We sanitize, cleanse, and polish. I hope to be of service.\u201d</p>\n<p>He seemed somewhat appeased by the professionalism. The man shook his hand, glancing down at Beau\u2019s mud-spattered uniform with a furrowed brow. \u201cYeah, uh - Tony Watkins, nice to meetcha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what can I do for you, Mr. Watkins? I was told you had a mess in your store that was scaring away your paying customers?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man, Tony, became quite incensed. \u201cMess? Yeah I got a friggin\u2019 mess - There\u2019s this smelly, green fuck sittin\u2019 on my fridge, eating my whoppers, and wrecking my shit. And listen, my weird as fuck customers don't even care that he's there. The real problem is he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 up my freakin\u2019 store! And when I try to get him to leave he pulls a Glock on me - and, uh, the police think I\u2019m high! So you get in there, janitor man, and you either ice the fucker or get him outta my friggin\u2019 store! This is almost as bad as those freaks with the big meat ball!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, animal control is one of our specialties.\u201d Beau lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a look? Just let me grab my supplies from the truck.\u201d He tried to maintain the professional demeanor, both to appease Tony, and also to try to keep his own sanity.</p>\n<p>Beau went to retrieve his full duffel of the remaining cleaning supplies, cursing himself once again for not buying a taser, and followed the man inside. He was greeted with a half destroyed store, shelves and products spilled out everywhere. Any tubs of icecream, or snack bags, were open and drained of their contents. The cabinet behind the register that contained the cigarettes had been ransacked, and there was a pungent aroma of weed in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God, it looks like a tornado went through here. What exactly did you say did this?\u201d Beau looked back at the owner, fighting to hold his nose while in such close proximity to the other man.</p>\n<p>The fat store owner chuckled, and Beau was uncomfortably attentive to the way he\u2026 undulated. \u201cHeh, yeah I don\u2019t have a damn clue. Why don\u2019t you, uhhh, take a look yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>When they turned into the aisle, Beau didn\u2019t see anything besides the general devastation until he turned his head and nearly jumped back in surprise. Sitting there was a large brown tree frog the approximate size of a grown ass man. He was smoking a lit menthol cigarette while his hands were splayed out, the four fingers fiddling with random debris strewn about. He was sat atop a Hershey\u2019s brand freezer.</p>\n<p>Now, Beau was not a total stranger to strange animals\u2026 but this was fucking ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you, frog thing.\u201d The creature slightly lifted its head, blearily looking at the fat man. \u201cYeah I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, you little shit-stain. I got the janitor on your ass now. Your days are numbered -\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a loud clicking noise, as the frog cocked the Glock and pointed it at Tony. Beau and Tony exclaimed loud noises of surprise, and ducked out of the way as a bullet whizzed by and blew up a vat of Nutella, spilling its contents onto the floor - and Beau\u2019s already dirty shirt.</p>\n<p>Breathing deeply and averting his hyperventilation, Beau asked Tony why he hadn\u2019t called hazardous animal control of some kind if the frog had a gun.</p>\n<p>Tony, in response, looked at Beau like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI got rats, and you can\u2019t sell no food in a place with rats. Your uh, Sucking, Cleaning, Proselytizing or whatever doesn't report to the state. And I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 no damn animal control fees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau didn\u2019t know how to respond, and wrangled the topic back to the matter at hand. \u201cListen, okay? Cleaning I can do. Removing this guy? I mean, he\u2019s got a gun, I don\u2019t really-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t paying you to mull it over. This frog better be gone by the morning or I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m calling your manager.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa. No need for that.\u201d Beau swallowed at the thought of anyone except Dee chewing him out. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAttaboy! Just make sure you lock up afterwards.\u201d He tossed a spare key to Beau and started to head out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Wait, are you not gonna stay to make sure that I finish the job?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got plans with the, uh, ladies, ya know? I mean come on, it\u2019s Friday, I got a couple of bills burnin\u2019 a hole in my pocket. I got better things to do than fuck around with a frog after the 9-5. So uh, get to it, janitor man.\u201d The store owner walked out, and Beau looked away from his filthy attire. He felt a lot better being mercifully separated from the malodorous store owner. He peered around the corner at the frog, who seemed to be fiddling with the Glock before tossing it to the floor. Beau then looked down at the key in his palm as he heard the door shut behind Watkins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Friday. And everyone has plans.\u201d He turned his head over to the frog, who was ominously much closer than before, having approached silently. It was looking at the janitor expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo.\u201d The frog greeted, taking the cigarette out of its mouth and flicking some ash onto the tile floor. It had a deep gravelly voice, not what Beau had expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhhh, yo?\u201d Beau responded, forcing himself to have nerves of steel he didn\u2019t really possess.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Gary. You said your name was Beau?\u201d The frog took another drag from the cigarette as he finished speaking.</p>\n<p>Beau blinked twice, figuring he must have heard him outside. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d The frog took several more drags from the stick, and Beau watched it as a sweat bead dribbled down his wet face. \u201cSo what brings you to, uh, the corner store? Didn\u2019t know frogs liked\u2026 convenience?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog dropped into a splayed out sitting position, his body making a profoundly loud \u2018splop\u2019 noise as it collided with the smoothly tiled floor. \u201cI love frozen dinners and menthols, brother. Can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. This place has \u2018em in spades.\u201d \u2018Gary\u2019 seemed to believe that was reason enough, and went back to taking drags from his cig.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange combination.\u201d Beau hoped that this would be a lot smoother than he was fearing it would have been. \u201cSoooooo, is there like a home I can help you get back to?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog shook his head in the negative, which really meant he shook his entire torso more or less. \u201cAin\u2019t goin\u2019 home. Too much heat on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeat? What\u2026 what did you do?\u201d Beau leaned in, morbidly curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m famous. You never heard of the Chugwater Frogman?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is a Chugwater?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTown in Wyoming. I\u2019m their local frogman. Got tired of their bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau hoped there would be more of an explanation, or at least justification, but he was left wanting. \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay in this corner store, the uhm\u2026 the owner is gonna kill you. With a gun. A really big gun.\u201d Beau lied once again.</p>\n<p>Another wisp of menthol wafted through the air. \u201cNah, I could take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u2026 a bullet? You\u2019re saying you can take a bullet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I've had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cL-like what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot hit by a car once.\u201d The frog looked Beau dead in the eyes, and said, \u201cDo you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau blinked and swallowed. \u201cNo, I don't think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog stood up, his feet making little plap noises on the floor as he paced. \u201cListen, this place has everything a frogman could need, except for a nice Olive Garden platter, flat screen, and a DVR so I can watch Big Brother\u2026 sittin\u2019 on a sofa, rubbing my belly, scratchin\u2019 my-\u201d</p>\n<p>The janitor loudly cleared his throat. \u201cWell, look, that sounds awesome but my job right now is to clean this place up. If you want, I can get you somewhere wet at least? Do frogs like wet things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m more of a branch guy, but wet is a good start.\u201d Beau thought that over\u2026</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, Beau had situated Gary on a mop handle he had haphazardly placed inside of a trucker shower stall. Gary was gripping onto it, using it like a branch. It was liable to fall apart any second, but the lukewarm water cascading down Gary\u2019s back giving him a serene expression oddly made it all worth it. Sort of.</p>\n<p>It was much less fun when he had to start wheeling his mop bucket setup back and forth from the main store back to the janitor closet, the same room with the shower stall, and began the arduous task of the clean up. It was going to be quite a long one, between all the spilled food and drinks, cigarette ashes, poop\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cHey wait a minute.\u201d Beau said, looking at Gary as he was dumping out the bucket into the mop sink. Gary opened his eyes, and looked annoyed that he was being talked to. \u201cWhy did you shit all over the store - aren\u2019t you like, basically a human frog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrogman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, so\u2026 Why? Do they not house train frogmen in Wyoming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am burrow trained, thank you very much. That Tony guy just reminds me of the damn truckers who\u2019d come through. Always littering, fouling up the water. One of the reasons I left. I don\u2019t take shit from nobody, but I will shit on people who I think deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Man, Beau wished he could do that. Well, not shit on people\u2019s floors - that would be weird. But he definitely liked the rest of that attitude. \u201cYeah, that Tony guy is\u2026 not great. I\u2019d go so far as to say I think he\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude he smells like shit, at least you only smell like bleach and sadness.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man winced, looking down at his sullied beige uniform. \u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d He felt the soreness in his legs more profoundly, and decided to take a break by sitting down and leaning against the wall. \u201cI guess I am kinda sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frogman looked over, peering out of the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotcha down? You seemed pretty confident back there, like a\u2026 real cleaning professional.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau sighed heavily and leaned on the handle of his mop. \u201cA cleaning professional that barely makes above minimum wage. But it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s the issue, I just\u2026 can\u2019t shake how lonely I feel in this town, y\u2019know? I\u2019m committed to cleaning up Pierre\u2019s messes but I\u2019ve got no one to be in a mess with.\u201d He looked up at the creature.</p>\n<p>The frogman gazed at him with his large, unreadable golden eyes. There was something\u2026 utterly human in those eyes. \u201cNo one? Don\u2019t most people have someone else at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau shrugged. \u201cWell, I have a roommate, but we don\u2019t really talk to each other, just kinda exist in the same space. He wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day even if I was made of money. We just pay rent together.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few moments passed, as the shower continued to run its water, splattering over the floor. Then, Beau looked up from the blue and grey tiles as a brown froggy foot stepped into view. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anybody either. It\u2019s always just been me, not even really sure where I came from but this place seems better than Chugwater. It\u2019s got better janitors at least. And it has more than one restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau smirked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWendy\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau sat up straighter. \u201cNo way dude, me too! You fuck with a vanilla frosty?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gary sat down with a wet noise next to Beau. \u201cThat and the breakfast baconator with the swiss cheese sauce.\u201d</p>\n<p>The janitor nodded. \u201cI feel you, I feel you. Guy I live with only ever wants to order out Little Caesars - no taste whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck Little Caesars, they\u2019re cheap for sure but they taste like cardboard - and I\u2019ve eaten cardboard so I should know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely! I don\u2019t wanna eat a fuckin hot and ready every weekend because he can\u2019t pick up some actual groceries.\u201d A few moments passed, the soothing sound of water on tiles the only noise in the store.</p>\n<p>Then, Gary turned to Beau. \u201cYo, I got a twenty, let\u2019s slam some Dominoes when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026 Really?\u201d Beau asked, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah bro, least I can do after making you pick up my crap -\u201d</p>\n<p>A raucous shattering of glass followed by a series of thuds resonated through the store. The two budding fast food aficionados turned to see two people fall through the window on the side of the room. One man crashed directly onto the floor with a big thunk, while the woman landed more gracefully than her partner, though still not very professionally.</p>\n<p>\u201cCracker down\u2026.\u201d The man on the ground groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, the Pizza Hut in this town is better than the Dominoes.\u201d The woman remarked, cleaning herself off before grabbing her partner and hoisting him up to his feet. Beau noted she used a mechanical arm that seemed to make lifting a grown man effortless. \u201cChudley, you're making us look bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy you gotta say fuck me then? They didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He gestured to Gary and Beau, before desperately looking at them. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026. can I help you?\u201d Beau was too dumbfounded to even react to Chudley\u2019s question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can help us by staying out of the way, you damn spook.\u201d Maria scoffed.</p>\n<p>Beau blinked, and Gary chuckled. \u201cSpook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things around here and we know you SCPeople are government contractors. Things that go bump in the night disappear around y'all, and you're always driving around in those fuckass Chevy vans.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just a janitor, lady, and I don\u2019t have to explain myself to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to use a damn door!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re from Wyoming.\u201d Gary replied dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us know how to use doors. I broke that window over there when I came in.\u201d Gary pointed at another, larger window that was busted in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna state for the record that I suggested we use a door but my partner wanted to make an entrance in style.\u201d Chudley stepped forward. \u201cThis is Maria Johnston, aspiring parabiologist. And I am Greg Chudley, aspiring has-been.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gary looked at them with contempt. \u201cParabiology isn\u2019t real, dipshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be a real science, once I have a chance to study you.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cThen those chuds at UW will finally see my brilliance.\u201d</p>\n<p>The realization hit Beau like a bag of bricks to who he was dealing with, \u201cYou two are college students?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria glared as though Beau had just said the dumbest thing she\u2019d heard in her entire life. \u201cYeah man. We\u2019re on summer break. Do you not spend your summer break chasing your local cryptid 500 miles to the capital of South Dakota?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d Beau asked, only to be easily thrown aside by Maria\u2019s metal limb.</p>\n<p>Maria pointed an accusing thumb at Greg, who was pretending not to sift through the bags on the ground of the convenience store. \u201cBlame this one\u2019s trust fund for enabling our insane tendencies. Now, Gary. We\u2019ve come a long way for this. I promise I\u2019m not going to hurt you but I need to take you back to my lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frogman made a loud, furious squeaking noise. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not going anywhere! Why does everyone want something from me?!\u201d Gary leapt with an incredible force across the room to distance himself from the pair. A lightbulb went off in his big froggy brain as he saw a discarded firearm on the ground. \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d Gary picked up his Glock 17 and took aim at the collegiate duo. Chudley immediately threw his hands up but Maria held her ground. \u201cYou two skeddaddle! I want to go to Dominoes with Beau and maybe roll around in the soil, just for a bit, and then binge Big Brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the right side of Beau\u2019s body was aching from being thrown to the floor he would have felt all warm and tingly on the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had wanted to hang out with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you're being so loyal to Dominoes. Pizza Hut has the superior pepperoni.\u201d Maria continued to overcompliment Pizza Hut ignoring the fact she was being held at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you like wet dog food! Those \u2018ronis are too damn soggy. Stop trying to change the subject! I will shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take it.\u201d Maria smirked confidently.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being cocky, have you ever been shot before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than getting hit by a car, do you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends on what kind of car. A smart car\u2019s worth of bullets is a lot of bullets but not as many bullets as a Sedan. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I could get my boy to go get the van, could you take a van\u2019s worth of bullets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI survived getting hit by a train. There isn\u2019t a single amount of goddamn bullets that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take!\u201d Maria screamed, and Gary clicked the safety to the off position.</p>\n<p>Beau crawled over to Chudley, who had just found a fifty in the corner and pocketed it. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2026is happening right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, if you haven\u2019t noticed Maria is very\u2026. Particular about the semantics of things. She\u2019s never one to lose an argument, no matter how ridiculous. Or if a frog is pointing a gun at her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRiiight. Should we intervene before she gets herself shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno man, she\u2019s got me convinced. Maybe she could take a cruise ship\u2019s worth of bullets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau tuned back into the conversation and decided he needed to act. He immediately jumped in between the pair again when Gary chambered a round, and they\u2019d gotten somewhere near space shuttles worth of munition endurance.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, none of you can take any FUCKING amount of bullets. Listen, Gary is the only person in this god forsaken town who seems to want to give me the time of day and I\u2019m not gonna let you take him.\u201d Beau said, impassioned. \u201cThis town is full of oddities, weirdos, and whatever the hell else. I would know. Just fucking pick one to write your paper on but not him, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria stared daggers through Beau at the annoying frogman behind him but the janitor noticed a slight change in her demeanor before she turned around.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. You can take him.\u201d She said over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>Beau slumped with relief, and a little confusion. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re not gonna clock me again?\u201d</p>\n<p>A belabored sigh came from her as she walked away. \u201cWe've got other leads to follow up on. I'm sure we'll find something for the thesis.\u201d She turned around and signaled for Chudley to follow. \u201cWe'll be seeing you around Skipper, dunno how lenient I'll be next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chudley gave a wordless salute as the pair disappeared into the night, leaving Beau and Gary dumbfounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh\u2026 You really mean all that?\u201d Gary asked as he put away his Glock into the place in which he was storing it.</p>\n<p>Beau looked down at the slightly shorter creature. \u201cOf course man. You think that old coot has got more loose bills lying around? I saw that Chudley guy pocket a fifty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the way you think, funny man. Let's get ourselves some Dominoes money!\u201d</p>\n<p>And so Beau and Gary finished cleaning up the store to the best of their ability all except one mess that Gary had left behind in Tony's office, as well they managed to loot at least sixty more dollars from the backroom.</p>\n<p>Their weekend would be filled with delicious pizza and getting Gary set up back at Beau's place. While they didn't have an extra television just for Gary , they did have a window with a convenient angle to their next door neighbor whose favorite show just happened to be Big Brother.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-highlighter-theme\">:scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:cleaning-services\">:scp-wiki:theme:cleaning-services</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> start=--\n\n|name=SYTYCFanon]]\n\n**A Wyoming Frog in Pierre**\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sytycfanon|For more stories click here]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> end=--]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**Friday, 3:07 PM**\n\n[[size 120%]] **Watkins Corner Store** [[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nRain poured hard on the windshield of the broad, white vehicle. The van belonging to the SCP Foundation parked right outside the convenience store. Its driver, Beau, sighed as he took the keys out of the ignition. Of all the days to get stuck in the field.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got plans tonight. So being that you\u2019re free, I\u2019m\u2026 //delegating// this to you.\u00a0\u00a0Dee's\u00a0\u00a0words echoed in his head. They were the bottom of the SCP Foundation\u2019s totem pole, but then, Beau was the dirt underneath it. If he didn\u2019t want to accept orders from them, his only available option was walking out the door and hanging up his cleaning supplies for good.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have plans for tonight too?\u201d He pocketed his keys. \u201c... I mean, I don\u2019t, but you could have at least considered it.\u201d Beau lamented to himself before getting out of the car. His first step down out of the van splashed his beige uniform with muck and dirt from the wet ground, and he grimaced.\n\n\n\nGrabbing a few basic supplies, he rounded the van and saw a man standing just outside the store. He was, simply described, a messy looking person. Beau less politely thought of him as white trash, seeing his tangled, grungy hair poking out from his flip flop sandals. The white wife beater tank top and sullied blue pants looked just as old and musty as they smelled. His hair clung to the back of his balding scalp for dear life, while his tired expression made him look done with life. He seemed unbothered by the hefty rain. Beau hoped this wasn\u2019t the man who owned the store-\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, you, janitor man - you my hookup to get this fuckin\u2019 thing outta my store? I didn\u2019t buy this damn thing to have freaks shittin\u2019 on my floor all night!\u201d\n\n\n\nGoddammit. The janitor shook his head, trying to at least pretend to be willing to do the job of his own volition. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Beau. Beau Larkin of\u00a0\u00a0the Safe Cleanup Professionals. We sanitize, cleanse, and polish. I hope to be of service.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe seemed somewhat appeased by the professionalism. The man shook his hand, glancing down at Beau\u2019s mud-spattered uniform with a furrowed brow. \u201cYeah, uh - Tony Watkins, nice to meetcha.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo what can I do for you, Mr. Watkins? I was told you had a mess in your store that was scaring away your paying customers?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man, Tony, became quite incensed. \u201cMess? Yeah I got a friggin\u2019 mess - There\u2019s this smelly, green fuck sittin\u2019 on my fridge, eating my whoppers, and wrecking my shit. And listen, my weird as fuck customers don't even care that he's there. The real problem is he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 up my freakin\u2019 store! And when I try to get him to leave he pulls a Glock on me - and, uh, the police think I\u2019m high! So you get in there, janitor man, and you either ice the fucker or get him outta my friggin\u2019 store! This is almost as bad as those freaks with the big meat ball!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, animal control is one of our specialties.\u201d Beau lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a look? Just let me grab my supplies from the truck.\u201d He tried to maintain the professional demeanor, both to appease Tony, and also to try to keep his own sanity. \n\n\n\nBeau went to retrieve his full duffel of the remaining cleaning supplies, cursing himself once again for not buying a taser, and followed the man inside. He was greeted with a half destroyed store, shelves and products spilled out everywhere. Any tubs of icecream, or snack bags, were open and drained of their contents. The cabinet behind the register that contained the cigarettes had been ransacked, and there was a pungent aroma of weed in the air. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh God, it looks like a tornado went through here. What exactly did you say did this?\u201d Beau looked back at the owner, fighting to hold his nose while in such close proximity to the other man.\n\n\n\nThe fat store owner chuckled, and Beau was uncomfortably attentive to the way he\u2026 undulated. \u201cHeh, yeah I don\u2019t have a damn clue. Why don\u2019t you, uhhh, take a look yourself?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen they turned into the aisle, Beau didn\u2019t see anything besides the general devastation until he turned his head and nearly jumped back in surprise. Sitting there was a large brown tree frog the approximate size of a grown ass man. He was smoking a lit menthol cigarette while\u00a0\u00a0his hands were splayed out, the four fingers fiddling with random debris strewn about. He was sat atop a Hershey\u2019s brand freezer.\n\n\n\nNow, Beau was not a total stranger to strange animals\u2026 but this was fucking ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, you, frog thing.\u201d The creature slightly lifted its head, blearily looking at the fat man. \u201cYeah I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, you little shit-stain. I got the janitor on your ass now. Your days are numbered -\u201d \n\n\n\nThere was a loud clicking noise, as the frog cocked the Glock and pointed it at Tony. Beau and Tony exclaimed loud noises of surprise, and ducked out of the way as a bullet whizzed by and blew up a vat of Nutella, spilling its contents onto the floor - and Beau\u2019s already dirty shirt.\n\n\n\nBreathing deeply and averting his hyperventilation, Beau asked Tony why he hadn\u2019t called hazardous animal control of some kind if the frog had a gun.\n\n\n\nTony, in response, looked at Beau like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI got rats, and you can\u2019t sell no food in a place with rats. Your uh, Sucking, Cleaning, Proselytizing or whatever doesn't report to the state. And I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 no damn animal control fees.\u201d \n\n\n\nBeau didn\u2019t know how to respond, and wrangled the topic back to the matter at hand. \u201cListen, okay? Cleaning I can do. Removing this guy? I mean, he\u2019s got a gun, I don\u2019t really-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t paying you to mull it over. This frog better be gone by the morning or I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m calling your manager.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa. No need for that.\u201d Beau swallowed at the thought of anyone except Dee chewing him out. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 figure it out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAttaboy! Just make sure you lock up afterwards.\u201d He tossed a spare key to Beau and started to head out.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Wait, are you not gonna stay to make sure that I finish the job?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got plans with the, uh, ladies, ya know? I mean come on, it\u2019s Friday, I got a couple of bills burnin\u2019 a hole in my pocket. I got better things to do than fuck around with a frog after the 9-5. So uh, get to it, janitor man.\u201d The store owner walked out, and Beau looked away from his filthy attire. He felt a lot better being\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mercifully separated from the malodorous store owner. He peered around the corner at the frog, who seemed to be fiddling with the Glock before tossing it to the floor. Beau then looked down at the key in his palm as he heard the door shut behind Watkins.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Friday. And everyone has plans.\u201d He turned his head over to the frog, who was ominously much closer than before, having approached silently. It was looking at the janitor expectantly.\n\n\n\n\u201cYo.\u201d The frog greeted, taking the cigarette out of its mouth and flicking some ash onto the tile floor. It had a deep gravelly voice, not what Beau had expected.\n\n\n\n\u201cUhhhh, yo?\u201d Beau responded, forcing himself to have nerves of steel he didn\u2019t really possess.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Gary. You said your name was Beau?\u201d The frog took another drag from the cigarette as he finished speaking.\n\n\n\nBeau blinked twice, figuring he must have heard him outside. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d The frog took several more drags from the stick, and Beau watched it as a sweat bead dribbled down his wet face. \u201cSo what brings you to, uh, the corner store? Didn\u2019t know frogs liked\u2026 convenience?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog dropped into a splayed out sitting position, his body making a profoundly loud \u2018splop\u2019 noise as it collided with the smoothly tiled floor. \u201cI love frozen dinners and menthols, brother. Can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. This place has \u2018em in spades.\u201d \u2018Gary\u2019 seemed to believe that was reason enough, and went back to taking drags from his cig.\n\n\n\n\u201cStrange combination.\u201d Beau hoped that this would be a lot smoother than he was fearing it would have been. \u201cSoooooo, is there like a home I can help you get back to?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog shook his head in the negative, which really meant he shook his entire torso more or less. \u201cAin\u2019t goin\u2019 home. Too much heat on me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHeat? What\u2026 what did you do?\u201d Beau leaned in, morbidly curious.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famous. You never heard of the Chugwater Frogman?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is a Chugwater?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTown in Wyoming. I\u2019m their local frogman. Got tired of their bullshit.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau hoped there would be more of an explanation, or at least justification, but he was left wanting. \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay in this corner store, the uhm\u2026 the owner is gonna kill you. With a gun. A really big gun.\u201d Beau lied once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother wisp of menthol wafted through the air. \u201cNah, I could take it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA\u2026 a bullet? You\u2019re saying you can take a bullet?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I've had worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cL-like what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGot hit by a car once.\u201d The frog looked Beau dead in the eyes, and said, \u201cDo you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau blinked and swallowed. \u201cNo, I don't think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...Have you?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog stood up, his feet making little plap noises on the floor as he paced. \u201cListen, this place has everything a frogman could need, except for a nice Olive Garden platter, flat screen, and a DVR so I can watch Big Brother\u2026 sittin\u2019 on a sofa, rubbing my belly, scratchin\u2019 my-\u201d\n\n\n\nThe janitor loudly cleared his throat. \u201cWell, look, that sounds awesome but my job right now is to clean this place up. If you want, I can get you somewhere wet at least? Do frogs like wet things?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m more of a branch guy, but wet is a good start.\u201d Beau thought that over\u2026\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, Beau had situated Gary on a mop handle he had haphazardly placed inside of a trucker shower stall. Gary was gripping onto it, using it like a branch. It was liable to fall apart any second, but the lukewarm water cascading down Gary\u2019s back giving him a serene expression oddly made it all worth it. Sort of.\n\n\n\nIt was much less fun when he had to start wheeling his mop bucket setup back and forth from the main store back to the janitor closet, the same room with the shower stall, and began the arduous task of the clean up. It was going to be quite a long one, between all the spilled food and drinks, cigarette ashes, poop\u2013\n\n\n\n\u201cHey wait a minute.\u201d Beau said, looking at Gary as he was dumping out the bucket into the mop sink. Gary opened his eyes, and looked annoyed that he was being talked to. \u201cWhy did you shit all over the store - aren\u2019t you like, basically a human frog?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFrogman.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRight, so\u2026 Why? Do they not house train frogmen in Wyoming?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am burrow trained, thank you very much. That Tony guy just reminds me of the damn truckers who\u2019d come through. Always littering, fouling up the water. One of the reasons I left. I don\u2019t take shit from nobody, but I will shit on people who I think deserve it.\u201d\n\n\n\nMan, Beau wished he could do that. Well, not shit on people\u2019s floors - that would be weird. But he definitely liked the rest of that attitude. \u201cYeah, that Tony guy is\u2026 not great. I\u2019d go so far as to say I think he\u2019s an ass.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDude he smells like shit, at least you only smell like bleach and sadness.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man winced, looking down at his sullied beige uniform. \u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d He felt the soreness in his legs more profoundly, and decided to take a break by sitting down and leaning against the wall. \u201cI guess I am kinda sad.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frogman looked over, peering out of the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotcha down? You seemed pretty confident back there, like a\u2026 real cleaning professional.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau sighed heavily and leaned on the handle of his mop. \u201cA cleaning professional that barely makes above minimum wage. But it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s the issue, I just\u2026 can\u2019t shake how lonely I feel in this town, y\u2019know? I\u2019m committed to cleaning up Pierre\u2019s messes but I\u2019ve got no one to be in a mess with.\u201d He looked up at the creature.\n\n\n\nThe frogman gazed at him with his large, unreadable golden eyes. There was something\u2026 utterly human in those eyes. \u201cNo one? Don\u2019t most people have someone else at home?\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau shrugged. \u201cWell, I have a roommate, but we don\u2019t really talk to each other, just kinda exist in the same space. He wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day even if I was made of money. We just pay rent together.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few moments passed, as the shower continued to run its water, splattering over the floor. Then, Beau looked up from the blue and grey tiles as a brown froggy foot stepped into view. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anybody either. It\u2019s always just been me, not even really sure where I came from but this place seems better than Chugwater. It\u2019s got better janitors at least. And it has more than one restaurant.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau smirked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to eat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau sat up straighter. \u201cNo way dude, me too! You fuck with a vanilla frosty?\u201d\n\n\n\nGary sat down with a wet noise next to Beau. \u201cThat and the breakfast baconator with the swiss cheese sauce.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe janitor nodded. \u201cI feel you, I feel you. Guy I live with only ever wants to order out Little Caesars - no taste whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck Little Caesars, they\u2019re cheap for sure but they taste like cardboard - and I\u2019ve eaten cardboard so I should know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! I don\u2019t wanna eat a fuckin hot and ready every weekend because he can\u2019t pick up some actual groceries.\u201d A few moments passed, the soothing sound of water on tiles the only noise in the store.\n\n\n\nThen, Gary turned to Beau. \u201cYo, I got a twenty, let\u2019s slam some Dominoes when you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2026 Really?\u201d Beau asked, stunned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah bro, least I can do after making you pick up my crap -\u201d\n\n\n\nA raucous shattering of glass followed by a series of thuds resonated through the store. The two budding fast food aficionados turned to see two people fall through the window on the side of the room. One man crashed directly onto the floor with a big thunk, while the woman landed more gracefully than her partner, though still not very professionally.\n\n\n\n\u201cCracker down\u2026.\u201d The man on the ground groaned.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, the Pizza Hut in this town is better than the Dominoes.\u201d The woman remarked, cleaning herself off before grabbing her partner and hoisting him up to his feet. Beau noted she used a mechanical arm that seemed to make lifting a grown man effortless. \u201cChudley, you're making us look bad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy you gotta say fuck me then? They didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He gestured to Gary and Beau, before desperately looking at them. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see that, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2026. can I help you?\u201d Beau was too dumbfounded to even react to Chudley\u2019s question.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can help us by staying out of the way, you damn spook.\u201d Maria scoffed.\n\n\n\nBeau blinked, and Gary chuckled. \u201cSpook?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things around here and we know you SCPeople are government contractors. Things that go bump in the night disappear around y'all, and you're always driving around in those fuckass Chevy vans.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a janitor, lady, and I don\u2019t have to explain myself to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to use a damn door!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re from Wyoming.\u201d Gary replied dryly. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of us know how to use doors. I broke that window over there when I came in.\u201d Gary pointed at another, larger window that was busted in.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna state for the record that I suggested we use a door but my partner wanted to make an entrance in style.\u201d Chudley stepped forward. \u201cThis is Maria Johnston, aspiring parabiologist. And I am Greg Chudley, aspiring has-been.\u201d\n\n\n\nGary looked at them with contempt. \u201cParabiology isn\u2019t real, dipshit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be a real science, once I have a chance to study you.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cThen those chuds at UW will finally see my brilliance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe realization hit Beau like a bag of bricks to who he was dealing with, \u201cYou two are college students?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria glared as though Beau had just said the dumbest thing she\u2019d heard in her entire life. \u201cYeah man. We\u2019re on summer break. Do you not spend your summer break chasing your local cryptid 500 miles to the capital of South Dakota?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d Beau asked, only to be easily thrown aside by Maria\u2019s metal limb. \n\n\n\nMaria pointed an accusing thumb at Greg, who was pretending not to sift through the bags on the ground of the convenience store. \u201cBlame this one\u2019s trust fund for enabling our insane tendencies. Now, Gary. We\u2019ve come a long way for this. I promise I\u2019m not going to hurt you but I need to take you back to my lab.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frogman made a loud, furious squeaking noise. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not going anywhere! Why does everyone want something from me?!\u201d Gary leapt with an incredible force across the room to distance himself from the pair. A lightbulb went off in his big froggy brain as he saw a discarded firearm on the ground. \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d Gary picked up his Glock 17 and took aim at the collegiate duo. Chudley immediately threw his hands up but Maria held her ground. \u201cYou two skeddaddle! I want to go to Dominoes with Beau and maybe roll around in the soil, just for a bit, and then binge Big Brother.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf the right side of Beau\u2019s body was aching from being thrown to the floor he would have felt all warm and tingly on the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had wanted to hang out with him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you're being so loyal to Dominoes. Pizza Hut has the superior pepperoni.\u201d Maria continued to overcompliment Pizza Hut ignoring the fact she was being held at gunpoint.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you like wet dog food! Those \u2018ronis are too damn soggy. Stop trying to change the subject! I will shoot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can take it.\u201d Maria smirked confidently.\n\n\n\n\u201cStop being cocky, have you ever been shot before?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than getting hit by a car, do you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDepends on what kind of car. A smart car\u2019s worth of bullets is a lot of bullets but not as many bullets as a Sedan. \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I could get my boy to go get the van, could you take a van\u2019s worth of bullets?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI survived getting hit by a train. There isn\u2019t a single amount of goddamn bullets that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take!\u201d Maria screamed, and Gary clicked the safety to the off position.\n\n\n\nBeau crawled over to Chudley, who had just found a fifty in the corner and pocketed it. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2026is happening right now?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, uh, if you haven\u2019t noticed Maria is very\u2026. Particular about the semantics of things. She\u2019s never one to lose an argument, no matter how ridiculous. Or if a frog is pointing a gun at her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRiiight. Should we intervene before she gets herself shot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI dunno man, she\u2019s got me convinced. Maybe she could take a cruise ship\u2019s worth of bullets.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau tuned back into the conversation and decided he needed to act. He immediately jumped in between the pair again when Gary chambered a round, and they\u2019d gotten somewhere near space shuttles worth of munition endurance.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, none of you can take any FUCKING amount of bullets. Listen, Gary is the only person in this god forsaken town who seems to want to give me the time of day and I\u2019m not gonna let you take him.\u201d Beau said, impassioned. \u201cThis town is full of oddities, weirdos, and whatever the hell else. I would know. Just fucking pick one to write your paper on but not him, please.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaria stared daggers through Beau at the annoying frogman behind him but the janitor noticed a slight change in her demeanor before she turned around.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. You can take him.\u201d She said over her shoulder.\n\n\n\nBeau slumped with relief, and a little confusion. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re not gonna clock me again?\u201d\n\n\n\nA belabored sigh came from her as she walked away. \u201cWe've got other leads to follow up on. I'm sure we'll find something for the thesis.\u201d She turned around and signaled for Chudley to follow. \u201cWe'll be seeing you around Skipper, dunno how lenient I'll be next time.\u201d \n\n\n\nChudley gave a wordless salute as the pair disappeared into the night, leaving Beau and Gary dumbfounded.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, uh\u2026 You really mean all that?\u201d Gary asked as he put away his Glock into the place in which he was storing it.\n\n\n\nBeau looked down at the slightly shorter creature. \u201cOf course man. You think that old coot has got more loose bills lying around? I saw that Chudley guy pocket a fifty.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI like the way you think, funny man. Let's get ourselves some Dominoes money!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so Beau and Gary finished cleaning up the store to the best of their ability all except one mess that Gary had left behind in Tony's office, as well they managed to loot at least sixty more dollars from the backroom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTheir weekend would be filled with delicious pizza and getting Gary set up back at Beau's place. While they didn't have an extra television just for Gary , they did have a window with a convenient angle to their next door neighbor whose favorite show just happened to be Big Brother.\n", "references": ["sytycfanon"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "cleanliness-guaranteed", "greg-chudley", "tale"], "title": "A Wyoming Frog In Pierre - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-wyoming-frog-in-pierre", "year": 2026}, "clipboard-avoiding-me": {"created_at": "2026-01-03T17:15:00", "creator": "xexnoncores", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "Added tags: poetry, surreal, tale.

You need a radioactive isotope; you need a container to hold it; you need shielding around that container. Every source of thanatic energy is different.

The same goes for the First: a blasted tree in no-man's-land, or the perforated skull of the first casualty. Before those were the Opium Wars, the Napoleonic Wars, the Wars of the Reformation; and after, Korea, Vietnam, the Congo. Humans are good at killing each other.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The most powerful thanatic source known to modern thaumatologists (excluding Mythic Age creations like the Atlantean Dead Mind) is the Volga Core, a roughly skull-shaped piece of furnace slag recovered from the ruins of the Red October steel plant after the Battle of Stalingrad. Exposure to the Volga Core can turn a healthy living human into a walking corpse in less than fifteen seconds. It was originally kept as part of the Soviet Union's paraweapon stockpile by the KGB Division of Special Circumstances; its current whereabouts are unknown, and it may be in the hands of the criminal organization known as \"Scarlet Hammer\".</p>\n<p>The thanatic source that caused the Chanhassen Catastrophe was not nearly that powerful. Originally recovered from the site of the Civil War Battle of Stones River, the Chanhassen source was a human femur from the body of Union Army Lieutenant Jeremiah Hackwell. It was engraved with an array of focusing sigils by the 19th-century scientist and necromancer Archibald Gravestone, one of the founders of Prometheus Labs, and further modified with inset silver circuitry by Prometheus Medical thanaturges. It was, as these things go, safe to be around; if undamaged, the Chanhassen source would take over a week of passive exposure to kill a healthy adult.</p>\n<p>You will note that there are four variables in that sentence: \"undamaged\", \"passive\", \"healthy\" and \"adult\". We will come back to them later.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Chanhassen is an outer suburb on the southern edge of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. It has a population of approximately twenty-five thousand, and is home to the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum; the Temple of Eck, headquarters of the new-age religious movement Eckankar; and Paisley Park, the former estate of the late musician Prince, now a recording studio and museum. It was also home to Athanasia Radiology, the Prometheus Medical subsidiary which conducted thanatotherapy trials in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Athanasia Radiology did not make it through the paratech crash, and shuttered its doors in 1997. All the mundane radiation sources were removed during the company's liquidation; Lieutenant Hackwell's femur was not. It remained untouched in a basement storage room for a quarter of a century, slightly lowering the life expectancy of the abandoned laboratory's rodent population and occasionally reanimating an insect. And there it would have stayed, if not for the intervention of a group of local teens.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>On October 31st, 2023, around 10:30 PM, a group of six Chanhassen High School seniors broke in to the Athanasia Radiology facility on a dare. All the teenagers were mildly intoxicated, and two of them had smoked a small amount of cannabis. One of those two, Keith Dahl, had also consumed a dose of psilocybin mushrooms; unbeknownst to him, this psychedelic experience had awakened his latent thaumaturgic talent.</p>\n<p>The ringleader, Mike Nelson, led the group into the basement, intending to hold a seance. The storage room containing the Chanhassen source was chosen, as it had the \"spookiest vibes\", and the teenagers soon found the source, deciding to use it as a prop for their seance. They lit candles, attempted to invoke the spirits of the dead, and passed around the femur. When Keith Dahl was given the femur, and called out to the spirit of its former owner, the Chanhassen Catastrophe began.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the framework of Universal Thaumatology, there are three components to any thaumatological working (or, in layman's terms, a spell): energy, action, and will. Energy is given purpose by the caster's will and form by their action. Purpose guides form, leading to change. In the case of Keith Dahl's accidental working, the energy was the thanatic power of the Chanhassen source; the action was his invocation of Lieutenant Hackwell's spirit; and the will was his own desire to, in his own words, \"see some spooky Halloween shit\". The result of this malformed spell was predictably disastrous.</p>\n<p>First: the summoning succeeded. Jeremiah Hackwell's shade was conjured up from Hell, the Tartarean realm where it had resided for the past 160 years. He was disoriented and only semi-sapient. This working had an approximate ARAD reading of 2.5 Kilocaspers, Sapphire, Sharp, Loose \u2014 moderate power, relatively blatant, constructive, and poorly formed. From these data, we can extrapolate the spell's backlash.</p>\n<p>Lower intensity, opposite hue, opposite pitch, same weave. With a Loose weave, we expect backlash of around 75% the original intensity, or approximately 1.8 Kilocaspers. Hue goes from Sapphire to Lemon, reducing the blatancy of the effect; pitch goes from Sharp to Flat, resulting in a destructive effect. The Chanhassen source's inlaid circuitry was partially destroyed by a burst of heat, and as a result, the source began actively and uncontrollably emitting thanatic energy, killing and reanimating all six teenagers.</p>\n<p>Secondary backlash occured with an intensity of about 1.25 Kilocaspers, and the same hue and pitch as the original spell. This bound the ghost of Jeremiah Hackwell into the Chanhassen source, and the ghost of Keith Dahl into his own reanimated corpse, allowing him to regain control of his body; the ghosts of the remaining teenagers were too weak to survive the binding, and dissipated.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Post-mortem sapience is possible for most thaumaturges, given sufficient study of the necromantic arts, but rarely desireable. Even the most powerful ghosts are limited by their existence as energy constructs, unable to work magic without destabilizing their animating essence and damaging their own memories. Revenants, like the unfortunate Mr. Dahl, are slightly hardier, and can safely cast spells using external EVE sources, but they require expensive chemical treatments and regular embalming sessions to stave off decay. Most mages simply prefer to die, and leave their legacy to their heirs.</p>\n<p>Keith Dahl was luckier than most revenants, in that his body was in near-perfect condition; thanatic energy kills by interrupting metabolic processes, much like cyanide, leading to cell death without gross tissue damage. He had yet to realize that he was dead. His first reaction, upon regaining consciousness and seeing the corpses of his friends, was to call 911. The tertiary backlash (subtle, destructive) of his accidental spell had damaged his cell phone, but his friend Mary Anderson's was still functional, and he made the call. An ambulance was sent to the abandoned laboratory, followed by a Carver County sheriff's deputy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Mr. Dahl made his way out of the basement to wait for emergency services, still holding the Chanhassen source. The ambulance arrived first, and the EMTs, Carlos Gutierrez and Julie Vang, quickly identified Mr. Dahl's lack of any vital signs. Given his continued animation, the human bone still clutched in his left hand, and the date, they decided to \"get the fuck out before [they] got zombified too.\" They gave him a space blanket and a hand warmer, and fled the scene. This saved their lives.</p>\n<p>Deputy Eli Johanssen was not so lucky. He had been warned about Mr. Dahl's undead nature by the paramedics, and came out of his squad car with his pistol drawn. Unfortunately, Carver County sheriff's uniforms are grey, and Jeremiah Hackwell's bound spirit was startled. Believing Deputy Johanssen to be a member of the Confederate Army, Hackwell used his nascent control over the Chanhassen source to shoot a focused beam of thanatic energy at Deputy Johanssen's heart, killing him instantly.</p>\n<p>At this point, Mr. Dahl fled back into the abandoned laboratory with the Chanhassen source. His decision to hide, rather than to make his way into town in search of medical attention or an authority figure, likely saved many lives. Within two hours, alerted by keywords in local law enforcement radio transmissions, Moblie Task Force Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\") had arrived on the scene, and quickly contained Mr. Dahl and the Chanhassen source.</p>\n<p>At his request, Mr. Dahl's spirit was banished after a brief interview; his body and the bodies of his friends were deanimated and returned to their families for burial. Standard cover story CO-3, \"Carbon Monoxide Inhalation,\" was disseminated to the press. The EMTs, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Vang, were amnesticized and implanted with false memories of discovering the bodies of the children and the sheriff's deputy in the laboratory basement. The Chanhassen source is classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is contained in a lead-lined containment locker at Storage Site-23.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>There are three primary lessons to be learned from the Chanhassen Catastrophe.</p>\n<p>First, that paratechnology must be contained. If the Athanasia Radiology clinic had been located in a paranormal enclave such as Three Portlands, it is likely that the Chanhassen Source would not have been abandoned in the first place; and if it had, anyone who encountered it would have been better equipped to recognize it as a dangerous occult artifact. The spread of paratechnology into unveiled society is dangerous, and preventing that spread is one of the primary purposes of the Foundation; nexuses and freeports are the lesser of two evils.</p>\n<p>Second, that thaumatology is inherently dangerous. Even operatives of the Global Occult Coalition sometimes fail to sufficiently account for backlash; if the best-trained occultists in the world can be killed by an unmanaged spell, self-trained civilian thaumaturges stand no chance. The Coalition's near-monopoly on thaumatological education probably causes more good than harm, at least for now, but the Foundation, in the interest of public safety and the continuity of humanity, has a duty to contain or eliminate any thaumaturges not affiliated with the GOC.</p>\n<p>And finally, that civilian cowardice saves lives. The EMTs immediately left the scene when they realized that Mr. Dahl's condition was anomalous; after the death of Deputy Johanssen, Mr. Dahl himself hid from further human contact. Both these actions prevented deaths, and more could have been prevented if Mr. Dahl and his friends had been too scared to enter the abandoned laboratory in the first place. Foundation social engineering programs since the end of the Cold War have done an admirable job at maintaining high levels of fear and anxiety in the American populace, and consistently prove their worth; if adolescent male bravado can be further tempered, it is estimated that civilian contact with the anomalous could be reduced by up to 15%. A scared populace is a quiet populace.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/dig-u-better-dead\">Dig U Better Dead</a>\" by ch00bakka, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Humans are good at killing each other. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe most powerful thanatic source known to modern thaumatologists (excluding Mythic Age creations like the Atlantean Dead Mind) is the Volga Core, a roughly skull-shaped piece of furnace slag recovered from the ruins of the Red October steel plant after the Battle of Stalingrad. Exposure to the Volga Core can turn a healthy living human into a walking corpse in less than fifteen seconds. It was originally kept as part of the Soviet Union's paraweapon stockpile by the KGB Division of Special Circumstances; its current whereabouts are unknown, and it may be in the hands of the criminal organization known as \"Scarlet Hammer\".\n\n\n\nThe thanatic source that caused the Chanhassen Catastrophe was not nearly that powerful. Originally recovered from the site of the Civil War Battle of Stones River, the Chanhassen source was a human femur from the body of Union Army Lieutenant Jeremiah Hackwell. It was engraved with an array of focusing sigils by the 19th-century scientist and necromancer Archibald Gravestone, one of the founders of Prometheus Labs, and further modified with inset silver circuitry by Prometheus Medical thanaturges. It was, as these things go, safe to be around; if undamaged, the Chanhassen source would take over a week of passive exposure to kill a healthy adult. \n\n\n\nYou will note that there are four variables in that sentence: \"undamaged\", \"passive\", \"healthy\" and \"adult\". We will come back to them later. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nChanhassen is an outer suburb on the southern edge of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. It has a population of approximately twenty-five thousand, and is home to the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum; the Temple of Eck, headquarters of the new-age religious movement Eckankar; and Paisley Park, the former estate of the late musician Prince, now a recording studio and museum. It was also home to Athanasia Radiology, the Prometheus Medical subsidiary which conducted thanatotherapy trials in the 1970s. \n\n\n\nAthanasia Radiology did not make it through the paratech crash, and shuttered its doors in 1997. All the mundane radiation sources were removed during the company's liquidation; Lieutenant Hackwell's femur was not. It remained untouched in a basement storage room for a quarter of a century, slightly lowering the life expectancy of the abandoned laboratory's rodent population and occasionally reanimating an insect. And there it would have stayed, if not for the intervention of a group of local teens.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOn October 31st, 2023, around 10:30 PM, a group of six Chanhassen High School seniors broke in to the Athanasia Radiology facility on a dare. All the teenagers were mildly intoxicated, and two of them had smoked a small amount of cannabis. One of those two, Keith Dahl, had also consumed a dose of psilocybin mushrooms; unbeknownst to him, this psychedelic experience had awakened his latent thaumaturgic talent. \n\n\n\nThe ringleader, Mike Nelson, led the group into the basement, intending to hold a seance. The storage room containing the Chanhassen source was chosen, as it had the \"spookiest vibes\", and the teenagers soon found the source, deciding to use it as a prop for their seance. They lit candles, attempted to invoke the spirits of the dead, and passed around the femur. When Keith Dahl was given the femur, and called out to the spirit of its former owner, the Chanhassen Catastrophe began. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nIn the framework of Universal Thaumatology, there are three components to any thaumatological working (or, in layman's terms, a spell): energy, action, and will. Energy is given purpose by the caster's will and form by their action. Purpose guides form, leading to change. In the case of Keith Dahl's accidental working, the energy was the thanatic power of the Chanhassen source; the action was his invocation of Lieutenant Hackwell's spirit; and the will was his own desire to, in his own words, \"see some spooky Halloween shit\". The result of this malformed spell was predictably disastrous. \n\n\n\nFirst: the summoning succeeded. Jeremiah Hackwell's shade was conjured up from Hell, the Tartarean realm where it had resided for the past 160 years. He was disoriented and only semi-sapient. This working had an approximate ARAD reading of 2.5 Kilocaspers, Sapphire, Sharp, Loose -- moderate power, relatively blatant, constructive, and poorly formed. From these data, we can extrapolate the spell's backlash.\n\n\n\nLower intensity, opposite hue, opposite pitch, same weave. With a Loose weave, we expect backlash of around 75% the original intensity, or approximately 1.8 Kilocaspers. Hue goes from Sapphire to Lemon, reducing the blatancy of the effect; pitch goes from Sharp to Flat, resulting in a destructive effect. The Chanhassen source's inlaid circuitry was partially destroyed by a burst of heat, and as a result, the source began actively and uncontrollably emitting thanatic energy, killing and reanimating all six teenagers.\n\n\n\nSecondary backlash occured with an intensity of about 1.25 Kilocaspers, and the same hue and pitch as the original spell. This bound the ghost of Jeremiah Hackwell into the Chanhassen source, and the ghost of Keith Dahl into his own reanimated corpse, allowing him to regain control of his body; the ghosts of the remaining teenagers were too weak to survive the binding, and dissipated. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nPost-mortem sapience is possible for most thaumaturges, given sufficient study of the necromantic arts, but rarely desireable. Even the most powerful ghosts are limited by their existence as energy constructs, unable to work magic without destabilizing their animating essence and damaging their own memories. Revenants, like the unfortunate Mr. Dahl, are slightly hardier, and can safely cast spells using external EVE sources, but they require expensive chemical treatments and regular embalming sessions to stave off decay. Most mages simply prefer to die, and leave their legacy to their heirs. \n\n\n\nKeith Dahl was luckier than most revenants, in that his body was in near-perfect condition; thanatic energy kills by interrupting metabolic processes, much like cyanide, leading to cell death without gross tissue damage. He had yet to realize that he was dead. His first reaction, upon regaining consciousness and seeing the corpses of his friends, was to call 911. The tertiary backlash (subtle, destructive) of his accidental spell had damaged his cell phone, but his friend Mary Anderson's was still functional, and he made the call. An ambulance was sent to the abandoned laboratory, followed by a Carver County sheriff's deputy. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMr. Dahl made his way out of the basement to wait for emergency services, still holding the Chanhassen source. The ambulance arrived first, and the EMTs, Carlos Gutierrez and Julie Vang, quickly identified Mr. Dahl's lack of any vital signs. Given his continued animation, the human bone still clutched in his left hand, and the date, they decided to \"get the fuck out before [they] got zombified too.\" They gave him a space blanket and a hand warmer, and fled the scene. This saved their lives. \n\n\n\nDeputy Eli Johanssen was not so lucky. He had been warned about Mr. Dahl's undead nature by the paramedics, and came out of his squad car with his pistol drawn. Unfortunately, Carver County sheriff's uniforms are grey, and Jeremiah Hackwell's bound spirit was startled. Believing Deputy Johanssen to be a member of the Confederate Army, Hackwell used his nascent control over the Chanhassen source to shoot a focused beam of thanatic energy at Deputy Johanssen's heart, killing him instantly. \n\n\n\nAt this point, Mr. Dahl fled back into the abandoned laboratory with the Chanhassen source. His decision to hide, rather than to make his way into town in search of medical attention or an authority figure, likely saved many lives. Within two hours, alerted by keywords in local law enforcement radio transmissions, Moblie Task Force Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\") had arrived on the scene, and quickly contained Mr. Dahl and the Chanhassen source. \n\n\n\nAt his request, Mr. Dahl's spirit was banished after a brief interview; his body and the bodies of his friends were deanimated and returned to their families for burial. Standard cover story CO-3, \"Carbon Monoxide Inhalation,\" was disseminated to the press. The EMTs, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Vang, were amnesticized and implanted with false memories of discovering the bodies of the children and the sheriff's deputy in the laboratory basement. The Chanhassen source is classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is contained in a lead-lined containment locker at Storage Site-23.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThere are three primary lessons to be learned from the Chanhassen Catastrophe. \n\n\n\nFirst, that paratechnology must be contained. If the Athanasia Radiology clinic had been located in a paranormal enclave such as Three Portlands, it is likely that the Chanhassen Source would not have been abandoned in the first place; and if it had, anyone who encountered it would have been better equipped to recognize it as a dangerous occult artifact. The spread of paratechnology into unveiled society is dangerous, and preventing that spread is one of the primary purposes of the Foundation; nexuses and freeports are the lesser of two evils.\n\n\n\nSecond, that thaumatology is inherently dangerous. Even operatives of the Global Occult Coalition sometimes fail to sufficiently account for backlash; if the best-trained occultists in the world can be killed by an unmanaged spell, self-trained civilian thaumaturges stand no chance. The Coalition's near-monopoly on thaumatological education probably causes more good than harm, at least for now, but the Foundation, in the interest of public safety and the continuity of humanity, has a duty to contain or eliminate any thaumaturges not affiliated with the GOC. \n\n\n\nAnd finally, that civilian cowardice saves lives. The EMTs immediately left the scene when they realized that Mr. Dahl's condition was anomalous; after the death of Deputy Johanssen, Mr. Dahl himself hid from further human contact. Both these actions prevented deaths, and more could have been prevented if Mr. Dahl and his friends had been too scared to enter the abandoned laboratory in the first place. Foundation social engineering programs since the end of the Cold War have done an admirable job at maintaining high levels of fear and anxiety in the American populace, and consistently prove their worth; if adolescent male bravado can be further tempered, it is estimated that civilian contact with the anomalous could be reduced by up to 15%. A scared populace is a quiet populace.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "ghost", "halloween", "no-dialogue", "prometheus", "tale", "third-law"], "title": "Dig U Better Dead - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dig-u-better-dead", "year": 2026}, "down-the-tracks": {"created_at": "2026-01-01T01:19:00", "creator": "switchitea", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "switchitea", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/switchitea", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-01T01:19:00"}, {"author": "switchitea", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/switchitea", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange.

It barrels through the uncaring skies with a fervor and a tenor, it's engines blaring at twenty five thousand rotations per minute. Exhaust billows as sixty hundred gallons of jet fuel are churned, burned and discarded inside a ten ton turbine. The chassis screeches and bends against the turbulence, the winds, straining against the unerring forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as eight dozen titanium screws combat the wrath of nature and win.</p>\n<p>It's dark over Denver. The sun set behind the towering mountains hours ago, all that remains is darkness. The Mile High City shines brilliantly against the oppressive shadow, bringing forth a warm vibrant yellow light that breaks out even unto the heavens, stretching through the cabin of the screeching metal plane.</p>\n<p>Gibbs doesn't hate flying. Her colleagues do. Doctor Rune, tall, bespectacled, prim proper and academic, the son of a miner and trapped in those shadows, hates flying. He claims it's because of corporate greed, a hatred in protest of penny-pinching bureaucrats in dusty white offices striking six keystrokes to separate a family into disparate seats lest they pay a tax to remain. That is true, but it is only half the truth. The other half is that when the wheels spin up two hundred fifty kilometers per hour and rubber meets road at unholy speed and the chassis lurches upwards towards the spiraling clouds, Rune feels like he is going to die. Not in a crash, a crash would be a comfort, it implies the presence of an Earth. No, Rune believes he will die of absence, as though there were never an Earth at all.</p>\n<p>Her other colleagues have more measured responses, the tall ones complain about the legroom, everyone else belts their small criticisms, they all eventually agree that flying is a necessary evil, except for Hargroves, she loves it, she loves to fly, she loves to <em>soar</em>.</p>\n<p>But Gibbs, Gibbs is fine with flying.</p>\n<p>And so it is that as she sits in the screeching metal bird in the darkness above Denver between two not-quite-asleep skiers with her shoulders pulled in to avoid an unwanted brush, sipping on a plastic-bottle margarita that's too strong to be refreshing but to weak to be comforting, that she smiles, because she's fine with flying, and she's almost there.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty minutes pass. Twenty more minutes of screaming steel and shaking iron, followed by one hundred thirty nine seconds of bowel tightening impact as the plane lands. The wheels fly from zero to two hundred a fifty kilometers an hour as rubber meets road at unholy speed and twelve decades of engineering roar to life in an instant to bring the lurching eagle to a halt. The ten ton turbines quiet.</p>\n<p>Gibbs gazes out at the runway, which is awash in technicolor, each chromatic path designated to aid pilots in navigating the blanketing dark. She continues to relax even as four hundred fifty persons flutter out to a three foot wide hallway, as twelve hundred hundred pounds of luggage are heaved down from shockingly flimsy cupboards. As twenty three men and women in bright orange vests embark to clean the shitty fabric seats.</p>\n<p>She opens her eyes, sets a determined march, retrieves her backpack, and is the last passenger to leave the plane. She gives a curt nod to the stewardess as she departs the vessel.</p>\n<p>She enters into the beckoning maw of Denver International Airport, its pristine shining metal contrasting harshly with the drab grey of the jetway. She takes rapid steps through bustling halls until she stumbles upon her mark, a payphone. She approaches and produces a beaten quarter from a stained leather wallet. She struggles to press it into the small metal slot, almost dropping it but not, failing to fail. An ageing mechanism within bemoaningly creaks to life as she rapidly enters precisely ten digits onto the syrup-sticky keypad. She realizes with a sigh that there is a IHOP immediately adjacent. She wipes three sticky fingers on her jeans as the telephonic machinery roars, whimperingly, to life.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>JULIAN EDEN:</strong> Ahoy?</p>\n<p><strong>HELLEN GIBBS:</strong> Hey Jules, it's me.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Hellen!

If you come back right now you could still catch Rune's Christmas party.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> It's fine. I've got a beautiful campsite in mind. I'd rather spend that night under the stars anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Do you really think you'll find any traces of 9990 in Garden of the Gods? Those rocks are young, only date back to the Pleistocene.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> It's called Garden of the <em>Gods</em>, Julian, that screams 9990. Regardless, maybe there is nothing there, so what? I still get a restful break.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Fair enough. Keep me posted.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Will do. Enjoy your break!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: midnightblue; color: white; padding: .5rem; text-align: center; border: 4px white double; width: 100px; float: left; margin-left: -10rem; display: var(--display-mobile);\">\n<p><tt>DISPLAYING NOTE 1/3</tt></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: rgb(var(--basalt-undertone));\">\n<h1 id=\"toc8\"><span>1983</span></h1>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc9\"><span>December 23</span></h3>\n<hr/></div>\n<p>A pristine red rental-corolla barrels down a mountain highway at two point four times the posted speed limit, shale and gravel accelerating rapidly under the tires and flying wildly into the canyon-esque walls.</p>\n<p>Six nails are hammered into the Earth by an experienced weathered and muscled arm. Six strings are wrapped rapidly into these sutures in the flesh of the planet. An unremarkable tent is erected in the surgery. An ever deflating mattress pad is filled over an afternoon and three hundred and twenty two breaths. It is winter in Colorado. There is a chill in the air.</p>\n<p>A bundled of Chevron-sourced plastic-wrapped logs are freed from their entrapment by calloused hands. Kindling is collected from the feast of dying grass. A match is struck three times and tossed in the kindling. A fire roars to life.</p>\n<p>Doctor Hellen Gibbs takes a deep breath of the wintry air, retrieves a pot from the bright red tent and pours two quarter gallons of water within. She hoists it atop the roiling fire and watches with satisfaction as it comes to boil smiling as the steam brushes against her face. She pours half of the pot into dehydrated stir fry and the other into equally thirsting peach crumble. The smells blanket the night, but they do not abate the ever present twinge of cold on her skin and in the air she breaths.</p>\n<p>She produces three pieces of silverware; mounted together through a ring in their hinds; from her jacket pocket. They gleam brilliantly in the moonlight, but they do not gleam so purely nor magically as the rocks. She stares out at the beating black sky; there's almost no light pollution here; as she presses the first bites of steaming hot food into her mouth.</p>\n<p>Truth is, she's never been very interested in the sky. From the time she was a very small girl, she's been interested in the Earth. Space is old, yes, but it is inconceivably old. \"The nebulous age of Eternity\", as one particularly pretentious physics major had monologued at her one day. But the Earth is <em>old</em>, in a way that made sense. In a way that she could chart and catalogue and understand. She does not care of cosmos thirteen billion years old, she is much more partial to the notion of mountains older than bone.</p>\n<p>Garden of the Gods does not share this age. These pillars of sedimentary rock aren't even that much older than homo <em>sapiens</em>. Garden of the Gods is young, is does not, <em>could</em> not posses 9990 phenomenon. She knows this, Eden knows this. Neither of them care. This is her time, he is happy to give it to her. She loves <a href=\"/run-the-river-red-hub\">Site-898</a>, but it's nice to get away on occasion. To be alone, if only for a little while.</p>\n<p>She smiles as the frost brushes against her cheeks. This is her time, she's going to make the most of it.</p>\n\n<p>Worn leather mountain boots tread steadily up an ancient dirt path towards the roaring fire. They are unhurried, but not unafraid. Each step carries a weight with it, a history. They have been on this trail before, they are not happy to return.</p>\n<p>Doctor Rudy Weller marches with determination. His lungs heave in his chest, he's accustomed to the elevation, but not the air. The air here is thin, he can feel it slip through his teeth and chill his gums. It's dry, too, it's not full; there's no depth to it, no texture. It's almost hollow, as absurd of an accusation as that is.</p>\n<p>His laces are tied, though there's only half of them, and half a pair of shoes. A large, metal protrusion demarks the space where a left leg ought to be in a naive anatomy. It's spiked to provide better grip on crags and rocks. A younger, more foolish version of him might have once mourned the 'loss', but the cave-in was thirteen years ago, that's an entire childhood, well, a childhood up to those messy years at least. Now he doesn't get foot cramps, as he often jokes.</p>\n<p>It did hurt, though. <a href=\"/scp-8272\">It hurt like a motherfucker</a>.</p>\n<p>He can still remember that pain, but he does not live in fear of it. He will not allow himself too. And so his steps are steady as he presses up the long, worn road.</p>\n<p>When he at last arrives at the makeshift hearth, eyes weary from many hours on mountain roads, there's already a cup of hot apple cider ready for him. He picks it up gratefully, and consumes it in lavish, starved gulps. It is just a matter of time before his host emerges from her tarp-ish cocoon to greet him, raising a gloved hand and waving with abandon. She wears these gloves even when she is in her sleeping bag. It is cold in Colorado.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Dr. Gibbs.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Rudy, we're fifteen hundred miles away from protocol and the chain of command.

She emerges from her tent, wandering out into the morning air and the layer of dew permeating it. Her eyes take in the nascent Rudy Weller's tent, a compact blue affair smaller even than her own. The sun is just starting to peak over the distant Rockies, casting the Earth in a purple hue. The hairs on her arms prickle with excitement and her heart pulses eight beats per minute faster. It's time for fieldwork.</p>\n<p>The first mile of her journey is exciting. The second, exhilarating. It is seven thirteen ante-meridiem, and already rock climbers sprawl across the many spires of the garden, clambering across them with abandon and rope. Their picks chop deep yet shallow into the rock, slowly and repeatedly scarring the Earth with a thousand cuts. Of course, these cuts are small, and the Earth will forget them, as it always does.</p>\n<p>One of the climbers, an older man, yet still below the halfway mark of his life, who really ought to have something better to do on a Saturday morning, looks down at her, noting her archeological garb. He gives her a salute, knowing she is one of the elite few who appreciates this rock as much as he does. She returns the gesture, though is slightly confused by it.</p>\n<p>What she does not know, and what he does not know, is that this place, this rock, is going to betray them. Tonight will be a blizzard for the ages, the coldest Christmas Eve there ever was and ever would be. He does not know that in six hours, she will be wrapped up in her tent, shuddering against the cold, trying desperately to cling to life and warmth. She does not know that in six hours, he will be lying in the trunk of his Camaro, blasting the heat and burning through the gas. Neither know that in six hours, temperatures will plummet. They will fall to thirty two, and then ten, and then zero, and they will not stop. They will fall through negative fifteen, and negative thirty five, and still they will fall. Tonight, it will be seventy five degrees Fahrenheit below zero.</p>\n\n<p>There is no coal in Garden of the Gods. That's not fully true, a little coal exists, but no large, useful deposits. Certainly none resembling akivite coal. 'Garden of the Gods' is a name, and just a name. But she knew that, or was pretty sure of that long before she ever came here. The investigation was warranted, but it was very much a formality.</p>\n<p>Still, she continues walking. Dust collects on her boots and on her coat. Slightly melted snow joins it. She walks another hour, barely checking her watch, breathing at ease even through the thin air.</p>\n<p>It is then she finds the door.</p>\n<p>It is so almost missable, but she does not miss it. It is a slight demarcation in the sedimentary rock. She approaches with nothing more than mild curiosity, curiosity that is rewarded. It is tall, that's the first thing she notices, very tall, bordering on towering. It is at least twice as tall as her, around three point three meters if she were to guess. It is significantly thinner, however, no wider than a normal door. The rock is worn, as all the rock here is on the rare occasion that it rains in Colorado, but some of the wear is different, special. The grooves are most certainly intentional.</p>\n<p>The grooves are shaped like tendrils of smoke, spanning the length of the door and spiraling as wisps, cut six to eight centimeters deep. A light flicks on in her brain, but it takes her time to pinpoint it. The realization happens all at once and much too fully. The grooves are the exact same shape as the patterns on her arms. And the patterns on Nerys' arms. They are a mark in a tongue never spoken by man, an ancient language of elden things. They convey a universal message: 'HERE BE DRAGONS'.</p>\n<p>The very last thing she notices is the plaque, a metal trunk with a plastic face, engraved with a stylized picture of a bird. The words read:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Carved in 1860 by Prospector Gleann Dennis, an Irish immigrant who set out for Colorado during the Pike's Peak gold rush, Dennis spent some time camping near this area, at the base of the peak. A successful prospector, he would eventually settle down in Manitou Springs. His legacy of mining would continue until his grandson was killed in an <a href=\"/scp-8987\">unrelated mining accident</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>It is unknown why Dennis made this carving, or what the significance of its patterns are, though this remains a topic of debate and discussion among locals.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Hellen Gibbs finishes reading the plaque and spends several minutes staring at the door. She sighs. It's time to head back to camp.</p>\n<p>At least she won't come back empty handed.</p>\n\n<p>The curvature of Rudy Weller's lips instantly betrays his stress. He looks anxiously at Gibbs as she approaches up the hill and paces in circles around the still roaring fire. He can hardly wait to speak as she approaches, but he does. Through great restraint, he allows her the first word.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Hey.</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Hey, how was your walk?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Good.</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Find any traces of 9990?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> What do you think?</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Go with your gut.

Darkness and snow shroud the Earth and her tent as a million million snowflakes are cast from the heavens and crash violently unto the dust. She is cocooned in her sleeping bag, warmed mostly by the proximity of her limbs to each other, constantly radiating heat in a cycle driven by her beating heart. But that beating is slower now.</p>\n<p>The other, former, source of her warmth, indeed of her survival, is the fire. Before he left, she had Rudy offer up some gasoline from his tank. She whipped up a drip feed by taking a frying pan and angling it such that only a couple drops flow out at once. It worked well, the fire was kept full and burning strong and hot even against the rhythmic cold. But something has changed.</p>\n<p>The fire's gone out.</p>\n<p>She doesn't want to believe it, at first. Wants to believe its just the storm taking a turn for the worse, but it isn't. The storm has mostly passed, it's up to zero Fahrenheit. Yet she can feel the blood stilling in her veins.</p>\n<p>She sighs in acknowledgement, before wriggling out of her sleeping bag. She pops on her shoes and ties them in a double knot, then reluctantly crosses the threshold to the cold. The first thing she checks is the fire, it is indeed out. It's not hard to find the culprit, the gasoline froze last night. It's only just beginning to thaw now, and without it the wood was burned through quickly. She shakes her head.</p>\n<p>She could restart the fire, try and go to bed. But then again, it's not <em>that</em> cold out, she'll be fine as long as she can get her blood flowing and stay moving. Plus, this may be her best shot to mess around with the door without anyone around. She smiles, the excitement has her feeling warmer already.</p>\n\n<p>Two miles in the cold is easier said than done. She can feel her heart pumping, her boots pounding relentlessly into the dirt. The human spirit to just keep going and never give up swells within her. She rubs her hands together and hugs herself for warmth. She crushes two hand-warmers in her palms and feels heat inject into her flesh. Yet these factors, all of them, melt away to reveal one singular, absolute truth:</p>\n<p>She is fucking cold.</p>\n<p>At first her thoughts are varied, even scattered. Thinking about the implications of the door, or of an instance, all the way out here. She thinks of tests to conduct, questions to ask. She wonders if the instance is even alive. Then her thoughts, too, converge, and soon she can only think that she is cold.</p>\n<p>She almost misses the door, yet again. This time she does not even succeed in distinguishing it from the rock. She notices only the metal trunk of the bronze plaque, which shines harshly against the snow. She approaches, crossing sixteen meters in forty eight steps.</p>\n<p>Were her faculties in order, she would examine the door. She would look for a handle, or a switch, or any mechanism at all. But her mind, as any mind would be, has been muted by cold. And so she knocks. First with candor, then with an unnecessary desperation. It is not <em>that</em> cold, she is in no danger, though her mind conceals this truth from her as well.</p>\n<p>It is on the third knock that the door opens and her arms burn. She desperately pulls up her sleeves, gazing down at the marks. They do not glow any brighter, but they do burn. Somehow, this brings her no pain. She feels only warmth as she is recognized. Only joy as she is known.</p>\n\n<p>The door slides open with a groan as an ancient mechanism is triggered revealing an interior lined with shining schist giving way to a spiraling series of stairs. She approaches with caution, but finds the endeavor wildly comforting. It is warm inside. Very warm.</p>\n<p>The first steps she takes are slow, cautious, but they quickly increase in vigor as her blood defrost and her scientific curiosity grows. She makes many many steps deep into the Earth, but not too deep, no more than two hundred feet, this place was, after all, still carved by human hands. The steps grow rougher, more uneven as she arrives closer to the bottom. Then end on a small, barren plain, decorated only by a few rocky outcroppings.</p>\n<p>She looks around, disappointed. There is nothing here. And then there is something. And it is an eye. A massive eye, forty six meters in diameter. It is an eye she has scarcely seen before, and always in circumstances much more desperate than this.</p>\n<p>When it speaks to her, it is only through the pact that it gets through at all. But this is an imperfect medium, it is akin to forcing the Mississippi through a diner straw. On the first word alone she can feel her brain go numb and her nose start to bleed. A tempest rages within her mind as the enormity of the dragons thoughts come to rest upon her mind.</p>\n<p>But this isn't her first rodeo. She grits her teeth, steels her mind, and chokes out a greeting.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Nice to meet you.

You must stay for dinner.]</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Dinner with a dragon is much like anything else with a dragon, awe inspiring, mystical, and kind of scary. They speak for a while more first, before eating, the pact struggles to translate, within fifteen minutes she gets a headache, within another fifteen, a nosebleed. This half hour is not entirely unproductive, however. She learns this instance's name is 'Slumbering Shallow, Whisper of Vacant Winds'. And, she'd been able to answer her biggest question:</p>\n<p>How does it survive?</p>\n<p>Typical 8007 instances live in volcanoes, and subsist off of the magma therein. Colorado has only one single active volcano, the Dotsero crater, and it's on the other end of the state. The answer, ultimately, is wind. The instance is covered in holes, she'd initially assumed they were wounds, similar to those found in deceased instances, but there's a doubt there, they are too irregular, too natural. They are, of course, not wounds, they are funnels, catching and intensifying the wind and pushing it towards a series of stone gears within. They churn in unholy gear ratios amplifying the energy until they reach the central chamber of the dragon's chest. Rather than a magmatic heart, there is a turbine. It translates this energy into the heat which keeps the instance alive and hot. While the instance's internals are very different, it's externals are very consistent with other instances. It is, still, a fire breathing dragon.</p>\n<p>Below the turbine, there is a circuit of gears that all run into each other. This serves almost as a battery, allowing the instance to survive even when the wind is not blowing. This is rare, however. The dragon's spines form the garden of the gods and are covered in the funnels. They receive massive amounts of wind, especially on a night like tonight.</p>\n<p>And so the dragon is very warm, and so the same for all her food.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon does not eat food. It is full to bursting with an utter glut of wind.</p>\n<p>This is good, as she does not have much food. Four Chevron-sourced slim-jims, a pack of fifty-eight honey roasted peanuts, and raspberry-honey caffeine gummies made for runners that she underestimates the strength of until she eats three two many and feels her heart accelerate to one hundred and twelve beats per minute.</p>\n<p>The dragon offers to warm up the food for her as excess heat billows from its mouth in the form of steam and smoke. She politely declines as she does not want her food heat to eleven hundred degrees Celsius. And also because the notion of even lukewarm slim-jim makes her sick to her stomach.</p>\n<p>Though, she does accept the entities aid in the beverage department.</p>\n<p>Tea is fine, to her. The rest of the department likes it a lot, some to a sociopathic degree. In the break room, right next to the coffee pot, there's a matching pot of tea, keyed to the 'flavor of the day'. That changes, there's a calendar which specifies it, which Eden controls. Gibbs doesn't know it off of the top of her head. She's never actually bothered to read it. When asked what her favorite flavor of tea is, she's always replied 'Long Island'.</p>\n<p>Her central tension with tea is not the flavor, or lack thereof, but with the process. Waiting several minutes for the water to boil, made all the longer given how weak the power is; the outlets in the break room are fifty volts max; for a end product that is only slightly better than water. She's willing to go through the process for coffee, mostly because she's probably chemically addicted to it, but it's just not worth it for tea.</p>\n<p>This is a complaint that evaporates instantly in the presence of a dragon which can boil water in five sixteenths of a second. And, as a responsible hiker, she does carry both tea and water. Within half a minute there's a complete, steaming cup of peppermint tea.</p>\n<p>Still, she'd prefer it were Long Island.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon does not speak as she eats, it leaves her mind, and the pact, in peace. It is only when she is done and fed and full; relatively at least; that it again imposes its mind.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\">[The gnashing of teeth.

Her fingers tense in pain as she white knuckles each crag and approaches the three hundred foot summit. She's in no real danger, the dragon is helping her, blowing warm wind on her hands and face so that they do not chill or freeze. Additionally, she is secured by a rope and years of experience. Still, this is a rather extreme physical feat for her, or, well, anybody.</p>\n<p>The first hundred feet are tiring. The second hundred are miserable. The last hundred are herculean. They are altogether easier than her doctoral thesis.</p>\n<p>The winds blow ferociously at her as the forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r combine to push her away from the rock, where the forces of gravity will return her swiftly to the Earth. But she does not fall. And her knuckles strain. And her arms strain.</p>\n<p>The energy given unto her by the slim-jims is quickly expended, followed by lunch and breakfast and six more meals before that. After the first five minutes she is sweating water she never even drank.</p>\n<p>She only ever actually slips once. A patch of ice in a hold that she cannot see when she grasps it. Her palm slips out of it and is scraped up by the sharp rock, her other hand fails to fully compensate and slips out too, and she falls. She clambers desperately for the rope, grasping on with vigor and swinging towards the rock. She kicks her feet towards the wall repeatedly to slow her descent until she can reestablish the hold. She loses at most twenty five feet overall, though her confidence is, slightly, shaken.</p>\n<p>And so it is that she is thoroughly exhausted by the time she reaches the peak.</p>\n<p>She hefts her shaking, freezing form up onto the ridge, her torso splayed across the edge. Every one of her pores dilates in frigidity and her teeth chatter in defiance of the stillness. She is not done.</p>\n<p>Slowly, but certainly, limb by limb, she rights herself, so that her feet balance precariously on the peak. She is truly cold, now. The dragon's air cannot warm her, it does not want to risk blowing her off.</p>\n<p>She gazes up at the wintry moon, it's color is the same as the snow. But then, she's never been one for gazing at the sky.</p>\n<p>She then looks out, over the landscape. Out into the expanse, away from the Rockies. There is low visibility, she cannot see far, likely no farther than twenty miles, but that is not what matters. She understands, now, why Slumbering Shallow came out here. It is breathtaking, it is unlike anywhere she has ever been. It is unique and singular and singularly unique and more than any of these things it is isolated and alone and lonely. If she wanted, as it had suggested, to run away, there would be no finer a place.</p>\n<p>But that is not what she wants. Not at all. What matters about this view, about these twenty miles, is that past the storm, past another twenty miles and another and a hundred and a thousand and a couple hundred more, there is Site-898, and they are staring right back at her, probably through dorky yellow binoculars.</p>\n<p>She smiles, she feels the cold winds brush against her rosy cheeks and chill her frigid skin as she stands three hundred feet above the sallow Earth.</p>\n<p>And for a moment she is on top of the world.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/garden-of-the-gods\">GARDEN OF THE GODS</a>\" by sprawlingstar, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It barrels through the uncaring skies with a fervor and a tenor, it's engines blaring at twenty five thousand rotations per minute. Exhaust billows as sixty hundred gallons of jet fuel are churned, burned and discarded inside a ten ton turbine. The chassis screeches and bends against the turbulence, the winds, straining against the unerring forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as eight dozen titanium screws combat the wrath of nature and win.\n\n\n\nIt's dark over Denver. The sun set behind the towering mountains hours ago, all that remains is darkness. The Mile High City shines brilliantly against the oppressive shadow, bringing forth a warm vibrant yellow light that breaks out even unto the heavens, stretching through the cabin of the screeching metal plane.\n\n\n\nGibbs doesn't hate flying. Her colleagues do. Doctor Rune, tall, bespectacled, prim proper and academic, the son of a miner and trapped in those shadows, hates flying. He claims it's because of corporate greed, a hatred in protest of penny-pinching bureaucrats in dusty white offices striking six keystrokes to separate a family into disparate seats lest they pay a tax to remain. That is true, but it is only half the truth. The other half is that when the wheels spin up two hundred fifty kilometers per hour and rubber meets road at unholy speed and the chassis lurches upwards towards the spiraling clouds, Rune feels like he is going to die. Not in a crash, a crash would be a comfort, it implies the presence of an Earth. No, Rune believes he will die of absence, as though there were never an Earth at all.\n\n\n\nHer other colleagues have more measured responses, the tall ones complain about the legroom, everyone else belts their small criticisms, they all eventually agree that flying is a necessary evil, except for Hargroves, she loves it, she loves to fly, she loves to //soar//.\n\n\n\nBut Gibbs, Gibbs is fine with flying.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is that as she sits in the screeching metal bird in the darkness above Denver between two not-quite-asleep skiers with her shoulders pulled in to avoid an unwanted brush, sipping on a plastic-bottle margarita that's too strong to be refreshing but to weak to be comforting, that she smiles, because she's fine with flying, and she's almost there.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes pass. Twenty more minutes of screaming steel and shaking iron, followed by one hundred thirty nine seconds of bowel tightening impact as the plane lands. The wheels fly from zero to two hundred a fifty kilometers an hour as rubber meets road at unholy speed and twelve decades of engineering roar to life in an instant to bring the lurching eagle to a halt. The ten ton turbines quiet.\n\n\n\nGibbs gazes out at the runway, which is awash in technicolor, each chromatic path designated to aid pilots in navigating the blanketing dark. She continues to relax even as four hundred fifty persons flutter out to a three foot wide hallway, as twelve hundred hundred pounds of luggage are heaved down from shockingly flimsy cupboards. As twenty three men and women in bright orange vests embark to clean the shitty fabric seats.\n\n\n\nShe opens her eyes, sets a determined march, retrieves her backpack, and is the last passenger to leave the plane. She gives a curt nod to the stewardess as she departs the vessel.\n\n\n\nShe enters into the beckoning maw of Denver International Airport, its pristine shining metal contrasting harshly with the drab grey of the jetway. She takes rapid steps through bustling halls until she stumbles upon her mark, a payphone. She approaches and produces a beaten quarter from a stained leather wallet. She struggles to press it into the small metal slot, almost dropping it but not, failing to fail. An ageing mechanism within bemoaningly creaks to life as she rapidly enters precisely ten digits onto the syrup-sticky keypad. She realizes with a sigh that there is a IHOP immediately adjacent. She wipes three sticky fingers on her jeans as the telephonic machinery roars, whimperingly, to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**JULIAN EDEN:** Ahoy?\n\n\n\n**HELLEN GIBBS:** Hey Jules, it's me.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Hellen! Good to hear from you. How was your flight?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Unremarkable.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Ah. So, how is Colorado?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Inconclusive, I haven't left the airport yet.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Are you sure this is how you want to spend your winter break? If you come back right now you could still catch Rune's Christmas party.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** It's fine. I've got a beautiful campsite in mind. I'd rather spend that night under the stars anyway.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Do you really think you'll find any traces of 9990 in Garden of the Gods? Those rocks are young, only date back to the Pleistocene.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** It's called Garden of the //Gods//, Julian, that screams 9990. Regardless, maybe there is nothing there, so what? I still get a restful break.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Fair enough. Keep me posted.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Will do.

Six strings are wrapped rapidly into these sutures in the flesh of the planet. An unremarkable tent is erected in the surgery. An ever deflating mattress pad is filled over an afternoon and three hundred and twenty two breaths. It is winter in Colorado. There is a chill in the air.\n\n\n\nA bundled of Chevron-sourced plastic-wrapped logs are freed from their entrapment by calloused hands. Kindling is collected from the feast of dying grass. A match is struck three times and tossed in the kindling. A fire roars to life.\n\n\n\nDoctor Hellen Gibbs takes a deep breath of the wintry air, retrieves a pot from the bright red tent and pours two quarter gallons of water within. She hoists it atop the roiling fire and watches with satisfaction as it comes to boil smiling as the steam brushes against her face. She pours half of the pot into dehydrated stir fry and the other into equally thirsting peach crumble. The smells blanket the night, but they do not abate the ever present twinge of cold on her skin and in the air she breaths.\n\n\n\nShe produces three pieces of silverware; mounted together through a ring in their hinds; from her jacket pocket. They gleam brilliantly in the moonlight, but they do not gleam so purely nor magically as the rocks. She stares out at the beating black sky; there's almost no light pollution here; as she presses the first bites of steaming hot food into her mouth.\n\n\n\nTruth is, she's never been very interested in the sky. From the time she was a very small girl, she's been interested in the Earth. Space is old, yes, but it is inconceivably old. \"The nebulous age of Eternity\", as one particularly pretentious physics major had monologued at her one day. But the Earth is //old//, in a way that made sense. In a way that she could chart and catalogue and understand. She does not care of cosmos thirteen billion years old, she is much more partial to the notion of mountains older than bone.\n\n\n\nGarden of the Gods does not share this age. These pillars of sedimentary rock aren't even that much older than homo //sapiens//. Garden of the Gods is young, is does not, //could// not posses 9990 phenomenon. She knows this, Eden knows this. Neither of them care. This is her time, he is happy to give it to her. She loves [[[Run the River Red Hub|Site-898]]], but it's nice to get away on occasion. To be alone, if only for a little while.\n\n\n\nShe smiles as the frost brushes against her cheeks. This is her time, she's going to make the most of it.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWorn leather mountain boots tread steadily up an ancient dirt path towards the roaring fire. They are unhurried, but not unafraid. Each step carries a weight with it, a history. They have been on this trail before, they are not happy to return.\n\n\n\nDoctor Rudy Weller marches with determination. His lungs heave in his chest, he's accustomed to the elevation, but not the air. The air here is thin, he can feel it slip through his teeth and chill his gums. It's dry, too, it's not full; there's no depth to it, no texture. It's almost hollow, as absurd of an accusation as that is.\n\n\n\nHis laces are tied, though there's only half of them, and half a pair of shoes. A large, metal protrusion demarks the space where a left leg ought to be in a naive anatomy. It's spiked to provide better grip on crags and rocks. A younger, more foolish version of him might have once mourned the 'loss', but the cave-in was thirteen years ago, that's an entire childhood, well, a childhood up to those messy years at least. Now he doesn't get foot cramps, as he often jokes.\n\n\n\nIt did hurt, though. [[[SCP-8272|It hurt like a motherfucker]]].\n\n\n\nHe can still remember that pain, but he does not live in fear of it. He will not allow himself too. And so his steps are steady as he presses up the long, worn road.\n\n\n\nWhen he at last arrives at the makeshift hearth, eyes weary from many hours on mountain roads, there's already a cup of hot apple cider ready for him. He picks it up gratefully, and consumes it in lavish, starved gulps. It is just a matter of time before his host emerges from her tarp-ish cocoon to greet him, raising a gloved hand and waving with abandon. She wears these gloves even when she is in her sleeping bag. It is cold in Colorado.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**WELLER:** Dr. Gibbs.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Rudy, we're fifteen hundred miles away from protocol and the chain of command.

She emerges from her tent, wandering out into the morning air and the layer of dew permeating it. Her eyes take in the nascent Rudy Weller's tent, a compact blue affair smaller even than her own. The sun is just starting to peak over the distant Rockies, casting the Earth in a purple hue. The hairs on her arms prickle with excitement and her heart pulses eight beats per minute faster. It's time for fieldwork.\n\n\n\nThe first mile of her journey is exciting. The second, exhilarating. It is seven thirteen ante-meridiem, and already rock climbers sprawl across the many spires of the garden, clambering across them with abandon and rope. Their picks chop deep yet shallow into the rock, slowly and repeatedly scarring the Earth with a thousand cuts. Of course, these cuts are small, and the Earth will forget them, as it always does.\n\n\n\nOne of the climbers, an older man, yet still below the halfway mark of his life, who really ought to have something better to do on a Saturday morning, looks down at her, noting her archeological garb. He gives her a salute, knowing she is one of the elite few who appreciates this rock as much as he does. She returns the gesture, though is slightly confused by it.\n\n\n\nWhat she does not know, and what he does not know, is that this place, this rock, is going to betray them. Tonight will be a blizzard for the ages, the coldest Christmas Eve there ever was and ever would be. He does not know that in six hours, she will be wrapped up in her tent, shuddering against the cold, trying desperately to cling to life and warmth. She does not know that in six hours, he will be lying in the trunk of his Camaro, blasting the heat and burning through the gas. Neither know that in six hours, temperatures will plummet. They will fall to thirty two, and then ten, and then zero, and they will not stop. They will fall through negative fifteen, and negative thirty five, and still they will fall. Tonight, it will be seventy five degrees Fahrenheit below zero.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThere is no coal in Garden of the Gods. That's not fully true, a little coal exists, but no large, useful deposits. Certainly none resembling akivite coal. 'Garden of the Gods' is a name, and just a name. But she knew that, or was pretty sure of that long before she ever came here. The investigation was warranted, but it was very much a formality.\n\n\n\nStill, she continues walking. Dust collects on her boots and on her coat. Slightly melted snow joins it. She walks another hour, barely checking her watch, breathing at ease even through the thin air.\n\n\n\nIt is then she finds the door.\n\n\n\nIt is so almost missable, but she does not miss it. It is a slight demarcation in the sedimentary rock. She approaches with nothing more than mild curiosity, curiosity that is rewarded. It is tall, that's the first thing she notices, very tall, bordering on towering. It is at least twice as tall as her, around three point three meters if she were to guess. It is significantly thinner, however, no wider than a normal door. The rock is worn, as all the rock here is on the rare occasion that it rains in Colorado, but some of the wear is different, special. The grooves are most certainly intentional.\n\n\n\nThe grooves are shaped like tendrils of smoke, spanning the length of the door and spiraling as wisps, cut six to eight centimeters deep. A light flicks on in her brain, but it takes her time to pinpoint it. The realization happens all at once and much too fully. The grooves are the exact same shape as the patterns on her arms. And the patterns on Nerys' arms. They are a mark in a tongue never spoken by man, an ancient language of elden things. They convey a universal message: 'HERE BE DRAGONS'.\n\n\n\nThe very last thing she notices is the plaque, a metal trunk with a plastic face, engraved with a stylized picture of a bird. The words read:\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n//Carved in 1860 by Prospector Gleann Dennis, an Irish immigrant who set out for Colorado during the Pike's Peak gold rush, Dennis spent some time camping near this area, at the base of the peak. A successful prospector, he would eventually settle down in Manitou Springs. His legacy of mining would continue until his grandson was killed in an [[[SCP-8987|unrelated mining accident]]].//\n\n\n\n//It is unknown why Dennis made this carving, or what the significance of its patterns are, though this remains a topic of debate and discussion among locals.//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nHellen Gibbs finishes reading the plaque and spends several minutes staring at the door. She sighs. It's time to head back to camp.\n\n\n\nAt least she won't come back empty handed.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe curvature of Rudy Weller's lips instantly betrays his stress. He looks anxiously at Gibbs as she approaches up the hill and paces in circles around the still roaring fire. He can hardly wait to speak as she approaches, but he does. Through great restraint, he allows her the first word. \n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** Hey.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Hey, how was your walk?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Good.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Find any traces of 9990?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** What do you think?\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** No.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Go with your gut. Anyway, what's up? You seem stressed.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** There's a cold front coming in. Bad one. Real bad. First traces will arrive within the hour.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Sky looks peaceful.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** It won't be.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** What do you suggest?\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Get the hell out of dodge. I'm ready to go, but I wasn't gonna leave without you.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Thanks Rudy, but I'll be alright. Plus, I wouldn't wanna waste my plane tickets.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** You sure?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Yeah. Plus I've still got some investigating to do. I found something.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** So did I.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** You can go first.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** I've been thinking about the formations, they're a little... off, I guess.

Darkness and snow shroud the Earth and her tent as a million million snowflakes are cast from the heavens and crash violently unto the dust. She is cocooned in her sleeping bag, warmed mostly by the proximity of her limbs to each other, constantly radiating heat in a cycle driven by her beating heart. But that beating is slower now.\n\n\n\nThe other, former, source of her warmth, indeed of her survival, is the fire. Before he left, she had Rudy offer up some gasoline from his tank. She whipped up a drip feed by taking a frying pan and angling it such that only a couple drops flow out at once. It worked well, the fire was kept full and burning strong and hot even against the rhythmic cold. But something has changed.\n\n\n\nThe fire's gone out.\n\n\n\nShe doesn't want to believe it, at first. Wants to believe its just the storm taking a turn for the worse, but it isn't. The storm has mostly passed, it's up to zero Fahrenheit. Yet she can feel the blood stilling in her veins.\n\n\n\nShe sighs in acknowledgement, before wriggling out of her sleeping bag. She pops on her shoes and ties them in a double knot, then reluctantly crosses the threshold to the cold. The first thing she checks is the fire, it is indeed out. It's not hard to find the culprit, the gasoline froze last night. It's only just beginning to thaw now, and without it the wood was burned through quickly. She shakes her head.\n\n\n\nShe could restart the fire, try and go to bed. But then again, it's not //that// cold out, she'll be fine as long as she can get her blood flowing and stay moving. Plus, this may be her best shot to mess around with the door without anyone around. She smiles, the excitement has her feeling warmer already.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nTwo miles in the cold is easier said than done. She can feel her heart pumping, her boots pounding relentlessly into the dirt. The human spirit to just keep going and never give up swells within her. She rubs her hands together and hugs herself for warmth. She crushes two hand-warmers in her palms and feels heat inject into her flesh. Yet these factors, all of them, melt away to reveal one singular, absolute truth:\n\n\n\nShe is fucking cold.\n\n\n\nAt first her thoughts are varied, even scattered. Thinking about the implications of the door, or of an instance, all the way out here. She thinks of tests to conduct, questions to ask. She wonders if the instance is even alive. Then her thoughts, too, converge, and soon she can only think that she is cold.\n\n\n\nShe almost misses the door, yet again. This time she does not even succeed in distinguishing it from the rock. She notices only the metal trunk of the bronze plaque, which shines harshly against the snow. She approaches, crossing sixteen meters in forty eight steps.\n\n\n\nWere her faculties in order, she would examine the door. She would look for a handle, or a switch, or any mechanism at all. But her mind, as any mind would be, has been muted by cold. And so she knocks. First with candor, then with an unnecessary desperation. It is not //that// cold, she is in no danger, though her mind conceals this truth from her as well.\n\n\n\nIt is on the third knock that the door opens and her arms burn. She desperately pulls up her sleeves, gazing down at the marks. They do not glow any brighter, but they do burn. Somehow, this brings her no pain. She feels only warmth as she is recognized. Only joy as she is known.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe door slides open with a groan as an ancient mechanism is triggered revealing an interior lined with shining schist giving way to a spiraling series of stairs. She approaches with caution, but finds the endeavor wildly comforting. It is warm inside. Very warm.\n\n\n\nThe first steps she takes are slow, cautious, but they quickly increase in vigor as her blood defrost and her scientific curiosity grows. She makes many many steps deep into the Earth, but not too deep, no more than two hundred feet, this place was, after all, still carved by human hands. The steps grow rougher, more uneven as she arrives closer to the bottom. Then end on a small, barren plain, decorated only by a few rocky outcroppings.\n\n\n\nShe looks around, disappointed. There is nothing here. And then there is something. And it is an eye. A massive eye, forty six meters in diameter. It is an eye she has scarcely seen before, and always in circumstances much more desperate than this.\n\n\n\nWhen it speaks to her, it is only through the pact that it gets through at all. But this is an imperfect medium, it is akin to forcing the Mississippi through a diner straw. On the first word alone she can feel her brain go numb and her nose start to bleed. A tempest rages within her mind as the enormity of the dragons thoughts come to rest upon her mind.\n\n\n\nBut this isn't her first rodeo. She grits her teeth, steels her mind, and chokes out a greeting.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** Nice to meet you.

You must stay for dinner.] [[/span]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nDinner with a dragon is much like anything else with a dragon, awe inspiring, mystical, and kind of scary. They speak for a while more first, before eating, the pact struggles to translate, within fifteen minutes she gets a headache, within another fifteen, a nosebleed. This half hour is not entirely unproductive, however. She learns this instance's name is 'Slumbering Shallow, Whisper of Vacant Winds'. And, she'd been able to answer her biggest question:\n\n\n\nHow does it survive?\n\n\n\nTypical 8007 instances live in volcanoes, and subsist off of the magma therein. Colorado has only one single active volcano, the Dotsero crater, and it's on the other end of the state. The answer, ultimately, is wind. The instance is covered in holes, she'd initially assumed they were wounds, similar to those found in deceased instances, but there's a doubt there, they are too irregular, too natural. They are, of course, not wounds, they are funnels, catching and intensifying the wind and pushing it towards a series of stone gears within. They churn in unholy gear ratios amplifying the energy until they reach the central chamber of the dragon's chest. Rather than a magmatic heart, there is a turbine. It translates this energy into the heat which keeps the instance alive and hot. While the instance's internals are very different, it's externals are very consistent with other instances. It is, still, a fire breathing dragon.\n\n\n\nBelow the turbine, there is a circuit of gears that all run into each other. This serves almost as a battery, allowing the instance to survive even when the wind is not blowing. This is rare, however. The dragon's spines form the garden of the gods and are covered in the funnels. They receive massive amounts of wind, especially on a night like tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd so the dragon is very warm, and so the same for all her food.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe dragon does not eat food. It is full to bursting with an utter glut of wind.\n\n\n\nThis is good, as she does not have much food. Four Chevron-sourced slim-jims, a pack of fifty-eight honey roasted peanuts, and raspberry-honey caffeine gummies made for runners that she underestimates the strength of until she eats three two many and feels her heart accelerate to one hundred and twelve beats per minute.\n\n\n\nThe dragon offers to warm up the food for her as excess heat billows from its mouth in the form of steam and smoke. She politely declines as she does not want her food heat to eleven hundred degrees Celsius. And also because the notion of even lukewarm slim-jim makes her sick to her stomach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThough, she does accept the entities aid in the beverage department.\n\n\n\nTea is fine, to her. The rest of the department likes it a lot, some to a sociopathic degree. In the break room, right next to the coffee pot, there's a matching pot of tea, keyed to the 'flavor of the day'. That changes, there's a calendar which specifies it, which Eden controls. Gibbs doesn't know it off of the top of her head. She's never actually bothered to read it. When asked what her favorite flavor of tea is, she's always replied 'Long Island'.\n\n\n\nHer central tension with tea is not the flavor, or lack thereof, but with the process. Waiting several minutes for the water to boil, made all the longer given how weak the power is; the outlets in the break room are fifty volts max; for a end product that is only slightly better than water. She's willing to go through the process for coffee, mostly because she's probably chemically addicted to it, but it's just not worth it for tea.\n\n\n\nThis is a complaint that evaporates instantly in the presence of a dragon which can boil water in five sixteenths of a second. And, as a responsible hiker, she does carry both tea and water. Within half a minute there's a complete, steaming cup of peppermint tea.\n\n\n\nStill, she'd prefer it were Long Island.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe dragon does not speak as she eats, it leaves her mind, and the pact, in peace. It is only when she is done and fed and full; relatively at least; that it again imposes its mind.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\"]] [The gnashing of teeth.

Her fingers tense in pain as she white knuckles each crag and approaches the three hundred foot summit. She's in no real danger, the dragon is helping her, blowing warm wind on her hands and face so that they do not chill or freeze. Additionally, she is secured by a rope and years of experience. Still, this is a rather extreme physical feat for her, or, well, anybody.\n\n\n\nThe first hundred feet are tiring. The second hundred are miserable. The last hundred are herculean. They are altogether easier than her doctoral thesis.\n\n\n\nThe winds blow ferociously at her as the forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r combine to push her away from the rock, where the forces of gravity will return her swiftly to the Earth. But she does not fall. And her knuckles strain. And her arms strain.\n\n\n\nThe energy given unto her by the slim-jims is quickly expended, followed by lunch and breakfast and six more meals before that. After the first five minutes she is sweating water she never even drank.\n\n\n\nShe only ever actually slips once. A patch of ice in a hold that she cannot see when she grasps it. Her palm slips out of it and is scraped up by the sharp rock, her other hand fails to fully compensate and slips out too, and she falls. She clambers desperately for the rope, grasping on with vigor and swinging towards the rock. She kicks her feet towards the wall repeatedly to slow her descent until she can reestablish the hold. She loses at most twenty five feet overall, though her confidence is, slightly, shaken.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is that she is thoroughly exhausted by the time she reaches the peak.\n\n\n\nShe hefts her shaking, freezing form up onto the ridge, her torso splayed across the edge. Every one of her pores dilates in frigidity and her teeth chatter in defiance of the stillness. She is not done.\n\n\n\nSlowly, but certainly, limb by limb, she rights herself, so that her feet balance precariously on the peak. She is truly cold, now. The dragon's air cannot warm her, it does not want to risk blowing her off.\n\n\n\nShe gazes up at the wintry moon, it's color is the same as the snow. But then, she's never been one for gazing at the sky.\n\n\n\nShe then looks out, over the landscape. Out into the expanse, away from the Rockies. There is low visibility, she cannot see far, likely no farther than twenty miles, but that is not what matters. She understands, now, why Slumbering Shallow came out here. It is breathtaking, it is unlike anywhere she has ever been. It is unique and singular and singularly unique and more than any of these things it is isolated and alone and lonely. If she wanted, as it had suggested, to run away, there would be no finer a place.\n\n\n\nBut that is not what she wants. Not at all. What matters about this view, about these twenty miles, is that past the storm, past another twenty miles and another and a hundred and a thousand and a couple hundred more, there is Site-898, and they are staring right back at her, probably through dorky yellow binoculars.\n\n\n\nShe smiles, she feels the cold winds brush against her rosy cheeks and chill her frigid skin as she stands three hundred feet above the sallow Earth.\n\n\n\nAnd for a moment she is on top of the world.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** crags.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/crags.html\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** peaks.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/peaks.html\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** divider.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user sprawlingstar]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** SCP Wiki\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** header-bg.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Dicklyon\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_of_the_Gods_central_gardens_from_the_north.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** planyourtrip.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Daniel Schwen\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_of_the_Gods_Sunset.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** supportconservation.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_135.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** witnessrestoration.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_175.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** spotthedifference.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_026.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** foreverfree.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2024-10-08_Garden_of_the_Gods_Sunrise_-_034.jpg\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-6448", "classification-committee-memo", "scp-8007", "scp-9990", "run-the-river-red-hub", "scp-8272", "scp-8987", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["adventure", "art-exchange", "heartwarming", "mystery", "tale"], "title": "GARDEN OF THE GODS - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/garden-of-the-gods", "year": 2026}, "girlraisingproject": {"created_at": "2026-01-02T01:16:00", "creator": "whenwerewe", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:16:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"goat.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:19:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:19:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"light.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:20:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"woods.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:20:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"ruin.webp\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:21:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:23:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:24:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:27:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Added tags: black-comedy, body-horror, fantasy, tale.

The tallest of them, disfigured by a twisted arm and muscles like an ox, gestured violently towards the hills we\u2019d descended from. Perhaps some of my band had escaped. It was bitter comfort to me now.</p>\n<p>I rose slowly to my feet. I held her by the wrist as I had so many times before, and she fell limply by the arm beside me. She was too light.</p>\n<p>What? Oh. I\u2019ve never had one of you try to <em>comfort</em> me before. That was a long time ago, anyway.</p>\n<p>The mud-brick village we had tried to raid was not yet called Uruk, and the men were not yet the Sumerians. Even the pale and weedy grass they gnawed at was not yet really wheat. They were a stunted lot, and might have been pitiable if they hadn\u2019t taken my daughter.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t look at me like that. We were starving. They had been pushing us out of the plains and into the high valleys all my life.</p>\n<p>Not that any of this matters. I\u2019m beyond trying to claw at the <em>moral high ground</em>.</p>\n<p>My fellows were scattered around me, dead to the last. We didn\u2019t know how to fight their numbers, their corded slings and taut bows, their weapons of strange and shining stone. They\u2019d died so easily.</p>\n<p>So I woke them up.</p>\n<p>One by one the dead rose. Seized joints cracked with unexpected flexion, tendon and sinew hesitantly peeled apart. Their blood pooled thickly at their feet.</p>\n<p>The men turned around to look at me, and them. Their faces were portraits of dread. When I have trouble sleeping I think of them and drift off. Then \u2014 there was all the tedious struggle, and all the tedious begging. But I had them in the end. One made it two hours down the packed dirt path that was not yet the world\u2019s first road, throwing his brothers behind him, in cowardice or appeasement.</p>\n<p>And there was my daughter. I carried her all the way. She was slight, and stiff, and as the sun set she began to cool until by touch I could not distinguish her from the earth in which I lay her.</p>\n<p>There is nothing pretty about the dead, no matter what the fanatics say. They\u2019ll rant at you as long as you care to listen, about beauty, certainty, symmetry. They\u2019re just insane; anyone who would do this is, really. I was ready to leave the meat of my daughter in the earth. But just before I did, something rose out of her, that was not breath, and clung to me. I thought I might as well keep it around. At the time I didn\u2019t let myself think something so stupid, but it would be nice to have her back.</p>\n<p>Yes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, obviously. It\u2019s always nice to have perceptive material. But try not to yell too much, it strains the diaphragm; you\u2019ll want that nice and fresh for later.</p>\n<p>I had lost other children, of course. You think of it as the ultimate tragedy. None of you can guess how lucky you are. Even just three centuries ago\u2026 it was something mothers expected. Which is not to say that it was ever easy. I would have called all of them back to life, if I could. But only her soul remained to me, and I am less sentimental about these things than most.</p>\n<p>Mhm. Still sentimental enough to cut you up.</p>\n<p>Oh? Well, this is the last time you\u2019ll be able to speak for a while, so I might as well.</p>\n<p>Once, when I was the same age my daughter was when she died, I ran into a leprous hundred-headed snake. Not that any of us knew what leprosy was in those days. But its skin was peeling and ulcerating; great blisters and cancers riddled every inch of exposed muscle; its eyes were spasming as it begged me for a drop of blood.</p>\n<p>And because I was young and stupid, I cut open my palm with a flint and let it drink, and it skittered off, begging me not to speak of its appearance to anyone. When three days later I ran into two beautiful men, fire-skinned and stinking of what I now realise must have been incense, I told them everything they asked me. They laughed in a voice like cracking ice and promised me their Queen\u2019s blessing.</p>\n<p>That probably had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>It now occurs to me they were definitely Mab\u2019s. I think I took a side in their civil war by doing that. I had a lot of headaches over the topic, later.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that\u2019s where it began. Now, nod if you\u2019d rather be blind for this next bit.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"goat.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/goat.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>We have both been reshaped by men. This sweet little thing is nothing like the huge beasts I knew in my youth. It became domestic; I went the other way. My dead razed village and town for generations, made me the enemy of all the settled peoples. But I returned to the ruins to find five more sprouting. I simply could not keep up. So when they offered me copper and iron, which I barely understood, I accepted. When they showed me the strange shapes they\u2019d carved into their clay, I learned. And I found that I had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ereshkigal\">new name</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>There. That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?</p>\n<p>Just a little joke! I don\u2019t get to talk to a lot of people. If you try to be funny near a Karcist they look at you like you\u2019re an alien.</p>\n<p>Really, though, you\u2019ll be fine. The vertebra fused back into place; you\u2019re practically good as new.</p>\n<p>Look, just don\u2019t pay attention to the lathe. No, no, if you keep panicking yourself like that I\u2019ll have to paralyse you again. Just think about something else. This really shouldn\u2019t be hurting that much.</p>\n<p>Do you want to hear more about me?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll take that as a yes.</p>\n<p>It was during the Hussite Wars\u2014</p>\n<p>Stop looking confused, they weren\u2019t occult. You people just don\u2019t know anything about your ancestors these days. I\u2019d be angry if I hadn\u2019t known how worthless they were personally. This was around the fourteen-hundreds. Is that good enough for you?</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t wail or I\u2019ll block your trachea. Thank you.</p>\n<p>Now, as I was saying, I was searching for a fleshsmith. This is skipping millennia of my life, but they weren\u2019t very <em>dense</em> millennia. Fill in about six hours of me narrating executions of uncouth men on the road, if you want. I had come to Esterberg, the hidden city. In those days there were far less humans, and many more faeries, and those odd ape-things. It stank like dead fish and liceridden fur. The city, like all cities in those days, was an open sore in the world. But it was the only place I could find someone who could stitch my daughter\u2019s soul back into a body.</p>\n<p>Yes, despite ten thousand years of wandering, I did not exactly have my finger on the pulse of the occult world (what a hilarious expression!). I had brushed up against the edges of Fae activity \u2014 and immediately fled \u2014 and I had run into fleshcarves and cogkindred on the road or in the hovels the peasants gave me in return for their lives. But I was only vaguely aware of, for example, the existence of the Daevites.</p>\n<p>It does not help that I did not hold, and indeed still do not hold, with cities. I can tolerate a thousand people living together, but once you start to lose count that\u2019s a bad sign.</p>\n<p>Sorry, this is besides the point. The tendonwork is distracting me. There, you should be able to speak again. Now, where was I?</p>\n<p>I had found after endless searching a suitable fleshcrafter, brought him my daughter\u2019s soul and a spare girl-child, and after deploying enough threats I was sure he wouldn\u2019t simply dispose of her errant spirit I set out into the city.</p>\n<p>I wanted to see if I could find some useful contacts, perhaps some tips on the location of other nexuses. To my later dismay, it turned out the city was quite firmly antiroyalist territory. And you know how Fae get; they just have this way about them. They learn things they have no right knowing.</p>\n<p>So I walked into the square with my retinue\u2014</p>\n<p>I kept about two dozen of the dead with me at all times. Had them in low-brimmed hats, big cloaks, stuffed them with herbs and so on. Mostly I got away with claiming to be a wandering priestess, though it didn\u2019t work in Esterberg, of course.</p>\n<p>In the square there was an eyeless beggar. And by eyeless I mean great divots had been sunk all over his bared skin, so you could see the half a hundred weeping sockets that must have once seen unimaginable sights. When I walked past him, he pointed straight at me. Every single face in the square turned to stare right at me within three seconds.</p>\n<p>Now, you understand, I was in what is today Poland. I had been born near Iraq. I was <em>used</em> to standing out. It wasn\u2019t anything like today, obviously, but I got little stares, kids either knew I was the funniest thing around or squealed when they saw me, you get the idea. They thought I was a Turk, which got a laugh the first time they said it to my face.</p>\n<p>What it felt like when that entire square, probably five thousand people, turned to bore into my head? I cannot describe it. I barely heard what the beggar said next. Something about crimes revealed and reconciled, a trial before the House of the Inventor, pardon-by-years. I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the words while everyone looked at me. Blank and confident, like men who hold shining stars in their hands, and know that not only can you not save yourself, you cannot save <em>anyone</em>.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I admit it, I panicked. I ordered my dead to lash out and fled in the terror. Anyone who died I raised too, to buy me my hour. It turns out that for all their staring most of the people in the square were basically civilians. And two dozen doesn\u2019t sound like many, but if they don\u2019t die when you kill them they can do a lot. So today I think they have a little plaque where the beggar used to sit, for the thanatotic riot of 1433. Killed about eight hundred, supposedly.</p>\n<p>While the citizens ran about like headless chickens I collected my project and dispatched the uncooperative Karcist with my favourite trick.</p>\n<p>That was the fifty-seventh time I died.</p>\n<p>I fled the city with her in my arms, all my dead lost to its militia, the happiest I\u2019d been in centuries. To call back a soul, well-formed, from <em>millenia</em> of sleep? Every two-bit reanimator called it impossible.</p>\n<p>Oh, come on, you know me better than that. I wouldn\u2019t do this to you for <em>fun</em>; I\u2019m not such a sadist I\u2019d risk the Coalition\u2019s wrath. Obviously something didn\u2019t work out.</p>\n<p>My daughter woke up. Her flesh was as cold as mine, but that was no burden. She would never be hungry again, and if she ever left me I knew I could bring her back. I would try to teach her, somehow, and let her do the same to me. We would pass through the ages of man together. That was the first time I really thought about my power, in detail.</p>\n<p>Yes, try and pull what remains of your face into a smirk, very classy. I was raised when the cutting edge of technology was <em>writing</em>. It took me fully three thousand years to realise the priests of Ashur and Marduk could not literally talk to the gods. I had to essentially invent the entire notion of necromancy from scratch.</p>\n<p>Well, thank you! But of course I don\u2019t seem that old. If I did, I would have gone insane a very long time ago. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to see a warhorse, an automobile, a spacecraft?</p>\n<p>Wait, wait, sorry. I\u2019m letting you rile me up. Back to the story.</p>\n<p>My daughter was the child I\u2019d loved, in every detail. Exactly every detail. She did not gain new traits, or lose old ones. It was as if her soul was frozen in amber. Something about the way it connected to her newly-conquered flesh was defective. She could puppeteer the body, but the body could not embed memories in her being. So she remembered only the last month, at best. She is an eternal youth, and can never grow.</p>\n<p>For a while, I thought her perfect as she was. Though I had not known it, this had been what I was missing all those empty years. The two of us lived out the Thirty Years\u2019 War in an obscure hut, mother and child (much later did we learn this was also the <em>Fifth</em> Occult War). I taught her a hundred times, to weave, to write, to feel safe. She did not feel an empty belly even once, and occasionally I entertained her by dismembering lost <em>landsknechte</em>.</p>\n<p>But I couldn\u2019t stay satisfied forever. Every mother wants to see her daughter grow into herself. She should have been my equal, and risen a queen of the dead alongside me. We would resurrect each other cyclically, until the last city fell.</p>\n<p>You people never fail to irritate me. No, don\u2019t flinch, just \u2014 if you want to ask something, <em>ask it</em>! What\u2019s the point of this ridiculous \u201cMay I ask\u201d nonsense? It\u2019s not as if tiptoeing around will make me any more merciful.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>You want to know <em>that</em>, do you. Why do I tell these stories in such varying tones. Why am I so cavalier about everything except my daughter. How insightful.</p>\n<p>You know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being totally <em>sincere</em> in your questioning. I think you\u2019re trying to make some sort of <em>point</em>. Perhaps to imply a false and saccharine equivalence between her and <em>other</em> people.</p>\n<p>So let me answer your question with a question of my own: what do you think happens if you supercharge a person\u2019s amygdala for five minutes? Do they just have a heart attack? Let\u2019s find out, shall we?</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"woods.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/woods.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>I have had no small number of encounters with <span style=\"color:green\">the abode of quiet</span>.

A shot of that, real concentrated, but over quick.</p>\n<p>That expression there is\u2026 Let me tell you another story. This one might even give you context on what\u2019s happening to you. Concentrate on the words, please.</p>\n<p>So I was in Chernobyl\u2014</p>\n<p>Oh, alright, fine. I\u2019d spent the past three hundred years looking for someone who knew how to help my daughter\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p>Well, I say that, but it\u2019s not strictly true. I spent fifty years searching, and then I realised I\u2019d have to do it myself. I learnt at the feet of the great soul-sages; I did favours for children of the Scarlet Fool; I even managed to win a lesson off one of the Wild Hunt on a bet. I began to put together something like a <em>theory</em> of necromancy. I was inspired by what was in the air in those days. All those philosophers, those men of science! There was something romantic about the idea the world could be understood.</p>\n<p>I knew firsthand it was false, of course.</p>\n<p>So I set out on a course of experimentation. That\u2019s when I began collecting material in earnest, and yes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here, you poor thing.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I said, I was in Chernobyl. After the Russians cursed the land, they evacuated the whole town. The margins of error for that kind of thing are large enough to lose a lot of people. Ripe pickings for little old me.</p>\n<p>What do you mean \u201ctalk like that\u201d? I talk like <em>myself</em>. If I wasn\u2019t able to change with the times I would have lost my mind a long time ago. Even last century, there was barely such a thing as a Foundation, and now they\u2019ve fallen apart. If I adapted any slower the pace of events would overtake me, you understand?</p>\n<p>Right, so, outskirts of Chernobyl, going shopping for new material. I couldn\u2019t bring my dead everywhere, the way I used to. The stink was too obvious, the scarves and hats too blatant. There were cameras metastasising on every street corner. I had to struggle just to carry one or two along with me those days.</p>\n<p>So there I was, walking around in a ridiculous coat and sunglasses, dragging this briefcase by my side. My daughter was never the type to cling to my skirts. She was away somewhere in the city. It wouldn\u2019t do to spend all my time worrying about her survival, so in the past hundred years I\u2019d fit her with a few extra features.</p>\n<p>If you are about to call me a bad parent, then be warned that I might start trying to be a good one, <em>starting with my research efforts</em>.</p>\n<p>No? Excellent.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d had my fair share of encounters with what are now hilariously called \u201cnormalcy preservation organisations\u201d. Bloodless and wretched things. They\u2019d tried to chain my daughter more times than I can count. I could accept that they\u2019d come after me, but she was just a slip of a girl. Their cruelty knew no bounds.</p>\n<p>One moment I was walking down an emptying street, and the next three agents leapt out from a decrepit old house and blew a neat triplet of holes in my torso.</p>\n<p>Of course by this point I was really quite hard to kill, but the three of them were backed up by two brutes in hazmat armour. They caught me about the neck with a loop of rope like some kind of animal and emptied their magazines. I was still conscious, but there\u2019s not really a lot you can do with gaping holes in every major muscle group.</p>\n<p>They dragged me into the base they\u2019d set up in their shack, which inside was done up like some kind of watchpost. I recognised vaguely the equipment and the general style: they were with Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, or one of its descendants.</p>\n<p>This\u2014</p>\n<p>It was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt. Even the day I lost my daughter, there was a kind of lingering apathy. I let the waves wash over me until my head only rarely broke the surface, and I almost forgot what loss was at all.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t like that. They were right there, in the room with me, and I couldn\u2019t move. She was out there, waiting for me, and when she came to find me, and she found <em>them</em>, and I would have to watch, if she found them would they even capture her or just pulp her fucking brain again\u2014</p>\n<p>Oops!</p>\n<p>Sorry. It\u2019ll reattach, don\u2019t worry. And anyway, you\u2019re not going to miss it for long.</p>\n<p>Hmph.</p>\n<p>Suffice to say I wasn\u2019t feeling great. They put me in cuffs, and were preparing some kind of sedative, which might even have worked. But\u2026</p>\n<p>One of them had taken <em>my briefcase</em>. And you know how they are. Their type just cannot stand an unanswered question. I don\u2019t know who they thought I was. If they\u2019d known exactly who they\u2019d found they would have burned it. But instead poor idiot mister Foundation popped the locks.</p>\n<p>The layers of the dermis aren\u2019t actually connected very strongly, you know? Once you puncture the membrane somewhere, you can work your way through the subcutaneous tissue pretty easy. Especially if you\u2019re using, say, human jaws.</p>\n<p>He reeled back and half his face was missing, torn off by the thing in the case. He screamed \u2014 I think he was trying to cry for help, but it had gotten into his muscles, too \u2014 and the rest of the agents opened up on my poor valiant servant.</p>\n<p>Then she arrived. Must have tracked her mother by scent, or perhaps she was playing stalk-and-catch. I was so proud of her.</p>\n<p>Just walked in through the front door, quiet as could be. I think the field team were a little off kilter for some reason, so they didn\u2019t shoot her. One of them screamed at her to get back while the other three tried to wrangle my homunculus. He actually ran over and tried to grab her and get out of the house!</p>\n<p>Well, my daughter popped his head off, of course. Then they turned their attention to her properly, but now there were only three of them against two of my dead and my dear girl. It was quick, and then it was slow.</p>\n<p>Two of them surrendered. I was worried they\u2019d hurt her, but she was only superficially perforated. At worst it was inconvenient. I\u2019d have to reattach her spinal cord where a stray round had pierced it to get her lower body functional again, that was all.</p>\n<p>As soon as I broke my restraints I embraced her and praised her for that display of bravery. We left at once, with the two captives restrained and lugged with us. One of them begged us the whole way to release his subordinate. I told him I\u2019d do his job for him and reprimand her and he made such a noise. It was a great pick-me-up after everything.</p>\n<p>When we got back I scrapped him for parts \u2014 in fact, look back there, you can still see his spine wriggling in the pneumatitrator! Isn\u2019t it kind of cute? No?</p>\n<p>Oh, be sullen, then. When my daughter gets like this I give her a chocolate and some leftovers, but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t work on you.</p>\n<p>I would have found somewhere for his inferior to make herself useful, too, but it turned out the paralytic had made its way to her lungs.</p>\n<p>Ho hum. He did get his wish; that was my good deed for the decade. Afterwards I took the kid out for a treat. Blue steak in Lyon.</p>\n<p>And, oh dear, speaking of hypoxia I do think your airway is blocked. Why didn\u2019t you <em>say</em> any\u2014</p>\n<p>Right, you don\u2019t have an isolation chamber for your larynx. My bad. Can you hear me right now? Were you even conscious for the back half of my story? It\u2019s awfully rude of you to choke on your blood while I was doing all this helpful work on your intestines, and I shall have my recompense, I say.</p>\n<p>Ha.

You\u2019ve gone soft in your old age, regardless. No, not \u2014 don\u2019t look at me like that. Yes, you\u2019re very young, and I\u2019m sure that hair is attractive to\u2026 somebody. But <em>you</em>, the Foundation, whatever you call yourselves nowadays. What you\u2019ve been getting up to is positively pathetic. The other day I heard a \u201cVanguard\u201d pharmacy put out a call for vampires to come in for conditioning treatment! Did you get so lazy you decided you\u2019d try and get all your enemies to just go willingly to their dissection and death?

Try harder.</p>\n<p>Listen, I like to joke with the material, but that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to tell me a lie, make it believable. You\u2019re so awful at subterfuge I\u2019m probably doing good by increasing the competence of your agency.</p>\n<p>No, come on, this persistence is pathetic. Even if you did somehow hoodwink <em>ten</em> bloodsuckers into showing up, you don\u2019t need to keep up this pretense about, what do you call it, \u201charm reduction\u201d, around <em>me</em>. Look at me! I\u2019m not going to judge you if you admit you scattered their ashes in the river.</p>\n<p>I have to respect your commitment. Maybe you even believe it. The Foundation were always masters of self-deception. I thought Vanguard had turned a new leaf. This has been an educational exchange for the <em>both</em> of us.</p>\n<p>Ah, but their new era has not been without its upsides. I am a great appreciator of your people\u2019s newfound openmindedness. If they\u2019d adopted this attitude from the start, we\u2019d all be deathless by now.

Yes, one of their liaisons offered me a pardon if I\u2019d agree to test on their mimicflesh and swear off the good stuff. I did try it for a few months, but it\u2019s just not the same. There are all these obscure occult properties, and the mimics don\u2019t even scream properly.</p>\n<p>Yes, and that\u2019s you caught up to the modern day, more or less. I skipped over a variety of encounters with dullards who thought they\u2019d be the one to kill me, but nothing worth telling.</p>\n<p>I absolutely <em>do</em> have to do this. My daughter\u2019s memory is up to a nice round two years, which is about ten thousand short of what I\u2019ll accept.</p>\n<p>Oh, good job on the smile! I thought your zygomaticus was halfway to necrosis, congratulations. Can I ask what brought it on? Would it have anything to do with the dozen Coalition jackboots fumbling out of their base toward my pretty little abode?</p>\n<p>You remain an awful liar, dear. Of course you know what I\u2019m talking about. You called them here with that goetic beacon in your pericardial cavity. Or maybe not; the world is full of coincidences.</p>\n<p>And there goes the grin. It\u2019s a shame, it looks good on you. Really shows off your incisors. I think those will be your main input into my next project.</p>\n<p>Every single sneering warden thinks they have me pegged. Here\u2019s a doddering old lady from before we invented writing, who\u2019s escaped capture by slinking away from everything dangerous, burdened by an imbecile daughter barely capable of feeding herself. I\u2019ve seen what you write about me. You have such interesting <em>opinions</em> about my work. And even though I have slipped through the nets of a hundred generations, every two-bit Director is just so sure he\u2019ll be the one to bring this antique into the reliquary that is her rightful place. Chernobyl was the closest you ever came, and you were still <em>pretty damn far</em>.</p>\n<p>I told you: if I could not adapt to the world as it is, I would have gone mad eons ago. And yet every time one of your technicians invent some new gimmick you try to catch me with it. The Scythians tried riding me down with their precious cavalry, old Rameses had a go with chariots, Metternich cornered me with grenadiers, De Gaulle\u2019s goons poisoned me with some fancy paralytic. All of them are decorating the east wall of the lab, now. Don\u2019t look! I just said I want your teeth, and the vomit does terrible things to the enamel.</p>\n<p>And your precious Coalition, with their newest hack. These unbinding mechanists have made a right mess. You know a month ago, the thrall they were interviewing on TV, where they had to keep redacting segments of her life story because her master was a wanted criminal? That was <em>me</em>! I mean, the embarrassment I felt, I just wanted a hole to open up and swallow her. Having my reputation tarnished in front of half the country by a spare worker! I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on an unbinder and see what makes them tick for just <em>so</em> long.</p>\n<p>So: thank you for putting together this whole operation. I was worried they might not bother, but it seems Vanguard has rubbed off on them. They were just so filled with <em>humanitarian concern</em> that they brought one! So sweet. I should have the countermeasure up by next week.</p>\n<p>Why on Earth did you step up as bait? Did you think they\u2019d pull you out while you were still recognisable? Because I can promise you that even if they did cage me, you are not in a fixable state.</p>\n<p>Hm. I do not think the word for what you have done here is <em>bravery</em>, exactly; even we Levantine hunter-gatherers had words for \u201csuicidal\u201d. It should make your cerebrum an interesting reagent, if nothing else.</p>\n<p>Ah, and here they come. They\u2019re just going through the chaff upstairs. I do wish you\u2019d never invented gunpowder. Those things are just far too loud.</p>\n<p>Eve! Come on upstairs, dear. There are some very rude men upstairs.</p>\n<p>Yes, isn\u2019t she just adorable? It took me a while to work out the telescoping ribcage. Put that away, darling, you\u2019re getting lymph everywhere. And those fingernails!

I held the whole world away from her with my hands and my ribs and my skull. Three spears were thrust into my back, and a fourth into the neck had killed me.\n\n\n\nWhile I was dead, the fifth had taken her, too.\n\n\n\nAs I blearily cracked open my eyes, already stiffening with rigor mortis, she trembled beside me. Her last breath was drowned out by bickering.\n\n\n\nBehind, the men who had killed us argued loudly in a foreign tongue about what to do next. The tallest of them, disfigured by a twisted arm and muscles like an ox, gestured violently towards the hills we\u2019d descended from. Perhaps some of my band had escaped. It was bitter comfort to me now.\n\n\n\nI rose slowly to my feet. I held her by the wrist as I had so many times before, and she fell limply by the arm beside me. She was too light.\n\n\n\nWhat? Oh. I\u2019ve never had one of you try to //comfort// me before. That was a long time ago, anyway.\n\n\n\nThe mud-brick village we had tried to raid was not yet called Uruk, and the men were not yet the Sumerians. Even the pale and weedy grass they gnawed at was not yet really wheat. They were a stunted lot, and might have been pitiable if they hadn\u2019t taken my daughter.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t look at me like that. We were starving. They had been pushing us out of the plains and into the high valleys all my life. \n\n\n\nNot that any of this matters. I\u2019m beyond trying to claw at the //moral high ground//.\n\n\n\nMy fellows were scattered around me, dead to the last. We didn\u2019t know how to fight their numbers, their corded slings and taut bows, their weapons of strange and shining stone. They\u2019d died so easily.\n\n\n\nSo I woke them up.\n\n\n\nOne by one the dead rose. Seized joints cracked with unexpected flexion, tendon and sinew hesitantly peeled apart. Their blood pooled thickly at their feet.\n\n\n\nThe men turned around to look at me, and them. Their faces were portraits of dread. When I have trouble sleeping I think of them and drift off. Then -- there was all the tedious struggle, and all the tedious begging. But I had them in the end. One made it two hours down the packed dirt path that was not yet the world\u2019s first road, throwing his brothers behind him, in cowardice or appeasement.\n\n\n\nAnd there was my daughter. I carried her all the way. She was slight, and stiff, and as the sun set she began to cool until by touch I could not distinguish her from the earth in which I lay her.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing pretty about the dead, no matter what the fanatics say. They\u2019ll rant at you as long as you care to listen, about beauty, certainty, symmetry. They\u2019re just insane; anyone who would do this is, really. I was ready to leave the meat of my daughter in the earth. But just before I did, something rose out of her, that was not breath, and clung to me. I thought I might as well keep it around. At the time I didn\u2019t let myself think something so stupid, but it would be nice to have her back.\n\n\n\nYes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, obviously. It\u2019s always nice to have perceptive material. But try not to yell too much, it strains the diaphragm; you\u2019ll want that nice and fresh for later.\n\n\n\nI had lost other children, of course. You think of it as the ultimate tragedy. None of you can guess how lucky you are. Even just three centuries ago\u2026 it was something mothers expected. Which is not to say that it was ever easy. I would have called all of them back to life, if I could. But only her soul remained to me, and I am less sentimental about these things than most.\n\n\n\nMhm. Still sentimental enough to cut you up.\n\n\n\nOh? Well, this is the last time you\u2019ll be able to speak for a while, so I might as well.\n\n\n\nOnce, when I was the same age my daughter was when she died, I ran into a leprous hundred-headed snake. Not that any of us knew what leprosy was in those days. But its skin was peeling and ulcerating; great blisters and cancers riddled every inch of exposed muscle; its eyes were spasming as it begged me for a drop of blood.\n\n\n\nAnd because I was young and stupid, I cut open my palm with a flint and let it drink, and it skittered off, begging me not to speak of its appearance to anyone. When three days later I ran into two beautiful men, fire-skinned and stinking of what I now realise must have been incense, I told them everything they asked me. They laughed in a voice like cracking ice and promised me their Queen\u2019s blessing.\n\n\n\nThat probably had something to do with it.\n\n\n\nIt now occurs to me they were definitely Mab\u2019s. I think I took a side in their civil war by doing that. I had a lot of headaches over the topic, later.\n\n\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s where it began. Now, nod if you\u2019d rather be blind for this next bit.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/goat.jpg |\n\ncaption=We have both been reshaped by men.

That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\n\n\n\nJust a little joke! I don\u2019t get to talk to a lot of people. If you try to be funny near a Karcist they look at you like you\u2019re an alien.\n\n\n\nReally, though, you\u2019ll be fine. The vertebra fused back into place; you\u2019re practically good as new.\n\n\n\nLook, just don\u2019t pay attention to the lathe. No, no, if you keep panicking yourself like that I\u2019ll have to paralyse you again. Just think about something else. This really shouldn\u2019t be hurting that much.\n\n\n\nDo you want to hear more about me?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\n\n\n\nIt was during the Hussite Wars--\n\n\n\nStop looking confused, they weren\u2019t occult. You people just don\u2019t know anything about your ancestors these days. I\u2019d be angry if I hadn\u2019t known how worthless they were personally. This was around the fourteen-hundreds. Is that good enough for you?\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t wail or I\u2019ll block your trachea. Thank you.\n\n\n\nNow, as I was saying, I was searching for a fleshsmith. This is skipping millennia of my life, but they weren\u2019t very //dense// millennia. Fill in about six hours of me narrating executions of uncouth men on the road, if you want. I had come to Esterberg, the hidden city. In those days there were far less humans, and many more faeries, and those odd ape-things. It stank like dead fish and liceridden fur. The city, like all cities in those days, was an open sore in the world. But it was the only place I could find someone who could stitch my daughter\u2019s soul back into a body.\n\n\n\nYes, despite ten thousand years of wandering, I did not exactly have my finger on the pulse of the occult world (what a hilarious expression!). I had brushed up against the edges of Fae activity -- and immediately fled -- and I had run into fleshcarves and cogkindred on the road or in the hovels the peasants gave me in return for their lives. But I was only vaguely aware of, for example, the existence of the Daevites.\n\n\n\nIt does not help that I did not hold, and indeed still do not hold, with cities. I can tolerate a thousand people living together, but once you start to lose count that\u2019s a bad sign.\n\n\n\nSorry, this is besides the point. The tendonwork is distracting me. There, you should be able to speak again. Now, where was I?\n\n\n\nI had found after endless searching a suitable fleshcrafter, brought him my daughter\u2019s soul and a spare girl-child, and after deploying enough threats I was sure he wouldn\u2019t simply dispose of her errant spirit I set out into the city.\n\n\n\nI wanted to see if I could find some useful contacts, perhaps some tips on the location of other nexuses. To my later dismay, it turned out the city was quite firmly antiroyalist territory. And you know how Fae get; they just have this way about them. They learn things they have no right knowing. \n\n\n\nSo I walked into the square with my retinue--\n\n\n\nI kept about two dozen of the dead with me at all times. Had them in low-brimmed hats, big cloaks, stuffed them with herbs and so on. Mostly I got away with claiming to be a wandering priestess, though it didn\u2019t work in Esterberg, of course.\n\n\n\nIn the square there was an eyeless beggar. And by eyeless I mean great divots had been sunk all over his bared skin, so you could see the half a hundred weeping sockets that must have once seen unimaginable sights. When I walked past him, he pointed straight at me. Every single face in the square turned to stare right at me within three seconds.\n\n\n\nNow, you understand, I was in what is today Poland. I had been born near Iraq. I was //used// to standing out. It wasn\u2019t anything like today, obviously, but I got little stares, kids either knew I was the funniest thing around or squealed when they saw me, you get the idea. They thought I was a Turk, which got a laugh the first time they said it to my face.\n\n\n\nWhat it felt like when that entire square, probably five thousand people, turned to bore into my head? I cannot describe it. I barely heard what the beggar said next. Something about crimes revealed and reconciled, a trial before the House of the Inventor, pardon-by-years. I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the words while everyone looked at me. Blank and confident, like men who hold shining stars in their hands, and know that not only can you not save yourself, you cannot save //anyone//.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, I admit it, I panicked. I ordered my dead to lash out and fled in the terror. Anyone who died I raised too, to buy me my hour. It turns out that for all their staring most of the people in the square were basically civilians. And two dozen doesn\u2019t sound like many, but if they don\u2019t die when you kill them they can do a lot. So today I think they have a little plaque where the beggar used to sit, for the thanatotic riot of 1433. Killed about eight hundred, supposedly.\n\n\n\nWhile the citizens ran about like headless chickens I collected my project and dispatched the uncooperative Karcist with my favourite trick.\n\n\n\nThat was the fifty-seventh time I died.\n\n\n\nI fled the city with her in my arms, all my dead lost to its militia, the happiest I\u2019d been in centuries. To call back a soul, well-formed, from //millenia// of sleep? Every two-bit reanimator called it impossible.\n\n\n\nOh, come on, you know me better than that. I wouldn\u2019t do this to you for //fun//; I\u2019m not such a sadist I\u2019d risk the Coalition\u2019s wrath. Obviously something didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\n\nMy daughter woke up. Her flesh was as cold as mine, but that was no burden. She would never be hungry again, and if she ever left me I knew I could bring her back. I would try to teach her, somehow, and let her do the same to me. We would pass through the ages of man together. That was the first time I really thought about my power, in detail.\n\n\n\nYes, try and pull what remains of your face into a smirk, very classy. I was raised when the cutting edge of technology was //writing//. It took me fully three thousand years to realise the priests of Ashur and Marduk could not literally talk to the gods. I had to essentially invent the entire notion of necromancy from scratch.\n\n\n\nWell, thank you! But of course I don\u2019t seem that old. If I did, I would have gone insane a very long time ago. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to see a warhorse, an automobile, a spacecraft?\n\n\n\nWait, wait, sorry. I\u2019m letting you rile me up. Back to the story.\n\n\n\nMy daughter was the child I\u2019d loved, in every detail. Exactly every detail. She did not gain new traits, or lose old ones. It was as if her soul was frozen in amber. Something about the way it connected to her newly-conquered flesh was defective. She could puppeteer the body, but the body could not embed memories in her being. So she remembered only the last month, at best. She is an eternal youth, and can never grow.\n\n\n\nFor a while, I thought her perfect as she was. Though I had not known it, this had been what I was missing all those empty years. The two of us lived out the Thirty Years\u2019 War in an obscure hut, mother and child (much later did we learn this was also the //Fifth// Occult War). I taught her a hundred times, to weave, to write, to feel safe. She did not feel an empty belly even once, and occasionally I entertained her by dismembering lost //landsknechte//.\n\n\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stay satisfied forever. Every mother wants to see her daughter grow into herself. She should have been my equal, and risen a queen of the dead alongside me. We would resurrect each other cyclically, until the last city fell.\n\n\n\nYou people never fail to irritate me. No, don\u2019t flinch, just -- if you want to ask something, //ask it//! What\u2019s the point of this ridiculous \u201cMay I ask\u201d nonsense? It\u2019s not as if tiptoeing around will make me any more merciful.\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\nYou want to know //that//, do you. Why do I tell these stories in such varying tones. Why am I so cavalier about everything except my daughter. How insightful.\n\n\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being totally //sincere// in your questioning. I think you\u2019re trying to make some sort of //point//. Perhaps to imply a false and saccharine equivalence between her and //other// people.\n\n\n\nSo let me answer your question with a question of my own: what do you think happens if you supercharge a person\u2019s amygdala for five minutes? Do they just have a heart attack? Let\u2019s find out, shall we?\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/woods.jpg |\n\ncaption=I have had no small number of encounters with [[span style=\"color:green\"]]the abode of quiet[[/span]].

I\u2019d spent the past three hundred years looking for someone who knew how to help my daughter\u2019s situation.\n\n\n\nWell, I say that, but it\u2019s not strictly true. I spent fifty years searching, and then I realised I\u2019d have to do it myself. I learnt at the feet of the great soul-sages; I did favours for children of the Scarlet Fool; I even managed to win a lesson off one of the Wild Hunt on a bet. I began to put together something like a //theory// of necromancy. I was inspired by what was in the air in those days. All those philosophers, those men of science! There was something romantic about the idea the world could be understood.\n\n\n\nI knew firsthand it was false, of course.\n\n\n\nSo I set out on a course of experimentation. That\u2019s when I began collecting material in earnest, and yes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here, you poor thing.\n\n\n\nAnyway, as I said, I was in Chernobyl. After the Russians cursed the land, they evacuated the whole town. The margins of error for that kind of thing are large enough to lose a lot of people. Ripe pickings for little old me.\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean \u201ctalk like that\u201d? I talk like //myself//. If I wasn\u2019t able to change with the times I would have lost my mind a long time ago. Even last century, there was barely such a thing as a Foundation, and now they\u2019ve fallen apart. If I adapted any slower the pace of events would overtake me, you understand?\n\n\n\nRight, so, outskirts of Chernobyl, going shopping for new material. I couldn\u2019t bring my dead everywhere, the way I used to. The stink was too obvious, the scarves and hats too blatant. There were cameras metastasising on every street corner. I had to struggle just to carry one or two along with me those days.\n\n\n\nSo there I was, walking around in a ridiculous coat and sunglasses, dragging this briefcase by my side. My daughter was never the type to cling to my skirts. She was away somewhere in the city. It wouldn\u2019t do to spend all my time worrying about her survival, so in the past hundred years I\u2019d fit her with a few extra features.\n\n\n\nIf you are about to call me a bad parent, then be warned that I might start trying to be a good one, //starting with my research efforts//.\n\n\n\nNo? Excellent.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d had my fair share of encounters with what are now hilariously called \u201cnormalcy preservation organisations\u201d. Bloodless and wretched things. They\u2019d tried to chain my daughter more times than I can count. I could accept that they\u2019d come after me, but she was just a slip of a girl. Their cruelty knew no bounds.\n\n\n\nOne moment I was walking down an emptying street, and the next three agents leapt out from a decrepit old house and blew a neat triplet of holes in my torso.\n\n\n\nOf course by this point I was really quite hard to kill, but the three of them were backed up by two brutes in hazmat armour. They caught me about the neck with a loop of rope like some kind of animal and emptied their magazines. I was still conscious, but there\u2019s not really a lot you can do with gaping holes in every major muscle group.\n\n\n\nThey dragged me into the base they\u2019d set up in their shack, which inside was done up like some kind of watchpost. I recognised vaguely the equipment and the general style: they were with Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, or one of its descendants.\n\n\n\nThis--\n\n\n\nIt was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt. Even the day I lost my daughter, there was a kind of lingering apathy. I let the waves wash over me until my head only rarely broke the surface, and I almost forgot what loss was at all.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t like that. They were right there, in the room with me, and I couldn\u2019t move. She was out there, waiting for me, and when she came to find me, and she found //them//, and I would have to watch, if she found them would they even capture her or just pulp her fucking brain again--\n\n\n\nOops!\n\n\n\nSorry. It\u2019ll reattach, don\u2019t worry. And anyway, you\u2019re not going to miss it for long.\n\n\n\nHmph.\n\n\n\nSuffice to say I wasn\u2019t feeling great. They put me in cuffs, and were preparing some kind of sedative, which might even have worked. But\u2026\n\n\n\nOne of them had taken //my briefcase//. And you know how they are. Their type just cannot stand an unanswered question. I don\u2019t know who they thought I was. If they\u2019d known exactly who they\u2019d found they would have burned it. But instead poor idiot mister Foundation popped the locks.\n\n\n\nThe layers of the dermis aren\u2019t actually connected very strongly, you know? Once you puncture the membrane somewhere, you can work your way through the subcutaneous tissue pretty easy. Especially if you\u2019re using, say, human jaws.\n\n\n\nHe reeled back and half his face was missing, torn off by the thing in the case. He screamed -- I think he was trying to cry for help, but it had gotten into his muscles, too -- and the rest of the agents opened up on my poor valiant servant.\n\n\n\nThen she arrived. Must have tracked her mother by scent, or perhaps she was playing stalk-and-catch. I was so proud of her.\n\n\n\nJust walked in through the front door, quiet as could be. I think the field team were a little off kilter for some reason, so they didn\u2019t shoot her. One of them screamed at her to get back while the other three tried to wrangle my homunculus. He actually ran over and tried to grab her and get out of the house!\n\n\n\nWell, my daughter popped his head off, of course. Then they turned their attention to her properly, but now there were only three of them against two of my dead and my dear girl. It was quick, and then it was slow.\n\n\n\nTwo of them surrendered. I was worried they\u2019d hurt her, but she was only superficially perforated. At worst it was inconvenient. I\u2019d have to reattach her spinal cord where a stray round had pierced it to get her lower body functional again, that was all.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I broke my restraints I embraced her and praised her for that display of\u00a0\u00a0bravery. We left at once, with the two captives restrained and lugged with us. One of them begged us the whole way to release his subordinate. I told him I\u2019d do his job for him and reprimand her and he made such a noise. It was a great pick-me-up after everything.\n\n\n\nWhen we got back I scrapped him for parts -- in fact, look back there, you can still see his spine wriggling in the pneumatitrator! Isn\u2019t it kind of cute? No?\n\n\n\nOh, be sullen, then. When my daughter gets like this I give her a chocolate and some leftovers, but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t work on you. \n\n\n\nI would have found somewhere for his inferior to make herself useful, too, but it turned out the paralytic had made its way to her lungs.\n\n\n\nHo hum. He did get his wish; that was my good deed for the decade. Afterwards I took the kid out for a treat. Blue steak in Lyon.\n\n\n\nAnd, oh dear, speaking of hypoxia I do think your airway is blocked. Why didn\u2019t you //say// any--\n\n\n\nRight, you don\u2019t have an isolation chamber for your larynx. My bad. Can you hear me right now? Were you even conscious for the back half of my story? It\u2019s awfully rude of you to choke on your blood while I was doing all this helpful work on your intestines, and I shall have my recompense, I say. \n\n\n\nHa. Oh, what a mess.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t get another one of you, it\u2019d be such a headache. I hope you can tolerate a little brain damage.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/ruin.webp |\n\ncaption=The cities played at worship, but the only thing they truly cared for was counting.

Hm?\n\n\n\nOh, the slurring isn\u2019t too bad. I was worried I\u2019d rendered you incogent. Monologuing is only fun with a lucid audience.\n\n\n\nWell, that episode wasn\u2019t all that interesting, regardless. I was just explaining how much I love my daughter, indulging in my motherly urges and so on. I know //you types// aren\u2019t a fan.\n\n\n\nWhat? Strike a nerve?\n\n\n\nHm. You\u2019ve gone soft in your old age, regardless. No, not -- don\u2019t look at me like that. Yes, you\u2019re very young, and I\u2019m sure that hair is attractive to\u2026 somebody. But //you//, the Foundation, whatever you call yourselves nowadays. What you\u2019ve been getting up to is positively pathetic. The other day I heard a \u201cVanguard\u201d pharmacy put out a call for vampires to come in for conditioning treatment! Did you get so lazy you decided you\u2019d try and get all your enemies to just go willingly to their dissection and death? If even one of the daughters of the great Impaler appeared I\u2019d eat my shoes.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t hear you; the nerve damage has really got to your tongue. Try harder.\n\n\n\nListen, I like to joke with the material, but that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to tell me a lie, make it believable. You\u2019re so awful at subterfuge I\u2019m probably doing good by increasing the competence of your agency.\n\n\n\nNo, come on, this persistence is pathetic. Even if you did somehow hoodwink //ten// bloodsuckers into showing up, you don\u2019t need to keep up this pretense about, what do you call it, \u201charm reduction\u201d, around //me//. Look at me! I\u2019m not going to judge you if you admit you scattered their ashes in the river.\n\n\n\nI have to respect your commitment. Maybe you even believe it. The Foundation were always masters of self-deception. I thought Vanguard had turned a new leaf. This has been an educational exchange for the //both// of us.\n\n\n\nAh, but their new era has not been without its upsides. I am a great appreciator of your people\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0newfound openmindedness. If they\u2019d adopted this attitude from the start, we\u2019d all be deathless by now. To think of how much easier things would have been if they hadn\u2019t clung to their idiot notions\u2026 I could strangle those pitiful Overseers.\n\n\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t say no to the amnesty when they offered it.\n\n\n\nOh, you look like a kicked puppy. Yes, one of their liaisons offered me a pardon if I\u2019d agree to test on their mimicflesh and swear off the good stuff. I did try it for a few months, but it\u2019s just not the same. There are all these obscure occult properties, and the mimics don\u2019t even scream properly.\n\n\n\nYes, and that\u2019s you caught up to the modern day, more or less. I skipped over a variety of encounters with dullards who thought they\u2019d be the one to kill me, but nothing worth telling.\n\n\n\nI absolutely //do// have to do this. My daughter\u2019s memory is up to a nice round two years, which is about ten thousand short of what I\u2019ll accept.\n\n\n\nOh, good job on the smile! I thought your zygomaticus was halfway to necrosis, congratulations. Can I ask what brought it on? Would it have anything to do with the dozen Coalition jackboots fumbling out of their base toward my pretty little abode?\n\n\n\nYou remain an awful liar, dear. Of course you know what I\u2019m talking about. You called them here with that goetic beacon in your pericardial cavity. Or maybe not; the world is full of coincidences.\n\n\n\nAnd there goes the grin. It\u2019s a shame, it looks good on you. Really shows off your incisors. I think those will be your main input into my next project. \n\n\n\nEvery single sneering warden thinks they have me pegged. Here\u2019s a doddering old lady from before we invented writing, who\u2019s escaped capture by slinking away from everything dangerous, burdened by an imbecile daughter barely capable of feeding herself. I\u2019ve seen what you write about me. You have such interesting //opinions// about my work. And even though I have slipped through the nets of a hundred generations, every two-bit Director is just so sure he\u2019ll be the one to bring this antique into the reliquary that is her rightful place. Chernobyl was the closest you ever came, and you were still //pretty damn far//.\n\n\n\nI told you: if I could not adapt to the world as it is, I would have gone mad eons ago. And yet every time one of your technicians invent some new gimmick you try to catch me with it. The Scythians tried riding me down with their precious cavalry, old Rameses had a go with chariots, Metternich cornered me with grenadiers, De Gaulle\u2019s goons poisoned me with some fancy paralytic. All of them are decorating the east wall of the lab, now. Don\u2019t look! I just said I want your teeth, and the vomit does terrible things to the enamel.\n\n\n\nAnd your precious Coalition, with their newest hack. These unbinding mechanists have made a right mess. You know a month ago, the thrall they were interviewing on TV, where they had to keep redacting segments of her life story because her master was a wanted criminal? That was //me//! I mean, the embarrassment I felt, I just wanted a hole to open up and swallow her. Having my reputation tarnished in front of half the country by a spare worker! I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on an unbinder and see what makes them tick for just //so// long.\n\n\n\nSo: thank you for putting together this whole operation. I was worried they might not bother, but it seems Vanguard has rubbed off on them. They were just so filled with //humanitarian concern// that they brought one! So sweet. I should have the countermeasure up by next week.\n\n\n\nWhy on Earth did you step up as bait?\u00a0\u00a0Did you think they\u2019d pull you out while you were still recognisable? Because I can promise you that even if they did cage me, you are not in a fixable state.\n\n\n\nHm. I do not think the word for what you have done here is //bravery//, exactly; even we Levantine hunter-gatherers had words for \u201csuicidal\u201d. It should make your cerebrum an interesting reagent, if nothing else.\n\n\n\nAh, and here they come. They\u2019re just going through the chaff upstairs. I do wish you\u2019d never invented gunpowder. Those things are just far too loud.\n\n\n\nEve! Come on upstairs, dear. There are some very rude men upstairs.\n\n\n\nYes, isn\u2019t she just adorable? It took me a while to work out the telescoping ribcage. Put that away, darling, you\u2019re getting lymph everywhere. And those fingernails! I\u2019ll have you know they can hit a sparrow at half a kilometre.\n\n\n\nJust go on up, sweet.\n\n\n\nDinner\u2019s served.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/light.jpg |\n\ncaption=When I was a child, I dreamt of the paradise I was promised my spirit would one day rise to.

There are some board games on shelves in the corner. There\u2019s a foosball table near the center, and a television on the wall that is currently showing a music video.</p>\n<p>However, each of these amenities is carefully controlled. All furniture is nailed to the floor or affixed firmly to the wall. There\u2019s nothing in the room that can be thrown or used as a weapon, and nothing that could allow prisoners to communicate with the outside world.</p>\n<p>Add to that the heavy metal door, the armed guards, and the fact that any escaping humanoid would have an entire facility to navigate before they got out, and this room is quite secure.</p>\n<p>Still, for members of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, to be allowed in here is an enormous privilege, one the Foundation is granting only on an extremely probative basis.</p>\n<p>Light neglected to mention that part of the deal. The Foundation is allowing us in here in exchange for the information I gave, but if any of us piss off the Jailors, we\u2019ll all be yanked back into solitary confinement.</p>\n<p>That means I can\u2019t fuck up. I can\u2019t do anything that would prompt the Jailors to take this away from my comrades. Even though I know that\u2019s exactly what the Jailors want me to think, I still can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s my fault Sean and the others got captured. I can\u2019t do anything that would make their captivity worse.</p>\n<p>There are around two dozen humanoids in medium security. Most of them are strangers, but my eyes snap right to the ones who are familiar.</p>\n<p>There, sitting in a corner, already talking to each other, are Jack, Mike, and Sean. They turn to look at me as I enter the room.</p>\n<p>I look back at them. They wear the same bluish uniforms all imprisoned anomalies wear, but I don\u2019t see any wounds or scars. Their mood is somber, but they don\u2019t seem broken.</p>\n<p>Considering the magnitude of the clusterfuck I dragged them into, they\u2019re doing a lot better than they could be.</p>\n<p>That should make me feel better, but it doesn\u2019t. If it weren\u2019t for me, they\u2019d still be free. They gave up their freedom for me, for my mission, a mission that was doomed from the start.</p>\n<p>As soon as the guards undo my cuffs, I run up to them. I hug all three of them in turn, tears trickling to the floor beneath me. Words I\u2019ve wanted to say for months come spilling out of me like water from a burst pipe. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I pulled you into all this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sean shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not my fault just to make me feel better. You got captured trying to rescue my brother. If I hadn\u2019t made you guys help me, you\u2019d still be free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> inducted <em>you</em> into the Serpent\u2019s Hand,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe knew the risks and chose to take them. Resistance is dangerous. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the Jailors\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. You wouldn\u2019t have come to this place if it weren\u2019t for me, and it all turned out to be for nothing. Evan was\u2026\u201d I look up at him. I see no confusion, only concern. He knows. Of course he does. Jack and Mike saw Evan betray me. It was probably the first thing they told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing an MTF uniform. He was eating with them. I was so stupid to trust him.\u201d An edge of anger creeps into my voice. Anger at Evan, for betraying me, and anger at myself, for falling for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us knew it was a possibility,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was wearing a uniform!\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t make a mistake, but a lot of people probably would have done the same thing. Besides, at least your brother hasn\u2019t been suffering this whole time. He\u2019s probably better off in that task force than in a cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened is worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s an enemy, now. He betrayed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean admits. He looks at me for a moment and seems to think better of continuing to speak, as if afraid his opinion on the issue would offend me.</p>\n<p>I take a moment to contemplate what he\u2019s suggesting, that Evan rotting miserable in a cell for six years would have been worse than what happened.</p>\n<p>I spent six years having nightmares about my brother rotting alone in a cell. The entire time he was gone, I had no idea how he was being treated. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was still alive.</p>\n<p>Once I entered the Library and learned about the Foundation, the fearful unknown was replaced with a vivid image of Evan being treated the way Sean was treated as a teenager, the way most humanoid anomalies are treated by the Foundation. Do I really wish I\u2019d found Evan like that?</p>\n<p>I have to, don\u2019t I? Not because I want him to suffer, but because, if he\u2019d been a prisoner, he would have followed me to the Wanderer\u2019s Library. I\u2019d have brought him into the Hand, and my parents would\u2019ve finally learned that their son was still alive.</p>\n<p>A new image flashes in my head. Somewhere, right now, my mom is in tears, believing that she outlived both of her sons. The Jailors surely faked my death just as they did Evan\u2019s, so now my parents think they\u2019ve lost both their children.</p>\n<p>Evan knew they\u2019d do that when he helped the Jailors capture me. Whatever misery she\u2019s suffering now, it\u2019s his fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been okay since we last saw you?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>Of course not. No one in containment is okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to worry about each other,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere\u2019s no helping that.\u201d</p>\n<p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell them what I\u2019ve been doing. I don\u2019t want to tell them that I\u2019ve also been helping the Jailors. Even though they trained me not to. Even though they spent months teaching me to shut down and give our enemies nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t lie to them, though. I can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t failed them. That would be yet another betrayal.</p>\n<p>Tears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping them, too,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asks. There it is. The anger I deserve. It\u2019s almost comforting, knowing that, at least after this, I won\u2019t be able to disappoint them any further.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been letting them use my powers,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve been putting people in front of me, civilians, victims of mind-control, and I\u2019ve been curing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Sean asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, and the tidbit of information I used to get the four of us in here. It was about the Fifth Church. I don\u2019t think they could use it against the Hand. Still\u2026 I failed you. You trained me to ignore them, to force my mind out of my body and give them nothing. Instead, I\u2019ve been letting them manipulate and bargain with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey put a victim in front of me, someone who\u2019d been cursed. I tried to do the fire thing. I tried to summon a vivid image to my mind and ignore them like you trained me to, but I only held out for a few minutes before I gave in and cured them of the spell that was torturing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>I expect anger. Judgement. Disappointment. Failing that, I expect some sugarcoating attempt to cheer me up. The last thing I expect is the genuine relief that passes across their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a horrible thing for them to do,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not holding out,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that they can use me to cure people, my brother is free to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but given that he\u2019s a loyal Jailor, it\u2019s probably bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sean says, \u201cI hate them too, but, if I had your powers, and if they locked me in a room with someone like that, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. It might\u2019ve even been the right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>I look up at him. Is he serious? Could he really have just said that? \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m helping them,\u201d I say. \u201cHow could that be the right thing to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doing anything that helps them hurt anyone?\u201d Jack asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot directly,\u201d I admit, after a moment, \u201cbut what I\u2019m doing used to be my brother\u2019s primary job. Now that I\u2019m doing it, he\u2019s free to go do Jailor things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d refused to treat those people,\u201d Mike asks, \u201cwould the Jailors have used Evan to cure them, or would he be off doing whatever he\u2019s doing, leaving them untreated?\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes me a moment to process the significance of this question. \u201cThe latter,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Evan said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I think you made the right choice,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThose people don\u2019t deserve to languish in a containment cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least you got the Jailors to let someone go,\u201d Jack adds.</p>\n<p>I stare up at them.</p>\n<p>The argument they just made, Evan also made it when he tried to recruit me to the Jailors right after he captured me.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI decrease the number of people in Foundation custody. Before I came around, there were hundreds of mental anomalies whose victims had to be kept in containment for the rest of their lives. I\u2019ve cured thousands of people like that, allowing them to be sent back to their families. I\u2019ve freed more people from Foundation containment than the Serpent\u2019s Hand ever will.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Am I really hearing the same argument from Sean?</p>\n<p>I try to keep my shock off my face, but, clearly, I\u2019m failing.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jack says, \u201call we\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re being forced to make hard choices in here. Try to cut yourself some slack, okay? You\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The best I can?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 actually think that?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Sean says. The others nod in agreement.</p>\n<p>Could it be that they\u2019re just saying this to cheer me up?</p>\n<p>No. They wouldn\u2019t lie to me like that. They wouldn\u2019t treat me like a child. If they\u2019re saying my decision is understandable, perhaps even <em>defensible</em>, that\u2019s what they honestly believe.</p>\n<p>I want to argue back, to explain why they should be disappointed in me, but I can\u2019t find the words, and after I spend close to a minute trying and trying to think of something to say, I once again cave to temptation, and change the subject. \u201cHow have you guys been?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been worse off than me.</p>\n<p>Sean was moved to Site-17 almost immediately after his capture, and he\u2019s been in high security containment ever since. All three of them have suffered the same mind-numbing isolation, only they haven\u2019t had interactions with Evan, Dr. Light, my patients, or any other scrap of human contact. They\u2019ve been completely alone for months.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer like that for my failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got us out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to you we\u2019re in here. We can never thank you enough for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the least I could do, after getting you stuck here,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe embarked on this mission together. We got captured together. We got in here together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d still be out if it weren\u2019t for me,\u201d I repeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been on your mission, we would\u2019ve been on another,\u201d Sean says. \u201cIt could have gone South, just like this one did. If that had happened, we probably never would have escaped solitary.\u201d</p>\n<p>My eyes are moist. I shake my head, but, once again, I\u2019m not able to formulate an argument. I did get them out of high security containment, and taking Light\u2019s deal was the only way I could\u2019ve done that. In almost any other situation, that would\u2019ve been impossible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d I say. \u201cI had to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We embarked on this mission together, we failed together, and we\u2019re still together now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The others seem to agree with that, and I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with them.</p>\n<p>The heavy conversation dies down after that, and we set about just spending time together. We spend some time on the foosball table, and another chunk of time watching TV.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another music video on, by the pop star Jimmy Pheonix. He\u2019s a young singer, around Evan\u2019s age. He exploded onto the scene about half a decade ago and has become one of the most popular musicians in the world.</p>\n<p>His style could be best described as aggressively inoffensive, one of those pop stars cooked up in a corporate boardroom for maximumly broad appeal. I\u2019m sure people who care deeply about music regard him as absolute trash. For example:</p>\n<p>\u201cGods, do they have to play this?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, I think it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>The other two turn to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Mike says, looking away. \u201cYou can like whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably an actual reason they\u2019re playing this,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why they\u2019d actively want to rot our brains with something mindless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the four chords.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of his songs use the four chords,\u201d Jack says. \u201cDo you even know which chords the \u2018four chords of pop music\u2019 are?\u201d</p>\n<p>After half a minute of embarrassing silence, Mike admits he does not.</p>\n<p>Socialization goes on for two hours. When it\u2019s over, me and my comrades are allowed to exchange goodbyes, then we\u2019re sent back to our cells.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re all still prisoners. They\u2019re still suffering immensely for my failure, but at least I\u2019m lightening their burden. At least they\u2019re with friends, some of the time.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s pathetic that the bar has sunk so low, but this is the best day I\u2019ve had in months. I can only hope it was for them, too. That\u2019s the least I owe them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Evan</strong></p>\n<p>Callum tilts his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he admits, \u201cyou have me curious. What\u2019s this epiphany you\u2019ve had?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know who Veronica Hall is?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe magician?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Fifthist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she? I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s probably a lie, but it\u2019s not an important one right now, so Evan doesn\u2019t allow himself to get distracted by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI talked to her yesterday,\u201d Evan says. \u201cShe said some very interesting things. She knew about the Galaxy Plaza ritual, and she seemed to think of <em>you</em> as the one primarily responsible for its failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum raises a brow. \u201cDid she? I will admit that\u2019s a bit interesting. I suppose it could be seen as my fault. The ritual might have worked if I hadn\u2019t had it moved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he says. For a second, he has to fight down his nerves. He\u2019s about to make a big claim. If he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to make himself look really stupid, which could permanently damage his rapport with Callum.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not wrong, though. His theory makes sense. It explains everything. It explains what all of this has to do with Cassidy Redwood. It explains why Callum chose to meddle with such an important ritual, when he could have easily taken revenge on Evan in another way. It explains how Callum could have been foolish enough to think that a ritual designed to require thousands of sacrifices would still work with only a few dozen.</p>\n<p>Or, rather, it explains that he was never that foolish.</p>\n<p>Evan looks Callum right in the eye. \u201cI think you got the ritual moved to Galaxy Plaza knowing that would cause it to fail,\u201d Evan says. \u201cI think you wanted it to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Callum is frozen. He\u2019s clearly surprised. But is it the correctness of the claim that has him shocked, or its absurdity?</p>\n<p>The smile that slowly creeps across Callum\u2019s face does little to resolve this ambiguity. \u201cOh?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHall said something very interesting to me yesterday. <em>\u2018I told them that what didn\u2019t work for Redwood wouldn\u2019t work for us.\u2019</em> She meant Cassidy Redwood, the Ortothan who tried and failed to resurrect her god with a blood sacrifice. Redwood left behind extensive notes detailing how she tried to reduce the number of sacrifices her ritual required.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted that you approached your father and asked him to move the ritual to Galaxy Plaza. I always took it for granted that you had enough pull with him to get him to say yes, but that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it? This ritual was the most important thing the church had ever attempted. There\u2019s no way your father would allow its effectiveness to be jeopardized just so you could get revenge against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it was moved,\u201d Callum observes. \u201cClearly I <em>did</em> manage to convince the Church to move it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in order to do that, you had to pair your proposal with an argument that the ritual would still work. You had to provide some kind of explanation, grounded in thaumaturgic theory, for why such a tiny number of sacrifices would still be enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the giant machine Cassidy Redwood built? There was nothing like that at the Galaxy Plaza.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you altered the details of the plan. You didn\u2019t need to use every trick she did. You just borrowed enough ideas to create a somewhat convincing case that the ritual could be completed with fewer sacrifices. You didn\u2019t even need to admit you got the idea from Redwood. Maybe Hall just made that connection later. Either way, you must have told them something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you know I was lying?\u201d Callum asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I have honestly believed the ritual would work with fewer sacrifices?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You know magical theory too well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a Fifthist. The same people who tried to take a bus to another solar system, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019d been interacting with me for months. Fifthism\u2019s grip on your mind had weakened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes one more second to push down his nerves. It\u2019s time for the killing blow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think that weakened grip <em>just</em> made you too smart to think the ritual would still work. I think it made you want it to fail. I think, after months of being friends with me, my voice eroding the Starfish\u2019s influence on you, a tiny bit of your conscience showed itself, just enough that you didn\u2019t want to end the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum stares up at Evan for several seconds. Slowly, as if out to milk the tension in the room for as long as he can, he closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cTsk, tsk, Evan. For a second, I really thought you had it all figured out, but then you had to start blabbering about my conscience.\u201d He pauses for a moment, then looks Evan right in the eye. \u201cMy choice to sabotage the ritual had nothing to do with morality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what did it have to do with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realized that I liked the world the way it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that different?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it had less than nothing to do with other people\u2019s wellbeing. Before you had me captured, I had money, power, and magic, and I was in a position to lord those things over the masses who lacked them. Most people didn\u2019t even know magic existed. None of them had any way of protecting themselves against my spells. I could do whatever I wanted. I could make them do whatever I wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Evan grimace. Jerry said something similar, a while back, that the Veil helps the world\u2019s monsters by ensuring ordinary people don\u2019t know how to defend themselves against them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the appeal of it,\u201d Callum continues. \u201cIn a clueless world, there was nothing stopping me from taking anything I wanted. I wanted a tome of arcane lore? I made someone sell it to me for a pittance. I wanted the hottest girl I knew to date me? She did. Everything I wanted, I got. I had power, and other people didn\u2019t. Do you know enough about Fifthist doctrine to know what\u2019s supposed to happen once the Fifth Church finally wins?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world turns into a hellscape based on the Starfish\u2019s warped imagination.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd with that newfound power, the Starfish destroys the barrier between desire and reality. All desires become real. <em>All</em> desires. Everyone would be able to bend reality to their whim, and if they decided they wanted to bend me, they\u2019d be just as likely to succeed as they\u2019d be to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy would a wolf want the helpless sheep he fed on to become wolves as well? My family\u2019s money wouldn\u2019t matter. My magic wouldn\u2019t be anything special. Everyone on earth would become my peer, and I don\u2019t want peers. I want the kind of power that can only exist in an ordered world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan stares at Callum. Somehow, even though Evan\u2019s initial guess was mostly right, Callum still managed to surprise and disappoint him.</p>\n<p>Maybe Evan should have known better. He wants so badly to believe his high-school best friend is buried somewhere deep inside Callum, but maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe that person was only ever a mask, and the real Callum could only have sick, selfish reasons to do anything, even save the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was right about the rest of it, though?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight enough that I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Callum admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I said I moved the ritual to Galaxy Plaza because I wanted revenge against you. I really did hate you for taking so much power away from me. At the same time, with the help of your magic voice, I\u2019d come to recognize that the Church\u2019s ultimate victory would, in its own way, do the same, so I hatched a plan to take care of both problems at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got my hands on Cassidy Redwood\u2019s notes. I drafted a similar proposal for our ritual and presented it to my father. I argued that the smaller number of sacrifices would attract less attention. Bullshit, of course. I knew a few dozen sacrifices could never be enough. I knew that the only thing my new ritual would succeed at doing was luring you into danger. I told you something would happen, knowing you\u2019d show up and try to save everyone. I thought you\u2019d run in and get yourself killed, and once you did, everything would be back to the way it was before I met you, with me ruling as crown prince over a town of magicless simpletons.\u201d</p>\n<p>There it is, then. After six years, the full truth about the Galaxy Plaza disaster, with no loose ends or lingering questions.</p>\n<p>As cathartic as it is to see it all laid out, Evan needs more than that to save the world again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the Church were going to try the same ritual again,\u201d Evan says, \u201cwhat kind of venue would they need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t insult my intelligence by pretending you\u2019re talking about a hypothetical. You\u2019re here because something happened. Just come out and tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan sighs. On paper, he isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose the situation to Callum. However, Callum\u2019s talking right now because Evan earned a bit of his respect by figuring out what he did six years ago. For Callum to continue talking, Evan needs to keep that respect.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I admit it. They\u2019re trying again. What kind of venue do they need?\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful to hear. I hope they succeed. I certainly won\u2019t be telling you anything that would help you stop them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just established that you don\u2019t want the world to end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>didn\u2019t</em> want it to end six years ago. My circumstances have changed since then. I no longer have money, power, or freedom. I\u2019m not in a position to lord my magic over anyone. Compared to my life in here, maybe the Fifth Church\u2019s new world would be an upgrade?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir new world would be hell for anyone sane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of it; there wouldn\u2019t be anyone sane.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan shakes his head. \u201cI would still be sane, as would anyone I chose to interact with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think I <em>don\u2019t</em> want you to experience eternal torment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if I can drag you down with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>That finally wipes the smile off Callum\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Evan says, \u201cif the Fifth Church does remake the world, and it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t tell me how to stop it, I will make <em>sure</em> you\u2019re perfectly sane until the end of time. I will find you, and I will force you to endure every second of our new eternity just as agonizingly lucid as me.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment of trepidation, Callum shakes his head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t capable of that kind of vindictiveness. If the world is already beyond saving, you won\u2019t torture me just out of spite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn most situations, you\u2019d be right,\u201d Evan admits, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting something. Jerry has my powers. He\u2019d also be sane, trapped in an insane world of eternal torment.\u201d Evan looks Callum in the eye. \u201cI swear to you, if that happens to my little brother, and it\u2019s your fault, I will <em>happily</em> dedicate the rest of my existence to punishing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum meets his gaze for a moment. His smugness falters.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Callum says, through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does the ritual work, and how would we stop it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>Starlight Saga</em> books have a memetic agent inside of them, similar to the one we put in <em>Star Signals</em>,\u201d Callum says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We tested them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tested whether the books have any effect on your stupid D-Class. Your tests came back negative because the meme doesn\u2019t do anything after it\u2019s first implanted. It just lingers there, waiting to be activated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActivated?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the ritual is for. It\u2019s all part of a deal we made with an extra-universal entity. A tiny piece of that being\u2019s essence is implanted in everyone who reads those books.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Evan asks. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s read <em>the Starlight Saga</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Callum\u2019s smugness returns. \u201cEvery last one. As we speak, our trigger waits, latent, in tens of millions of readers all over the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes a step backwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce we give the entity the sacrifice we owe it,\u201d Callum continues, \u201cit\u2019ll activate the trigger. All those minds will be ours, and they\u2019ll start remaking the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tens of millions. Tens of millions of people. The implications are so heavy that it\u2019s hard to stay standing. \u201cTens of millions would start to develop Ojai syndrome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t \u2018start to\u2019 develop it. They\u2019d become fully affected, instantly, just as if they\u2019d read <em>Star Signals</em> cover to cover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInstantly\u2026\u201d Evan doesn\u2019t want to show Callum\u2019s weakness, but he can\u2019t keep the horror off his face. For that many people to fall fully under the control of the Fifth Church would be the greatest disaster in human history, anomalous or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Callum\u2019s delight is no less obvious than Evan\u2019s fear. \u201cThe problem with <em>Star Signals</em> is that it was too slow. We\u2019d barely started to spread the book when you identified it as a threat and started shutting us down, so the Church created a new memetic agent which would activate all at once, after it was already widespread. Once those millions of minds are under the Church\u2019s control, they\u2019ll begin the same ritual the <em>Star Signals</em> readers started, and, about two weeks later, the world will be remade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes a deep breath. Focus. He can\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed. He needs to keep his head in the game. His job is to save the world. That\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we figure out when and where the sacrifice will take place?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I interfered, the Church was going to do it at some massive nerd convention in California.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe people we sacrifice have to be affected by the memetic agent. Part of the deal. Something about the entity getting to keep their souls. If the Church is planning to try again, they\u2019ll pick somewhere where thousands of <em>Starlight Saga</em> readers have gathered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back at the height of those books\u2019 popularity, any large gathering of sci-fi fans would be full of people who\u2019ve read them. Six years later\u2026 honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be that different. There\u2019d be thousands of events that could potentially qualify, and even if the Foundation identified and stopped one, all that would do is buy a bit of time. So long as that seed is prevalent, the Church can try again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there any way of purging that memetic seed from people?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>Callum shrugs. \u201cYou might be able to do it. You\u2019re pretty good at cleaning magic gunk out of people\u2019s brains. Still, given how many people there are to cure, and given that you have no way of identifying them, I don\u2019t like your odds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan doesn\u2019t like the Foundation\u2019s odds, either.</p>\n<p>The Foundation\u2019s people need to have a very, very long talk about this information, and that talk needs to begin as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s all my questions for now,\u201d Evan says. \u201cThank you. What you just said might save the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say? Threatening to torture someone for all eternity is a good way to get their secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, you\u2019ve done a good thing today. Maybe there\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvan, it\u2019s been five minutes since we went over this. You haven\u2019t dug up some faint echo of my better nature. I don\u2019t have a better nature. I said what I said because you threatened me. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Evan says. \u201cGoodbye, then. Me or another Foundation agent may be back with more questions later. Be candid with them, or else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Goodbye, and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost enough to goad Evan into taking the last word, but that\u2019d be as much of a victory for Callum as anything. Evan leaves.</p>\n<p>Light is waiting outside. \u201cGood work,\u201d she says, though there isn\u2019t any cheer in her voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Evan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m arranging an emergency meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Light\u2019s gaze lingers on him for a moment. He meets it. He does his best to force the worry off of his face.</p>\n<p>She can probably still see it. After, he can tell she\u2019s doing the same. The truth is, unless everything Callum just said is completely wrong, this is the gravest situation Evan has ever faced. Unless the Foundation does something very clever, very quickly, tens of millions of minds are going to be brought under the Fifth Church\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>Once that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s hard to imagine how even the Foundation could save the world.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-hub\">Series Hub</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster\">\u25c0\u25c0 First Entry</a> | <a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall\">\u25c0 Previous Entry</a> | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent\">Next Entry \u25b6</a></p>\n<p><sub><a href=\"/xhawk77x\">More by this Author</a></sub></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-18-callum-michaels\">I Didn't Forget Pt 18: Callum Michaels</a>\" by XHAWK77X, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The former Fifthist looks up at him from across the table, smug as ever.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we really doing this again so soon?\u201d Callum asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be different this time,\u201d Evan says.\n\n\n\nCallum sighs. \u201cFine. It\u2019s not like I have anything better to do. I suppose you have more questions?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. This time, I think I have answers.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Jerry**\n\n\n\nThe day after I made my arrangement with Dr. Light, I\u2019m escorted to the medium security socialization area after a long day treating civilians with mental afflictions.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a well-guarded room, totally enclosed and located deep within Site-17.\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of chairs and tables in the room, along with a handful of entertainment objects. There are some board games on shelves in the corner. There\u2019s a foosball table near the center, and a television on the wall that is currently showing a music video.\n\n\n\nHowever, each of these amenities is carefully controlled. All furniture is nailed to the floor or affixed firmly to the wall. There\u2019s nothing in the room that can be thrown or used as a weapon, and nothing that could allow prisoners to communicate with the outside world.\n\n\n\nAdd to that the heavy metal door, the armed guards, and the fact that any escaping humanoid would have an entire facility to navigate before they got out, and this room is quite secure.\n\n\n\nStill, for members of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, to be allowed in here is an enormous privilege, one the Foundation is granting only on an extremely probative basis.\n\n\n\nLight neglected to mention that part of the deal. The Foundation is allowing us in here in exchange for the information I gave, but if any of us piss off the Jailors, we\u2019ll all be yanked back into solitary confinement.\n\n\n\nThat means I can\u2019t fuck up. I can\u2019t do anything that would prompt the Jailors to take this away from my comrades. Even though I know that\u2019s exactly what the Jailors want me to think, I still can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s my fault Sean and the others got captured. I can\u2019t do anything that would make their captivity worse.\n\n\n\nThere are around two dozen humanoids in medium security. Most of them are strangers, but my eyes snap right to the ones who are familiar.\n\n\n\nThere, sitting in a corner, already talking to each other, are Jack, Mike, and Sean. They turn to look at me as I enter the room.\n\n\n\nI look back at them. They wear the same bluish uniforms all imprisoned anomalies wear, but I don\u2019t see any wounds or scars. Their mood is somber, but they don\u2019t seem broken.\n\n\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the clusterfuck I dragged them into, they\u2019re doing a lot better than they could be.\n\n\n\nThat should make me feel better, but it doesn\u2019t. If it weren\u2019t for me, they\u2019d still be free. They gave up their freedom for me, for my mission, a mission that was doomed from the start.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the guards undo my cuffs, I run up to them. I hug all three of them in turn, tears trickling to the floor beneath me. Words I\u2019ve wanted to say for months come spilling out of me like water from a burst pipe. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I pulled you into all this.\u201d\n\n\n\nSean shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not my fault just to make me feel better. You got captured trying to rescue my brother. If I hadn\u2019t made you guys help me, you\u2019d still be free.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c//I// inducted //you// into the Serpent\u2019s Hand,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe knew the risks and chose to take them. Resistance is dangerous. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the Jailors\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nI shake my head. \u201cNo. You wouldn\u2019t have come to this place if it weren\u2019t for me, and it all turned out to be for nothing. Evan was\u2026\u201d I look up at him. I see no confusion, only concern. He knows. Of course he does. Jack and Mike saw Evan betray me. It was probably the first thing they told him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing an MTF uniform. He was eating with them. I was so stupid to trust him.\u201d An edge of anger creeps into my voice. Anger at Evan, for betraying me, and anger at myself, for falling for it.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of us knew it was a possibility,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was wearing a uniform!\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t make a mistake, but a lot of people probably would have done the same thing. Besides, at least your brother hasn\u2019t been suffering this whole time. He\u2019s probably better off in that task force than in a cell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened is worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s an enemy, now. He betrayed me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sean admits. He looks at me for a moment and seems to think better of continuing to speak, as if afraid his opinion on the issue would offend me.\n\n\n\nI take a moment to contemplate what he\u2019s suggesting, that Evan rotting miserable in a cell for six years would have been worse than what happened.\n\n\n\nI spent six years having nightmares about my brother rotting alone in a cell. The entire time he was gone, I had no idea how he was being treated. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was still alive.\n\n\n\nOnce I entered the Library and learned about the Foundation, the fearful unknown was replaced with a vivid image of Evan being treated the way Sean was treated as a teenager, the way most humanoid anomalies are treated by the Foundation. Do I really wish I\u2019d found Evan like that?\n\n\n\nI have to, don\u2019t I? Not because I want him to suffer, but because, if he\u2019d been a prisoner, he would have followed me to the Wanderer\u2019s Library. I\u2019d have brought him into the Hand, and my parents would\u2019ve finally learned that their son was still alive.\n\n\n\nA new image flashes in my head. Somewhere, right now, my mom is in tears, believing that she outlived both of her sons. The Jailors surely faked my death just as they did Evan\u2019s, so now my parents think they\u2019ve lost both their children.\n\n\n\nEvan knew they\u2019d do that when he helped the Jailors capture me. Whatever misery she\u2019s suffering now, it\u2019s his fault.\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you been okay since we last saw you?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\nOf course not. No one in containment is okay.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to worry about each other,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere\u2019s no helping that.\u201d\n\n\n\nI close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell them what I\u2019ve been doing. I don\u2019t want to tell them that I\u2019ve also been helping the Jailors. Even though they trained me not to. Even though they spent months teaching me to shut down and give our enemies nothing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t lie to them, though. I can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t failed them. That would be yet another betrayal.\n\n\n\nTears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping them, too,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asks. There it is. The anger I deserve. It\u2019s almost comforting, knowing that, at least after this, I won\u2019t be able to disappoint them any further.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been letting them use my powers,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve been putting people in front of me, civilians, victims of mind-control, and I\u2019ve been curing them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Sean asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, and the tidbit of information I used to get the four of us in here. It was about the Fifth Church. I don\u2019t think they could use it against the Hand. Still\u2026 I failed you. You trained me to ignore them, to force my mind out of my body and give them nothing. Instead, I\u2019ve been letting them manipulate and bargain with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey put a victim in front of me, someone who\u2019d been cursed. I tried to do the fire thing. I tried to summon a vivid image to my mind and ignore them like you trained me to, but I only held out for a few minutes before I gave in and cured them of the spell that was torturing them.\u201d\n\n\n\nI expect anger. Judgement. Disappointment. Failing that, I expect some sugarcoating attempt to cheer me up. The last thing I expect is the genuine relief that passes across their faces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was a horrible thing for them to do,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not holding out,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that they can use me to cure people, my brother is free to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but given that he\u2019s a loyal Jailor, it\u2019s probably bad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Sean says, \u201cI hate them too, but, if I had your powers, and if they locked me in a room with someone like that, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. It might\u2019ve even been the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nI look up at him. Is he serious? Could he really have just said that? \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m helping them,\u201d I say. \u201cHow could that be the right thing to do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you doing anything that helps them hurt anyone?\u201d Jack asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot directly,\u201d I admit, after a moment, \u201cbut what I\u2019m doing used to be my brother\u2019s primary job. Now that I\u2019m doing it, he\u2019s free to go do Jailor things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d refused to treat those people,\u201d Mike asks, \u201cwould the Jailors have used Evan to cure them, or would he be off doing whatever he\u2019s doing, leaving them untreated?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt takes me a moment to process the significance of this question. \u201cThe latter,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Evan said.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I think you made the right choice,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThose people don\u2019t deserve to languish in a containment cell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least you got the Jailors to let someone go,\u201d Jack adds.\n\n\n\nI stare up at them.\n\n\n\nThe argument they just made, Evan also made it when he tried to recruit me to the Jailors right after he captured me.\n\n\n\n//\u201cI decrease the number of people in Foundation custody. Before I came around, there were hundreds of mental anomalies whose victims had to be kept in containment for the rest of their lives. I\u2019ve cured thousands of people like that, allowing them to be sent back to their families. I\u2019ve freed more people from Foundation containment than the Serpent\u2019s Hand ever will.\u201d//\n\n\n\nAm I really hearing the same argument from Sean?\n\n\n\nI try to keep my shock off my face, but, clearly, I\u2019m failing.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Jack says, \u201call we\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re being forced to make hard choices in here. Try to cut yourself some slack, okay? You\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe best I can?\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 actually think that?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Sean says. The others nod in agreement.\n\n\n\nCould it be that they\u2019re just saying this to cheer me up?\n\n\n\nNo. They wouldn\u2019t lie to me like that. They wouldn\u2019t treat me like a child. If they\u2019re saying my decision is understandable, perhaps even //defensible//, that\u2019s what they honestly believe.\n\n\n\nI want to argue back, to explain why they should be disappointed in me, but I can\u2019t find the words, and after I spend close to a minute trying and trying to think of something to say, I once again cave to temptation, and change the subject. \u201cHow have you guys been?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ve been worse off than me.\n\n\n\nSean was moved to Site-17 almost immediately after his capture, and he\u2019s been in high security containment ever since. All three of them have suffered the same mind-numbing isolation, only they haven\u2019t had interactions with Evan, Dr. Light, my patients, or any other scrap of human contact. They\u2019ve been completely alone for months.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer like that for my failure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou got us out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to you we\u2019re in here. We can never thank you enough for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was the least I could do, after getting you stuck here,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe embarked on this mission together. We got captured together. We got in here together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d still be out if it weren\u2019t for me,\u201d I repeat.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been on your mission, we would\u2019ve been on another,\u201d Sean says. \u201cIt could have gone South, just like this one did. If that had happened, we probably never would have escaped solitary.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy eyes are moist. I shake my head, but, once again, I\u2019m not able to formulate an argument. I did get them out of high security containment, and taking Light\u2019s deal was the only way I could\u2019ve done that. In almost any other situation, that would\u2019ve been impossible.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d I say. \u201cI had to help you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We embarked on this mission together, we failed together, and we\u2019re still together now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe others seem to agree with that, and I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with them.\n\n\n\nThe heavy conversation dies down after that, and we set about just spending time together. We spend some time on the foosball table, and another chunk of time watching TV.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another music video on, by the pop star Jimmy Pheonix. He\u2019s a young singer, around Evan\u2019s age. He exploded onto the scene about half a decade ago and has become one of the most popular musicians in the world.\n\n\n\nHis style could be best described as aggressively inoffensive, one of those pop stars cooked up in a corporate boardroom for maximumly broad appeal. I\u2019m sure people who care deeply about music regard him as absolute trash. For example:\n\n\n\n\u201cGods, do they have to play this?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cEh, I think it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\nThe other two turn to look at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mike says, looking away. \u201cYou can like whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably an actual reason they\u2019re playing this,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why they\u2019d actively want to rot our brains with something mindless.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the four chords.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of his songs use the four chords,\u201d Jack says. \u201cDo you even know which chords the \u2018four chords of pop music\u2019 are?\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter half a minute of embarrassing silence, Mike admits he does not.\n\n\n\nSocialization goes on for two hours. When it\u2019s over, me and my comrades are allowed to exchange goodbyes, then we\u2019re sent back to our cells.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re all still prisoners. They\u2019re still suffering immensely for my failure, but at least I\u2019m lightening their burden. At least they\u2019re with friends, some of the time.\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s pathetic that the bar has sunk so low, but this is the best day I\u2019ve had in months. I can only hope it was for them, too. That\u2019s the least I owe them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Evan**\n\n\n\nCallum tilts his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he admits, \u201cyou have me curious. What\u2019s this epiphany you\u2019ve had?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know who Veronica Hall is?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe magician?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Fifthist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs she? I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s probably a lie, but it\u2019s not an important one right now, so Evan doesn\u2019t allow himself to get distracted by it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI talked to her yesterday,\u201d Evan says. \u201cShe said some very interesting things. She knew about the Galaxy Plaza ritual, and she seemed to think of //you// as the one primarily responsible for its failure.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum raises a brow. \u201cDid she? I will admit that\u2019s a bit interesting. I suppose it could be seen as my fault. The ritual might have worked if I hadn\u2019t had it moved.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he says. For a second, he has to fight down his nerves. He\u2019s about to make a big claim. If he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to make himself look really stupid, which could permanently damage his rapport with Callum.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong, though. His theory makes sense. It explains everything. It explains what all of this has to do with Cassidy Redwood. It explains why Callum chose to meddle with such an important ritual, when he could have easily taken revenge on Evan in another way. It explains how Callum could have been foolish enough to think that a ritual designed to require thousands of sacrifices would still work with only a few dozen.\n\n\n\nOr, rather, it explains that he was never that foolish.\n\n\n\nEvan looks Callum right in the eye. \u201cI think you got the ritual moved to Galaxy Plaza knowing that would cause it to fail,\u201d Evan says. \u201cI think you wanted it to fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Callum is frozen. He\u2019s clearly surprised. But is it the correctness of the claim that has him shocked, or its absurdity?\n\n\n\nThe smile that slowly creeps across Callum\u2019s face does little to resolve this ambiguity. \u201cOh?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHall said something very interesting to me yesterday. //\u2018I told them that what didn\u2019t work for Redwood wouldn\u2019t work for us.\u2019// She meant Cassidy Redwood, the Ortothan who tried and failed to resurrect her god with a blood sacrifice. Redwood left behind extensive notes detailing how she tried to reduce the number of sacrifices her ritual required.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted that you approached your father and asked him to move the ritual to Galaxy Plaza. I always took it for granted that you had enough pull with him to get him to say yes, but that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it? This ritual was the most important thing the church had ever attempted. There\u2019s no way your father would allow its effectiveness to be jeopardized just so you could get revenge against me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it was moved,\u201d Callum observes. \u201cClearly I //did// manage to convince the Church to move it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd in order to do that, you had to pair your proposal with an argument that the ritual would still work. You had to provide some kind of explanation, grounded in thaumaturgic theory, for why such a tiny number of sacrifices would still be enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the giant machine Cassidy Redwood built? There was nothing like that at the Galaxy Plaza.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you altered the details of the plan. You didn\u2019t need to use every trick she did. You just borrowed enough ideas to create a somewhat convincing case that the ritual could be completed with fewer sacrifices. You didn\u2019t even need to admit you got the idea from Redwood. Maybe Hall just made that connection later. Either way, you must have told them something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd how do you know I was lying?\u201d Callum asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I have honestly believed the ritual would work with fewer sacrifices?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. You know magical theory too well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a Fifthist. The same people who tried to take a bus to another solar system, remember?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d been interacting with me for months. Fifthism\u2019s grip on your mind had weakened.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes one more second to push down his nerves. It\u2019s time for the killing blow.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think that weakened grip //just// made you too smart to think the ritual would still work. I think it made you want it to fail. I think, after months of being friends with me, my voice eroding the Starfish\u2019s influence on you, a tiny bit of your conscience showed itself, just enough that you didn\u2019t want to end the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum stares up at Evan for several seconds. Slowly, as if out to milk the tension in the room for as long as he can, he closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cTsk, tsk, Evan. For a second, I really thought you had it all figured out, but then you had to start blabbering about my conscience.\u201d He pauses for a moment, then looks Evan right in the eye. \u201cMy choice to sabotage the ritual had nothing to do with morality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen what did it have to do with?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI realized that I liked the world the way it was.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that different?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it had less than nothing to do with other people\u2019s wellbeing. Before you had me captured, I had money, power, and magic, and I was in a position to lord those things over the masses who lacked them. Most people didn\u2019t even know magic existed. None of them had any way of protecting themselves against my spells. I could do whatever I wanted. I could make them do whatever I wanted.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat makes Evan grimace. Jerry said something similar, a while back, that the Veil helps the world\u2019s monsters by ensuring ordinary people don\u2019t know how to defend themselves against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the appeal of it,\u201d Callum continues. \u201cIn a clueless world, there was nothing stopping me from taking anything I wanted. I wanted a tome of arcane lore? I made someone sell it to me for a pittance. I wanted the hottest girl I knew to date me? She did. Everything I wanted, I got. I had power, and other people didn\u2019t. Do you know enough about Fifthist doctrine to know what\u2019s supposed to happen once the Fifth Church finally wins?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe world turns into a hellscape based on the Starfish\u2019s warped imagination.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd with that newfound power, the Starfish destroys the barrier between desire and reality. All desires become real. //All// desires. Everyone would be able to bend reality to their whim, and if they decided they wanted to bend me, they\u2019d be just as likely to succeed as they\u2019d be to fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum shakes his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy would a wolf want the helpless sheep he fed on to become wolves as well? My family\u2019s money wouldn\u2019t matter. My magic wouldn\u2019t be anything special. Everyone on earth would become my peer, and I don\u2019t want peers. I want the kind of power that can only exist in an ordered world.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan stares at Callum. Somehow, even though Evan\u2019s initial guess was mostly right, Callum still managed to surprise and disappoint him.\n\n\n\nMaybe Evan should have known better. He wants so badly to believe his high-school best friend is buried somewhere deep inside Callum, but maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe that person was only ever a mask, and the real Callum could only have sick, selfish reasons to do anything, even save the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was right about the rest of it, though?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight enough that I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Callum admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I said I moved the ritual to Galaxy Plaza because I wanted revenge against you. I really did hate you for taking so much power away from me. At the same time, with the help of your magic voice, I\u2019d come to recognize that the Church\u2019s ultimate victory would, in its own way, do the same, so I hatched a plan to take care of both problems at once.\n\n\n\n\u201cI got my hands on Cassidy Redwood\u2019s notes. I drafted a similar proposal for our ritual and presented it to my father. I argued that the smaller number of sacrifices would attract less attention. Bullshit, of course. I knew a few dozen sacrifices could never be enough. I knew that the only thing my new ritual would succeed at doing was luring you into danger. I told you something would happen, knowing you\u2019d show up and try to save everyone. I thought you\u2019d run in and get yourself killed, and once you did, everything would be back to the way it was before I met you, with me ruling as crown prince over a town of magicless simpletons.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere it is, then. After six years, the full truth about the Galaxy Plaza disaster, with no loose ends or lingering questions.\n\n\n\nAs cathartic as it is to see it all laid out, Evan needs more than that to save the world again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Church were going to try the same ritual again,\u201d Evan says, \u201cwhat kind of venue would they need?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t insult my intelligence by pretending you\u2019re talking about a hypothetical. You\u2019re here because something happened. Just come out and tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan sighs. On paper, he isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose the situation to Callum. However, Callum\u2019s talking right now because Evan earned a bit of his respect by figuring out what he did six years ago. For Callum to continue talking, Evan needs to keep that respect.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. I admit it. They\u2019re trying again. What kind of venue do they need?\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful to hear. I hope they succeed. I certainly won\u2019t be telling you anything that would help you stop them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe just established that you don\u2019t want the world to end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI //didn\u2019t// want it to end six years ago. My circumstances have changed since then. I no longer have money, power, or freedom. I\u2019m not in a position to lord my magic over anyone. Compared to my life in here, maybe the Fifth Church\u2019s new world would be an upgrade?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir new world would be hell for anyone sane.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of it; there wouldn\u2019t be anyone sane.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan shakes his head. \u201cI would still be sane, as would anyone I chose to interact with.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you think I //don\u2019t// want you to experience eternal torment?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot if I can drag you down with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat finally wipes the smile off Callum\u2019s face.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Evan says, \u201cif the Fifth Church does remake the world, and it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t tell me how to stop it, I will make //sure// you\u2019re perfectly sane until the end of time. I will find you, and I will force you to endure every second of our new eternity just as agonizingly lucid as me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a moment of trepidation, Callum shakes his head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t capable of that kind of vindictiveness. If the world is already beyond saving, you won\u2019t torture me just out of spite.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn most situations, you\u2019d be right,\u201d Evan admits, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting something. Jerry has my powers. He\u2019d also be sane, trapped in an insane world of eternal torment.\u201d Evan looks Callum in the eye. \u201cI swear to you, if that happens to my little brother, and it\u2019s your fault, I will //happily// dedicate the rest of my existence to punishing you.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum meets his gaze for a moment. His smugness falters.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Callum says, through gritted teeth.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow does the ritual work, and how would we stop it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe //Starlight Saga// books have a memetic agent inside of them, similar to the one we put in //Star Signals//,\u201d Callum says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We tested them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou tested whether the books have any effect on your stupid D-Class. Your tests came back negative because the meme doesn\u2019t do anything after it\u2019s first implanted. It just lingers there, waiting to be activated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cActivated?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the ritual is for. It\u2019s all part of a deal we made with an extra-universal entity. A tiny piece of that being\u2019s essence is implanted in everyone who reads those books.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Evan asks. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s read //the Starlight Saga//?\u201d\n\n\n\nWith that, Callum\u2019s smugness returns. \u201cEvery last one. As we speak, our trigger waits, latent, in tens of millions of readers all over the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes a step backwards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce we give the entity the sacrifice we owe it,\u201d Callum continues, \u201cit\u2019ll activate the trigger. All those minds will be ours, and they\u2019ll start remaking the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nTens of millions. Tens of millions of people. The implications are so heavy that it\u2019s hard to stay standing. \u201cTens of millions would start to develop Ojai syndrome?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t \u2018start to\u2019 develop it. They\u2019d become fully affected, instantly, just as if they\u2019d read //Star Signals// cover to cover.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInstantly\u2026\u201d Evan doesn\u2019t want to show Callum\u2019s weakness, but he can\u2019t keep the horror off his face. For that many people to fall fully under the control of the Fifth Church would be the greatest disaster in human history, anomalous or otherwise.\n\n\n\nCallum\u2019s delight is no less obvious than Evan\u2019s fear. \u201cThe problem with //Star Signals// is that it was too slow. We\u2019d barely started to spread the book when you identified it as a threat and started shutting us down, so the Church created a new memetic agent which would activate all at once, after it was already widespread. Once those millions of minds are under the Church\u2019s control, they\u2019ll begin the same ritual the //Star Signals// readers started, and, about two weeks later, the world will be remade.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes a deep breath. Focus. He can\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed. He needs to keep his head in the game. His job is to save the world. That\u2019s all that matters.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can we figure out when and where the sacrifice will take place?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I interfered, the Church was going to do it at some massive nerd convention in California.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy there?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people we sacrifice have to be affected by the memetic agent. Part of the deal. Something about the entity getting to keep their souls. If the Church is planning to try again, they\u2019ll pick somewhere where thousands of //Starlight Saga// readers have gathered.\u201d\n\n\n\nBack at the height of those books\u2019 popularity, any large gathering of sci-fi fans would be full of people who\u2019ve read them. Six years later\u2026 honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be that different. There\u2019d be thousands of events that could potentially qualify, and even if the Foundation identified and stopped one, all that would do is buy a bit of time. So long as that seed is prevalent, the Church can try again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs there any way of purging that memetic seed from people?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\nCallum shrugs. \u201cYou might be able to do it. You\u2019re pretty good at cleaning magic gunk out of people\u2019s brains. Still, given how many people there are to cure, and given that you have no way of identifying them, I don\u2019t like your odds.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan doesn\u2019t like the Foundation\u2019s odds, either.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s people need to have a very, very long talk about this information, and that talk needs to begin as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all my questions for now,\u201d Evan says. \u201cThank you. What you just said might save the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? Threatening to torture someone for all eternity is a good way to get their secrets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cStill, you\u2019ve done a good thing today. Maybe there\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEvan, it\u2019s been five minutes since we went over this. You haven\u2019t dug up some faint echo of my better nature. I don\u2019t have a better nature. I said what I said because you threatened me. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Evan says. \u201cGoodbye, then. Me or another Foundation agent may be back with more questions later. Be candid with them, or else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. Goodbye, and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost enough to goad Evan into taking the last word, but that\u2019d be as much of a victory for Callum as anything. Evan leaves.\n\n\n\nLight is waiting outside. \u201cGood work,\u201d she says, though there isn\u2019t any cheer in her voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Evan says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m arranging an emergency meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\n\nLight\u2019s gaze lingers on him for a moment. He meets it. He does his best to force the worry off of his face.\n\n\n\nShe can probably still see it. After, he can tell she\u2019s doing the same. The truth is, unless everything Callum just said is completely wrong, this is the gravest situation Evan has ever faced. Unless the Foundation does something very clever, very quickly, tens of millions of minds are going to be brought under the Fifth Church\u2019s control.\n\n\n\nOnce that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s hard to imagine how even the Foundation could save the world.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[[i-didn-t-forget-hub|Series Hub]]]**\n\n\n\n[[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster|\u25c0\u25c0 First Entry]]] | [[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall|\u25c0 Previous Entry]]] | [[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent|Next Entry \u25b6]]]\n\n\n\n,,[[[xhawk77x|More by this Author]]],,\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["i-didn-t-forget-hub", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent", "xhawk77x", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "doctor-light", "fifthist", "first-person", "last-hope", "mystery", "ressurection", "serpents-hand", "tale"], "title": "I Didn't Forget Pt 18: Callum Michaels - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-didn-t-forget-pt-18-callum-michaels", "year": 2026}, "likeitsthefirsttime": {"created_at": "2026-01-04T12:26:00", "creator": "AstersQuill", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T12:26:00"}, {"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, bleak, director-scout, lgbtq, on-guard-43, tale, thilo-zwist.

Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was approximately 5:03am when Wynn Rydderech opened his eyes, as he always did around this time. He was slow on the rise, as he thought he ought to be at this age, his body giving him only as much trouble as he thought it should.</p>\n<p>He waddled awkwardly across the carpeted floor towards the bathroom, imaging how cold the tile threshold might feel, and found that the act of cleaning himself had passed in a blink\u2014 the act of undressing, lathering, rinsing, and dressing was almost as fluid and unmistakably uniform as the water circling the drain as he stepped out of the stall. Even with this, he was still not complete. Although his mind knew what was missing, he found that his hands were much faster at weaving his tie into a Windsor, and feeding the snaking leather belt smoothly through each loop, before buckling the faded brass.</p>\n<p>For all intents and purposes, he still <em>looked</em> good, even in the folds and wrinkles, and how his hair slowly simmered from red to grey ash. He wore a smile, just noticeable, that lingered, for some reason, from before Rydderech could recall.</p>\n<p>And the room around him made this lapse known, as if every edge had muddied into oil on canvas instead of something tangible.</p>\n<p><em>Why am I so happy?</em></p>\n<p>It, of course, was no issue to be happy\u2014 Rydderech could invite all variety of emotion to the forefront if his mind had lingered on it, unconsciously or not. But this happiness carried with it a certain weight to it, not so dissimilar to the one he felt in the core of his chest. It was as if the ghost of some thing, some one, had been standing there next to him, whispering words that were meant to bring about some sort of reaction, if and only if he had the context.</p>\n<p>He allowed this ghost to hold his hand as he walked into a common area, and watched the most striking details pull forth: the stained wood paneling was host to several clusters of melty memorabilia, pinions and frames of unknown contents nailed proudly into the wall like medals on a uniform. These did little to dampen the soft crackling of electric static from the CRT, which cast a dull glow onto a worn sofa, wherein two of the cushions had faded from use. The ghost took its position as Rydderech rotated the dials, watching the sea of black and white sand slowly give way to animated figures. The speaker whined out an anachronistic concerto that bounced off the walls as sonar, revealing much of the space, and bringing his attention towards a slightly ajar door.</p>\n<p>He followed the ghost as it took its leave from the couch. Passing through the vestibule, he regarded the pair of a pair of polished, leather shoes, one size notably smaller than the other, and brushed his shoulder against a matching hat and jacket that might only reach to his forearms.</p>\n<p>And yet, this smaller figure, who might have been the owner, was nowhere to be found. It certainly wasn't his; Rydderech had grown quite content with himself as his body slowed (as he thought it should), and regarded his shortening sleeves and waist with an almost jolly mien. No, the size alone of these garments wasn't the issue, but the fact that he believed they should be there for a reason that was presently escaping him.</p>\n<p>The ghost paid his confusion no mind, and slowed its pace considerably as it moved to a door left slightly ajar. With a thief-like motion, it slipped into the room, disappearing into the space only illuminated by a thin slit of light, revealing the unmistakable mound of a body beneath a quilt. Rydderech was careful as he stepped in, though he was much too large, and stepped too loudly to match the ghost's maneuvers. But the quilted figure did not react. His eyes adjusted to the fuzzy darkness with a blink, and as still-faded tchotchkes made themselves known to him, he felt his smile begin to grow. He almost cursed himself as he sat on the edge of the bed; of course he knew the other person sharing this home with him. Of course he knew the person who slept in another bed as to not be awoken at approximately 5:00am (the time Rydderech always knew himself to wake up at). And, of course, as he carefully leaned towards the head on the pillow, reaching his hand out, that this person was his <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">wife</span>.</p>\n<p>Rydderech's vision pulsed, and he flinched. The once blonde and flowing hair of his <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">wife</span>, that fractaled out from <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">her</span> head was instead replaced with short and grey bristles of a man that was more than familiar to him. As calm and as collected as he could muster, Rydderech rose and slowly backed away from the bed, watching the room around him dissolve. He knew now what was missing, a pit in his chest as something that should have been there, and, for as long as he could remember, had been there, dissipated into static. His hands trembled as he collected his jacket and hat, and as he shut the door behind him, and greeted the monotonous industrial labyrinth before him, he had only one thought in his mind:</p>\n<p><em>Where had Vivian Scout gone?</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span>1908</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>1 February</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/acroamatic-abatement\">Cardiff University</a>: Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Do you think I frightened him off?\" Ryderrech grinned, removing a concertina of worn notebooks from a briefcase. He could hear a chuckle from Vivian Scout, who was working to settle in across the room from him.</p>\n<p>The weight of a small key was a comfortable new addition to Rydderech's pocket. Not too long ago it had belonged to another man, a scholar not unlike the pair of them, but one in the unfortunate position of being paired with Scout during room assignments. Rydderech by no means meant to torture their colleague, at least not in any cruel and unbecoming way, but he was by no means shy about making his presence in their space known.</p>\n<p>\"He must have been intimidated,\" Scout called from the otherside of a wardrobe, \"he was an anxious fellow and, well, you're\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"You think I'm intimidating?\" Rydderech raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"I think you're reminiscent of a brick wall, and your hair doesn't much help your case.\"</p>\n<p>Rydderech circled the wardrobe, and placed his hands on the edge of the desk Scout was unflinchingly focused on.</p>\n<p>\"How flattering. Of all the descriptors you've given me, I think this is the first time you've compared me to structure.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're a very charming brick wall.\" Scout placed a trio of papers filled with chicken scratch atop a jumble of manila envelopes. He turned to face his companion. \"Sturdy. Certainly, more reminiscent of a museum than a factory.\"</p>\n<p>Rydderech crossed his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Well one of us needs to be 'sturdy' enough to lean on, especially since you have a penchant for falling.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"That certainly hasn't been the only time you've fallen for me.\"</p>\n<p>Scout exhaled and shook his head, and stepped forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his companion. He leaned into him, and from the corner of his eye, Rydderech could see he was smiling.</p>\n<p>The pair stood for a moment in silence, sharing an unspoken appreciation for the mess of what could be considered a science lab and abode. Though there was much more work to be done, and though a proper sorting system of their dreams had yet to be established, they had each other, and for the moment, that was enough.</p>\n<p>Rydderech yawned, more akin to a growl, and stretched his sore arms out. The winter sunlight had long since left the pair, and despite the chill, the flicker of lamp lights in the distance was almost reminiscent of fireflies lazily flickering as they hovered. The room was warm, bright, and as long as the pair didn't cause too much trouble (there would always be <em>some</em> amount of trouble to cause), it was home.</p>\n<p>\"Tired?\" Scout queried with a smirk. \"The first day of our collaboration and you're already falling asleep on me?\"</p>\n<p>\"The first day of our collaboration and <em>I</em> moved all the furniture around.\" Rydderech massaged his bicep, kneading the muscle with his thumb. \"Hopefully our beds should be sufficiently far enough away in the event of any accidental spills.\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed, but I do not intend to chance that, at least not tonight.\"</p>\n<p>\"So tomorrow then. Unless you plan on burning the midnight oil.\"</p>\n<p>Scout placed a hand on Rydderech's shoulder. \"Tomorrow indeed.\"</p>\n<p>The pair began to prepare for bed, clumsily dancing through the space, almost careful enough to not bump into the wall, or a stack of books, or each other. Almost. After sufficiently littering the floor with books, and Scout \"accidentally\" being tapped into a wall, the pair stood side-by-side, looking at their bed. <em>Their</em> bed. One of two in the room, though the only one not currently covered in trousers and undershirts.</p>\n<p>\"I can\u2026 sleep in mine, if that would be more comfortable for you\u2014 or the floor. I don't require much.\" Rydderech scratched the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, what I want the most is for you to make a nest in my laundry.\" Scout chuckled and offered a hand to Rydderech. Hand-in-hand, the pair sat on the edge of the bed. \"I will take the outside tonight, and tomorrow night we can switch. Fair?\"</p>\n<p>\"And what of the monsters beneath the bed?\" Rydderech smirked. \"What if I wake up and you're gone?\"</p>\n<p>Scout rolled his eyes and, in an exaggerated manner, panned his head as he looked beneath the bed.</p>\n<p>\"Happy?\"</p>\n<p>\"I would prefer if you checked again.\"</p>\n<p>Scout lightly pushed Rydderech, who laid down and shuffled and scooted to leave as much room as possible for his partner. In a blink, the room was enveloped in darkness, stealing sight, and confusing his other senses. He closed his eyes and tasted a hint of kerosene as he took a deep breath in. Behind him he felt arms try to awkwardly wrap around him, the weight of another person on his back. And he heard, in loving whisper, a promise.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to keep you safe, Wynn. I'm not going to let anything happen to you.\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc5\"><span>1997</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc6\"><span>3 April</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520\">Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>There was a time when Rydderech had regarded the vast expanse of concrete and metal scaffolding and colorful, impossibly extending piping with awe. After all, this was <em>his</em> magnum opus; he had imagined every centimeter, every possible consideration, iterated and reiterated until he could no longer conceive of any holes in his plans. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Had a younger version of him known what he would inherit, what facility he would create, and what work he would be able to do, the current Rydderech would have never been able to stop him, even if he knew the cost. Any other answer would mean that it would not be Wynn Rydderech answering; a Wynn Rydderech not willing to pay the cost wouldn't be Wynn Rydderech at all.</p>\n<p>Both thankfully and not, Rydderech was not here alone, though he alone was here by choice, and would suffer under what that meant. He knew all 43 members of his cohort, in name and story. On some days he would greet them as he roamed through his facility. On some days, he thought they might greet him back. On others, he preferred they pay him no mind. The ambiance of their chatter could take all forms: whispering gossip, boisterous laughter, love and anger. It was through these interactions that Rydderech still believed himself human, for what more were these simulacra than manifestations of his own psyche, manifestations of what it meant to work with other people. The moment these exchanges would no longer be the case was the day he knew he would have to hang up the conceptualization of himself as 'human', but today was not yet that day.</p>\n<p>But Rydderech <em>was</em> hung up on the fact that, unlike the labyrinthine expanse above him, this was his labyrinthine expanse alone, his empire of dirt. At least what would become of Site-43 was built with care and intention. Care that comprised much of the considerations of another man, a man who walked like a ghost next to Rydderech now, who stood so diligently and worrying on guard <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">somewhere else.</span></p>\n<p>Rydderech shivered at the thought; he knew he was being watched down here, he <em>hated</em> the feeling of being watched. He sometimes imagined those above him tracing his every move, the rehearsed monotony of his self-imposed station, a dancing figurine in a show. They were infinitely patient with him, because of course they were, and continued to engage regardless of the role Rydderech had chosen to play that day.</p>\n<p>And what did he provide in return? His usefulness, of course. They would only be willing to extend the amount of grace and resources possible for him to hold onto at least some semblance of a thread of sanity if he had proven himself useful, or at the very least entertaining. In truth, any one of his projects or experiments or bored delusions might lead to the plug being pulled, leaving him alone, as an actor on a dimmed stage, long after anyone could recall what show was being played at all.</p>\n<p>Rydderech chafed at the thought, and how powerless he felt each and every time it was his turn to take the stage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc7\"><span>1911</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc8\"><span>20 October</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #990011\">Vienna</span>: Austria, Austro-Hungarian Empire</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Arm-in-arm, Rydderech carefully led his date out the front of the opera house, stopping just for a moment to take a deep breath of the cold night's air. Outwardly, he and his date were entirely indistinguishable from the patrons filing out; men in tuxedos and polished shoes, women in flowing dresses with fur and pearl and lace. It reminded Rydderech of what a procession of zoo animals might look like, entirely gaudy, a show in itself.</p>\n<p>This wasn't the first time Rydderech had seen such a show, or the opera within. Truthfully, if his talent had been in singing rather than toxicology, he might have been able to don tights and long-out-of-style hats to belt the notes out himself. But he was not here for the show\u2014 it was merely a formality. His date acted with all the poise and elegance a woman should, and he was to respond in kind, with the professional air about him, that projected outwardly to the world that this was a fine and <em>normal</em> partnership for the times. This, too, was merely a formality; there was very little in this world that brought about more suffering than formalities.</p>\n<p>But like most formalities, the pressure to conform to them was ever-present; many, including his own family, were beginning to wonder why the scholar was without a wife. Offhanded excuses were enough to keep the gossip away temporarily\u2014 scheduling issues, the risk of dying (or worse) within his field, possible contamination\u2014 these were largely understood. He wanted to state that he was simply unlucky when it came to love, but that cut both ways; Rydderech <em>was</em> unlucky, but not because he lacked the charisma or looks (because he certainly had both), but because the person he loved was an ocean and continent away.</p>\n<p>During particularly troubling times, when nothing seemed to be going right, Rydderech could at least rely on the familiar typing of his scholarly companion to bring him some comfort, or at least as much comfort could be found in the anomalous abstract the pair were mired in. Within Rydderech, however, there was a doubt. A doubt that one day the letters might cease, that some awful fate might befall his Vivian Scout, or worst of all, the understanding that what they had was merely a passing of seasons.</p>\n<p>He felt a soft tap on his shoulder, and understood that he had been lost in thought along the avenues, missing his apartment by around two blocks, thinking, wishing that someone else was here instead. Rydderech gave her a smile and a nod, before crossing the street, once more on the correct path.</p>\n<p>She was, to put it plainly, pleasant. She was quick-witted, knowledgeable on all manner of topics, but also loved to keep to herself. She was, in an objective sense, attractive, and in another life, Rydderech might have been attracted <em>to</em> her. But very simply, he wasn't, and that she could understand as well. However, this arrangement worked because both parties knew only to ask the questions necessary for their relationship to survive. They spoke often, ate together, and were outwardly the model of a healthy couple. He had met her family, and even helped one of her brothers out while in a particular jam with the university. But secrecy was baked in the moment conversations turned to one of work, and that vulnerability, or lack thereof, carried itself through all aspects of their relationship.</p>\n<p>In another life, she might have been perfect for someone not named Wynn Rydderech. In this one, she sufficed, though the thought was laden with its own level of guilt in the few moments Rydderech had to interrogate what that meant.</p>\n\n<p>Rydderech imagined Vivian Scout standing just in the background of the mirror, grinning and ready to engage Wynn in a bout of friendly banter.</p>\n<p>Vivian often helped him prepare for events, in his own way. The recognition of a missed detail was often delivered with joke or snark, and the pair would work to resolve the detail at the same level of conversation. After a particularly dry formal event season brought about by renovations, Vivian very bluntly suggested that Wynn purchase a new suit because the strain on the fabric of his old reliable was \"presently attempting to escape him.\"</p>\n<p>Yet strangely he worried very little about such matters now. Outside of the occasional tear or fade, wrinkles and creases were easily smoothed out with simply the brush of his hand, though that failed to translate to much else.</p>\n<p>Rydderech summed it up to fatigue, however. A simple trick of tired eyes to make him seem more put together than he was. He changed into something much more comfortable, and regarded the stack of papers on his desk next to a typewriter nesting a half-written response. There was much to discuss, and Rydderech let the snapping of keys, and the flowing story of his work, his life, and what could be shown of his love, carry him to sleep.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc9\"><span>1964</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc10\"><span>31 March</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Provisional Site-43</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Dominion of Canada</strong></span><br/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Once more Wynn Rydderech found himself crouched over a typewriter deep into the night, trying to trade the ever-decreasing store of time for one final explanation of what was becoming of him.</p>\n<p>Scout would have been long asleep by now. He was worn down by the day-to-day minutiae of what it meant to run such a burgeoning facility, but even then, even though he too had mingled with the weird most his life, Scout's age had certainly kept up with him. Much unlike Rydderech.</p>\n<p>These sorts of fadings were never fast, they <em>never</em> are. They move along vast stretches like ants, erode away great mountains like rain drops off leaves, and by the end, everyone finds themselves looking back at all they thought they had left. If they're even able to at all.</p>\n<p>Rydderech, unknowingly, and for a while unnoticingly, was the point of equilibrium about which his life moved. For every stone cast by the world, for every natural failure that was meant to give way, for even as he looked death itself in the eyes, he was unmarred. He used to be fit, healthy, tried to lead a good life, and for this he was rewarded with a rounder figure and moderately aching joints. He was lucky, and for this, his luck was destined to run out.</p>\n<p>There was a stack of missives in the bin adjacent to his desk, perfectly arranged font with red cross-outs and the faded marks of coffee or tears. Some of them were crumpled, or torn with the agony of a silent yell, some semblance of release; like if a tree fell in a forest, the final act of it all, never seen and only discovered once it was too late for anything to be done of it.</p>\n<p>Rydderech balled his fists and squeezed, before letting the tension go with an exhale. He looked at the blank document before him, and imagined all the possible variations of what it might say. What would be the most impactful? What would be best to remember him by? Would he write something long, a true testament to the lifetime and then some they'd spent both together and apart? How would one ever capture such depth.</p>\n<p>And as the words spun around in his mind, Rydderech, begrudgingly, noticed that someone <em>else</em> had come to mind: Thilo Zwist.</p>\n<p>Jealousy wasn't necessarily the best way to describe Wynn's thoughts towards the Austrian, but in this one, specific case, it might as well have been. Who else on this planet would be able to capture in words exactly what Rydderech was feeling, what he was trying to get across, but the wizard who had lived for generations. And most annoyingly, the wizard who <em>almost</em> captured as much attention in their relationship. Never more than Rydderech, not necessarily even as close, but the chase, the web of words\u2014 there was certainly something there.</p>\n<p><em>What else is there?</em></p>\n<p>And in that thought, Rydderech found his answer, and began typing.</p>\n<p>Rydderech had written crates worth of letters in his life, maybe even enough to mourn the tree and the roots that could have grown in a forest, that instead gave itself to deliver so much more than words over distance and time. In itself, each of those letters formed the mosaic of Wynn Rydderech, gave themselves to be a snapshot of the ever-changing idea of what it meant to be a person. Love and labor, trial and triumph, the extending hand that provided the temporary, reassuring comfort of another.</p>\n<p>All-in-all he knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the contents of this letter may be the last time Rydderech spoke to Vivian Scout, his partner, lover, and husband, as himself.</p>\n<p>So, he thought he might write Scout a letter of what that meant. Write him a letter of who Wynn Rydderech was, and say what Wynn Rydderech would have hoped to say a thousand times more if he had the chance.</p>\n<p>He wanted Vivian to do what he had always done, and to reaffirm every single promise they had made over the years.</p>\n<p>He needed Vivian to continue the good work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc11\"><span>1997</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc12\"><span>4 April</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520\">Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>What Rydderech thought should be his workshop took shape around him. The ground padded each and every footstep, and when he reached for papers on the nearby table (as only one appeared) he always had in his hand <em>exactly</em> what he was looking for (if he could even recognize what that was in the first place). If the man were any more dark and brooding, he would have likened it to a villain's evil lair, but it was more akin to a safety net, somewhere that someone much more outwardly affable plotted to save the world.</p>\n<p>He was doing the good work, after all. What more could be done than that?</p>\n<p>He let his mind run wild with ideas, many of which would have caught him the concerned look of ethics boards and meek assistants <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">topside</span>\u2014 he didn't doubt that was happening, of course, he knew it would be. But that was the wonder of his station now: the body, the mind, the space around him, all of them contained innumerable pieces of a cosmic toolbox. He imagined every atom, every molecule, and how the electric rhythm of the world coursed through them\u2014 he was the composer now, a thought that was both infinitely frightening and left him laughing to the end of each and every day.</p>\n<p>But in this place of great triumph, he knew his only anchor to his past life was ever-present, ever-waiting for correspondence, should he deem himself ready for it. His respite for loneliness was there in the moments he needed a connection unlike anything he could create down here. With the universe in his hand and only his imagination as the limit, Wynn Rydderech could never hope to recreate even a fraction of the love he knew existed, but was once more alienated from.</p>\n<p>The ghost floated beside him. Even it was not tangible enough to feel, nor to lift the curling corners of schematics that would revolutionize everything, if only it was possible to build them. It stopped, and shrunk itself over one such schematic that Rydderech didn't have to see to know (or rather, what it became in a sea of lined paper). After all, he had designed it himself. It was meant to be his Damocles, his deliverance from this torment, and something he both dreamed and cowered from.</p>\n<p>Vivian too knew what it meant, and what Wynn needed him to do, should the time come. He was sure Vivian would remember their promise, he knew it. The man who had always tried to keep him safe would not fail.</p>\n<p>And he knew that man was waiting for him at the other end of a printer, trying his very best to not let the worry show on his face if others were around. The Site Director had to keep his cool and level head, lest someone underestimate him, as few had learned the consequences of before.</p>\n<p>With a wave of his hand, a keyboard appeared, and his fingers began their march across the plastic as if they already knew their orders. The ghost lingered nearby, steadily watching.</p>\n<p><em>I thought I saw the sun not too long ago. Who knew the caverns down here could get so bright.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; Rydderech wouldn't be surprised if Vivian had moved the entire assembly closer to their dormitory, just to keep on top of any communications that would come through.</p>\n<p>The ghost circled Rydderech, but did not regard him.</p>\n<p><em>The panthers bring \"shiny things\" with them sometimes. Maybe it's something you might think about looking into.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; someone would tell the Site Director right away about his transmissions. Vivian would excuse himself from any meeting, even with the Overseers, should the need arise. He was simply just running late.</p>\n<p>The ghost began moving away from Rydderech, turning its back to him as it floated towards the door.</p>\n<p><em>I think I would like to see the sun again one day, Vivian, at least before mine sets.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. And waited. And waited. And what felt like seconds turned to minutes. And what felt like minutes turned to hours, then years, then weeks. And the ghost floated through the door to some other place far from a place like this one. And Wynn Rydderech was left alone.</p>\n<p><em>Vivian?</em></p>\n<p>And the screen before him slowly hummed to life. For a moment, Rydderech felt a twinge of hope in his heart, and leaned forward in his \"chair\" in anticipation. Then the electricity went out, and the space around him went dark, and he realized that it might have been better not to have read the message at all.</p>\n<div class=\"danke site\">\n<p>Dr. Rydderech, it's <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">Deputy Chief Nancy Briggs</span>.

He was slow on the rise, as he thought he ought to be at this age, his body giving him only as much trouble as he thought it should.\n\n\n\nHe waddled awkwardly across the carpeted floor towards the bathroom, imaging how cold the tile threshold might feel, and found that the act of cleaning himself had passed in a blink\u2014 the act of undressing, lathering, rinsing, and dressing was almost as fluid and unmistakably uniform as the water circling the drain as he stepped out of the stall.\u00a0\u00a0Even with this, he was still not complete. Although his mind knew what was missing, he found that his hands were much faster at weaving his tie into a Windsor, and feeding the snaking leather belt smoothly through each loop, before buckling the faded brass.\n\n\n\nFor all intents and purposes, he still //looked// good, even in the folds and wrinkles, and how his hair slowly simmered from red to grey ash. He wore a smile, just noticeable, that lingered, for some reason, from before Rydderech could recall.\n\n\n\nAnd the room around him made this lapse known, as if every edge had muddied into oil on canvas instead of something tangible.\n\n\n\n//Why am I so happy?//\n\n\n\nIt, of course, was no issue to be happy\u2014 Rydderech could invite all variety of emotion to the forefront if his mind had lingered on it, unconsciously or not. But this happiness carried with it a certain weight to it, not so dissimilar to the one he felt in the core of his chest. It was as if the ghost of some thing, some one, had been standing there next to him, whispering words that were meant to bring about some sort of reaction, if and only if he had the context.\n\n\n\nHe allowed this ghost to hold his hand as he walked into a common area, and watched the most striking details pull forth: the stained wood paneling was host to several clusters of melty memorabilia, pinions and frames of unknown contents nailed proudly into the wall like medals on a uniform. These did little to dampen the soft crackling of electric static from the CRT, which cast a dull glow onto a worn sofa, wherein two of the cushions had faded from use. The ghost took its position as Rydderech rotated the dials, watching the sea of black and white sand slowly give way to animated figures. The speaker whined out an anachronistic concerto that bounced off the walls as sonar, revealing much of the space, and bringing his attention towards a slightly ajar door.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe followed the ghost as it took its leave from the couch. Passing through the vestibule, he regarded the pair of a pair of polished, leather shoes, one size notably smaller than the other, and brushed his shoulder against a matching hat and jacket that might only reach to his forearms.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, this smaller figure, who might have been the owner, was nowhere to be found. It certainly wasn't his; Rydderech had grown quite content with himself as his body slowed (as he thought it should), and regarded his shortening sleeves and waist with an almost jolly mien. No, the size alone of these garments wasn't the issue, but the fact that he believed they should be there for a reason that was presently escaping him.\n\n\n\nThe ghost paid his confusion no mind, and slowed its pace considerably as it moved to a door left slightly ajar. With a thief-like motion, it slipped into the room, disappearing into the space only illuminated by a thin slit of light, revealing the unmistakable mound of a body beneath a quilt. Rydderech was careful as he stepped in, though he was much too large, and stepped too loudly to match the ghost's maneuvers. But the quilted figure did not react. His eyes adjusted to the fuzzy darkness with a blink, and as still-faded tchotchkes made themselves known to him, he felt his smile begin to grow. He almost cursed himself as he sat on the edge of the bed; of course he knew the other person sharing this home with him. Of course he knew the person who slept in another bed as to not be awoken at approximately 5:00am (the time Rydderech always knew himself to wake up at). And, of course, as he carefully leaned towards the head on the pillow, reaching his hand out, that this person was his [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]wife[[/span]].\n\n\n\nRydderech's vision pulsed, and he flinched. The once blonde and flowing hair of his [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]wife[[/span]], that fractaled out from [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]her[[/span]] head was instead replaced with short and grey bristles of a man that was more than familiar to him. As calm and as collected as he could muster, Rydderech rose and slowly backed away from the bed, watching the room around him dissolve. He knew now what was missing, a pit in his chest as something that should have been there, and, for as long as he could remember, had been there, dissipated into static. His hands trembled as he collected his jacket and hat, and as he shut the door behind him, and greeted the monotonous industrial labyrinth before him, he had only one thought in his mind:\n\n\n\n//Where had Vivian Scout gone?//\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1908\n\n++ 1 February\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/acroamatic-abatement Cardiff University]: Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"Do you think I frightened him off?\" Ryderrech grinned, removing a concertina of worn notebooks from a briefcase. He could hear a chuckle from Vivian Scout, who was working to settle in across the room from him.\n\n\n\nThe weight of a small key was a comfortable new addition to Rydderech's pocket. Not too long ago it had belonged to another man, a scholar not unlike the pair of them, but one in the unfortunate position of being paired with Scout during room assignments. Rydderech by no means meant to torture their colleague, at least not in any cruel and unbecoming way, but he was by no means shy about making his presence in their space known.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"He must have been intimidated,\" Scout called from the otherside of a wardrobe, \"he was an anxious fellow and, well, you're\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"You think I'm intimidating?\" Rydderech raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"I think you're reminiscent of a brick wall, and your hair doesn't much help your case.\"\n\n\n\nRydderech circled the wardrobe, and placed his hands on the edge of the desk Scout was unflinchingly focused on.\n\n\n\n\"How flattering. Of all the descriptors you've given me, I think this is the first time you've compared me to structure.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're a very charming brick wall.\" Scout placed a trio of papers filled with chicken scratch atop a jumble of manila envelopes. He turned to face his companion. \"Sturdy. Certainly, more reminiscent of a museum than a factory.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRydderech crossed his arms.\n\n\n\n\"Well one of us needs to be 'sturdy' enough to lean on, especially since you have a penchant for falling.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"\n\n\n\n\"That certainly hasn't been the only time you've fallen for me.\"\n\n\n\nScout exhaled and shook his head, and stepped forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his companion. He leaned into him, and from the corner of his eye, Rydderech could see he was smiling.\n\n\n\nThe pair stood for a moment in silence, sharing an unspoken appreciation for the mess of what could be considered a science lab and abode. Though there was much more work to be done, and though a proper sorting system of their dreams had yet to be established, they had each other, and for the moment, that was enough.\n\n\n\nRydderech yawned, more akin to a growl, and stretched his sore arms out. The winter sunlight had long since left the pair, and despite the chill, the flicker of lamp lights in the distance was almost reminiscent of fireflies lazily flickering as they hovered. The room was warm, bright, and as long as the pair didn't cause too much trouble (there would always be //some// amount of trouble to cause), it was home.\n\n\n\n\"Tired?\" Scout queried with a smirk. \"The first day of our collaboration and you're already falling asleep on me?\"\n\n\n\n\"The first day of our collaboration and //I// moved all the furniture around.\" Rydderech massaged his bicep, kneading the muscle with his thumb. \"Hopefully our beds should be sufficiently far enough away in the event of any accidental spills.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, but I do not intend to chance that, at least not tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\"So tomorrow then. Unless you plan on burning the midnight oil.\"\n\n\n\nScout placed a hand on Rydderech's shoulder. \"Tomorrow indeed.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair began to prepare for bed, clumsily dancing through the space, almost careful enough to not bump into the wall, or a stack of books, or each other. Almost. After sufficiently littering the floor with books, and Scout \"accidentally\" being tapped into a wall, the pair stood side-by-side, looking at their bed. //Their// bed. One of two in the room, though the only one not currently covered in trousers and undershirts.\n\n\n\n\"I can\u2026 sleep in mine, if that would be more comfortable for you\u2014 or the floor. I don't require much.\" Rydderech scratched the back of his neck.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, what I want the most is for you to make a nest in my laundry.\" Scout chuckled and offered a hand to Rydderech. Hand-in-hand, the pair sat on the edge of the bed. \"I will take the outside tonight, and tomorrow night we can switch. Fair?\"\n\n\n\n\"And what of the monsters beneath the bed?\" Rydderech smirked. \"What if I wake up and you're gone?\"\n\n\n\nScout rolled his eyes and, in an exaggerated manner, panned his head as he looked beneath the bed.\n\n\n\n\"Happy?\"\n\n\n\n\"I would prefer if you checked again.\"\n\n\n\nScout lightly pushed Rydderech, who laid down and shuffled and scooted to leave as much room as possible for his partner. In a blink, the room was enveloped in darkness, stealing sight, and confusing his other senses. He closed his eyes and tasted a hint of kerosene as he took a deep breath in. Behind him he felt arms try to awkwardly wrap around him, the weight of another person on his back. And he heard, in loving whisper, a promise.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to keep you safe, Wynn. I'm not going to let anything happen to you.\"\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1997\n\n++ 3 April\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThere was a time when Rydderech had regarded the vast expanse of concrete and metal scaffolding and colorful, impossibly extending piping with awe. After all, this was //his// magnum opus; he had imagined every centimeter, every possible consideration, iterated and reiterated until he could no longer conceive of any holes in his plans. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Had a younger version of him known what he would inherit, what facility he would create, and what work he would be able to do, the current Rydderech would have never been able to stop him, even if he knew the cost. Any other answer would mean that it would not be Wynn Rydderech answering; a Wynn Rydderech not willing to pay the cost wouldn't be Wynn Rydderech at all.\n\n\n\nBoth thankfully and not, Rydderech was not here alone, though he alone was here by choice, and would suffer under what that meant. He knew all 43 members of his cohort, in name and story. On some days he would greet them as he roamed through his facility. On some days, he thought they might greet him back. On others, he preferred they pay him no mind. The ambiance of their chatter could take all forms: whispering gossip, boisterous laughter, love and anger. It was through these interactions that Rydderech still believed himself human, for what more were these simulacra than manifestations of his own psyche, manifestations of what it meant to work with other people. The moment these exchanges would no longer be the case was the day he knew he would have to hang up the conceptualization of himself as 'human', but today was not yet that day.\n\n\n\nBut Rydderech //was// hung up on the fact that, unlike the labyrinthine expanse above him, this was his labyrinthine expanse alone, his empire of dirt. At least what would become of Site-43 was built with care and intention. Care that comprised much of the considerations of another man, a man who walked like a ghost next to Rydderech now, who stood so diligently and worrying on guard [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]somewhere else.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nRydderech shivered at the thought; he knew he was being watched down here, he //hated// the feeling of being watched. He sometimes imagined those above him tracing his every move, the rehearsed monotony of his self-imposed station, a dancing figurine in a show. They were infinitely patient with him, because of course they were, and continued to engage regardless of the role Rydderech had chosen to play that day.\n\n\n\nAnd what did he provide in return? His usefulness, of course. They would only be willing to extend the amount of grace and resources possible for him to hold onto at least some semblance of a thread of sanity if he had proven himself useful, or at the very least entertaining. In truth, any one of his projects or experiments or bored delusions might lead to the plug being pulled, leaving him alone, as an actor on a dimmed stage, long after anyone could recall what show was being played at all.\n\n\n\nRydderech chafed at the thought, and how powerless he felt each and every time it was his turn to take the stage.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1911\n\n++ 20 October\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**##990011|Vienna##: Austria, Austro-Hungarian Empire**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nArm-in-arm, Rydderech carefully led his date out the front of the opera house, stopping just for a moment to take a deep breath of the cold night's air. Outwardly, he and his date were entirely indistinguishable from the patrons filing out; men in tuxedos and polished shoes, women in flowing dresses with fur and pearl and lace. It reminded Rydderech of what a procession of zoo animals might look like, entirely gaudy, a show in itself.\n\n\n\nThis wasn't the first time Rydderech had seen such a show, or the opera within. Truthfully, if his talent had been in singing rather than toxicology, he might have been able to don tights and long-out-of-style hats to belt the notes out himself. But he was not here for the show\u2014 it was merely a formality. His date acted with all the poise and elegance a woman should, and he was to respond in kind, with the professional air about him, that projected outwardly to the world that this was a fine and //normal// partnership for the times. This, too, was merely a formality; there was very little in this world that brought about more suffering than formalities.\n\n\n\nBut like most formalities, the pressure to conform to them was ever-present; many, including his own family, were beginning to wonder why the scholar was without a wife. Offhanded excuses were enough to keep the gossip away temporarily\u2014 scheduling issues, the risk of dying (or worse) within his field, possible contamination\u2014 these were largely understood. He wanted to state that he was simply unlucky when it came to love, but that cut both ways; Rydderech //was// unlucky, but not because he lacked the charisma or looks (because he certainly had both), but because the person he loved was an ocean and continent away.\n\n\n\nDuring particularly troubling times, when nothing seemed to be going right, Rydderech could at least rely on the familiar typing of his scholarly companion to bring him some comfort, or at least as much comfort could be found in the anomalous abstract the pair were mired in. Within Rydderech, however, there was a doubt. A doubt that one day the letters might cease, that some awful fate might befall his Vivian Scout, or worst of all, the understanding that what they had was merely a passing of seasons.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe felt a soft tap on his shoulder, and understood that he had been lost in thought along the avenues, missing his apartment by around two blocks, thinking, wishing that someone else was here instead. Rydderech gave her a smile and a nod, before crossing the street, once more on the correct path.\n\n\n\nShe was, to put it plainly, pleasant. She was quick-witted, knowledgeable on all manner of topics, but also loved to keep to herself. She was, in an objective sense, attractive, and in another life, Rydderech might have been attracted //to// her. But very simply, he wasn't, and that she could understand as well. However, this arrangement worked because both parties knew only to ask the questions necessary for their relationship to survive. They spoke often, ate together, and were outwardly the model of a healthy couple. He had met her family, and even helped one of her brothers out while in a particular jam with the university. But secrecy was baked in the moment conversations turned to one of work, and that vulnerability, or lack thereof, carried itself through all aspects of their relationship.\n\n\n\nIn another life, she might have been perfect for someone not named Wynn Rydderech. In this one, she sufficed, though the thought was laden with its own level of guilt in the few moments Rydderech had to interrogate what that meant.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nRydderech imagined Vivian Scout standing just in the background of the mirror, grinning and ready to engage Wynn in a bout of friendly banter.\n\n\n\nVivian often helped him prepare for events, in his own way. The recognition of a missed detail was often delivered with joke or snark, and the pair would work to resolve the detail at the same level of conversation. After a particularly dry formal event season brought about by renovations, Vivian very bluntly suggested that Wynn purchase a new suit because the strain on the fabric of his old reliable was \"presently attempting to escape him.\"\n\n\n\nYet strangely he worried very little about such matters now. Outside of the occasional tear or fade, wrinkles and creases were easily smoothed out with simply the brush of his hand, though that failed to translate to much else.\n\n\n\nRydderech summed it up to fatigue, however. A simple trick of tired eyes to make him seem more put together than he was. He changed into something much more comfortable, and regarded the stack of papers on his desk next to a typewriter nesting a half-written response. There was much to discuss, and Rydderech let the snapping of keys, and the flowing story of his work, his life, and what could be shown of his love, carry him to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1964\n\n++ 31 March\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Provisional Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Dominion of Canada**[[/span]]\n\n\u00a0[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nOnce more Wynn Rydderech found himself crouched over a typewriter deep into the night, trying to trade the ever-decreasing store of time for one final explanation of what was becoming of him.\n\n\n\nScout would have been long asleep by now. He was worn down by the day-to-day minutiae of what it meant to run such a burgeoning facility, but even then, even though he too had mingled with the weird most his life, Scout's age had certainly kept up with him. Much unlike Rydderech.\n\n\n\nThese sorts of fadings were never fast, they //never// are. They move along vast stretches like ants, erode away great mountains like rain drops off leaves, and by the end, everyone finds themselves looking back at all they thought they had left. If they're even able to at all.\n\n\n\nRydderech, unknowingly, and for a while unnoticingly, was the point of equilibrium about which his life moved. For every stone cast by the world, for every natural failure that was meant to give way, for even as he looked death itself in the eyes, he was unmarred. He used to be fit, healthy, tried to lead a good life, and for this he was rewarded with a rounder figure and moderately aching joints. He was lucky, and for this, his luck was destined to run out.\n\n\n\nThere was a stack of missives in the bin adjacent to his desk, perfectly arranged font with red cross-outs and the faded marks of coffee or tears. Some of them were crumpled, or torn with the agony of a silent yell, some semblance of release; like if a tree fell in a forest, the final act of it all, never seen and only discovered once it was too late for anything to be done of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRydderech balled his fists and squeezed, before letting the tension go with an exhale. He looked at the blank document before him, and imagined all the possible variations of what it might say. What would be the most impactful? What would be best to remember him by? Would he write something long, a true testament to the lifetime and then some they'd spent both together and apart? How would one ever capture such depth.\n\n\n\nAnd as the words spun around in his mind, Rydderech, begrudgingly, noticed that someone //else// had come to mind: Thilo Zwist.\n\n\n\nJealousy wasn't necessarily the best way to describe Wynn's thoughts towards the Austrian, but in this one, specific case, it might as well have been. Who else on this planet would be able to capture in words exactly what Rydderech was feeling, what he was trying to get across, but the wizard who had lived for generations. And most annoyingly, the wizard who //almost// captured as much attention in their relationship. Never more than Rydderech, not necessarily even as close, but the chase, the web of words\u2014 there was certainly something there.\n\n\n\n//What else is there?//\n\n\n\nAnd in that thought, Rydderech found his answer, and began typing.\n\n\n\nRydderech had written crates worth of letters in his life, maybe even enough to mourn the tree and the roots that could have grown in a forest, that instead gave itself to deliver so much more than words over distance and time. In itself, each of those letters formed the mosaic of Wynn Rydderech, gave themselves to be a snapshot of the ever-changing idea of what it meant to be a person. Love and labor, trial and triumph, the extending hand that provided the temporary, reassuring comfort of another.\n\n\n\nAll-in-all he knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the contents of this letter may be the last time Rydderech spoke to Vivian Scout, his partner, lover, and husband, as himself.\n\n\n\nSo, he thought he might write Scout a letter of what that meant. Write him a letter of who Wynn Rydderech was, and say what Wynn Rydderech would have hoped to say a thousand times more if he had the chance.\n\n\n\nHe wanted Vivian to do what he had always done, and to reaffirm every single promise they had made over the years.\n\n\n\nHe needed Vivian to continue the good work.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1997\n\n++ 4 April\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWhat Rydderech thought should be his workshop took shape around him. The ground padded each and every footstep, and when he reached for papers on the nearby table (as only one appeared) he always had in his hand //exactly// what he was looking for (if he could even recognize what that was in the first place). If the man were any more dark and brooding, he would have likened it to a villain's evil lair, but it was more akin to a safety net, somewhere that someone much more outwardly affable plotted to save the world.\n\n\n\nHe was doing the good work, after all. What more could be done than that?\n\n\n\nHe let his mind run wild with ideas, many of which would have caught him the concerned look of ethics boards and meek assistants [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]topside[[/span]]\u2014 he didn't doubt that was happening, of course, he knew it would be. But that was the wonder of his station now: the body, the mind, the space around him, all of them contained innumerable pieces of a cosmic toolbox. He imagined every atom, every molecule, and how the electric rhythm of the world coursed through them\u2014 he was the composer now, a thought that was both infinitely frightening and left him laughing to the end of each and every day.\n\n\n\nBut in this place of great triumph, he knew his only anchor to his past life was ever-present, ever-waiting for correspondence, should he deem himself ready for it. His respite for loneliness was there in the moments he needed a connection unlike anything he could create down here. With the universe in his hand and only his imagination as the limit, Wynn Rydderech could never hope to recreate even a fraction of the love he knew existed, but was once more alienated from.\n\n\n\nThe ghost floated beside him. Even it was not tangible enough to feel, nor to lift the curling corners of schematics that would revolutionize everything, if only it was possible to build them. It stopped, and shrunk itself over one such schematic that Rydderech didn't have to see to know (or rather, what it became in a sea of lined paper). After all, he had designed it himself. It was meant to be his Damocles, his deliverance from this torment, and something he both dreamed and cowered from.\n\n\n\nVivian too knew what it meant, and what Wynn needed him to do, should the time come. He was sure Vivian would remember their promise, he knew it. The man who had always tried to keep him safe would not fail.\n\n\n\nAnd he knew that man was waiting for him at the other end of a printer, trying his very best to not let the worry show on his face if others were around. The Site Director had to keep his cool and level head, lest someone underestimate him, as few had learned the consequences of before.\n\n\n\nWith a wave of his hand, a keyboard appeared, and his fingers began their march across the plastic as if they already knew their orders. The ghost lingered nearby, steadily watching.\n\n\n\n//I thought I saw the sun not too long ago. Who knew the caverns down here could get so bright.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; Rydderech wouldn't be surprised if Vivian had moved the entire assembly closer to their dormitory, just to keep on top of any communications that would come through.\n\n\n\nThe ghost circled Rydderech, but did not regard him.\n\n\n\n//The panthers bring \"shiny things\" with them sometimes. Maybe it's something you might think about looking into.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; someone would tell the Site Director right away about his transmissions. Vivian would excuse himself from any meeting, even with the Overseers, should the need arise. He was simply just running late.\n\n\n\nThe ghost began moving away from Rydderech, turning its back to him as it floated towards the door.\n\n\n\n//I think I would like to see the sun again one day, Vivian, at least before mine sets.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. And waited. And waited. And what felt like seconds turned to minutes. And what felt like minutes turned to hours, then years, then weeks. And the ghost floated through the door to some other place far from a place like this one. And Wynn Rydderech was left alone.\n\n\n\n//Vivian?//\n\n\n\nAnd the screen before him slowly hummed to life. For a moment, Rydderech felt a twinge of hope in his heart, and leaned forward in his \"chair\" in anticipation. Then the electricity went out, and the space around him went dark, and he realized that it might have been better not to have read the message at all.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n\nDr. Rydderech, it's [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]Deputy Chief Nancy Briggs[[/span]].

But in S&amp;S3 Druv'tuul is located underneath South America due to Parabox laziness, and its entrance to the surface world is randomly generated between game to game. This sounds bad, but is actually crucial to obtaining Marx as an agitator. Follow the Great Work journal entry until you reach the branch that opens Druv'tuul to the outside world, and send expeditions to the surface.</p>\n<p>If you pop up in the Amazon, reload the save.<br/>\nIf you pop up near the Caribbean or the Pacific, reload the save.<br/>\nIf you pop up in any state bordering the south Atlantic, stay the course. Ideally, Uruguay or Argentina, but south Brazil or even Paraguay will work in a pinch.</p>\n<p>The geographical position of Druv'tuul is of great importance, not because it will give us access to Marx, but to another revolutionary agitator: Giuseppe Garibaldi.</p>\n<p>If you keep good time and get to the surface before Garibaldi's event chain is over (approximately before 1848), you'll be able to catch him before he returns to Italy. Since Parabox did not account for the Yeren reaching the surface this early, you will receive the default event chain for South American nations. Always choose decisions that increase activism and acceptance value for any human culture. Eventually, you will be able to establish a territory on the surface.</p>\n<p>Rush the necessary laws to permit migration and cultural acceptance and let the humans move in (but only into the surface territory; do not attempt to do this for Druv'tuul itself unless you want reactionaries to blow up your city.) Garibaldi will eventually leave for Italy as soon as the revolutions occur in Europe. This is fine. In fact, we want this to occur as soon as possible. This is because after Garibaldi leaves, we will receive an event where we can invite a foreign agitator to visit the territory, FOR FREE. Now, assuming you rushed socialism and have completed the Great Work journal entry by now, and the King is still in power, there will be an option to invite the man himself: Karl Marx. (The exact details of why Marx is an option despite the territory being in South America are not fully clear to me, but technically the game does not recognize Druv'tuul and her vassals to be on <em>any</em> continent so.

But in S&S3 Druv'tuul is located underneath South America due to Parabox laziness, and its entrance to the surface world is randomly generated between game to game. This sounds bad, but is actually crucial to obtaining Marx as an agitator. Follow the Great Work journal entry until you reach the branch that opens Druv'tuul to the outside world, and send expeditions to the surface.\n\n\n\nIf you pop up in the Amazon, reload the save.\n\nIf you pop up near the Caribbean or the Pacific, reload the save.\n\nIf you pop up in any state bordering the south Atlantic, stay the course. Ideally, Uruguay or Argentina, but south Brazil or even Paraguay will work in a pinch.\n\n\n\nThe geographical position of Druv'tuul is of great importance, not because it will give us access to Marx, but to another revolutionary agitator: Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\n\n\nIf you keep good time and get to the surface before Garibaldi's event chain is over (approximately before 1848), you'll be able to catch him before he returns to Italy. Since Parabox did not account for the Yeren reaching the surface this early, you will receive the default event chain for South American nations. Always choose decisions that increase activism and acceptance value for any human culture. Eventually, you will be able to establish a territory on the surface.\n\n\n\nRush the necessary laws to permit migration and cultural acceptance and let the humans move in (but only into the surface territory; do not attempt to do this for Druv'tuul itself unless you want reactionaries to blow up your city.) Garibaldi will eventually leave for Italy as soon as the revolutions occur in Europe. This is fine. In fact, we want this to occur as soon as possible. This is because after Garibaldi leaves, we will receive an event where we can invite a foreign agitator to visit the territory, FOR FREE.

There, in front of them, was the core of the disaster caused in the facility.</p>\n<p>Their journey to the origin of the anomaly had been long and dangerous, especially because of the unfortunate encounters they had with the infected. All the corpses were properly tagged as they made their way, the hostiles neutralized, and the rooms cleared. The only thing left was to figure out how to quickly and safely rescue the scientists currently barricaded inside.</p>\n<p>Some members of the team looked at each other for a few seconds, trying to come up with some kind of strategy to break the barrier that separated them from the researchers until agent Steffano Gonz\u00e1lez decided to break the silence.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cV\u00edctor? You got anything?\u201d said Steffano, as he slowly approached the young man.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Agent V\u00edctor Penz looked up briefly from his notebook. He was making use of the short break to update his map with notes about the area. His activity was interrupted by his teacher\u2019s question, which he complained about under his breath before setting about reviewing the situation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cLet me see.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>In front of them, a bizarre and gruesome combination of a mucilage-like substance and pieces of fungus formed a barrier, stretching across the doorway and between the hall leading to the room where the scientists were barricaded.</p>\n<p>After checking the surroundings and thinking for a few seconds, he raised his voice again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cDoes anyone know if this thing is fire resis- Bah\u2026 No. Nevermind. You.\u201d He said pointing directly to agent Turner. \u201cDo you have a lighter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck would I have a lighter and not any othe-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have one or not?\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShocked by the agent\u2019s audacity, Rex simply looked at him with a raised eyebrow and started to search in his backpack. After a few moments, he rudely threw a lighter at Victor.</p>\n<p>Victor took a small sample of the fungus from a nearby wall. He lit the lighter on and when he brought it close to the flame, the sample disintegrated while releasing a smoke of greenish-blue spores.</p>\n<p>After observing the smoke for a few seconds and with his doubt cleared up, he proceeded to explain his plan:<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cI thought about this: We could use the alcohol and the lighter to burn the first line of whatever the fuck is covering the door. Perhaps we could improvise an incendiary device with what we have in our equipment. The more area we cover, the better. Meanwhile, dividing ourselves into two groups, one for civilians and the other for any possible threats. You all heard on the radio that there are infecteds inside, so we have to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Everybody meditated about it for a few seconds, before the silence was broken by a sarcastic laugh from Agent Turner.</p>\n<p>Penz just watched, confused and frowning</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe cannot do that.\u201d Said Marcelo as he took a few steps forward. \u201cThe release of spores into the environment when incinerating whatever that is\u2026 It may not be as harmful to us since we have the right equipment, but we must consider those who are inside. However,\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe Portuguese agent extracted a CBRN kit from his equipment and his partner did the same, taking his own out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve now noticed that the substance dissolves very easily when stimulated, such as by setting it on fire, so, to put it simply, we can try something using the basic chemical containment equipment\u2026 It isn\u2019t much, since we weren\u2019t expecting something of this magnitude, but it may be more than useful to dissolve whatever lies ahead, at least in not too excessive amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nRex slowly approached the door blocked by the viscous mucilage and proceeded to take a couple samples to insert them into tubes very similar to traditional laboratory test tubes, with the only difference that these were covered with warning stickers of different types, alongside the distinctive logos of the Beta-7 task force and The Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo carefully observed the various encapsulated chemical agents he carried as he read a guide that came with the kit.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cSamples ready.\u201d Rex shouted to Marcelo. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna isolate these for a second and I\u2019ll let you try them with the solvents we have. Let's see if we strike a bit of luck here for the first time in the division\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead\u201d Marcelo stretched out his arm wearing an oversized yellow glove over the equipment they had brought previously, receiving the tubes Rex handed him. \u201cNow cross your fingers and stay back in case of any adverse reactions that may occur.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAgents Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and Penz simply waited nearby, with the kind of admiration one would expect when watching a highly skilled team at work. Everybody knew that interrupting the process could be a waste of time and, therefore, would risk not being able to evacuate the civilians alive.</p>\n<p>The mucilage from inside the vials glowed faintly. One by one, Marcelo poured the reagents. Variations of \u201cvoriconazole\u201d, \"quinoxyfen\", \u201cimidazole\u201d and some \u201cEchinocandins\u201d. All carefully labelled so that their reactions to the fungal agent could be measured and identified.</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, the differences in some of the tubes were extremely noticeable. One in particular showed a visible structural change, which Marcelo reported to Rex. Both agents analyzed it and then agreed, finally they shared the result with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWell, as you can see\u2026\u201d Marcelo raised the sole disposable tube he had in his hand for a few seconds,enough time for the rest of the team to see it. \u201cWe suppose that this is what we are looking for. The reaction was as expected\u2026 But to be sure, I\u2019ll need the lighter.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nPenz threw the lighter back to Rex, who looked at him reluctantly for a few seconds and then passed it to Marcelo. The agent carefully took out part of the sample from the vial and passed it over the flame. The sample disappeared in a matter of seconds, but this time no spores could be seen. Evidently, it had worked.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cHa, ha! Perfect, now, what was the plan of action you said before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBurn everything blocking the entrance and the room before the containment room so we can get in. Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and you would go for the civilians, Turner and I for the hostiles. There's no clear view of how many are in there, so it's best to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Everyone looked at V\u00edctor for a moment before nodding slightly and moving on to the execution.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cSo, first\u2026\u201d Rex shouted as he laboriously prepared enough reagent to break down the mucilage that was blocking the passage. \u201cWe need to spread this across as much surface area as possible.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo was preparing a small yellow tank with a hose similar to a fire extinguisher, which they were going to use to cover the area with the chemical. As he was spraying the organic wall, the fungus wriggled and pulsed to the contact with the solvent. When the task was done, he took a few steps back and put the equipment away again.</p>\n<p>A spark from the lighter, and the wall in front of them vanished almost immediately. In the front room, clusters of hyphae blocked the way like vines. Marcelo reached out and gave one of them a slight pull, which was enough to break it. They were not going to be an obstacle for the team anymore.</p>\n<p>Watching the situation unfold, Victor signaled to the others to review the entry plan. The agents Ibarra, Gonzalez and Oliveira would enter the observation room and would be responsible for extracting the civilians, while Turner and him would go for the remaining hostiles in the containment room.</p>\n<p>With the plan established and their weapons drawn, both teams headed through the hyphae maze hanging from the ceiling. With a quick movement of his hand, Victor pointed to the darkest side of the room as he walked slowly to the end of the hall that led to the entrance of both rooms. Once there, he signaled via radio to announce his arrival at the door covered in mucilage, where the presence of hostiles was presumed.</p>\n<p>Rex took a combat knife from his backpack and made some cuts in the remaining mucilage between the door separating the two agents and the dark room with its dim turquoise light. Victor, with one of his hands resting on Rex\u2019s shoulder, approached and illuminated the room with the lantern attached to his shotgun.</p>\n<p>On the other side, several deformed hostiles laid staring at the ceiling of the room. In a corner, a grotesque mass made of some biological compound, similar to the stem of a plant, vibrated and pulsed constantly, giving off faint and intermittent flashes of light.</p>\n<p>Silence reigned for a moment as both agents watched the various humanoid figures writhe in agony, scratching their bodies in an attempt to take off some pieces of scales that seemed to serve as natural armor.</p>\n<p>V\u00edctor lightly pushed Rex aside as he extracted a stun grenade from a compartment of his equipment.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOne. Two. Three!\u201d the agent shouted before dropping the explosive inside the room and moving away so as not to be hit by its effect.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A gruesome scene was shown unfolding inside the room where the rescue team entered.</p>\n\n<p>Two scientists were unconscious, sitting with their backs against the wall. Both had chemical protective coveralls, which seemed to have protected them from the infection that affected the other scientists in the area.</p>\n<p>Steffano and Ibarra approached each scientist, trying to check their vital signs and carrying them to the vicinity of the entrance door.</p>\n<p>A radio transmission indicated that V\u00edctor and Rex had reached their objective, to which Steffano responded positively.</p>\n<p>Marcelo illuminated the room with his flashlight in hand, panning it around as he approached a large table in the center of the room. On the table lay the last scientist using the protective coverall in a prone position.</p>\n<p>Oliveira quickly noticed and he immediately approached the subject, turning him over and positioning him correctly on the ground.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGuys, over here!\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Steffano approached Marcelo, who was slowly examining the unconscious scientist.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Marcelo desperately pressed a section of the suit near the neck. \u201cI need tape, or something similar. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ibarra checked the contents of his backpack, looking for an efficient alternative.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe suit is broken. We need to seal it immediately\u201d Marcelo responded as he pressed the suit with one hand and checked his backpack with the other one. \u201cI'm going to put a simple oxygen mask on him to counteract any pathogens that may have entered the system, but I need to seal this up right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be in any state of infection beyond loss of consciousness.\u201d Steffano pointed out. \u201cThat doesn't mean anything, of course, but I would like to know what led these people to the state they are in.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSteffano knelt down beside the subject and started to press the suit, replacing Marcelo, who was focused on putting the mask in the small tear. Ibarra took out a tape of considerable length and began to secure the area of the break after the two agents had finished their work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe have to drag them to the door. There, we'll carry each one on our shoulders and see if we can get them out that way. There is no other way, for now.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Marcelo agreed unanimously and began to carry the unconscious men to the doorway. In that moment, the rumble of a nearby explosion, followed by the sound of several detonations, put the three agents on alert.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The explosion of the stun grenade made the hostiles writhe and screech in pain, searching for the source of the explosion. V\u00edctor slapped Rex\u2019s back strongly, who instantly entered, firing his assault rifle on the two nearby hostiles. V\u00edctor took advantage of the opportunity to blast his shotgun towards the other two hostiles, who were immediately ejected by the force of the shots.</p>\n<p>Rex came close to the creatures he shot, who were still moving erratically, even with the prominent holes in the soft parts of his skin.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cUgh. Bloody hell!\u201d he shouted before drawing his secondary weapon and emptying the magazine on the monsters.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nV\u00edctor approached the other two hostiles with methodical and precise movements to shoot them, and executed them both with a single, clean shot on the head.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201c<em>Bichos de mierda.</em>\u201d Said Penz, answering Rex\u2019s shouts.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBetween the commotion and the heavy breathing, both agents approached the fleshy nucleus that breathed in one of the corners of the room.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cI don't know what this is, but I think we both agree that it\u2019s the reason we are here in the first place, innit?\u201d Asked Rex, as he took out the tank they had used to spray the chemical against the mucilage earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely. What I\u2019m not sure about is, if trying to destroy this thing might be a good idea.\u201d Penz answered, concerned, after seeing his colleague with the tank in his hands. \u201cWe don't know what the consequences might be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Rex began to spray the chemical over the nucleus, before pausing to contemplate. \u201cI think it is a good idea to get rid of the contamination source. I don\u2019t know what the consequences might be, but I don\u2019t think it could be worse than this.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe creatures the agents thought had previously been defeated began to shake and convulse frantically in the same place where they had been left.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit, uh\u2026 God damn it, just do it, ok? We\u2019ll complain later.\u201d V\u00edctor pointed his weapon at the creatures. \u201cCome on! Hurry up!\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nRex finished emptying the contents of the tank on the surroundings and lit all the area on fire before running away, dragging V\u00edctor by part of his suit.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Outside the rooms there were Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and Oliveira with the civilians on their shoulders. Gonzalez tried to adjust the radio to communicate with the other two agents, to no avail.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe should start moving, the civilians are top priority.\u201d Said Marcelo</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know that,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez replied, slightly frustrated. \u201cJust\u2026 give me a moment, I\u2019ll try once more and then-\u201c Steffano was interrupted by another loud rumbling, followed by a beam of light coming from the back room.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>From the back, Victor and Rex ran out at full speed, almost bumping into the walls, while shouting at the top of their lungs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGET OUT, NOW!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRUN!\u201d shouted V\u00edctor as he ran towards the others as fast as he could.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBehind the agents, the hostiles who had supposedly been taken down ran out of the room at full speed. They were being incinerated as they ran, but it didn't seem to affect them, bullet holes could be seen all over their bodies.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWhat the fu-\u201d Steffano shouted before running slowly because of the load he was carrying \u201cWhat the hell just happened there?\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Marcelo just started running, taking the lead for the whole team. V\u00edctor and Rex ran behind the rest of the agents, pointing at the hostile that were rushing at full speed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t the time, not now!\u201d Answered Rex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn the distance, it could be seen how the fire carried by the hostiles began to burn the surroundings with every step they took, creating a blazing tide that advanced alongside them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d Penz throwed another stun grenade, which ended up getting lost in the rush, without being effective.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe mucilage started glowing strongly, spreading over the heels of the agents who were running to escape from the lower part of the facility.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPenz, the door!\u201d Rex shouted, signing with one of his hands indicating the security gate through which they had initially entered.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nVictor froze for a split second, processing the order Rex surprisingly gave him, then sprinted quickly towards the door, taking the lead.</p>\n<p>Ibarra and Oliveira watched in confusion as Penz sprinted at full speed and positioned himself on the left side of the security gate. During the confusion, Turner took up position behind Gonz\u00e1lez and began sprinting backwards, shooting at the hostiles as an attempt to slow down the imminent march of the enemies.</p>\n<p>The run lasted only a few minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Oscar and Marcelo arrived first, drew their secondary weapon and pointed towards the hallway where Steffano and Rex were approaching with the enemies hot on their heels.</p>\n<p>Seconds after, and by a matter of luck, Steffano passed through the security gate alongside Rex, who did an excellent job keeping in line the anomalies as V\u00edctor typed some numbers on the security console, finally closing the gate and keeping everyone safe.</p>\n<p>All the agents stood still for a few seconds, breathing heavily and processing what had just happened.</p>\n<p>Without saying a word, everyone began to climb the stairs. Rex and V\u00edctor tried to help the others, without interrupting their walk.</p>\n<p>The stairs seemed to stretch on endlessly due to the effects of fatigue, but the adrenaline kept the agent on the rails. Everyone climbed slowly and walked the last stretch of the way out of the facility with difficulty.</p>\n<p>Limping and in pain, those carrying the civilians went from walking slowly to jogging. At the front of the installations, the giant gates swung open, allowing an entire task force to enter.</p>\n<p>Steffano shouted some instructions, and most of the task force passed by the agents, going directly to the location from which they had just come. Another couple of agents of the task force stopped and helped the group carry the civilians, while providing support so that they could walk with less difficulty.</p>\n<p>Once outside, the scene was completely different from what they had encountered when they first arrived.</p>\n<p>Several helicopter fleets circled the facility. Tents of different colors were arranged throughout the perimeter. Some red tents gave medical support to the civilians that could have been harmed during the breach. Some of those provided psychological assistance, and others simply displayed an assortment of weapons for the agents who recently arrived on the scene for the intervention.</p>\n<p>The specially trained mobile task forces were the most noticeable above the scene, with oversized suits and specialized equipment, forming brigades with the other agents who were gathering at the doors of the facilities.</p>\n<p>The entire team was intervened by two groups of personnel; some wore full-body grey suits, while others were dressed as doctors and nurses. The latter retrieved the civilians from the shoulder of the agents carrying them, and disappeared from the scene to keep them safe, while the men in gray gave instructions to guide them to a tent of the same color, a bit further away from the rest.</p>\n<p>Once inside, the entire team was instructed to follow an emergency cleaning and chemical decontamination protocol. They were disarmed from their equipment and stripped down to their underwear and were sprayed with various chemical agents for disinfection.</p>\n<p>Once they finished the process, they dried themselves before moving to the next section of the tent, where the bags they had left outside before the operation were being kept. Each member took their equipment and began to change again.</p>\n<p>In the silence of the room, everyone dressed meticulously without saying anything about the operation.</p>\n<p>After a couple of minutes starting to get dressed, Turner looked up at agent Penz, who did not notice him until a couple of seconds later.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201c\u2026Is everything al-?\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBefore he could say another word, V\u00edctor was interrupted by Rex\u2019s laughter, who approached him and extended his fist to greet him.</p>\n<p>Penz looked at him for a moment, confused, before he responded to the greeting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOi, goldilocks. We almost died there. What were you going to do if we died, mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could do anything in that case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right!\u201d Rex slammed a glove against the ground and then started laughing again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nPenz did not fully understand the reaction, but he was not bothered by them either. Something about the whole situation reminded him of times gone by, and perhaps, just perhaps, he was not as lost as he used to think.</p>\n<p>The blonde agent smiled with his head down and finished closing a small bag with a Glock and its tiny flashlight.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>While the team was waiting for a new order, Rex was sitting, leaning against a pile of bags and he was visibly irritated.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Marcelo asked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2026\u201d After a few seconds, he continued \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think they were going to receive us with a tent. Fuck! I didn\u2019t believe we would see anyone waiting for us outside that door. I still don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t think about it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steffano interrupted them from the other side of the room \u201cSorry. What are you saying?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt's a bit obvious, innit?\u201d Rex snapped again \u201cThey send two guys from a task force alone to a site far away from everything. You have to pray that they send only three more as backup. Those three are hired on a quasi-private basis. None of them are given a damn clue of what the fuck is waiting inside there. For God's sake! It looked like they left us there to d-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough\u201d Marcelo interrupted Rex before he could continue. \u201cThe situation wasn\u2019t handled in the best way. We all noticed that. Most of the plan was made on the fly due to the urgency. But I don\u2019t think it is the best idea doing this now, after all\u2026\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhen he was done dressing up, Marcelo turned around and gave the tent structure behind him a light tap.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWalls have ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d Steffano frowned for a moment before replying slowly. \u201cWe\u2019d better get together to celebrate the victory at another time, in another place.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSteffano took out a notebook from his bag, and from it, took out a couple of small cards with his name and email address on them. He handed one to each agent from the task force they had worked with, then silently put the notebook back in his bag.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cI know a place where we could go and relax, it\u2019s a small bar where the police used to hang out. There the walls don\u2019t have ears, in fact, they have no sense at all. If you know what I mean\u201d said the agent, chuckling to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see, yeah. We\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d Marcelo turned to Rex, who was distracted, chatting with Victor and Oscar. \u201cNevermind\u2026 We\u2019ll be there. It\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Both agents shook hands. The handshake lasted for a couple of seconds before being interrupted by the entrance of a man dressed in a formal military uniform, who slowly approached the group.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGentlemen. With your permission, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\u201d He paused for a moment before continuing. \u201cFirst, let me congratulate you on such an impressive performance, we would expect nothing less from an elite group. Unfortunately, you know what comes next.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Marcelo and Steffano were visibly frustrated. Marcelo had his reasons, and Steffano just hated the bureaucracy of operatives.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be summoned to Site-22, New York headquarters. There\u2019s most of the documents, so you know where to go. It has to be sometime this week, preferably within the next three days. Once you finish the standard process you will be free of responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood\u201d responded Marcelo.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good day, agents.\u201d Said the officer, leaving the way he came.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Ibarra approached Gonz\u00e1lez and whispered something in his ear before he grabbed a heavy backpack and said goodbye to everyone as he left.</p>\n<p>Victor looked worriedly at Steffano before asking:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything is alright, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all good.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Steffano gave a thumbs up in approval before grabbing his bags and leaving the tent, accompanied by the rest of the agents.</p>\n<p>After a quick exchange of farewells and several handshakes, each member went separate ways with their respective group. V\u00edctor followed Steffano with his head down, glancing sideways at the groups of agents and researchers surrounding the now quarantined site.</p>\n<p>The return trip was not remarkable; they flew back to Site-210 by helicopter, followed by a drive to Site-28. Both were quite exhausted, and the protocol interruptions along the way did not help much.</p>\n<p>When they got back to the apartment, they left their bags in the living room without saying a word. Steffano took the chance to finally relax and stretch out on the sofa, while V\u00edctor glanced at the clock a few seconds before heading to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The noise coming from there broke the silence in the place. The opening and closing of the refrigerator, the search of the ingredients and the organization of everything were momentarily interrupted when one of the two spoke up:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Asked Steffano, turning to look at him as he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cBurgers.\u201d V\u00edctor answered him without looking, busy cutting some vegetables for a topping. \u201cIt\u2019s quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite late. Don\u2019t you prefer ordering something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d The sound of the knife against the cutting board stopped for a second. \u201cWell, it's almost one in the morning. I don\u2019t think we can order anything at this time. It\u2019s quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright\u2026 if you say so.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>After a couple of minutes, Steffano went to the dining room to set the table for dinner. He lifted a white tablecloth and placed it on the table, arranging it neatly and tidying up the room to bring in the food.</p>\n<p>With the food on table and both of them eating, Steffano paused between bites to gesticulate. He commented about the experience of the incursion so he could ask the opinion of his student, but then he realized that he had failed to get his attention.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cVic?\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cV\u00edctor!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?

He stares at the Foundation agent sitting on the other side of his desk, making no effort to conceal his disbelief.</p>\n<p>\"You think Shaquille O'Neal, four-time NBA champion and fifteen-time All-Star, is a robot.\"</p>\n<p>Clarissa Shaw stares back defiantly. \"I know it.\"</p>\n<p>She rolls her wheelchair forwards so she can slap a manila file folder on his desk. \"I have evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer makes no moves to take the folder. \"Why are you bothering me? Shouldn't you be taking this to Merlo? Or is she too busy ignoring our extradition requests?\"</p>\n<p>The mention of Anderson, even obliquely, causes Shaw to wince. Spencer guesses that she was part of the task force that <a href=\"/bal-chatri\">ambushed Vincent Anderson</a> as <a href=\"/falcon-flight\">he fled Portlands</a>, snatching the megalomaniac genius and wanted felon right out from under the nose of the UIU. It would certainly explain her injuries.</p>\n<p>\"Merlo has her hands tied. Now that Anderson is in custody, there isn't as much funding to go after his company. Holman won't approve an op without concrete evidence. Everyone thinks I'm grasping at straws to find a way to stay involved in the action.\" The hurt in Shaw's voice is obvious.</p>\n<p>Spencer has enough tact to not press that issue. But he still doesn't want to get involved. His partner, forensic thaumatologist Robin Thorne, is taking a much-needed vacation with their significant other, leaving him to supervise the Three Portlands Field Office alone.</p>\n<p>So far, it has been blissfully monotonous and uneventful, and he hopes to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry to hear that Clarissa, but I fail to see why this is my problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because Shaq is an American citizen, and if he's been replaced by a Saker, then he might be in danger. And because if there's a Saker still out there, we have no idea what it will do now that Anderson is in custody. It may very well go on a rampage, or try to kill the President. Anderson has already tried to subvert the United States Government. Can you really afford to ignore a Saker, especially one as prominent as Shaq?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If</em> there's a Saker,\" Spencer counters. But he has to give the point to Shaw. If she's right \u2014 <em>if</em> \u2014 then he has to act. Anything less would be negligence.</p>\n<p>He picks up the folder and cracks it open. He starts leafing through the files within.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\" He removes a photograph and holds it up to examine it more closely. It's a side-by-side comparison of two still frames of Shaquille O'Neal from <em>Inside the NBA</em>, date-stamped a week apart. Shaw had used red marker pen to circle a number of differences, all barely perceptible.</p>\n<p>Spencer looks up from the photograph at Shaw. Looks back at the photograph. Back at Shaw.</p>\n<p>She desperately needs a win. Far more than he needs things to stay boring.</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm convinced.\"</p>\n<p>He throws the folder back on the desk and stands up, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and sliding it on in a smooth, well-practiced motion. He looks at Shaw expectantly. \"Well? Saddle up, we're going robot hunting.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>December 19, 2018</strong><br/>\n<strong>Shaq's House</strong><br/>\n<strong>Orlando, Florida</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer rings the doorbell.</p>\n<p>\"I still think we should have tried to get backup from MOOT,\" Shaw says while they wait.</p>\n<p>\"Thorne took out one of these things by themself, I think the two of us can handle one robot,\" Spencer replies. \"Besides, he might not even be here. He wasn't at the house in Texas.\"</p>\n<p>\"And if it is here? I'd rather have a wizard backing us up.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shrugs. \"We're just here to ask a few questions and see if we can confirm our suspicions. We can always come back later with wizard SWAT if we're right.\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose. I still don't like it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, you came to me. If you don't like how we do things in the Unit, you can always leave.\"</p>\n<p>They fall silent at the sound of someone unlocking the door.</p>\n<p>Shaq opens the door.</p>\n<p>Spencer shuffles nervously, his cool facade crumbling slightly in the face of all seven feet and one inch of the basketball player's enormous frame.</p>\n<p>\"Hi, Mr. O'Neal. I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer\u2014\" He holds up his badge as proof, then gestures at Shaw. \"\u2014and this is Agent Clarissa Shaw. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?\"</p>\n<p>Shaq hesitates. \"Is it urgent? I'm working on a new album, and I had a sick freestyle going.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm very sorry to interrupt you,\" Spencer says. \"But we have reason to believe you might be in danger.\"</p>\n<p>\"We think someone might be impersonating you,\" Shaw says, which is almost the truth.</p>\n<p>\"Have you noticed anything strange?\" Spencer asks. \"Unusual activity on your accounts, other people remembering interactions that you didn't have, weird phone calls, anything like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, nothing like that.\" Shaq sighs. \"I bet I know what's up.\" He leans closer and says, in a stage whisper, \"I have a stunt double, back from making <em>Steel</em>. Great guy, terrible at basketball. Sometimes people see him in public and think he's me. You dig it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I dig it.\" Spencer smiles brightly. \"Shaq didn't have a stunt double for that movie. They couldn't find a tall enough look-a-like.\"</p>\n<p>Panic flashes across Shaq's face. \"Fuck!\"</p>\n<p>He slams the door shut.</p>\n<p>Shaw groans. \"We've been made. He's definitely a Saker, and he knows we're onto him.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods. \"You know, I think you might be right.\" He pulls out his pistol and holds it at the ready below his waist. \"Can you cover the front? I'm gonna try to circle around and cut him off.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you really suggesting we split up so it can pick us off one-by-one?\"</p>\n<p>But he's already jogging across the driveway, scanning for an easy spot to vault over the wall and into the backyard.</p>\n<p>He's still standing in the driveway when, a moment later, an engine roars and a cherry red Corvette smashes through the garage door. In fact, he's directly in its path.</p>\n<p>The car hits Spencer at about five miles per hour, lifting him from the ground and folding him up against the hood. He clings desperately to the car with one hand, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Miraculously, his other hand still holds his pistol.</p>\n<p>He aims vaguely and starts firing. His first shot goes wide. His second shot gouges the hood. His third shot takes out the driver-side mirror.</p>\n<p>The Corvette accelerates and weaves down the driveway, trying to throw him off, or at least ruin his aim. His pistol goes flying, tumbling into the grass of the lawn. He starts swearing, random curse words from a variety of languages, and tries to hold on with both hands.</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot takes the corner at the end of the driveway hard. Really hard. The Corvette goes up on two wheels for a moment, and Spencer goes flying. He lands in a patch of dandelions across the street, bruised, battered, and winded, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The Corvette speeds off down the street and vanishes from view.</p>\n<p>Shaw rolls down the driveway and looks down at him. \"Do you want to call for backup now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I think so.\" Spencer rubs his back and winces. \"Did you see which way he was going?\"</p>\n<p>\"South,\" Shaw saws. \"He's probably getting onto State Route 482.\"</p>\n<p>\"That'll take him to the airport.\" He groans as he stands up and starts dusting dandelion fluff off his pants.</p>\n<p>\"Great, let's go, we can catch him there.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shakes his head. \"No, we're not engaging in the middle of MCO. It would be a blood bath.\" He pulls out his phone and begins to dial.</p>\n<p>\"What\u2014?\"</p>\n<p>He holds up a hand to cut her off and starts speaking into the phone.</p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/quinn-law-hub\">Agent Carter</a>? Ken Spencer here, from the Three Ports office. I need a favor from you.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses to listen.</p>\n<p>\"I need an APB for Shaquille O'Neal. He's driving a red Corvette without a left-side wing mirror, and is likely en route to Orlando International Airport. Tell local cops and TSA not to engage or try to detain, just observe. I want to know what flight he gets on and when.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses again. Shaw can't hear the words being said, but the voice on the other end of the line sounds agitated.</p>\n<p>\"No, he's been replaced by a robot.\"</p>\n<p>Another pause.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, it's related to the Caldwell thing. It's a matter of national security.\"</p>\n<p>The voice sounds slightly mollified.</p>\n<p>Spencer laughs. \"Thanks, Isaac. I owe you one.\"</p>\n<p>He closes the phone and looks at Shaw. \"In your expert opinion, do you believe that there is a clear and exigent threat to the life of Shaquille O'Neal?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw blinks. \"It's possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"And is it possible that we might find him inside this residence, or, failing that, information regarding his current location?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"Sure, I guess.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer smiles like a shark. \"I'm willing to call that exigent circumstances.\" He pulls a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and snaps them on. \"Let's search the place.\"</p>\n<p>They move methodically, sweeping through each room with practiced patience, checking everything \u2014 opening drawers, lifting up cushions, looking under furniture. Spencer even checks the dust on the bookshelves to see which books have recently been moved. They're looking for any clue that might tell them where the real Shaq is \u2014 if he's even still alive.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after almost forty minutes of searching, Shaw finds something.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, come take a look at this!\" she calls out.</p>\n<p>Spencer comes over to find her pointing at a framed photograph next to the entertainment center.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\" he asks. The photo shows Shaq performing as a DJ at some event.</p>\n<p>\"Look at that, do you see it? Reflected in his sunglasses.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer leans in for a better look. Shaq is in a nightclub somewhere, performing on an elevated stage above a crowded dance floor. A dozen different colors of muted neon light the scene, giving it an otherworldly vibe.</p>\n<p>Reflected in the left lens of Shaq's sunglasses, almost too small to make out, is a small logo, probably from a neon sign outside the nightclub.</p>\n<p>It's the logo of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.</p>\n<p>\"Fucking hell.\" Spencer picks up the photograph and holds it up to the light. \"That's in Eurtec.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or somewhere with a Coalition presence,\" Shaw says.</p>\n<p>\"No, it's definitely Eurtec. Look at that guy's wrist.\" Spencer points at an arm thrusting up from the dance floor into the bottom of the photograph. \"Do you see the tattoo?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw squints, then nods. \"What about it?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's the insignia of a neo-Nazi Eurtec street gang.\"</p>\n<p>\"So he's been to Eurtec,\" Shaw says. \"Which means he's clued in about the Veil.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which explains why someone might want to replace him with a robot.\" Spencer sets the photograph back down and begins to pace. \"This isn't looking good. He might be in real trouble.\"</p>\n<p>At that moment, Spencer's phone rings, merrily playing the X-Files theme. He answers the phone immediately, pointedly ignoring Shaw's curious look.</p>\n<p>\"Go for Spencer,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He listens intently for about thirty seconds, then hangs up.</p>\n<p>\"Robot's taking a flight to Paris,\" he tells Shaw. \"Plane leaves in thiry minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's in Paris?\" she asks.</p>\n<p>Spencer looks at the photograph of Shaq DJing. \"Eurtec.\"</p>\n<p>Understanding dawns in Shaw's eyes. \"It's looking for Shaq.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe.\" Spencer frowns. \"Is that typical of Sakers?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw shrugs. \"We don't really know what's typical of Sakers.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought you guys were the experts.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, that's the guy who makes them. We just know how to break them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's hope that's enough.\" Spencer starts dialing another number. \"I assume you don't have Library access, yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, why? Who are you calling?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Someone who can give us a Way to Eurtec that doesn't go through the Library.\" He lifts the phone to his ear and starts speaking. \"Hello, <a href=\"/much-belated-inheritance\">Mister Raybon</a>? This is Agent Spencer. How'd you like to do a good deed? The life of Shaquille O'Neal might depend on it.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Eurtec</strong></p>\n<p>It takes Spencer and Shaw two hours to get to Eurtec, following the directions given to them by Jordan \"Submarine\" Raybon. The retired smuggler knows how to get to anywhere from anywhere, although not always by the most direct route. He gives them a path through the Way network that will take them from Orlando to Naples, Italy. Although it's only a few miles of walking in total, by the time the two agents are standing before a Way into Eurtec they've passed through the Neverglades; Naples, Florida; Liminal Italy; the Kingdom of Zero Sicilies; and half-a-dozen other locales across the world tree.</p>\n<p>\"You ever been to Eurtec?\" Spencer asks.</p>\n<p>Shaw shakes her head. \"No, the Coalition doesn't like us being here.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't imagine why.\" He starts ticking off points on his fingers. \"It's bigger than Three Ports, by a lot, and meaner. The Coalition mostly doesn't give a fuck about street crime. The city is physically and economically stratified, and neo-Nazi gangs control the lower levels. We won't have any real authority, so don't tell anyone you're with the Foundation, it'll just piss people off. You can bring weapons through customs but it probably won't help \u2014 almost everyone is armed with something, usually magic.\"</p>\n<p>\"What about wheelchair access?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>Spencer frowns. \"Worse than an American city, better than anywhere in baseline Europe. There used to be a teleporter network but they shut it down after 9/11.\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn, that would have been nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't have anything nice in the United Nations' cyberpunk dystopia.\" Spencer chuckles, once, before his expression turns serious again. \"For real though, this place makes Portlands look like a fluffy kitten \u2014 and I have seen Portlandsers spontaneously construct and burn an effigy of J. Edgar Hoover purely out of boredom.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you blame them?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"No, and it was a pretty decent likeness, but that's not the point. Just being American will make us a target here. Don't let your guard down.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"Understood. I'll keep my eyes open.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer steps forwards to confront the blank brick wall of the Neopolitan alleyway. He pulls a crumpled slip of paper from his pocket and double-checks the instructions written on it.</p>\n<p>He clears his throat, knocks three times on a slightly off-color brick, and says, \"Let us leave good sense behind.\"</p>\n<p>The bricks glow for a moment, then crumble to sand and ash, exposing a small pedestrian tunnel. Spencer leads them through, emerging into what looks like an airport terminal. Over a dozen similar tunnels dot the wall behind them, with light pedestrian traffic going in and out of them.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you said there was customs?\" Shaw looks around for anything resembling security and comes up blank.</p>\n<p>\"The city is run by a bunch of precognitive computers. We cleared customs on the Way in. If we hadn't, you'd know.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw looks pensive. \"Could they tell us where Shaq is? Or where he will be?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shrugs. \"Probably. If they want to help us, then they'd have already done it \u2014 maybe they even have. But I doubt it. From what I've heard, the Nornir don't get involved. They have bigger things to worry about.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, like Yao Ming.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer barks out a short laugh. \"Sure. Like Yao Ming.\" He checks his watch. \"Come on, we have six hours to find Shaq. Then the Saker gets here, and I don't want to try playing spot the impostor.\"</p>\n<p>They both set a timer on their watches.</p>\n<p>\"How exactly are we going to find Shaq?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Some good old-fashioned police work,\" Spencer says. \"We're gonna canvas the city.\"</p>\n<p>\"All million people? In six hours?\" Shaw shakes her head. \"You're more likely to trip over him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" He stops the next passerby and holds up a Shaquille O'Neal basketball card. \"Excuse me, have you seen this man?\"</p>\n<p>The man nods. \"Shaq? Of course, I wouldn't miss him.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer glances at Shaw. She rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Where did you see him?\" Spencer asks.</p>\n<p>\"He was playing at Club Cipher,\" the man replies. \"But if you're hoping to catch him, he won't be there tonight. He's been playing a different venue every night.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods, feigning comprehension. \"Any idea where he'll be tonight?\"</p>\n<p>The man shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't get announced in advance. It's like a guerilla DJing thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, thank you. You've been very helpful.\" He lets the man continue on his way.</p>\n<p>\"Alright there's no way you're that lucky,\" Shaw says. \"What's your trick?\"</p>\n<p>\"That photo we saw of Shaq,\" Spencer says. \"He was playing at a club. I figured that if he was here and not, you know, a prisoner or dead, then there was a pretty good chance he'd be performing again.\"</p>\n<p>\"You never actually intended to canvas the whole city.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope! Just the nightclubs.\" Spencer grabs a tourist map of Eurtec from a nearby stand. \"And with a few educated guesses, we can narrow our search further.\"</p>\n<p>He pulls a pen from his pocket and crosses out Club Cipher.</p>\n<p>\"Right, if we know where he's been then we know where he won't be,\" Shaw says.</p>\n<p>\"And it might give us an idea of where he will be. Cipher is a dive, which suggests he's probably not playing any of the really upscale clubs \u2014 you know, the ones that charge a cover just to stand in line.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know so much about Eurtec?\" Shaw asks. \"The UIU doesn't have jurisdiction here \"</p>\n<p>\"No, but we have an international office here. For liaison purposes. I read their reports.\" Spencer shrugs. \"And I may have been here a few times on vacation.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw stares at him. \"I cannot picture you on vacation.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, I'm not a robot,\" he says. \"I take vacations too.\" He holds up the map, upon which he has drawn about a dozen circles. \"Here's our target list. Thirteen nightclubs in the city's lower level.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can we hit them all in six hours?\"</p>\n<p>\"We can try.\"</p>\n<p>They manage it, just barely. Canvassing the city's nightclubs takes them five hours and fifty minutes.</p>\n<p>Their first stop is Ewige Blumenkraft, an Illuminati-owned nightclub inside the Eurtec Parabotanical Gardens in the city's middle-tier. It is widely considered the lamest club in Europe, but the Illuminati have the money to pay for the best DJs, so people still go. The bouncer helpfully informs them that Shaq played there a week ago, and that the Achronal Hyacinth will be unblooming soon.</p>\n<p>Their second visit is to BROZ, a gay club inside the former Yugoslav consulate. The centerpiece is an unexploded bomb from the NATO intervention in Serbia, which is allegedly still armed. The bartender tells them that Shaq was there a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Next they hit the French clubs, Paradis \u2014 a discotheque inside a former Gothic church that was transported to Eurtec brick-by-brick \u2014 and Atomique \u2014 situated inside a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Neither club has seen \"Le Shaq\", but both have plans to book him soon.</p>\n<p>Valhalla is the first club to give them trouble. The abandoned mattress factory is overrun by neo-Nazi thugs, all benefiting from the lack of dram laws in Eurtec. It's obvious that Shaq hasn't been there, but they ask the bouncer anyways.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck off, cripple,\" he says to Shaw.</p>\n<p>The Foundation agent clenches her fists, causing the bouncer to laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Aw, you wanna fight, dyke?\" He takes a step back, up onto a step. \"What are you gonna do now?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer sucker punches him in the gut. The man collapses in a heap.</p>\n<p>\"That,\" Shaw says. \"Thanks for the assist.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fucking Nazis.\" Spencer spits on the fallen bouncer. \"Let's get out of here.\"</p>\n<p>The next club on their list is the Count, a bougie little opium den allegedly run by Dracula. The dance floor is packed by eager goths with plunging necklines all grinding to a club remix of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". Shaq has not played there.</p>\n<p>Borealis is another Nazi club. They skip it and move on to Volts, the only club to be exclusively located in virtual reality. Spencer orders a shot, just to see if viritual alcohol has any effect. It doesn't.</p>\n<p>They don't find Shaq until the ninth club, a high-end dive run by <a href=\"/truth-is-sin\">MachineGod</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Look, there's Shaq.\" Spencer points up at the stage where Shaq is playing.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, you were right,\" Shaw says. \"Point for old-fashioned police work, I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Come on, we don't have much time.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a loud scream cuts through the noise of the club. Spencer and Shaw turn to look at its origin. On the other side of the club, another Shaquille O'Neal has picked someone up and thrown them across the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\"Shaquille O'Neal!\" Its voice booms and reverberates unnaturally. Shaq stops playing and looks at the robot in confusion.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want?\" He calls down.</p>\n<p>\"Your life!\" The robot strides through the now-panicked crowd, easily cutting through the throng of bodies.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, the plane landed early,\" Spencer says. \"Shaw, can you distract it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? What's your plan?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer reaches elbow-deep into one of the extradimensional pockets of his suit and extracts a sawn-off shotgun. \"I'm gonna blow its head off.\"</p>\n<p>He slips into the crowd, vanishing from view. Shaw shakes her head, then starts wheeling herself towards the stage, not caring how many feet she runs over in the process.</p>\n<p>The Saker vaults onto the stage with surprising agility, landing in a three-point stance. It picks up the DJ deck and throws it directly at Shaq's head.</p>\n<p>Shaq ducks underneath the still-spinning turntables. With a yell, he charges the robot and tackles it, sending them both flying off the edge of the stage. With the robot pinned beneath him, Shaq rears back and throws a punch at its jaw.</p>\n<p>The Saker doesn't react.</p>\n<p>Shaq punches it again.</p>\n<p>The Saker catches the punch in one hand.</p>\n<p>With its other hand it grabs Shaq by the throat. It sits up, then clambers to its feet while holding the struggling Shaq. It still doesn't react to the stray kicks and wild punches that Shaq is pummeling it with.</p>\n<p>It lifts Shaq into the air with one arm and studies him. The sight is almost comical, except that it betrays the terrifying strength of the robot.</p>\n<p>\"There can't be two Shaqs,\" it explains. \"I cannot truly be Shaq as long as you live.\"</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot pulls its other arm back and prepares to punch Shaq in the face.</p>\n<p>Shaw does not have a plan. She has an idea which, very charitably, could be called the start of a plan.</p>\n<p>\"Freeze tin man!\" Shaw shouts out. She holds up a clenched fist. \"Let Shaq go, or I blow us all to hell.\"</p>\n<p>The robot freezes. \"Not you again! What do you want from me?\"</p>\n<p>\"I told you, let Shaq go.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Shaw sees Spencer creeping up behind the robot.</p>\n<p>\"And if I don't, you'll detonate a bomb?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"This wheelchair is packed with high explosives. Enough to destroy you.\" A loud click comes from her fist. \"And I just armed the dead-man's switch.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lady are you fucking crazy?\" Shaq shouts.</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot frowns. \"You're bluffing. You'd kill the other Shaq too.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw stares at the robot, pointedly avoiding looking at the approaching figure. \"You're gonna kill him anyways. I'm just here to destroy you.\"</p>\n<p>The Saker shakes its head. \"No. You are definitely bluffing. There is no bomb. I am going to kill Mr. O'Neal, and then I am going to kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wrong.\" Spencer pulls the trigger of the sawn-off shotgun, firing a heavy slug at point blank range into the back of the robot's neck.</p>\n<p>The Saker drops Shaq and stumbles forwards. It turns, unsteadily, to face Spencer. Sparks fly from exposed servos underneath its bionic skin.</p>\n<p>Spencer pumps the shotgun and fires another round into its torso.</p>\n<p>The robot throws up an arm to try and shield itself.</p>\n<p>He fires again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>The robot topples to its knees. Smoke and oil leak from it in a dozen places. Flaps of shredded skin hang loosely, revealing the mechanical components beneath. It stares at Spencer with hatred in its electric eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 just wanted.. to be Shaq\u2026\" it stutters.</p>\n<p>Shaw rolls her wheelchair closer. She draws her service pistol and places it against the side of the robot's head.</p>\n<p>\"There's only one Shaq,\" she says. \"And you aren't it.\"</p>\n<p>She pulls the trigger.</p>\n<p>The remains of the robot collapse to the floor with a clatter and a thump.</p>\n<p>Spencer gives Shaw a look. \"You don't actually have a bomb, right?\"</p>\n<p>She shakes her head and opens her fist to reveal a ballpoint pen. \"Nope, just a pen and some improv.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer laughs so hard that he has to put his hands on his knees to support himself. \"A fucking pen!\" He laughs again. \"Thorne is never gonna believe this.\"</p>\n<p>Shaq takes the opportunity to approach the two agents. \"Yo, what the fuck is going on here? Who the hell are you?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods, clearing his throat and composing himself. \"Mr. O'Neal, I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer of the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, and this is Clarissa Shaw. Someone replaced you with a human replica android. We were investigating.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that was me.\" Shaq looks slightly embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\"You replaced yourself with a robot?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, last time I was here there was this guy \u2014 I think his name was <a href=\"/ties-that-bind\">Isaac</a>? \u2014 anyways, he was selling these robots for use as body doubles. I got one to do <em>Inside the NBA</em> for me so I could do more DJing.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw and Spencer exchange glances.</p>\n<p>\"Well.\" Spencer pauses.</p>\n<p>\"It malfunctioned,\" Shaw says. \"And came here to try and kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, for real?\" Shaq whistles. \"Damn, I guess I should have seen that coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh, you never hear about the robots that don't go rogue and try to commit murder,\" Spencer says. \"I just hope you've learned something about the risks of using Veiled technologies.\"</p>\n<p>Shaq nods. \"Definitely. From now on the only magic I'll play with is Orlando.\"</p>\n<p>\"Glad to hear it.\" Spencer looks around at the now-empty nightclub. \"Shouldn't the police have gotten here by now?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw shrugs. \"Precog computers, remember? They probably know we've got a handle on it.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods. \"Yeah, I guess. Anything else, Shaw?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. O'Neal, do you care if we keep the remains of the robot to study?\"</p>\n<p>Shaq shakes his head. \"Not like I can return it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, then I think we're done here,\" Spencer says. \"It was a real pleasure meeting you, Mr. O'Neal.\"</p>\n<p>He turns to leave, then stops.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Mr. O'Neal, one last thing.\" Spencer clears his throat nervously. \"Can I have your autograph?\"</p>\n<div class=\"permanent-marker-regular\" style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 165%;\">\n<p>Agent Spencer,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Thanks for the assist.

He stares at the Foundation agent sitting on the other side of his desk, making no effort to conceal his disbelief.\n\n\n\n\"You think Shaquille O'Neal, four-time NBA champion and fifteen-time All-Star, is a robot.\"\n\n\n\nClarissa Shaw stares back defiantly. \"I know it.\"\n\n\n\nShe rolls her wheelchair forwards so she can slap a manila file folder on his desk. \"I have evidence.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer makes no moves to take the folder. \"Why are you bothering me? Shouldn't you be taking this to Merlo? Or is she too busy ignoring our extradition requests?\"\n\n\n\nThe mention of Anderson, even obliquely, causes Shaw to wince. Spencer guesses that she was part of the task force that [[[bal-chatri|ambushed Vincent Anderson]]] as [[[falcon-flight|he fled Portlands]]], snatching the megalomaniac genius and wanted felon right out from under the nose of the UIU. It would certainly explain her injuries.\n\n\n\n\"Merlo has her hands tied. Now that Anderson is in custody, there isn't as much funding to go after his company. Holman won't approve an op without concrete evidence. Everyone thinks I'm grasping at straws to find a way to stay involved in the action.\" The hurt in Shaw's voice is obvious.\n\n\n\nSpencer has enough tact to not press that issue. But he still doesn't want to get involved. His partner, forensic thaumatologist Robin Thorne, is taking a much-needed vacation with their significant other, leaving him to supervise the Three Portlands Field Office alone.\n\n\n\nSo far, it has been blissfully monotonous and uneventful, and he hopes to keep it that way.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that Clarissa, but I fail to see why this is my problem.\"\n\n\n\n\"Because Shaq is an American citizen, and if he's been replaced by a Saker, then he might be in danger. And because if there's a Saker still out there, we have no idea what it will do now that Anderson is in custody. It may very well go on a rampage, or try to kill the President. Anderson has already tried to subvert the United States Government. Can you really afford to ignore a Saker, especially one as prominent as Shaq?\"\n\n\n\n\"//If// there's a Saker,\" Spencer counters. But he has to give the point to Shaw. If she's right -- //if// -- then he has to act. Anything less would be negligence.\n\n\n\nHe picks up the folder and cracks it open. He starts leafing through the files within.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\" He removes a photograph and holds it up to examine it more closely. It's a side-by-side comparison of two still frames of Shaquille O'Neal from //Inside the NBA//, date-stamped a week apart. Shaw had used red marker pen to circle a number of differences, all barely perceptible.\n\n\n\nSpencer looks up from the photograph at Shaw. Looks back at the photograph. Back at Shaw.\n\n\n\nShe desperately needs a win. Far more than he needs things to stay boring.\n\n\n\n\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n\nHe throws the folder back on the desk and stands up, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and sliding it on in a smooth, well-practiced motion. He looks at Shaw expectantly. \"Well? Saddle up, we're going robot hunting.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n**December 19, 2018**\n\n**Shaq's House**\n\n**Orlando, Florida**\n\n\n\nSpencer rings the doorbell.\n\n\n\n\"I still think we should have tried to get backup from MOOT,\" Shaw says while they wait.\n\n\n\n\"Thorne took out one of these things by themself, I think the two of us can handle one robot,\" Spencer replies. \"Besides, he might not even be here. He wasn't at the house in Texas.\"\n\n\n\n\"And if it is here? I'd rather have a wizard backing us up.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shrugs. \"We're just here to ask a few questions and see if we can confirm our suspicions. We can always come back later with wizard SWAT if we're right.\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose. I still don't like it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, you came to me. If you don't like how we do things in the Unit, you can always leave.\"\n\n\n\nThey fall silent at the sound of someone unlocking the door.\n\n\n\nShaq opens the door.\n\n\n\nSpencer shuffles nervously, his cool facade crumbling slightly in the face of all seven feet and one inch of the basketball player's enormous frame.\n\n\n\n\"Hi, Mr. O'Neal. I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer\u2014\" He holds up his badge as proof, then gestures at Shaw. \"\u2014and this is Agent Clarissa Shaw. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?\"\n\n\n\nShaq hesitates. \"Is it urgent? I'm working on a new album, and I had a sick freestyle going.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm very sorry to interrupt you,\" Spencer says. \"But we have reason to believe you might be in danger.\"\n\n\n\n\"We think someone might be impersonating you,\" Shaw says, which is almost the truth.\n\n\n\n\"Have you noticed anything strange?\" Spencer asks. \"Unusual activity on your accounts, other people remembering interactions that you didn't have, weird phone calls, anything like that?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, nothing like that.\" Shaq sighs. \"I bet I know what's up.\" He leans closer and says, in a stage whisper, \"I have a stunt double, back from making //Steel//. Great guy, terrible at basketball. Sometimes people see him in public and think he's me. You dig it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I dig it.\" Spencer smiles brightly. \"Shaq didn't have a stunt double for that movie. They couldn't find a tall enough look-a-like.\"\n\n\n\nPanic flashes across Shaq's face. \"Fuck!\"\n\n\n\nHe slams the door shut.\n\n\n\nShaw groans. \"We've been made. He's definitely a Saker, and he knows we're onto him.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods. \"You know, I think you might be right.\" He pulls out his pistol and holds it at the ready below his waist. \"Can you cover the front? I'm gonna try to circle around and cut him off.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you really suggesting we split up so it can pick us off one-by-one?\"\n\n\n\nBut he's already jogging across the driveway, scanning for an easy spot to vault over the wall and into the backyard.\n\n\n\nHe's still standing in the driveway when, a moment later, an engine roars and a cherry red Corvette smashes through the garage door. In fact, he's directly in its path.\n\n\n\nThe car hits Spencer at about five miles per hour, lifting him from the ground and folding him up against the hood. He clings desperately to the car with one hand, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Miraculously, his other hand still holds his pistol.\n\n\n\nHe aims vaguely and starts firing. His first shot goes wide. His second shot gouges the hood. His third shot takes out the driver-side mirror.\n\n\n\nThe Corvette accelerates and weaves down the driveway, trying to throw him off, or at least ruin his aim. His pistol goes flying, tumbling into the grass of the lawn. He starts swearing, random curse words from a variety of languages, and tries to hold on with both hands.\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot takes the corner at the end of the driveway hard. Really hard. The Corvette goes up on two wheels for a moment, and Spencer goes flying. He lands in a patch of dandelions across the street, bruised, battered, and winded, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The Corvette speeds off down the street and vanishes from view.\n\n\n\nShaw rolls down the driveway and looks down at him. \"Do you want to call for backup now?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I think so.\" Spencer rubs his back and winces. \"Did you see which way he was going?\"\n\n\n\n\"South,\" Shaw saws. \"He's probably getting onto State Route 482.\"\n\n\n\n\"That'll take him to the airport.\" He groans as he stands up and starts dusting dandelion fluff off his pants.\n\n\n\n\"Great, let's go, we can catch him there.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shakes his head. \"No, we're not engaging in the middle of MCO. It would be a blood bath.\" He pulls out his phone and begins to dial.\n\n\n\n\"What--?\"\n\n\n\nHe holds up a hand to cut her off and starts speaking into the phone.\n\n\n\n\"[[[quinn-law-hub|Agent Carter]]]? Ken Spencer here, from the Three Ports office. I need a favor from you.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses to listen.\n\n\n\n\"I need an APB for Shaquille O'Neal. He's driving a red Corvette without a left-side wing mirror, and is likely en route to Orlando International Airport. Tell local cops and TSA not to engage or try to detain, just observe. I want to know what flight he gets on and when.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses again. Shaw can't hear the words being said, but the voice on the other end of the line sounds agitated.\n\n\n\n\"No, he's been replaced by a robot.\"\n\n\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's related to the Caldwell thing. It's a matter of national security.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice sounds slightly mollified.\n\n\n\nSpencer laughs. \"Thanks, Isaac. I owe you one.\"\n\n\n\nHe closes the phone and looks at Shaw. \"In your expert opinion, do you believe that there is a clear and exigent threat to the life of Shaquille O'Neal?\"\n\n\n\nShaw blinks. \"It's possible.\"\n\n\n\n\"And is it possible that we might find him inside this residence, or, failing that, information regarding his current location?\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer smiles like a shark. \"I'm willing to call that exigent circumstances.\" He pulls a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and snaps them on. \"Let's search the place.\"\n\n\n\nThey move methodically, sweeping through each room with practiced patience, checking everything -- opening drawers, lifting up cushions, looking under furniture. Spencer even checks the dust on the bookshelves to see which books have recently been moved. They're looking for any clue that might tell them where the real Shaq is -- if he's even still alive.\n\n\n\nEventually, after almost forty minutes of searching, Shaw finds something.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, come take a look at this!\" she calls out.\n\n\n\nSpencer comes over to find her pointing at a framed photograph next to the entertainment center.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\" he asks. The photo shows Shaq performing as a DJ at some event.\n\n\n\n\"Look at that, do you see it? Reflected in his sunglasses.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer leans in for a better look. Shaq is in a nightclub somewhere, performing on an elevated stage above a crowded dance floor. A dozen different colors of muted neon light the scene, giving it an otherworldly vibe.\n\n\n\nReflected in the left lens of Shaq's sunglasses, almost too small to make out, is a small logo, probably from a neon sign outside the nightclub.\n\n\n\nIt's the logo of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.\n\n\n\n\"Fucking hell.\" Spencer picks up the photograph and holds it up to the light. \"That's in Eurtec.\"\n\n\n\n\"Or somewhere with a Coalition presence,\" Shaw says.\n\n\n\n\"No, it's definitely Eurtec. Look at that guy's wrist.\" Spencer points at an arm thrusting up from the dance floor into the bottom of the photograph. \"Do you see the tattoo?\"\n\n\n\nShaw squints, then nods. \"What about it?\"\n\n\n\n\"That's the insignia of a neo-Nazi Eurtec street gang.\"\n\n\n\n\"So he's been to Eurtec,\" Shaw says. \"Which means he's clued in about the Veil.\"\n\n\n\n\"Which explains why someone might want to replace him with a robot.\" Spencer sets the photograph back down and begins to pace. \"This isn't looking good. He might be in real trouble.\"\n\n\n\nAt that moment, Spencer's phone rings, merrily playing the X-Files theme. He answers the phone immediately, pointedly ignoring Shaw's curious look.\n\n\n\n\"Go for Spencer,\" he says.\n\n\n\nHe listens intently for about thirty seconds, then hangs up.\n\n\n\n\"Robot's taking a flight to Paris,\" he tells Shaw. \"Plane leaves in thiry minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's in Paris?\" she asks.\n\n\n\nSpencer looks at the photograph of Shaq DJing. \"Eurtec.\"\n\n\n\nUnderstanding dawns in Shaw's eyes. \"It's looking for Shaq.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe.\" Spencer frowns. \"Is that typical of Sakers?\"\n\n\n\nShaw shrugs. \"We don't really know what's typical of Sakers.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thought you guys were the experts.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, that's the guy who makes them. We just know how to break them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's hope that's enough.\" Spencer starts dialing another number. \"I assume you don't have Library access, yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, why? Who are you calling?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Someone who can give us a Way to Eurtec that doesn't go through the Library.\" He lifts the phone to his ear and starts speaking. \"Hello, [[[much-belated-inheritance|Mister Raybon]]]? This is Agent Spencer. How'd you like to do a good deed? The life of Shaquille O'Neal might depend on it.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Eurtec**\n\n\n\nIt takes Spencer and Shaw two hours to get to Eurtec, following the directions given to them by Jordan \"Submarine\" Raybon. The retired smuggler knows how to get to anywhere from anywhere, although not always by the most direct route. He gives them a path through the Way network that will take them from Orlando to Naples, Italy. Although it's only a few miles of walking in total, by the time the two agents are standing before a Way into Eurtec they've passed through the Neverglades; Naples, Florida; Liminal Italy; the Kingdom of Zero Sicilies; and half-a-dozen other locales across the world tree.\n\n\n\n\"You ever been to Eurtec?\" Spencer asks.\n\n\n\nShaw shakes her head. \"No, the Coalition doesn't like us being here.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can't imagine why.\" He starts ticking off points on his fingers. \"It's bigger than Three Ports, by a lot, and meaner. The Coalition mostly doesn't give a fuck about street crime. The city is physically and economically stratified, and neo-Nazi gangs control the lower levels. We won't have any real authority, so don't tell anyone you're with the Foundation, it'll just piss people off. You can bring weapons through customs but it probably won't help -- almost everyone is armed with something, usually magic.\"\n\n\n\n\"What about wheelchair access?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\nSpencer frowns. \"Worse than an American city,\u00a0\u00a0better than anywhere in baseline Europe. There used to be a teleporter network but they shut it down after 9/11.\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn, that would have been nice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can't have anything nice in the United Nations' cyberpunk dystopia.\" Spencer chuckles, once, before his expression turns serious again. \"For real though, this place makes Portlands look like a fluffy kitten -- and I have seen Portlandsers spontaneously construct and burn an effigy of J. Edgar Hoover purely out of boredom.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you blame them?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"No, and it was a pretty decent likeness, but that's not the point. Just being American will make us a target here. Don't let your guard down.\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"Understood. I'll keep my eyes open.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer steps forwards to confront the blank brick wall of the Neopolitan alleyway. He pulls a crumpled slip of paper from his pocket and double-checks the instructions written on it.\n\n\n\nHe clears his throat, knocks three times on a slightly off-color brick, and says, \"Let us leave good sense behind.\"\n\n\n\nThe bricks glow for a moment, then crumble to sand and ash, exposing a small pedestrian tunnel. Spencer leads them through, emerging into what looks like an airport terminal. Over a dozen similar tunnels dot the wall behind them, with light pedestrian traffic going in and out of them.\n\n\n\n\"I thought you said there was customs?\" Shaw looks around for anything resembling security and comes up blank.\n\n\n\n\"The city is run by a bunch of precognitive computers. We cleared customs on the Way in. If we hadn't, you'd know.\"\n\n\n\nShaw looks pensive. \"Could they tell us where Shaq is? Or where he will be?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shrugs. \"Probably. If they want to help us, then they'd have already done it -- maybe they even have. But I doubt it. From what I've heard, the Nornir don't get involved. They have bigger things to worry about.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, like Yao Ming.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer barks out a short laugh. \"Sure. Like Yao Ming.\" He checks his watch. \"Come on, we have six hours to find Shaq. Then the Saker gets here, and I don't want to try playing spot the impostor.\"\n\n\n\nThey both set a timer on their watches.\n\n\n\n\"How exactly are we going to find Shaq?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Some good old-fashioned police work,\" Spencer says. \"We're gonna canvas the city.\"\n\n\n\n\"All million people? In six hours?\" Shaw shakes her head. \"You're more likely to trip over him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" He stops the next passerby and holds up a Shaquille O'Neal basketball card. \"Excuse me, have you seen this man?\"\n\n\n\nThe man nods. \"Shaq? Of course, I wouldn't miss him.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer glances at Shaw. She rolls her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Where did you see him?\" Spencer asks.\n\n\n\n\"He was playing at Club Cipher,\" the man replies. \"But if you're hoping to catch him, he won't be there tonight. He's been playing a different venue every night.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods, feigning comprehension. \"Any idea where he'll be tonight?\"\n\n\n\nThe man shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't get announced in advance. It's like a guerilla DJing thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, thank you. You've been very helpful.\" He lets the man continue on his way.\n\n\n\n\"Alright there's no way you're that lucky,\" Shaw says. \"What's your trick?\"\n\n\n\n\"That photo we saw of Shaq,\" Spencer says. \"He was playing at a club. I figured that if he was here and not, you know, a prisoner or dead, then there was a pretty good chance he'd be performing again.\"\n\n\n\n\"You never actually intended to canvas the whole city.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope! Just the nightclubs.\" Spencer grabs a tourist map of Eurtec from a nearby stand. \"And with a few educated guesses, we can narrow our search further.\"\n\n\n\nHe pulls a pen from his pocket and crosses out Club Cipher.\n\n\n\n\"Right, if we know where he's been then we know where he won't be,\" Shaw says.\n\n\n\n\"And it might give us an idea of where he will be. Cipher is a dive, which suggests he's probably not playing any of the really upscale clubs -- you know, the ones that charge a cover just to stand in line.\"\n\n\n\n\"How do you know so much about Eurtec?\" Shaw asks. \"The UIU doesn't have jurisdiction here \"\n\n\n\n\"No, but we have an international office here. For liaison purposes. I read their reports.\" Spencer shrugs. \"And I may have been here a few times on vacation.\"\n\n\n\nShaw stares at him. \"I cannot picture you on vacation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, I'm not a robot,\" he says. \"I take vacations too.\" He holds up the map, upon which he has drawn about a dozen circles. \"Here's our target list. Thirteen nightclubs in the city's lower level.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can we hit them all in six hours?\"\n\n\n\n\"We can try.\"\n\n\n\nThey manage it, just barely. Canvassing the city's nightclubs takes them five hours and fifty minutes.\n\n\n\nTheir first stop is Ewige Blumenkraft, an Illuminati-owned nightclub inside the Eurtec Parabotanical Gardens in the city's middle-tier. It is widely considered the lamest club in Europe, but the Illuminati have the money to pay for the best DJs, so people still go. The bouncer helpfully informs them that Shaq played there a week ago, and that the Achronal Hyacinth will be unblooming soon.\n\n\n\nTheir second visit is to BROZ, a gay club inside the former Yugoslav consulate. The centerpiece is an unexploded bomb from the NATO intervention in Serbia, which is allegedly still armed. The bartender tells them that Shaq was there a few days ago.\n\n\n\nNext they hit the French clubs, Paradis -- a discotheque inside a former Gothic church that was transported to Eurtec brick-by-brick -- and Atomique -- situated inside a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Neither club has seen \"Le Shaq\", but both have plans to book him soon.\n\n\n\nValhalla is the first club to give them trouble. The abandoned mattress factory is overrun by neo-Nazi thugs, all benefiting from the lack of dram laws in Eurtec. It's obvious that Shaq hasn't been there, but they ask the bouncer anyways.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck off, cripple,\" he says to Shaw.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation agent clenches her fists, causing the bouncer to laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Aw, you wanna fight, dyke?\" He takes a step back, up onto a step. \"What are you gonna do now?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer sucker punches him in the gut. The man collapses in a heap.\n\n\n\n\"That,\" Shaw says. \"Thanks for the assist.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fucking Nazis.\" Spencer spits on the fallen bouncer. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\n\n\nThe next club on their list is the Count, a bougie little opium den allegedly run by Dracula. The dance floor is packed by eager goths with plunging necklines all grinding to a club remix of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". Shaq has not played there.\n\n\n\nBorealis is another Nazi club. They skip it and move on to Volts, the only club to be exclusively located in virtual reality. Spencer orders a shot, just to see if viritual alcohol has any effect. It doesn't.\n\n\n\nThey don't find Shaq until the ninth club, a high-end dive run by [[[truth-is-sin|MachineGod]]].\n\n\n\n\"Look, there's Shaq.\" Spencer points up at the stage where Shaq is playing.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, you were right,\" Shaw says. \"Point for old-fashioned police work, I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Come on, we don't have much time.\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a loud scream cuts through the noise of the club. Spencer and Shaw turn to look at its origin. On the other side of the club, another Shaquille O'Neal has picked someone up and thrown them across the dance floor.\n\n\n\n\"Shaquille O'Neal!\" Its voice booms and reverberates unnaturally. Shaq stops playing and looks at the robot in confusion.\n\n\n\n\"What do you want?\" He calls down.\n\n\n\n\"Your life!\" The robot strides through the now-panicked crowd, easily cutting through the throng of bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck, the plane landed early,\" Spencer says. \"Shaw, can you distract it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why? What's your plan?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer reaches elbow-deep into one of the extradimensional pockets of his suit and extracts a sawn-off shotgun. \"I'm gonna blow its head off.\"\n\n\n\nHe slips into the crowd, vanishing from view. Shaw shakes her head, then starts wheeling herself towards the stage, not caring how many feet she runs over in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Saker vaults onto the stage with surprising agility, landing in a three-point stance. It picks up the DJ deck and throws it directly at Shaq's head.\n\n\n\nShaq ducks underneath the still-spinning turntables. With a yell, he charges the robot and tackles it, sending them both flying off the edge of the stage. With the robot pinned beneath him, Shaq rears back and throws a punch at its jaw.\n\n\n\nThe Saker doesn't react.\n\n\n\nShaq punches it again.\n\n\n\nThe Saker catches the punch in one hand.\n\n\n\nWith its other hand it grabs Shaq by the throat. It sits up, then clambers to its feet while holding the struggling Shaq. It still doesn't react to the stray kicks and wild punches that Shaq is pummeling it with.\n\n\n\nIt lifts Shaq into the air with one arm and studies him. The sight is almost comical, except that it betrays the terrifying strength of the robot.\n\n\n\n\"There can't be two Shaqs,\" it explains. \"I cannot truly be Shaq as long as you live.\"\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot pulls its other arm back and prepares to punch Shaq in the face.\n\n\n\nShaw does not have a plan. She has an idea which, very charitably, could be called the start of a plan.\n\n\n\n\"Freeze tin man!\" Shaw shouts out. She holds up a clenched fist. \"Let Shaq go, or I blow us all to hell.\"\n\n\n\nThe robot freezes. \"Not you again! What do you want from me?\"\n\n\n\n\"I told you, let Shaq go.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Shaw sees Spencer creeping up behind the robot.\n\n\n\n\"And if I don't, you'll detonate a bomb?\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"This wheelchair is packed with high explosives. Enough to destroy you.\" A loud click comes from her fist. \"And I just armed the dead-man's switch.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lady are you fucking crazy?\" Shaq shouts.\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot frowns. \"You're bluffing. You'd kill the other Shaq too.\"\n\n\n\nShaw stares at the robot, pointedly avoiding looking at the approaching figure. \"You're gonna kill him anyways. I'm just here to destroy you.\"\n\n\n\nThe Saker shakes its head. \"No. You are definitely bluffing. There is no bomb. I am going to kill Mr. O'Neal, and then I am going to kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wrong.\" Spencer pulls the trigger of the sawn-off shotgun, firing a heavy slug at point blank range into the back of the robot's neck.\n\n\n\nThe Saker drops Shaq and stumbles forwards. It turns, unsteadily, to face Spencer. Sparks fly from exposed servos underneath its bionic skin.\n\n\n\nSpencer pumps the shotgun and fires another round into its torso.\n\n\n\nThe robot throws up an arm to try and shield itself.\n\n\n\nHe fires again.\n\n\n\nAnd again.\n\n\n\nAnd again.\n\n\n\nThe robot topples to its knees. Smoke and oil leak from it in a dozen places. Flaps of shredded skin hang loosely, revealing the mechanical components beneath. It stares at Spencer with hatred in its electric eyes.\n\n\n\n\"I... just wanted.. to be Shaq...\" it stutters.\n\n\n\nShaw rolls her wheelchair closer. She draws her service pistol and places it against the side of the robot's head.\n\n\n\n\"There's only one Shaq,\" she says. \"And you aren't it.\"\n\n\n\nShe pulls the trigger.\n\n\n\nThe remains of the robot collapse to the floor with a clatter and a thump.\n\n\n\nSpencer gives Shaw a look. \"You don't actually have a bomb, right?\"\n\n\n\nShe shakes her head and opens her fist to reveal a ballpoint pen. \"Nope, just a pen and some improv.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer laughs so hard that he has to put his hands on his knees to support himself. \"A fucking pen!\" He laughs again. \"Thorne is never gonna believe this.\"\n\n\n\nShaq takes the opportunity to approach the two agents. \"Yo, what the fuck is going on here? Who the hell are you?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods, clearing his throat and composing himself. \"Mr. O'Neal, I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer of the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, and this is Clarissa Shaw. Someone replaced you with a human replica android. We were investigating.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that was me.\" Shaq looks slightly embarrassed.\n\n\n\n\"You replaced yourself with a robot?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, last time I was here there was this guy -- I think his name was [[[ties-that-bind|Isaac]]]? -- anyways, he was selling these robots for use as body doubles. I got one to do //Inside the NBA// for me so I could do more DJing.\"\n\n\n\nShaw and Spencer exchange glances.\n\n\n\n\"Well.\" Spencer pauses.\n\n\n\n\"It malfunctioned,\" Shaw says. \"And came here to try and kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fuck, for real?\" Shaq whistles. \"Damn, I guess I should have seen that coming.\"\n\n\n\n\"Eh, you never hear about the robots that don't go rogue and try to commit murder,\" Spencer says. \"I just hope you've learned something about the risks of using Veiled technologies.\"\n\n\n\nShaq nods. \"Definitely. From now on the only magic I'll play with is Orlando.\"\n\n\n\n\"Glad to hear it.\" Spencer looks around at the now-empty nightclub. \"Shouldn't the police have gotten here by now?\"\n\n\n\nShaw shrugs. \"Precog computers, remember? They probably know we've got a handle on it.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods. \"Yeah, I guess. Anything else, Shaw?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. O'Neal, do you care if we keep the remains of the robot to study?\"\n\n\n\nShaq shakes his head. \"Not like I can return it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, then I think we're done here,\" Spencer says. \"It was a real pleasure meeting you, Mr. O'Neal.\"\n\n\n\nHe turns to leave, then stops.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Mr. O'Neal, one last thing.\" Spencer clears his throat nervously. \"Can I have your autograph?\"\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n\n\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Permanent+Marker&display=swap');\n\n\n\n.permanent-marker-regular {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0font-family: \"Permanent Marker\", cursive;\n\n}\n\n\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"permanent-marker-regular\" style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 165%;\"]]\n\nAgent Spencer,\n\n\n\n= Thanks for the assist.

A train that only travels at night, but never sees dawn. If you stand outside, alone on a platform, surrounded by darkness \u2014 and if you are truly, hopelessly lost \u2014 you will hear its whistle.</p>\n<p>It comes to you, so you might find your resolution.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Three new passengers.<br/>\nTwo departures.</p>\n<p>The train has brought us to the space between the mountains again, and I am once again plagued by the idea that the train knows things I do not. In a way, we cannot be definitive \u2014 as much as a Train requires a Conductor, a Conductor needs a Train. We all need a purpose and a reason, and sometimes existence is all you can get.</p>\n<p>The train has always had a will of its own, far before the tracks were laid and the first iron wheel began to spin. Before, we travelled with the breeze, following the current forwards and backwards without a care. I would stand, ostensibly setting the direction of our journey, the one watched by others, the one in 'control'.</p>\n<p>They would look to me for answers then. In that way, things are no different now than they once were.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite the eons of service \u2014 I still do not have the answers they need.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I find myself flipping through the pages of the logbook, recalling past lives and forgotten memories. I think about the faces, the blur, the blend \u2014 and I think about the flame burning at the heart of the train. A flame that has always burned, an idea that will continue so long as there is a need; they will always need the train.</p>\n<p>The Train will always need a Conductor.</p>\n<p>I follow the will of the tracks, leaving the destination to the beating heart of fire. I serve the vessel, as I always have: collecting passengers, lost and wayward souls, the ones left behind and stuck in the cracks. I do what I can, so that they still have a chance.</p>\n<p>Nothing matters beyond that.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a train not bound by tracks \u2014 it uses those that exist, when convenient, but it is never restricted. A train that goes where it desires, laying new tracks before its cast-bronze wheels; each track laid will leave with the train, the absence of one whom is unremembered as the only evidence that it ever was. When this train comes, the departure is final.</p>\n<p>But the train is not your end.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ten new passengers.<br/>\nOne departure.</p>\n<p>The South Pacific has always been a favorite of mine, watching the sun set over the golden waves as nature takes domain over the night. Humanity conquered the daytime long ago, nature having lost their claim; it escaped to the darkness, where man dared not tread. It hid in the spaces between, waiting for the times that exist around the world we have made.</p>\n<p>Nighttime is a reminder of how the world once was, as I remember it.</p>\n<p>But the world changed, for a time. What were once clean lines drawn in the sand became ambiguous and debated as people searched for identity, for meaning, for a place to belong. The world grew, far beyond the constraints it had once faced \u2014 oceans became puddles, as bridges turned rivers into trickles. Humanity bent the world to fit what was seen as progress, to remake our lives and remove the dirty parts that we wish to forget.</p>\n<p>And, just as quickly as the world changed \u2014 it became stuck.</p>\n<p>Today, a passenger finally departed, one who had rode the train for years. They were as much of a fixture as I, a guide and mentor to the newly departed who just boarded, a friend to those living in the mire. I respected them, as I watched their search for meaning; I am happy that they found what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>I stood beside the others, all watching them leave in envy \u2014 something that has become a twisted tradition onboard. A going away party, where you are wished well by those who envy your freedom; there is little joy to be shared in the moment, but hope? Hope blossoms.</p>\n<p>I saw their face for the first time, as they departed the train. We tend to lose who we are while stuck in the mire, finding ourselves only once we come up for air; I watched as he took his first breath, the crisp ocean breeze filling his lungs with life.</p>\n<p>I waited for him to disappear, fade away, to be freed from the endless repetition; I stared, as is my twisted tradition, endlessly watching those that get to pass on. Every single time, I wait for their liberation; instead, I see their persistence.</p>\n<p>Why do they always choose to persist?</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I am glad for them. Resolution is a goal we all seek, and I have lived my existence in the service of that ideal. I serve a true purpose, a desperate need in a frozen world. I give others what I cannot have, because they were denied it in kind. After all, there is always a need to tip the scales for a world stuck in one place.</p>\n<p>Things no longer change, not things that matter. The world exists as a series of cycles, loops, origins and destinations and the tracks that go back and forth. The train exists beyond the patterns, but even still \u2014 the wheels spin, grinding along the bronze rails, a mimicry of the patterns of life.</p>\n<p>Life turns to death, work turns to sleep, day turns to night and love turns to misery. Nothing is stagnant, no matter how much we will it to be. No matter how little we need a cycle, it persists regardless. Wheels spinning, something set in motion before you were born, that will continue to turn long after you are gone.</p>\n<p>When the passenger departed today, they finally escaped one of the patterns. They were able to find their peace, whatever that meant to them.</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I had a hand in this; I am no more responsible for their resolutions than I am for the train. It is enough to serve.</p>\n<p>Part of me knows that I do not matter, and that were I do fade away, another would rise to take my place. Repetition follows us all, and I am bound to rings of fate just like my passengers.</p>\n<p>But what would happen if I left and the axle was broken?</p>\n<p>What if, without a Conductor, the Train no longer remains?</p>\n<p>I continue to stoke the fires at the heart of the bronze beast, feeding its raging purpose. I cannot risk leaving the world to the whims of fate. I will continue to keep the wheels spinning, so that one day, we may all find our endings.</p>\n<p>And maybe then, I can finally rest.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a train for the lost, the damned, the forgotten \u2014 it comes to you in your time of need. It serves not as your resting place, nor as your salvation. They say the train is nothing more than an illusory nadir, a place to pass through, one that takes you from where you were to where you need to be. It exists, not as a destination, but as a facilitation.</p>\n<p>It exists because it is still needed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>One new passenger.<br/>\nOne new train car.</p>\n<p>No departures.</p>\n<p>The train elected to follow the rails of many worlds, bringing us to another destination in need of closure. As I write, the ocean hangs low in the sky overhead, a storm brewing as the coral-trees sway. The fish that flee overhead belong here, as do the people living under the leaking sky; but that does not mean they are any different than you, or I.</p>\n<p>The train goes where it is needed; its need is universal.</p>\n<p>It is not often I speak with my passengers. There is an unspoken understanding, the train speaking to them like a long-lost friend; they know what is needed of them, and they know what the train means. The drifting and the aimless see the train for what it is \u2014 a sanctuary.</p>\n<p>All salvation comes with a cost: but this price is one that I control. As the Conductor, there is little I can do to change the world. Bound to the rails just as the Train, I am a passenger through life; in that way, I am no different than those who ride the cars in search of meaning. And, while I cannot change the spots on the leopard, I can make a difference.</p>\n<p>The price is a single coin, as it always has been, and as it always will be.</p>\n<p>With the toll, you receive no ticket. Your obol earns you no guarantees of a destination, nor does it force you into a shape you reject. There is no authority to enforce payment, nor is there a profit to be made; it is a tradition, and that is sufficient. The coin is a trifle, a shared understanding between the passengers and I \u2014 we are each meant to be exactly where we are. We each understand that we belong.</p>\n<p>Your coin buys peace of mind, if only for a time.</p>\n<p>Comfort is a luxury. A luxury in a discomforting world, peace in a maelstrom of noise. We spend our lives in pursuit of the times between, chasing the escape from a painful reality. Some find comfort in others. Some make their work their world, pretending escape is nothing more than a fantasy. Some even find comfort in giving up.</p>\n<p>But that comfort never comes.</p>\n<p>Souls wait in dissonance, bound to the wheels that crush them with every spin, unable to leave their eternal torture; their suffering grows, and not even Lampeter can give salvation to all the riders. There are those who cannot accept the help, those who know not to ask \u2014 the train finds them.</p>\n<p>The train cuts the knots of their bindings and I am there to catch them.</p>\n<p>The new passenger today was a child. A youth, wrapped in seaweed-cloth, gills bristling under the fabric, lungs forced to labor as they had not before. Terrified \u2014 not of the train before them, but of the world that surrounded them, the world that abandoned them, the world they mistakenly believed was their home. But, of course, who would blame a child for these thoughts?</p>\n<p>Existence is relative, and time lingers in the beyond; they were as young as the day they were lost, afraid of a world they could not understand. They were alone, standing on the busy platform without a coin to spare. They had none that cared, nor those that remembered; they were never given the chance to earn their fare.</p>\n<p>There was nobody to place a coin over their eyes as they lay still. Lying, waiting for the train to arrive.</p>\n<p>It is days like this I am thankful there are holes in my pockets, and far too little time to mend them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a Train whose Conductor is simply an occupant, an extension of the will of the train. The Conductor would disagree \u2014 but in the same stale breath, claim that the Train and Conductor are one. They would say that neither can exist without the other. That is the way it always has been, and that is the way it always will be.</p>\n<p>Need lies at the heart of all things.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>No new passengers.<br/>\nNo departures.</p>\n<p>Three stops without making a difference.</p>\n<p>Stars. Forests. Seas of Blood. The scenery changed, but my feelings did not.</p>\n<p>I am filled with shame each time the train departs without the soul it found; some are not ready, others choose to reject this path. I wish I could change their minds, but that is not my role in things. You cannot force a resolution, just as you cannot demand a need.</p>\n<p>The need demands you.</p>\n<p>I do not remember the first passenger we had. I think not only of the history of the train and I, but of the times before when I would trail my hand through the rippling water, miasma filling the air; I cannot remember my origin, not do I need to.</p>\n<p>I do not know what force demanded my existence \u2014 but I know the need that I have always answered.</p>\n<p>We have always served the same need: we take those who do not belong, and ferry them to their final destination. We are the safety net, the lonely soul sweeping the alleyways, digging through the cracks and finding the ones the cycle threw out. The ones who rule the world, who live within the system and bend the patterns to their willpower: they do not need my help. They do not need a train to escape, for comfort cannot assist those who languish in opulence.</p>\n<p>I remain for the rest. The train charges forward, eternal, step by step through time. So long as there is a need, there will be a train. So long as there is a Train, there will be a Conductor.</p>\n<p>These days, I find myself reminiscing more and more of the times before I was the Conductor. I remember when I was no more than a big fish in a small pond, an aimless wanderer from the sticks, stuck in my own cycle. From shore to shore, I would travel back and forth; I do not remember the passengers, nor do I remember distinctions. I only remember the time as a whole, as a memory that I once lived, but is now faded.</p>\n<p>I was lost then, too. I did not know purpose was something I could need, let alone something to want. I served, as was required. I did my job, and kept the wheels of fate spinning \u2014 but I was not there, not in the same way I am now. I did not feed the flames, I did not oil the coupling rods that drive us forward, and I did not care.</p>\n<p>I did not see the needs of the world as I do now. I wasn't needed then, not like I am now.</p>\n<p>Rowing across the river was enough.</p>\n<p>I didn't notice the world changing. I didn't notice when they grew from their villages, their worship of the pantheons, when they moved beyond borders. I didn't notice the engines that roared, replacing the growling of beasts, nor did I notice I was being forgotten.</p>\n<p>And then, one day, I woke to the grinding of the rails. I rose to the grinding bronze thrumming under my feet, my paddle changed with a shovel, coins feeding the flames at the heart of the vessel. I knew that there was a purpose now, a purpose that was in search of one like myself.</p>\n<p>I did not need to understand the Train to know I was the Conductor now. I did not need to understand the world, to know that I was still needed. There is a truth I continue to live by: the world may have changed, but people never do.</p>\n<p>The Charon Express rolls onwards, as I ride on. We remain, until there are none left who need safe transportation.</p>\n<p>I do not think I will ever find my resolution \u2014 but that truth does not disappoint me. It is enough to have existed. It is enough to answer a need. Each departure will keep my fire burning, until one day I am nothing but ashes.</p>\n<p>The cycle continues despite me. I continue despite the cycle.</p>\n<p>Neither of us can give up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a train that once was a ship from a simpler time, for a simpler world. But the world today is not so simple, and a river is the least of the concerns of the soul. Not even the Conductor knows why it took this form, but they are certain that it was needed.</p>\n<p>They are certain it must persist.</p>\n<hr/>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:lampeter-warm\">:scp-wiki:theme:lampeter-warm</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train that does not exist.

I serve the vessel, as I always have: collecting passengers, lost and wayward souls, the ones left behind and stuck in the cracks. I do what I can, so that they still have a chance.\n\n\n\nNothing matters beyond that.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train not bound by tracks -- it uses those that exist, when convenient, but it is never restricted. A train that goes where it desires, laying new tracks before its cast-bronze wheels; each track laid will leave with the train, the absence of one whom is unremembered as the only evidence that it ever was. When this train comes, the departure is final.\n\n\n\nBut the train is not your end.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nTen new passengers.\n\nOne departure.\n\n\n\nThe South Pacific has always been a favorite of mine, watching the sun set over the golden waves as nature takes domain over the night. Humanity conquered the daytime long ago, nature having lost their claim; it escaped to the darkness, where man dared not tread. It hid in the spaces between, waiting for the times that exist around the world we have made.\n\n\n\nNighttime is a reminder of how the world once was, as I remember it.\n\n\n\nBut the world changed, for a time. What were once clean lines drawn in the sand became ambiguous and debated as people searched for identity, for meaning, for a place to belong. The world grew, far beyond the constraints it had once faced -- oceans became puddles, as bridges turned rivers into trickles. Humanity bent the world to fit what was seen as progress, to remake our lives and remove the dirty parts that we wish to forget.\n\n\n\nAnd, just as quickly as the world changed -- it became stuck.\n\n\n\nToday, a passenger finally departed, one who had rode the train for years. They were as much of a fixture as I, a guide and mentor to the newly departed who just boarded, a friend to those living in the mire. I respected them, as I watched their search for meaning; I am happy that they found what they were looking for.\n\n\n\nI stood beside the others, all watching them leave in envy -- something that has become a twisted tradition onboard. A going away party, where you are wished well by those who envy your freedom; there is little joy to be shared in the moment, but hope? Hope blossoms.\n\n\n\nI saw their face for the first time, as they departed the train. We tend to lose who we are while stuck in the mire, finding ourselves only once we come up for air; I watched as he took his first breath, the crisp ocean breeze filling his lungs with life.\n\n\n\nI waited for him to disappear, fade away, to be freed from the endless repetition; I stared, as is my twisted tradition, endlessly watching those that get to pass on. Every single time, I wait for their liberation; instead, I see their persistence.\n\n\n\nWhy do they always choose to persist?\n\n\n\nI would like to think that I am glad for them. Resolution is a goal we all seek, and I have lived my existence in the service of that ideal. I serve a true purpose, a desperate need in a frozen world. I give others what I cannot have, because they were denied it in kind. After all, there is always a need to tip the scales for a world stuck in one place.\n\n\n\nThings no longer change, not things that matter. The world exists as a series of cycles, loops, origins and destinations and the tracks that go back and forth. The train exists beyond the patterns, but even still -- the wheels spin, grinding along the bronze rails, a mimicry of the patterns of life.\n\n\n\nLife turns to death, work turns to sleep, day turns to night and love turns to misery. Nothing is stagnant, no matter how much we will it to be. No matter how little we need a cycle, it persists regardless. Wheels spinning, something set in motion before you were born, that will continue to turn long after you are gone.\n\n\n\nWhen the passenger departed today, they finally escaped one of the patterns. They were able to find their peace, whatever that meant to them.\n\n\n\nI would like to think that I had a hand in this; I am no more responsible for their resolutions than I am for the train. It is enough to serve.\n\n\n\nPart of me knows that I do not matter, and that were I do fade away, another would rise to take my place. Repetition follows us all, and I am bound to rings of fate just like my passengers.\n\n\n\nBut what would happen if I left and the axle was broken?\n\n\n\nWhat if, without a Conductor, the Train no longer remains?\n\n\n\nI continue to stoke the fires at the heart of the bronze beast, feeding its raging purpose. I cannot risk leaving the world to the whims of fate. I will continue to keep the wheels spinning, so that one day, we may all find our endings.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe then, I can finally rest.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train for the lost, the damned, the forgotten -- it comes to you in your time of need. It serves not as your resting place, nor as your salvation. They say the train is nothing more than an illusory nadir, a place to pass through, one that takes you from where you were to where you need to be. It exists, not as a destination, but as a facilitation.\n\n\n\nIt exists because it is still needed.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOne new passenger.\n\nOne new train car.\n\n\n\nNo departures.\n\n\n\nThe train elected to follow the rails of many worlds, bringing us to another destination in need of closure. As I write, the ocean hangs low in the sky overhead, a storm brewing as the coral-trees sway. The fish that flee overhead belong here, as do the people living under the leaking sky; but that does not mean they are any different than you, or I.\n\n\n\nThe train goes where it is needed; its need is universal.\n\n\n\nIt is not often I speak with my passengers. There is an unspoken understanding, the train speaking to them like a long-lost friend; they know what is needed of them, and they know what the train means. The drifting and the aimless see the train for what it is -- a sanctuary.\n\n\n\nAll salvation comes with a cost: but this price is one that I control. As the Conductor, there is little I can do to change the world. Bound to the rails just as the Train, I am a passenger through life; in that way, I am no different than those who ride the cars in search of meaning. And, while I cannot change the spots on the leopard, I can make a difference.\n\n\n\nThe price is a single coin, as it always has been, and as it always will be.\n\n\n\nWith the toll, you receive no ticket. Your obol earns you no guarantees of a destination, nor does it force you into a shape you reject. There is no authority to enforce payment, nor is there a profit to be made; it is a tradition, and that is sufficient. The coin is a trifle, a shared understanding between the passengers and I -- we are each meant to be exactly where we are. We each understand that we belong.\n\n\n\nYour coin buys peace of mind, if only for a time.\n\n\n\nComfort is a luxury. A luxury in a discomforting world, peace in a maelstrom of noise. We spend our lives in pursuit of the times between, chasing the escape from a painful reality. Some find comfort in others. Some make their work their world, pretending escape is nothing more than a fantasy. Some even find comfort in giving up.\n\n\n\nBut that comfort never comes.\n\n\n\nSouls wait in dissonance, bound to the wheels that crush them with every spin, unable to leave their eternal torture; their suffering grows, and not even Lampeter can give salvation to all the riders. There are those who cannot accept the help, those who know not to ask -- the train finds them.\n\n\n\nThe train cuts the knots of their bindings and I am there to catch them.\n\n\n\nThe new passenger today was a child. A youth, wrapped in seaweed-cloth, gills bristling under the fabric, lungs forced to labor as they had not before. Terrified -- not of the train before them, but of the world that surrounded them, the world that abandoned them, the world they mistakenly believed was their home. But, of course, who would blame a child for these thoughts?\n\n\n\nExistence is relative, and time lingers in the beyond; they were as young as the day they were lost, afraid of a world they could not understand. They were alone, standing on the busy platform without a coin to spare. They had none that cared, nor those that remembered; they were never given the chance to earn their fare.\n\n\n\nThere was nobody to place a coin over their eyes as they lay still. Lying, waiting for the train to arrive.\n\n\n\nIt is days like this I am thankful there are holes in my pockets, and far too little time to mend them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a Train whose Conductor is simply an occupant, an extension of the will of the train. The Conductor would disagree -- but in the same stale breath, claim that the Train and Conductor are one. They would say that neither can exist without the other. That is the way it always has been, and that is the way it always will be.\n\n\n\nNeed lies at the heart of all things.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nNo new passengers.\n\nNo departures.\n\n\n\nThree stops without making a difference.\n\n\n\nStars. Forests. Seas of Blood. The scenery changed, but my feelings did not.\n\n\n\nI am filled with shame each time the train departs without the soul it found; some are not ready, others choose to reject this path. I wish I could change their minds, but that is not my role in things. You cannot force a resolution, just as you cannot demand a need.\n\n\n\nThe need demands you.\n\n\n\nI do not remember the first passenger we had. I think not only of the history of the train and I, but of the times before when I would trail my hand through the rippling water, miasma filling the air; I cannot remember my origin, not do I need to.\n\n\n\nI do not know what force demanded my existence -- but I know the need that I have always answered.\n\n\n\nWe have always served the same need: we take those who do not belong, and ferry them to their final destination. We are the safety net, the lonely soul sweeping the alleyways, digging through the cracks and finding the ones the cycle threw out. The ones who rule the world, who live within the system and bend the patterns to their willpower: they do not need my help. They do not need a train to escape, for comfort cannot assist those who languish in opulence.\n\n\n\nI remain for the rest. The train charges forward, eternal, step by step through time. So long as there is a need, there will be a train. So long as there is a Train, there will be a Conductor. \n\n\n\nThese days, I find myself reminiscing more and more of the times before I was the Conductor. I remember when I was no more than a big fish in a small pond, an aimless wanderer from the sticks, stuck in my own cycle. From shore to shore, I would travel back and forth; I do not remember the passengers, nor do I remember distinctions. I only remember the time as a whole, as a memory that I once lived, but is now faded.\n\n\n\nI was lost then, too. I did not know purpose was something I could need, let alone something to want. I served, as was required. I did my job, and kept the wheels of fate spinning -- but I was not there, not in the same way I am now. I did not feed the flames, I did not oil the coupling rods that drive us forward, and I did not care.\n\n\n\nI did not see the needs of the world as I do now. I wasn't needed then, not like I am now.\n\n\n\nRowing across the river was enough.\n\n\n\nI didn't notice the world changing. I didn't notice when they grew from their villages, their worship of the pantheons, when they moved beyond borders. I didn't notice the engines that roared, replacing the growling of beasts, nor did I notice I was being forgotten.\n\n\n\nAnd then, one day, I woke to the grinding of the rails. I rose to the grinding bronze thrumming under my feet, my paddle changed with a shovel, coins feeding the flames at the heart of the vessel. I knew that there was a purpose now, a purpose that was in search of one like myself.\n\n\n\nI did not need to understand the Train to know I was the Conductor now. I did not need to understand the world, to know that I was still needed. There is a truth I continue to live by: the world may have changed, but people never do.\n\n\n\nThe Charon Express rolls onwards, as I ride on. We remain, until there are none left who need safe transportation.\n\n\n\nI do not think I will ever find my resolution -- but that truth does not disappoint me. It is enough to have existed. It is enough to answer a need. Each departure will keep my fire burning, until one day I am nothing but ashes.\n\n\n\nThe cycle continues despite me. I continue despite the cycle.\n\n\n\nNeither of us can give up.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train that once was a ship from a simpler time, for a simpler world. But the world today is not so simple, and a river is the least of the concerns of the soul. Not even the Conductor knows why it took this form, but they are certain that it was needed.\n\n\n\nThey are certain it must persist.\n\n\n\n-----\n", "references": [], "tags": ["art-exchange", "lampeter", "tale"], "title": "The Charon Express - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-charon-express", "year": 2026}, "the-devil-within-the-gale": {"created_at": "2026-01-03T11:07:00", "creator": "DirEthan", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DirEthan", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/direthan", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-03T11:07:00"}, {"author": "DirEthan", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/direthan", "comment": "Added tags: doctor-clef.
