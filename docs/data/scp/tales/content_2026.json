Bordner prior to his disappearance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum WL-25-12-2025:</strong> At 07:18, 4 December 2025, a MTF Tau-9 (\u201cBookworms\u201d) exploration team entered the Wanderers' Library to establish a forward base for future operations mapping previously unexplored sections of the Library. The mission is considered a failure, with the confirmed deaths of 17 Foundation operatives. One individual remains missing. Several short prose tales, all indicated to belong to a collection of stories whose authorship is attributed to \"Ardell with No Name,\" are suggested to contain information on the missing operative's whereabouts. These tales have since manifested in various locations throughout the Wanderers' Library. These items have been collated for ease of reference below.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Book Title:</strong> Ardellous Tales, Vol. III: Chicken Soup for the Cosmic and Abyssal, p. 7<br/>\n<strong>Discovery Site:</strong> This tale was discovered on an abandoned writing desk in a concealed study connected to an archive near Tau-9 Outpost 41. Despite the frequency of travel through the archive, the study had never been discovered. Unknown entities native to the Library make infrequent use of this study, but no contact has been made.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Onward</strong></p>\n<p>On soft grass, through dense shadows cast by suns unseen, you walk. The bookshelves dot the lazy hills that stretch around you; the breezes pushes the occasional lost page to dance across your path. Whether miles high, or shorter than you, the bookshelves here are ever present and you weave your way through them, homeward bound.</p>\n<p>Your rifle's strap digs into your shoulder; its weight once a reassurance, now just a reminder of the half-magazine you have left. Not enough bullets, too far from home, and no way to know you're heading the right way except good faith in the beetle-man that pointed you this way.</p>\n<p>\"Across those hills, and to the left, you'll find the way you came!\" the beetle-man had said, pointing through a door at the hills you now fare.</p>\n<p>\"And it's safe?\" You asked, but the answer never came as the beetle-man pushed his soup cart further down the tiled halls of the Library, leaving you to step into a world without a roof, in a building that shouldn't be.</p>\n<p>Your rations ran out weeks ago, but food finds its way to you. Dropped from the heavens, found on a tree, delivered via cart \u2014 the Library provides. So you carry a satchel you made from your torn jacket, filled with not much beyond a compass that spins, a wand that you found, and half a copy of the Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers. You considered throwing it away, but it feels right to keep it. You try to ignore the soft metallic clinks of the chain with the tags that carry your name \u2014 the name of a man who once mattered.</p>\n<p>You pause at a bookshelf, craning your neck to gauge its immensity; the cool breeze playing on your skin. Your eyes trace the flight of the paper birds that drift on the air singing songs in languages you can't understand, and you squeeze your eyes shut willing them to be sparrows from your childhood. But they aren't. And they won't be. You are not home. You are wandering. You are lost. You force your gaze down and trudge on; each bookshelf seems unique, but they're not worth the time. You hum to drown out the baleful tones of the paper birds passing books you don't understand, under the sunless, bright sky. The tune isn't something you remember from anywhere other than here. It came to you to pass the time when you were the only one left, and now it helps. You think it helps.</p>\n<p>But your eyes find the door that the beetle said would be there, and the humming stops for moment, as you gaze across the hills unsure of what comes next. This wasn't the way that you came to this place, but this is how you leave. So across the soft grass you force your steady step, unsure of why your chest tells you this is wrong, or why now you aren't humming, you're hyperventilating.</p>\n<p>The door stands before you, plain and brown. Nothing more than a door and a brass knob on the top of a hill. You don't move. You can't let yourself hope too much; you've been told the way out before and wound up in stranger places than this. But you can't fight it. Home calls to you from across the cosmos \u2014 the safety of your people, the comfort of your place in the world, the familiarity of the routine, the simple knowing of love. That's all that drives you onward \u2014 home.</p>\n<p>You place your hand on the doorknob, your arm is lead as it moves. The knob turns silently, and holding your breath, you push the door open. Your heart jumps, and you nearly weep when it's a corridor and not wilderness. The corridor runs to your left and to your right; wooden floors and panelled walls leading in either direction and turning beyond your line of sight. You know these walls. You've seen them before. They remind you of where you lost the others and for the first time in weeks there's more than desperation \u2014 there's hope. You look back for a moment at the peace of the hills you're leaving behind, never knowing if you'll return to them, and let the picture settle in your mind.</p>\n<p>Finally, you turn and step into the corridor, shutting the door behind you.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> 79 days after the tale was removed from the study it was found in, a note was left in it's place. The note reads, \"You fuckers, I wasn't done. Here's the updated version.\" Comparisons to the original confirm the updated version contains a single comma that was left out of the original copy. The tale above has been updated accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Book Title:</strong> Ardellous Tales, Vol. XVII: The Itch Beneath The Skin, p. 1184<br/>\n<strong>Discovery Site:</strong> This entry was found nailed to a bookshelf in an otherwise undisturbed and clean section of the Library. The blood spatters on the page have not been identified.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Bonds of Man</strong></p>\n<p>Your hands shake as you collect your toll, your burden. Each chain with a tag with a name gets collected from its owner and then you lay it out neatly on a table you found. You stand within the chaos of a gunfight that could have been days ago noting the names of the companions you lost and swore to return to. This isn't the way back, and this wasn't the last place you saw them, but this mundane library with its dust and carpets and windows that look into blackness, became their unceremonious tomb.</p>\n<p>You can't do much for them. They're gone. So instead you collect the chains that carry their names taking stock of everyone you couldn't save.</p>\n<p>Recollections of that day stir lava in your stomach. The ambush, the fire fight, the thaumaturge that sent you flying out a window into blackness not dissimilar from what now surrounds you. You were going to find them again. You were going to go home and share drinks about the adventures beyond the Veil.</p>\n<p>Instead, you collect the chains from bodies mangled by magic, cleaning each with as much care as you can from the canteen that you filled. Your gritted teeth feel like they're going to crack, but if you unclench your jaw you fear you will never stop screaming.</p>\n<p>The shuffling of paper across the floor draws your attention, and you whip your head around and you are not alone. Before you stands a cultist, obsidian flames springing from his hands, and you dive behind the table, reaching for your gun that doesn't have enough bullets. The air erupts into black flame above you as you slam into the ground, instantly scrabbling to find a better vantage point. They killed your squad. They will kill you. The caustic static of magic fills the air again and the table between you and your attacker is lifted and thrown aside. Wordlessly, your assailant steps forward, the next flash of void-fire appears in his hand above his head; you aren't even off the ground yet.</p>\n<p>You force yourself up as his hands descend, and you're sprinting down an aisle with black fire chasing your steps. The heat beats against your neck as you dive around a corner, behind the demolished desk in a reading nook at the end of the row. You hear the footsteps charging down the hall, and you ready your gun. It's been running low on bullets for weeks now, and avoiding the Library's more dangerous inhabitants has always been your preferred option, but the luck of prey animals always finds its end. You take a knee, your eyes trained on the spot he'll appear from, your focus burning in your body, blackening your mind.</p>\n<p>The man with his black flames turns the corner, and a roaring staccato erupts from the muzzle of your gun, briefly deafening you as your assailant screams and falls from view behind the bookshelves. You wait just a moment for the flames to dissipate, listening for movement before you leave your spot and creep around the shelves, deeper into the rows to get a better angle, keeping safe distance between you. You must have hit him, you can hear him moaning, but that doesn't mean you're safe. You're a few rows down when you step out for him to see. He's bleeding \u2014 the white robe is turning red fast \u2014 but he's not done. Black fire roars down the aisle at you and you answer with the few bullets you have left and cries of defiance until a dreaded, empty click is all that's heard from your assault rifle. Black fire explodes before you and you're thrown from your feet. Shelves collapse, books explode, the shouting drowns in the cacophony as you finally come to rest under a precariously leaning shelf.</p>\n<p>And finally there is stillness once more as you lie, exhausted and scared, waiting for what's next.</p>\n<p>You might have lain there for a minute or a month, but it all feels too long. Maybe you lost consciousness, but when you emerge from the collapse, all the burning embers are cooled, and the smell of smoke is old. You leave your gun on the floor \u2014 it's useless now \u2014 and you trudge forward through the paper and wood to find your assailant at peace beneath a bookshelf, bled out and smiling with a few bullets in his chest.</p>\n<p>The pain of the day grips your voice and you scream, echoing down the halls of the Wanderers' Library, but here rage is impotent. When this passes, once the chains bearing names are collected, you know that all that's left is to keep walking.</p>\n<p>Knowing that, you scream louder.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> All family members of the missing operatives have been appropriately amnesticized and cover stories have been deployed, honouring them for their service. Those found dwelling on the past after reading this tale should be sent for amnestic therapy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Book Title:</strong> Ardellous Tales, Vol. XLII: Gravity Of Ways, p. 62<br/>\n<strong>Discovery Site:</strong> Delivered to MTF Tau-9 by a dense flutter of butterflies. All agents touched by the butterflies reported elevated moods, but were catatonic for up to 4 hours after the encounter. Efforts to identify the cause of these effects are to be prioritised.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Magnificence of the Murky House</strong></p>\n<p>She stands between bookshelves, her wings splayed aloft. Jet black and violet, the light dancing on her scales, her majesty freezes you in place. Behind her, her powerful tail sways slightly, agitated. Above her the roof is cracked with age, and in the gloom of these archives, you hear the crash of a waterfall somewhere hidden within.</p>\n<p>\"Will you steal from me too, stranger,\" the beast's voice is a lullaby belying her form. \"Or will you leave me a trinket instead?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I'll steal from you, but there's not much I can leave.\" You raise your hands, hoping you seem meek. \"I'm just a wanderer.\"</p>\n<p>The silence hangs between you as she stares for far too long. Then she steps forward, swiftness incarnate, thunderous steps bringing her majesty to bear before you; gleam-scaled snout lowered to your eye-level, \"Then perhaps just your company as you wander.\"</p>\n<p>And you exhale, nodding, and say, \"I can try.\"</p>\n<p>\"And where are you wandering to?\" Her snout fumes with wisps of dreams and whispers, and she waits expectantly.</p>\n<p>\"Home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where is home?\"</p>\n<p>\"If only I knew,\" you say, bitterly enough for her to notice. \"Some said they know the way.\"</p>\n<p>\"None do.\"</p>\n<p>The heavy purple of her eyes glisten as she turns her head. Following her gaze you see the rows of shelves, burdened with greenery and books, leading deeper in to the Library, and you see how small you are. She takes a step, beckoning you with a nod. \"We'll walk a while together then, and I shall swear to only tell you what I'm sure of.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you don't know the way home. So what are you sure of?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am sure of myself.\"</p>\n<p>\"And is that enough?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes,\" her wings stretch wide, saluting the shelves flanking the path. Her footfalls don't cease as she parades her hoard before you. \"But I have company around me, scribbles and epics, delights and torments. There is joy to be had if one knows what one wants, and knows what can be.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you know what can be?\"</p>\n<p>\"I know I will never leave this place.\"</p>\n<p>\"And why's that?\"</p>\n<p>\"The door's too small.\" Her wings sort of shrug. \"I outgrew it years ago.\"</p>\n<p>It's been weeks since you smiled, but she breaks through, and you welcome it as you chuckle at her inanity. To know the happiness of a smile when all you want is home almost feels like betrayal, though. That's what's kept you going this long. When the world turned upside-down, and you finally saw the things that skittered on the edges of normalcy, the horrors that whispered off pages, the impossible spaces in between understanding, going home was all that mattered. The jokes at the dinner table seemed sweeter, the bickering over poorly ironed clothes seemed safe, the pizza delivered late was just how things were. To smile now feels wrong.</p>\n<p>But you let it linger, despite yourself. Strolling through the soft light of the archive, the chirps of night insects pierce through the growing roar of the waterfall, accompanying you and your companion until the soft spray of water touches your face. The floorboards give way to grass, and from a rocky hole in the roof water pours into a large pool that overflows and forms a river cutting through the domain. The bookshelves keep a healthy distance, but a few dot the grassy boundaries of the river, inviting you to sit a while and read.</p>\n<p>A few park benches dotted with fresh fruits wait by bookshelves, beneath trees, and the bounty invites you over \u2014 the feeding system you've grown used to. You excuse yourself and set your bag down, unpacking to make space for food while your companion watches closely. You're halfway decided between the mango or some apples when her snout appears at the edge of your table, her eyes narrowed on the pile of your belongings.</p>\n<p>\"What's that?\" She asks, and you follow her intent gaze, guessing she means the book.</p>\n<p>\"Oh. I'm not sure why I keep that,\" you say. \"It was a gift before it broke. It's the Lord of the Rings. The Two Towers. Well\u2026 half a copy.\"</p>\n<p>\"And I thought you said you don't have trinkets to leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"You've never read The Two Towers?\"</p>\n<p>\"I have!\" She says, nearly defensive, nearly proud of herself. \"I own many copies, but I've never owned <em>half</em> a copy. And there's something about that.\"</p>\n<p>You narrow your eyes for a moment, but reach for the gift from a friend that got mangled while you ran for your life, contemplating its worth to her\u2026 realising it didn't have worth to you. You slide it towards her snout and watch as her eyes light up.</p>\n<p>\"You're welcome to it.\" You say it so calmly, so matter-of-fact, but do you owe it more than that?</p>\n<p>Her eyes gleam proudly and her whole body shakes from the joy, and she wastes no time. The half-book floats from where you placed it, rising for a while as she looks around, eyeing the nearby shelves. Finally, the half of The Two Towers you've been carrying nestles itself into a shelf away from the spray of the waterfall where it sits watching the water flow by.</p>\n<p>\"You're a gentleman and a scholar,\" she says, the lullaby of her voice turning warmer.</p>\n<p>\"I'm only glad it found a home,\" you say, choosing the mango.</p>\n<p>\"And I suppose you'll keep trying to find yours?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose that's quite a question.\" Your hands rest on your belongings lightly as the cool air touches the wetness forming on your eyes, but you blink it away and look up to smile at your host. \"Thank you for the company, but I think it's time I found a way across.\"</p>\n<p>She closes her eyes slowly, smiling in her way, and looks downstream. \"Follow the river and you'll find a bridge. There's a door not much further than that. One day you'll find what you need.\"</p>\n<p>\"One day,\" you say and then you share a farewell and the behemoth made of whispers and dreams pads back into the caverns of her archive, content with her collection. You remain where you are, seated on a bench that shouldn't be here, and listen to the woodland sounds of the Library. You're lighter than before, but your eyes linger on the gift you left her, sitting on its shelf, and you wonder too long if you'll miss it.</p>\n<p>Finally, you repack your bag, nestling the metal chains in their place at the bottom where they can't bruise the fruit, and you set off once more to find a bridge.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> Those reading this tale may encounter anomalously induced ennui for up to three weeks after the fact. Affected readers are encouraged to indulge this by engaging in evening walks, frequently visiting (but not making use of) travel agency websites, complaining about the blandness of food, and partaking in lengthy ramblings regarding grating mundanity to speed the process.

The textbook was discovered completely by accident in a section of the library dedicated to the cultural practices of the dominant <em>Rana Sapiens</em> species of Earth 748-A whose anatomy is captured within the rest of the textbook.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A Man Who Once Mattered</strong></p>\n<p>An august drone surrounds you as you soar through the ravines of the Wanderers' Library on the back of a turquoise dragonfly, its chitin gleaming in the light. Wild laughter flies from your lips as you carve your way towards the rolling hills you've walked across so often now. A second passes and you and your immense mount breach the edge of the ravines, leaving the cliffs behind. Below, the hills undulate in all directions and the paper birds drift lazily. Up here the flocks are larger, drifting in peaceful clouds as you fly onwards, heading to nowhere.</p>\n<p>Steadily, you raise your hands above your head, letting the wind whip across your unkempt hair, cooling your body. You still wear the fatigues, but aside from the chains with the names of your comrades, you carry no symbols of who you were. Those names now sit safe and at rest in your pack. It's laden with climbing materials, you keep a light bedroll strapped to it now. It's best to be prepared for the next cliff face; relying on dragonflies can be a gamble.</p>\n<p>Mighty wings drive you forward, the dragonfly vibrating beneath you. It aims for two enormous bookshelves, the silent gates to a quiet vale, and it dives to pick up speed. You lower yourself against the insect, a grin spreading across your face. Exhilaration grips you, and howling cheers burst from your lips as you breach the boundary between the rolling hills and this secluded valley, covered in fruit trees and paper birds. They are not the sparrows from your childhood, but they are the songs of Now and your ear is finding their charm. But right now, you are not seeking song, and the dragonfly leads you deeper into the valley until finally you spy a road, and next to the road, a soup cart where you land.</p>\n<p>\"The same as always?\" The beetle-man calls to you before you've even jumped off the dragonfly.</p>\n<p>\"Chef's Choice just like always!\" You shout back leaping from the insect, landing with a roll for just the fun of it before the dragonfly rises once more and flits towards the shelves where more of its kind dance with the paper birds. She will return when you need her later. For now, there's a cool breeze, books to read, and a smile on the person serving the soup; a day to be had if you've ever seen one.</p>\n<p>You set your bag on the counter as the beetle-man chirps a song to himself. Old habits die hard, and you still check your supplies whenever you rest even though the Library provides. It's a quick practiced process, but that's probably why you've never thought of it. As the smell of something curried reaches your nose, your eyes spy the compass that spins and the splinters that were a wand you carried but knew nothing about; that last ditch chance and failure you nearly didn't come back from\u2026. In the end it seemed better to at least try.</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't seem useful,\" the beetle-man says as he plops a bowl before you, his eyes are fixed on the splinters and compass.</p>\n<p>\"It's not, is it?\" you say, and perhaps he catches the question in your eyes because he holds out his hand.</p>\n<p>\"I can get rid of it for you if you want,\" he says. \"There's junk traders about if you're keen to go looking, but I see them around, so I'm happy to help.\" And it doesn't take a word more before you hand over the compass and splinters, free of the weight.</p>\n<p>Then grinning, you take a deep sniff of the steaming soup in front of you and ask, \"And what did the chef choose this week?\"</p>\n<p>\"Curried pear and leek,\" the beetle-man shrugs. \"Mundane, I suppose, but now and then it works. Besides, it moves faster than this.\" And he lifts a lid on another steaming pot and immediately a tentacle reaches out followed by a mist that whispers about tomorrow. The beetle shuts it quickly and then smiles at you instead. \"The curried pear and leek tastes more like home than regret.\"</p>\n<p>So you dip your spoon in, filling it as much as you can. Then once you've cooled it with a breath you sip the soup deeply, letting the memories of home fill you for a moment, and then you smile. \"I'd say it tastes of memory, but I don't know about home.\"</p>\n<p>\"And what memory is that?\"</p>\n<p>You don't answer, because you don't know, and maybe the beetle-man is right. Here, where you sit, you are safe amongst the tales of universes beyond knowing. Here, where you sit, there is peace for a man who once mattered. You smile a little softly, wondering what comes next. You lay your head on a soft pallet in a treehouse each night, you visit the beetle-man when he comes, you're learning the paper birds' songs, you read books on the shelves here on the hills under suns unseen.</p>\n<p>So maybe, where you sit, with the beetle-man and his cart, this soup tastes of home, after all.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> The page the tale is written on will occasionally struggle against being handled, but positive reassurances that it will be returned to its copy of Gray's Anatomy will return it to a docile state. Once reading is complete, returning the tale to its correct place in the hijacked textbook is imperative, or the ink will bleed, rendering the piece unreadable for a time. While temperamental, the tale enjoys being read and the smudged ink will return to its normal state after roughly three days.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/a-man-who-once-mattered\">A Man Who Once Mattered</a>\" by Mr Panik, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The mission is considered a failure, with the confirmed deaths of 17 Foundation operatives.\u00a0\u00a0One individual remains missing. Several short prose tales, all indicated to belong to a collection of stories\u00a0\u00a0whose authorship is attributed to \"Ardell with No Name,\" are suggested to contain information on the missing operative's whereabouts. These tales have since manifested in various locations throughout the Wanderers' Library. These items have been collated for ease of reference below.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Book Title:** Ardellous Tales, Vol. III: Chicken Soup for the Cosmic and Abyssal, p. 7\n\n**Discovery Site:** This tale was discovered on an abandoned writing desk in a concealed study connected to an archive near Tau-9 Outpost 41. Despite the frequency of travel through the archive, the study had never been discovered. Unknown entities native to the Library make infrequent use of this study, but no contact has been made. \n\n------\n\n= **Onward**\n\n\n\nOn soft grass, through dense shadows cast by suns unseen, you walk. The bookshelves dot the lazy hills that stretch around you; the breezes pushes the occasional lost page to dance across your path. Whether miles high, or shorter than you, the bookshelves here are ever present and you weave your way through them, homeward bound.\n\n\n\nYour rifle's strap digs into your shoulder; its weight once a reassurance, now just a reminder of the half-magazine you have left. Not enough bullets, too far from home, and no way to know you're heading the right way except good faith in the beetle-man that pointed you this way. \n\n\n\n\"Across those hills, and to the left, you'll find the way you came!\" the beetle-man had said, pointing through a door at the hills you now fare.\n\n\n\n\"And it's safe?\" You asked, but the answer never came as the beetle-man pushed his soup cart further down the tiled halls of the Library, leaving you to step into a world without a roof, in a building that shouldn't be. \n\n\n\nYour rations ran out weeks ago, but food finds its way to you. Dropped from the heavens, found on a tree, delivered via cart -- the Library provides. So you carry a satchel you made from your torn jacket, filled with not much beyond a compass that spins, a wand that you found, and half a copy of the Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers. You considered throwing it away, but it feels right to keep it. You try to ignore the soft metallic clinks of the chain with the tags that carry your name -- the name of a man who once mattered.\n\n\n\nYou pause at a bookshelf, craning your neck to gauge its immensity; the cool breeze playing on your skin. Your eyes trace the flight of the paper birds that drift on the air singing songs in languages you can't understand, and you squeeze your eyes shut willing them to be sparrows from your childhood. But they aren't. And they won't be. You are not home. You are wandering. You are lost. You force your gaze down and trudge on; each bookshelf seems unique, but they're not worth the time.\u00a0\u00a0You hum to drown out the baleful tones of the paper birds passing books you don't understand, under the sunless, bright sky. The tune isn't something you remember from anywhere other than here. It came to you to pass the time when you were the only one left, and now it helps. You think it helps. \n\n\n\nBut your eyes find the door that the beetle said would be there, and the humming stops for moment, as you gaze across the hills unsure of what comes next. This wasn't the way that you came to this place, but this is how you leave. So across the soft grass you force your steady step, unsure of why your chest tells you this is wrong, or why now you aren't humming, you're hyperventilating.\n\n\n\nThe door stands before you, plain and brown. Nothing more than a door and a brass knob on the top of a hill. You don't move. You can't let yourself hope too much; you've been told the way out before and wound up in stranger places than this. But you can't fight it. Home calls to you from across the cosmos -- the safety of your people, the comfort of your place in the world, the familiarity of the routine, the simple knowing of love. That's all that drives you onward -- home. \n\n\n\nYou place your hand on the doorknob, your arm is lead as it moves.\u00a0\u00a0The knob turns silently, and holding your breath, you push the door open. Your heart jumps, and you nearly weep when it's a corridor and not wilderness. The corridor runs to your left and to your right; wooden floors and panelled walls leading in either direction and turning beyond your line of sight. You know these walls. You've seen them before. They remind you of where you lost the others and for the first time in weeks there's more than desperation -- there's hope. You look back for a moment at the peace of the hills you're leaving behind, never knowing if you'll return to them, and let the picture settle in your mind. \n\n\n\nFinally, you turn and step into the corridor, shutting the door behind you.\n\n------\n\n**Researcher's Notes:** 79 days after the tale was removed from the study it was found in, a note was left in it's place. The note reads, \"You fuckers, I wasn't done. Here's the updated version.\" Comparisons to the original confirm the updated version contains a single comma that was left out of the original copy. The tale above has been updated accordingly. \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Book Title:** Ardellous Tales, Vol. XVII: The Itch Beneath The Skin, p. 1184\n\n**Discovery Site:** This entry was found nailed to a bookshelf in an otherwise undisturbed and clean section of the Library. The blood spatters on the page have not been identified.\n\n------\n\n= **Bonds of Man**\n\n\n\nYour hands shake as you collect your toll, your burden. Each chain with a tag with a name gets collected from its owner and then you lay it out neatly on a table you found. You stand within the chaos of a gunfight that could have been days ago noting the names of the companions you lost and swore to return to. This isn't the way back, and this wasn't the last place you saw them, but this mundane library with its dust and carpets and windows that look into blackness, became their unceremonious tomb. \n\n\n\nYou can't do much for them. They're gone. So instead you collect the chains that carry their names taking stock of everyone you couldn't save. \n\n\n\nRecollections of that day stir lava in your stomach. The ambush, the fire fight, the thaumaturge that sent you flying out a window into blackness not dissimilar from what now surrounds you. You were going to find them again. You were going to go home and share drinks about the adventures beyond the Veil.\n\n\n\nInstead, you collect the chains from bodies mangled by magic, cleaning each with as much care as you can from the canteen that you filled. Your gritted teeth feel like they're going to crack, but if you unclench your jaw you fear you will never stop screaming.\n\n\n\nThe shuffling of paper across the floor draws your attention, and you whip your head around and you are not alone. Before you stands a cultist, obsidian flames springing from his hands, and you dive behind the table, reaching for your gun that doesn't have enough bullets. The air erupts into black flame above you as you slam into the ground, instantly scrabbling to find a better vantage point. They killed your squad. They will kill you. The caustic static of magic fills the air again and the table between you and your attacker is lifted and thrown aside. Wordlessly, your assailant steps forward, the next flash of void-fire appears in his hand above his head; you aren't even off the ground yet.\n\n\n\nYou force yourself up as his hands descend, and you're sprinting down an aisle with black fire chasing your steps. The heat beats against your neck as you dive around a corner, behind the demolished desk in a reading nook at the end of the row. You hear the footsteps charging down the hall, and you ready your gun. It's been running low on bullets for weeks now, and avoiding the Library's more dangerous inhabitants has always been your preferred option, but the luck of prey animals always finds its end. You take a knee, your eyes trained on the spot he'll appear from, your focus burning in your body, blackening your mind.\n\n\n\nThe man with his black flames turns the corner, and a roaring staccato erupts from the muzzle of your gun, briefly deafening you as your assailant screams and falls from view behind the bookshelves. You wait just a moment for the flames to dissipate, listening for movement before you leave your spot and creep around the shelves, deeper into the rows to get a better angle, keeping safe distance between you. You must have hit him, you can hear him moaning, but that doesn't mean you're safe. You're a few rows down when you step out for him to see. He's bleeding -- the white robe is turning red fast -- but he's not done. Black fire roars down the aisle at you and you answer with the few bullets you have left and cries of defiance until a dreaded, empty click is all that's heard from your assault rifle. Black fire explodes before you and you're thrown from your feet. Shelves collapse, books explode, the shouting drowns in the cacophony as you finally come to rest under a precariously leaning shelf.\n\n\n\nAnd finally there is stillness once more as you lie, exhausted and scared, waiting for what's next.\n\n\n\nYou might have lain there for a minute or a month, but it all feels too long. Maybe you lost consciousness, but when you emerge from the collapse, all the burning embers are cooled, and the smell of smoke is old. You leave your gun on the floor -- it's useless now -- and\u00a0\u00a0you trudge forward through the paper and wood to find your assailant at peace beneath a bookshelf, bled out and smiling with a few bullets in his chest. \n\n\n\nThe pain of the day grips your voice and you scream, echoing down the halls of the Wanderers' Library, but here rage is impotent. When this passes, once the chains bearing names are collected, you know that all that's left is to keep walking.\n\n\n\nKnowing that, you scream louder.\n\n------\n\n**Researcher's Notes:** All family members of the missing operatives have been appropriately amnesticized and cover stories have been deployed, honouring them for their service. Those found dwelling on the past after reading this tale should be sent for amnestic therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Book Title:** Ardellous Tales, Vol. XLII: Gravity Of Ways, p. 62\n\n**Discovery Site:** Delivered to MTF Tau-9 by a dense flutter of butterflies. All agents touched by the butterflies reported elevated moods, but were catatonic for up to 4 hours after the encounter. Efforts to identify the cause of these effects are to be prioritised.\n\n------\n\n= **Magnificence of the Murky House**\n\n\n\nShe stands between bookshelves, her wings splayed aloft. Jet black and violet, the light dancing on her scales, her majesty freezes you in place. Behind her, her powerful tail sways slightly, agitated. Above her the roof is cracked with age, and in the gloom of these archives, you hear the crash of a waterfall somewhere hidden within.\n\n\n\n\"Will you steal from me too, stranger,\" the beast's voice is a lullaby belying her form. \"Or will you leave me a trinket instead?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I'll steal from you, but there's not much I can leave.\" You raise your hands, hoping you seem meek. \"I'm just a wanderer.\"\n\n\n\nThe silence hangs between you as she stares for far too long. Then she steps forward, swiftness incarnate, thunderous steps bringing her majesty to bear before you; gleam-scaled snout lowered to your eye-level, \"Then perhaps just your company as you wander.\"\n\n\n\nAnd you exhale, nodding, and say, \"I can try.\"\n\n\n\n\"And where are you wandering to?\" Her snout fumes with wisps of dreams and whispers, and she waits expectantly.\n\n\n\n\"Home.\" \n\n\n\n\"Where is home?\"\n\n\n\n\"If only I knew,\" you say, bitterly enough for her to notice. \"Some said they know the way.\"\n\n\n\n\"None do.\" \n\n\n\nThe heavy purple of her eyes glisten as she turns her head. Following her gaze you see the rows of shelves, burdened with greenery and books, leading deeper in to the Library, and you see how small you are. She takes a step, beckoning you with a nod. \"We'll walk a while together then, and I shall swear to only tell you what I'm sure of.\" \n\n\n\n\"And you don't know the way home. So what are you sure of?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am sure of myself.\"\n\n\n\n\"And is that enough?\" \n\n\n\n\"Sometimes,\" her wings stretch wide, saluting the shelves flanking the path. Her footfalls don't cease as she parades her hoard before you. \"But I have company around me, scribbles and epics, delights and torments. There is joy to be had if one knows what one wants, and knows what can be.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you know what can be?\"\n\n\n\n\"I know I will never leave this place.\"\n\n\n\n\"And why's that?\"\n\n\n\n\"The door's too small.\" Her wings sort of shrug. \"I outgrew it years ago.\"\n\n\n\nIt's been weeks since you smiled, but she breaks through, and you welcome it as you chuckle at her inanity. To know the happiness of a smile when all you want is home almost feels like betrayal, though.\u00a0\u00a0That's what's kept you going this long. When the world turned upside-down, and you finally saw the things that skittered on the edges of normalcy, the horrors that whispered off pages, the impossible spaces in between understanding, going home was all that mattered. The jokes at the dinner table seemed sweeter, the bickering over poorly ironed clothes seemed safe, the pizza delivered late was just how things were. To smile now feels wrong.\n\n\n\nBut you let it linger, despite yourself. Strolling through the soft light of the archive, the chirps of night insects pierce through the growing roar of the waterfall, accompanying you and your companion until the soft spray of water touches your face. The floorboards give way to grass, and from a rocky hole in the roof water pours into a large pool that overflows and forms a river cutting through the domain. The bookshelves keep a healthy distance, but a few dot the grassy boundaries of the river, inviting you to sit a while and read.\n\n\n\nA few park benches dotted with fresh fruits wait by bookshelves, beneath trees, and the bounty invites you over -- the feeding system you've grown used to.\u00a0\u00a0You excuse yourself and set your bag down, unpacking to make space for food while your companion watches closely. You're halfway decided between the mango or some apples when her snout appears at the edge of your table, her eyes narrowed on the pile of your belongings.\n\n\n\n\"What's that?\" She asks, and you follow her intent gaze, guessing she means the book.\n\n\n\n\"Oh. I'm not sure why I keep that,\" you say. \"It was a gift before it broke. It's the Lord of the Rings. The Two Towers. Well... half a copy.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I thought you said you don't have trinkets to leave.\"\n\n\n\n\"You've never read The Two Towers?\"\n\n\n\n\"I have!\" She says, nearly defensive, nearly proud of herself. \"I own many copies, but I've never owned //half// a copy. And there's something about that.\"\n\n\n\nYou narrow your eyes for a moment, but reach for the gift from a friend that got mangled while you ran for your life, contemplating its worth to her... realising it didn't have worth to you. You slide it towards her snout and watch as her eyes light up. \n\n\n\n\"You're welcome to it.\" You say it so calmly, so matter-of-fact, but do you owe it more than that? \n\n\n\nHer eyes gleam proudly and her whole body shakes from the joy, and she wastes no time. The half-book floats from where you placed it, rising for a while as she looks around, eyeing the nearby shelves. Finally, the half of The Two Towers you've been carrying nestles itself into a shelf away from the spray of the waterfall where it sits watching the water flow by.\n\n\n\n\"You're a gentleman and a scholar,\" she says, the lullaby of her voice turning warmer. \n\n\n\n\"I'm only glad it found a home,\" you say, choosing the mango. \n\n\n\n\"And I suppose you'll keep trying to find yours?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose that's quite a question.\" Your hands rest on your belongings lightly as the cool air touches the wetness forming on your eyes, but you blink it away and look up to smile at your host. \"Thank you for the company, but I think it's time I found a way across.\"\n\n\n\nShe closes her eyes slowly, smiling in her way, and looks downstream. \"Follow the river and you'll find a bridge. There's a door not much further than that.\u00a0\u00a0One day you'll find what you need.\"\n\n\n\n\"One day,\" you say and then you share a farewell and the behemoth made of whispers and dreams pads back into the caverns of her archive, content with her collection. You remain where you are, seated on a bench that shouldn't be here, and listen to the woodland sounds of the Library. You're lighter than before, but your eyes linger on the gift you left her, sitting on its shelf, and you wonder too long if you'll miss it. \n\n\n\nFinally, you repack your bag, nestling the metal chains in their place at the bottom where they can't bruise the fruit, and you set off once more to find a bridge.\n\n------\n\n**Researcher's Notes:** Those reading this tale may encounter anomalously induced ennui for up to three weeks after the fact. Affected readers are encouraged to indulge this by engaging in evening walks, frequently visiting (but not making use of) travel agency websites, complaining about the blandness of food, and partaking in lengthy ramblings regarding grating mundanity to speed the process. If the ennui persists after this period, book the trip, but prepare for rain. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Book Title:** Ardellous Tales, Vol. LXXI: Winter, p. 481\n\n**Discovery Site:** This tale was discovered folded on a windowsill beneath a stained glass window depicting an angel.

You were someone once. A leader. A husband. A father. A man who arrived at the last minute with the right gift and a smile. Now you are simply lost. You forge through endless halls of endless somewheres and none of them the correct one. So you drift...\n\n\n\nYou were a lover. You built a life with her, but before her you planned a life with him. \n\nYou were a father. You mapped the road ahead and hoped they'd like the plan. You even started saving for college.\n\nYou were a son. You made them proud at one point, but when you joined a \"private military contractor\" you could see the disappointment.\n\n\n\nNow you've proven it true. \n\n\n\nSo you drift here through nowhere, torpor claiming you bit-by-bit as the memory of home frays...\n\n\n\nYou are lost. You are alone. You are never going home. Exhaustion nips at your heels, and desperation has claimed your heart. Your knees rest on cold marble, your pack is set down next to you and you stare at the endless rows, silent. Your hands rest in your lap,\u00a0\u00a0loosely cradling the remains of the wand that was supposed to find the exit, and you just stare. Finally, you lay yourself down on the tiles. There is nothing more to say except the only thing that make sense.\n\n\n\n\"Here lies whoever...\" \n\n------\n\n**Researcher's Notes:** Your name does not appear in this tale. If your name appears in this tale, seek amnestic professionals immediately to ensure memory of the tale is lost.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Book Title:** Ardellous Tales, Vol. CLXXXII: The Trails of Dragonflies, p. 1\n\n**Discovery Site:** This tale replaced a page of Gray's Anatomy from Earth 748-A. The textbook was discovered completely by accident in a section of the library dedicated to the cultural practices of the dominant //Rana Sapiens// species of Earth 748-A whose anatomy is captured within the rest of the textbook.\n\n------\n\n= **A Man Who Once Mattered**\n\n\n\nAn august drone surrounds you as you soar through the ravines of the Wanderers' Library on the back of a turquoise dragonfly, its chitin gleaming in the light. Wild laughter flies from your lips as you carve your way towards the rolling hills you've walked across so often now. A second passes and you and your immense mount breach the edge of the ravines, leaving the cliffs behind. Below, the hills undulate in all directions and the paper birds drift lazily. Up here the flocks are larger, drifting in peaceful clouds as you fly onwards, heading to nowhere. \n\n\n\nSteadily, you raise your hands above your head, letting the wind whip across your unkempt hair, cooling your body. You still wear the fatigues, but aside from the chains with the names of your comrades, you carry no symbols of who you were. Those names now sit safe and at rest in your pack. It's laden with climbing materials, you keep a light bedroll strapped to it now. It's best to be prepared for the next cliff face; relying on dragonflies can be a gamble.\n\n\n\nMighty wings drive you forward, the dragonfly vibrating beneath you. It aims for two enormous bookshelves, the silent gates to a quiet vale, and it dives to pick up speed. You lower yourself against the insect, a grin spreading across your face. Exhilaration grips you, and howling cheers burst from your lips as you breach the boundary between the rolling hills and this secluded valley, covered in fruit trees and paper birds. They are not the sparrows from your childhood, but they are the songs of Now and your ear is finding their charm. But right now, you are not seeking song, and the dragonfly leads you deeper into the valley until finally you spy a road, and next to the road, a soup cart where you land.\n\n\n\n\"The same as always?\" The beetle-man calls to you before you've even jumped off the dragonfly.\n\n\n\n\"Chef's Choice just like always!\" You shout back leaping from the insect, landing with a roll for just the fun of it before the dragonfly rises once more and flits towards the shelves where more of its kind dance with the paper birds. She will return when you need her later. For now, there's a cool breeze, books to read, and a smile on the person serving the soup; a day to be had if you've ever seen one.\n\n\n\nYou set your bag on the counter as the beetle-man chirps a song to himself. Old habits die hard, and you still check your supplies whenever you rest even though the Library provides. It's a quick practiced process, but that's probably why you've never thought of it. As the smell of something curried reaches your nose, your eyes spy the compass that spins and the splinters that were a wand you carried but knew nothing about; that last ditch chance and failure you nearly didn't come back from.... In the end it seemed better to at least try. \n\n\n\n\"Doesn't seem useful,\" the beetle-man says as he plops a bowl before you, his eyes are fixed on the splinters and compass. \n\n\n\n\"It's not, is it?\" you say, and perhaps he catches the question in your eyes because he holds out his hand.\n\n\n\n\"I can get rid of it for you if you want,\" he says. \"There's junk traders about if you're keen to go looking, but I see them around, so I'm happy to help.\" And it doesn't take a word more before you hand over the compass and splinters, free of the weight. \n\n\n\nThen grinning, you take a deep sniff of the steaming soup in front of you and ask, \"And what did the chef choose this week?\"\n\n\n\n\"Curried pear and leek,\" the beetle-man shrugs. \"Mundane, I suppose, but now and then it works. Besides, it moves faster than this.\" And he lifts a lid on another steaming pot and immediately a tentacle reaches out followed by a mist that whispers about tomorrow. The beetle shuts it quickly and then smiles at you instead. \"The curried pear and leek tastes more like home than regret.\"\n\n\n\nSo you dip your spoon in, filling it as much as you can. Then once you've cooled it with a breath you sip the soup deeply, letting the memories of home fill you for a moment, and then you smile. \"I'd say it tastes of memory, but I don't know about home.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what memory is that?\"\n\n\n\nYou don't answer, because you don't know, and maybe the beetle-man is right. Here, where you sit, you are safe amongst the tales of universes beyond knowing. Here, where you sit, there is peace for a man who once mattered. You smile a little softly, wondering what comes next. You lay your head on a soft pallet in a treehouse each night, you visit the beetle-man when he comes, you're learning the paper birds' songs, you read books on the shelves here on the hills under suns unseen.\n\n\n\nSo maybe, where you sit, with the beetle-man and his cart, this soup tastes of home, after all. \n\n------\n\n**Researcher's Notes:** The page the tale is written on will occasionally struggle against being handled, but positive reassurances that it will be returned to its copy of Gray's Anatomy will return it to a docile state. Once reading is complete, returning the tale to its correct place in the hijacked textbook is imperative, or the ink will bleed, rendering the piece unreadable for a time. While temperamental, the tale enjoys being read and the smudged ink will return to its normal state after roughly three days.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Mr Panik]]\n\n> **Filename:** bordner2.jpeg\n\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/dvids/ DVIDSHUB]\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/dvids/14051822734/\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["panik-s-perfection-in-progress", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_image", "_licensebox", "bittersweet", "lgbtq", "otherworldly", "second-person", "slice-of-life", "surrealism", "tale", "wanderers-library", "worldbuilding"], "title": "A Man Who Once Mattered - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-man-who-once-mattered", "year": 2026}, "a-memory-of-grafton": {"created_at": "2026-01-22T23:01:00", "creator": "mysticgalaxy", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "mysticgalaxy", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mysticgalaxy", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-22T23:01:00"}, {"author": "mysticgalaxy", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mysticgalaxy", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

The van belonging to the SCP Foundation parked right outside the convenience store. Its driver, Beau, sighed as he took the keys out of the ignition. Of all the days to get stuck in the field.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve got plans tonight. So being that you\u2019re free, I\u2019m\u2026 <em>delegating</em> this to you. Dee's words echoed in his head. They were the bottom of the SCP Foundation\u2019s totem pole, but then, Beau was the dirt underneath it. If he didn\u2019t want to accept orders from them, his only available option was walking out the door and hanging up his cleaning supplies for good.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have plans for tonight too?\u201d He pocketed his keys. \u201c\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t, but you could have at least considered it.\u201d Beau lamented to himself before getting out of the car. His first step down out of the van splashed his beige uniform with muck and dirt from the wet ground, and he grimaced.</p>\n<p>Grabbing a few basic supplies, he rounded the van and saw a man standing just outside the store. He was, simply described, a messy looking person. Beau less politely thought of him as white trash, seeing his tangled, grungy hair poking out from his flip flop sandals. The white wife beater tank top and sullied blue pants looked just as old and musty as they smelled. His hair clung to the back of his balding scalp for dear life, while his tired expression made him look done with life. He seemed unbothered by the hefty rain. Beau hoped this wasn\u2019t the man who owned the store-</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you, janitor man - you my hookup to get this fuckin\u2019 thing outta my store? I didn\u2019t buy this damn thing to have freaks shittin\u2019 on my floor all night!\u201d</p>\n<p>Goddammit. The janitor shook his head, trying to at least pretend to be willing to do the job of his own volition. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Beau. Beau Larkin of the Safe Cleanup Professionals. We sanitize, cleanse, and polish. I hope to be of service.\u201d</p>\n<p>He seemed somewhat appeased by the professionalism. The man shook his hand, glancing down at Beau\u2019s mud-spattered uniform with a furrowed brow. \u201cYeah, uh - Tony Watkins, nice to meetcha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what can I do for you, Mr. Watkins? I was told you had a mess in your store that was scaring away your paying customers?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man, Tony, became quite incensed. \u201cMess? Yeah I got a friggin\u2019 mess - There\u2019s this smelly, green fuck sittin\u2019 on my fridge, eating my whoppers, and wrecking my shit. And listen, my weird as fuck customers don't even care that he's there. The real problem is he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 up my freakin\u2019 store! And when I try to get him to leave he pulls a Glock on me - and, uh, the police think I\u2019m high! So you get in there, janitor man, and you either ice the fucker or get him outta my friggin\u2019 store! This is almost as bad as those freaks with the big meat ball!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, animal control is one of our specialties.\u201d Beau lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a look? Just let me grab my supplies from the truck.\u201d He tried to maintain the professional demeanor, both to appease Tony, and also to try to keep his own sanity.</p>\n<p>Beau went to retrieve his full duffel of the remaining cleaning supplies, cursing himself once again for not buying a taser, and followed the man inside. He was greeted with a half destroyed store, shelves and products spilled out everywhere. Any tubs of icecream, or snack bags, were open and drained of their contents. The cabinet behind the register that contained the cigarettes had been ransacked, and there was a pungent aroma of weed in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God, it looks like a tornado went through here. What exactly did you say did this?\u201d Beau looked back at the owner, fighting to hold his nose while in such close proximity to the other man.</p>\n<p>The fat store owner chuckled, and Beau was uncomfortably attentive to the way he\u2026 undulated. \u201cHeh, yeah I don\u2019t have a damn clue. Why don\u2019t you, uhhh, take a look yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>When they turned into the aisle, Beau didn\u2019t see anything besides the general devastation until he turned his head and nearly jumped back in surprise. Sitting there was a large brown tree frog the approximate size of a grown ass man. He was smoking a lit menthol cigarette while his hands were splayed out, the four fingers fiddling with random debris strewn about. He was sat atop a Hershey\u2019s brand freezer.</p>\n<p>Now, Beau was not a total stranger to strange animals\u2026 but this was fucking ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you, frog thing.\u201d The creature slightly lifted its head, blearily looking at the fat man. \u201cYeah I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, you little shit-stain. I got the janitor on your ass now. Your days are numbered -\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a loud clicking noise, as the frog cocked the Glock and pointed it at Tony. Beau and Tony exclaimed loud noises of surprise, and ducked out of the way as a bullet whizzed by and blew up a vat of Nutella, spilling its contents onto the floor - and Beau\u2019s already dirty shirt.</p>\n<p>Breathing deeply and averting his hyperventilation, Beau asked Tony why he hadn\u2019t called hazardous animal control of some kind if the frog had a gun.</p>\n<p>Tony, in response, looked at Beau like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI got rats, and you can\u2019t sell no food in a place with rats. Your uh, Sucking, Cleaning, Proselytizing or whatever doesn't report to the state. And I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 no damn animal control fees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau didn\u2019t know how to respond, and wrangled the topic back to the matter at hand. \u201cListen, okay? Cleaning I can do. Removing this guy? I mean, he\u2019s got a gun, I don\u2019t really-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t paying you to mull it over. This frog better be gone by the morning or I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m calling your manager.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa. No need for that.\u201d Beau swallowed at the thought of anyone except Dee chewing him out. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAttaboy! Just make sure you lock up afterwards.\u201d He tossed a spare key to Beau and started to head out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Wait, are you not gonna stay to make sure that I finish the job?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got plans with the, uh, ladies, ya know? I mean come on, it\u2019s Friday, I got a couple of bills burnin\u2019 a hole in my pocket. I got better things to do than fuck around with a frog after the 9-5. So uh, get to it, janitor man.\u201d The store owner walked out, and Beau looked away from his filthy attire. He felt a lot better being mercifully separated from the malodorous store owner. He peered around the corner at the frog, who seemed to be fiddling with the Glock before tossing it to the floor. Beau then looked down at the key in his palm as he heard the door shut behind Watkins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Friday. And everyone has plans.\u201d He turned his head over to the frog, who was ominously much closer than before, having approached silently. It was looking at the janitor expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo.\u201d The frog greeted, taking the cigarette out of its mouth and flicking some ash onto the tile floor. It had a deep gravelly voice, not what Beau had expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhhh, yo?\u201d Beau responded, forcing himself to have nerves of steel he didn\u2019t really possess.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Gary. You said your name was Beau?\u201d The frog took another drag from the cigarette as he finished speaking.</p>\n<p>Beau blinked twice, figuring he must have heard him outside. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d The frog took several more drags from the stick, and Beau watched it as a sweat bead dribbled down his wet face. \u201cSo what brings you to, uh, the corner store? Didn\u2019t know frogs liked\u2026 convenience?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog dropped into a splayed out sitting position, his body making a profoundly loud \u2018splop\u2019 noise as it collided with the smoothly tiled floor. \u201cI love frozen dinners and menthols, brother. Can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. This place has \u2018em in spades.\u201d \u2018Gary\u2019 seemed to believe that was reason enough, and went back to taking drags from his cig.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange combination.\u201d Beau hoped that this would be a lot smoother than he was fearing it would have been. \u201cSoooooo, is there like a home I can help you get back to?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog shook his head in the negative, which really meant he shook his entire torso more or less. \u201cAin\u2019t goin\u2019 home. Too much heat on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeat? What\u2026 what did you do?\u201d Beau leaned in, morbidly curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m famous. You never heard of the Chugwater Frogman?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is a Chugwater?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTown in Wyoming. I\u2019m their local frogman. Got tired of their bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau hoped there would be more of an explanation, or at least justification, but he was left wanting. \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay in this corner store, the uhm\u2026 the owner is gonna kill you. With a gun. A really big gun.\u201d Beau lied once again.</p>\n<p>Another wisp of menthol wafted through the air. \u201cNah, I could take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u2026 a bullet? You\u2019re saying you can take a bullet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I've had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cL-like what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot hit by a car once.\u201d The frog looked Beau dead in the eyes, and said, \u201cDo you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau blinked and swallowed. \u201cNo, I don't think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The frog stood up, his feet making little plap noises on the floor as he paced. \u201cListen, this place has everything a frogman could need, except for a nice Olive Garden platter, flat screen, and a DVR so I can watch Big Brother\u2026 sittin\u2019 on a sofa, rubbing my belly, scratchin\u2019 my-\u201d</p>\n<p>The janitor loudly cleared his throat. \u201cWell, look, that sounds awesome but my job right now is to clean this place up. If you want, I can get you somewhere wet at least? Do frogs like wet things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m more of a branch guy, but wet is a good start.\u201d Beau thought that over\u2026</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, Beau had situated Gary on a mop handle he had haphazardly placed inside of a trucker shower stall. Gary was gripping onto it, using it like a branch. It was liable to fall apart any second, but the lukewarm water cascading down Gary\u2019s back giving him a serene expression oddly made it all worth it. Sort of.</p>\n<p>It was much less fun when he had to start wheeling his mop bucket setup back and forth from the main store back to the janitor closet, the same room with the shower stall, and began the arduous task of the clean up. It was going to be quite a long one, between all the spilled food and drinks, cigarette ashes, poop\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cHey wait a minute.\u201d Beau said, looking at Gary as he was dumping out the bucket into the mop sink. Gary opened his eyes, and looked annoyed that he was being talked to. \u201cWhy did you shit all over the store - aren\u2019t you like, basically a human frog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrogman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, so\u2026 Why? Do they not house train frogmen in Wyoming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am burrow trained, thank you very much. That Tony guy just reminds me of the damn truckers who\u2019d come through. Always littering, fouling up the water. One of the reasons I left. I don\u2019t take shit from nobody, but I will shit on people who I think deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Man, Beau wished he could do that. Well, not shit on people\u2019s floors - that would be weird. But he definitely liked the rest of that attitude. \u201cYeah, that Tony guy is\u2026 not great. I\u2019d go so far as to say I think he\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude he smells like shit, at least you only smell like bleach and sadness.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man winced, looking down at his sullied beige uniform. \u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d He felt the soreness in his legs more profoundly, and decided to take a break by sitting down and leaning against the wall. \u201cI guess I am kinda sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frogman looked over, peering out of the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotcha down? You seemed pretty confident back there, like a\u2026 real cleaning professional.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau sighed heavily and leaned on the handle of his mop. \u201cA cleaning professional that barely makes above minimum wage. But it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s the issue, I just\u2026 can\u2019t shake how lonely I feel in this town, y\u2019know? I\u2019m committed to cleaning up Pierre\u2019s messes but I\u2019ve got no one to be in a mess with.\u201d He looked up at the creature.</p>\n<p>The frogman gazed at him with his large, unreadable golden eyes. There was something\u2026 utterly human in those eyes. \u201cNo one? Don\u2019t most people have someone else at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau shrugged. \u201cWell, I have a roommate, but we don\u2019t really talk to each other, just kinda exist in the same space. He wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day even if I was made of money. We just pay rent together.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few moments passed, as the shower continued to run its water, splattering over the floor. Then, Beau looked up from the blue and grey tiles as a brown froggy foot stepped into view. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anybody either. It\u2019s always just been me, not even really sure where I came from but this place seems better than Chugwater. It\u2019s got better janitors at least. And it has more than one restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau smirked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWendy\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau sat up straighter. \u201cNo way dude, me too! You fuck with a vanilla frosty?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gary sat down with a wet noise next to Beau. \u201cThat and the breakfast baconator with the swiss cheese sauce.\u201d</p>\n<p>The janitor nodded. \u201cI feel you, I feel you. Guy I live with only ever wants to order out Little Caesars - no taste whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck Little Caesars, they\u2019re cheap for sure but they taste like cardboard - and I\u2019ve eaten cardboard so I should know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely! I don\u2019t wanna eat a fuckin hot and ready every weekend because he can\u2019t pick up some actual groceries.\u201d A few moments passed, the soothing sound of water on tiles the only noise in the store.</p>\n<p>Then, Gary turned to Beau. \u201cYo, I got a twenty, let\u2019s slam some Dominoes when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026 Really?\u201d Beau asked, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah bro, least I can do after making you pick up my crap -\u201d</p>\n<p>A raucous shattering of glass followed by a series of thuds resonated through the store. The two budding fast food aficionados turned to see two people fall through the window on the side of the room. One man crashed directly onto the floor with a big thunk, while the woman landed more gracefully than her partner, though still not very professionally.</p>\n<p>\u201cCracker down\u2026.\u201d The man on the ground groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, the Pizza Hut in this town is better than the Dominoes.\u201d The woman remarked, cleaning herself off before grabbing her partner and hoisting him up to his feet. Beau noted she used a mechanical arm that seemed to make lifting a grown man effortless. \u201cChudley, you're making us look bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy you gotta say fuck me then? They didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He gestured to Gary and Beau, before desperately looking at them. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2026. can I help you?\u201d Beau was too dumbfounded to even react to Chudley\u2019s question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can help us by staying out of the way, you damn spook.\u201d Maria scoffed.</p>\n<p>Beau blinked, and Gary chuckled. \u201cSpook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things around here and we know you SCPeople are government contractors. Things that go bump in the night disappear around y'all, and you're always driving around in those fuckass Chevy vans.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just a janitor, lady, and I don\u2019t have to explain myself to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to use a damn door!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re from Wyoming.\u201d Gary replied dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us know how to use doors. I broke that window over there when I came in.\u201d Gary pointed at another, larger window that was busted in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna state for the record that I suggested we use a door but my partner wanted to make an entrance in style.\u201d Chudley stepped forward. \u201cThis is Maria Johnston, aspiring parabiologist. And I am Greg Chudley, aspiring has-been.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gary looked at them with contempt. \u201cParabiology isn\u2019t real, dipshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be a real science, once I have a chance to study you.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cThen those chuds at UW will finally see my brilliance.\u201d</p>\n<p>The realization hit Beau like a bag of bricks to who he was dealing with, \u201cYou two are college students?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria glared as though Beau had just said the dumbest thing she\u2019d heard in her entire life. \u201cYeah man. We\u2019re on summer break. Do you not spend your summer break chasing your local cryptid 500 miles to the capital of South Dakota?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d Beau asked, only to be easily thrown aside by Maria\u2019s metal limb.</p>\n<p>Maria pointed an accusing thumb at Greg, who was pretending not to sift through the bags on the ground of the convenience store. \u201cBlame this one\u2019s trust fund for enabling our insane tendencies. Now, Gary. We\u2019ve come a long way for this. I promise I\u2019m not going to hurt you but I need to take you back to my lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frogman made a loud, furious squeaking noise. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not going anywhere! Why does everyone want something from me?!\u201d Gary leapt with an incredible force across the room to distance himself from the pair. A lightbulb went off in his big froggy brain as he saw a discarded firearm on the ground. \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d Gary picked up his Glock 17 and took aim at the collegiate duo. Chudley immediately threw his hands up but Maria held her ground. \u201cYou two skeddaddle! I want to go to Dominoes with Beau and maybe roll around in the soil, just for a bit, and then binge Big Brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the right side of Beau\u2019s body was aching from being thrown to the floor he would have felt all warm and tingly on the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had wanted to hang out with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you're being so loyal to Dominoes. Pizza Hut has the superior pepperoni.\u201d Maria continued to overcompliment Pizza Hut ignoring the fact she was being held at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you like wet dog food! Those \u2018ronis are too damn soggy. Stop trying to change the subject! I will shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take it.\u201d Maria smirked confidently.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being cocky, have you ever been shot before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than getting hit by a car, do you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends on what kind of car. A smart car\u2019s worth of bullets is a lot of bullets but not as many bullets as a Sedan. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I could get my boy to go get the van, could you take a van\u2019s worth of bullets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI survived getting hit by a train. There isn\u2019t a single amount of goddamn bullets that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take!\u201d Maria screamed, and Gary clicked the safety to the off position.</p>\n<p>Beau crawled over to Chudley, who had just found a fifty in the corner and pocketed it. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2026is happening right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, if you haven\u2019t noticed Maria is very\u2026. Particular about the semantics of things. She\u2019s never one to lose an argument, no matter how ridiculous. Or if a frog is pointing a gun at her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRiiight. Should we intervene before she gets herself shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno man, she\u2019s got me convinced. Maybe she could take a cruise ship\u2019s worth of bullets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beau tuned back into the conversation and decided he needed to act. He immediately jumped in between the pair again when Gary chambered a round, and they\u2019d gotten somewhere near space shuttles worth of munition endurance.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, none of you can take any FUCKING amount of bullets. Listen, Gary is the only person in this god forsaken town who seems to want to give me the time of day and I\u2019m not gonna let you take him.\u201d Beau said, impassioned. \u201cThis town is full of oddities, weirdos, and whatever the hell else. I would know. Just fucking pick one to write your paper on but not him, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria stared daggers through Beau at the annoying frogman behind him but the janitor noticed a slight change in her demeanor before she turned around.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. You can take him.\u201d She said over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>Beau slumped with relief, and a little confusion. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re not gonna clock me again?\u201d</p>\n<p>A belabored sigh came from her as she walked away. \u201cWe've got other leads to follow up on. I'm sure we'll find something for the thesis.\u201d She turned around and signaled for Chudley to follow. \u201cWe'll be seeing you around Skipper, dunno how lenient I'll be next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chudley gave a wordless salute as the pair disappeared into the night, leaving Beau and Gary dumbfounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh\u2026 You really mean all that?\u201d Gary asked as he put away his Glock into the place in which he was storing it.</p>\n<p>Beau looked down at the slightly shorter creature. \u201cOf course man. You think that old coot has got more loose bills lying around? I saw that Chudley guy pocket a fifty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the way you think, funny man. Let's get ourselves some Dominoes money!\u201d</p>\n<p>And so Beau and Gary finished cleaning up the store to the best of their ability all except one mess that Gary had left behind in Tony's office, as well they managed to loot at least sixty more dollars from the backroom.</p>\n<p>Their weekend would be filled with delicious pizza and getting Gary set up back at Beau's place. While they didn't have an extra television just for Gary , they did have a window with a convenient angle to their next door neighbor whose favorite show just happened to be Big Brother.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-highlighter-theme\">:scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:cleaning-services\">:scp-wiki:theme:cleaning-services</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> start=--\n\n|name=SYTYCFanon]]\n\n**A Wyoming Frog in Pierre**\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sytycfanon|For more stories click here]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> end=--]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**Friday, 3:07 PM**\n\n[[size 120%]] **Watkins Corner Store** [[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nRain poured hard on the windshield of the broad, white vehicle. The van belonging to the SCP Foundation parked right outside the convenience store. Its driver, Beau, sighed as he took the keys out of the ignition. Of all the days to get stuck in the field.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got plans tonight. So being that you\u2019re free, I\u2019m\u2026 //delegating// this to you.\u00a0\u00a0Dee's\u00a0\u00a0words echoed in his head. They were the bottom of the SCP Foundation\u2019s totem pole, but then, Beau was the dirt underneath it. If he didn\u2019t want to accept orders from them, his only available option was walking out the door and hanging up his cleaning supplies for good.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have plans for tonight too?\u201d He pocketed his keys. \u201c... I mean, I don\u2019t, but you could have at least considered it.\u201d Beau lamented to himself before getting out of the car. His first step down out of the van splashed his beige uniform with muck and dirt from the wet ground, and he grimaced.\n\n\n\nGrabbing a few basic supplies, he rounded the van and saw a man standing just outside the store. He was, simply described, a messy looking person. Beau less politely thought of him as white trash, seeing his tangled, grungy hair poking out from his flip flop sandals. The white wife beater tank top and sullied blue pants looked just as old and musty as they smelled. His hair clung to the back of his balding scalp for dear life, while his tired expression made him look done with life. He seemed unbothered by the hefty rain. Beau hoped this wasn\u2019t the man who owned the store-\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, you, janitor man - you my hookup to get this fuckin\u2019 thing outta my store? I didn\u2019t buy this damn thing to have freaks shittin\u2019 on my floor all night!\u201d\n\n\n\nGoddammit. The janitor shook his head, trying to at least pretend to be willing to do the job of his own volition. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Beau. Beau Larkin of\u00a0\u00a0the Safe Cleanup Professionals. We sanitize, cleanse, and polish. I hope to be of service.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe seemed somewhat appeased by the professionalism. The man shook his hand, glancing down at Beau\u2019s mud-spattered uniform with a furrowed brow. \u201cYeah, uh - Tony Watkins, nice to meetcha.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo what can I do for you, Mr. Watkins? I was told you had a mess in your store that was scaring away your paying customers?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man, Tony, became quite incensed. \u201cMess? Yeah I got a friggin\u2019 mess - There\u2019s this smelly, green fuck sittin\u2019 on my fridge, eating my whoppers, and wrecking my shit. And listen, my weird as fuck customers don't even care that he's there. The real problem is he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 up my freakin\u2019 store! And when I try to get him to leave he pulls a Glock on me - and, uh, the police think I\u2019m high! So you get in there, janitor man, and you either ice the fucker or get him outta my friggin\u2019 store! This is almost as bad as those freaks with the big meat ball!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, animal control is one of our specialties.\u201d Beau lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a look? Just let me grab my supplies from the truck.\u201d He tried to maintain the professional demeanor, both to appease Tony, and also to try to keep his own sanity. \n\n\n\nBeau went to retrieve his full duffel of the remaining cleaning supplies, cursing himself once again for not buying a taser, and followed the man inside. He was greeted with a half destroyed store, shelves and products spilled out everywhere. Any tubs of icecream, or snack bags, were open and drained of their contents. The cabinet behind the register that contained the cigarettes had been ransacked, and there was a pungent aroma of weed in the air. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh God, it looks like a tornado went through here. What exactly did you say did this?\u201d Beau looked back at the owner, fighting to hold his nose while in such close proximity to the other man.\n\n\n\nThe fat store owner chuckled, and Beau was uncomfortably attentive to the way he\u2026 undulated. \u201cHeh, yeah I don\u2019t have a damn clue. Why don\u2019t you, uhhh, take a look yourself?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen they turned into the aisle, Beau didn\u2019t see anything besides the general devastation until he turned his head and nearly jumped back in surprise. Sitting there was a large brown tree frog the approximate size of a grown ass man. He was smoking a lit menthol cigarette while\u00a0\u00a0his hands were splayed out, the four fingers fiddling with random debris strewn about. He was sat atop a Hershey\u2019s brand freezer.\n\n\n\nNow, Beau was not a total stranger to strange animals\u2026 but this was fucking ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, you, frog thing.\u201d The creature slightly lifted its head, blearily looking at the fat man. \u201cYeah I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, you little shit-stain. I got the janitor on your ass now. Your days are numbered -\u201d \n\n\n\nThere was a loud clicking noise, as the frog cocked the Glock and pointed it at Tony. Beau and Tony exclaimed loud noises of surprise, and ducked out of the way as a bullet whizzed by and blew up a vat of Nutella, spilling its contents onto the floor - and Beau\u2019s already dirty shirt.\n\n\n\nBreathing deeply and averting his hyperventilation, Beau asked Tony why he hadn\u2019t called hazardous animal control of some kind if the frog had a gun.\n\n\n\nTony, in response, looked at Beau like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI got rats, and you can\u2019t sell no food in a place with rats. Your uh, Sucking, Cleaning, Proselytizing or whatever doesn't report to the state. And I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 no damn animal control fees.\u201d \n\n\n\nBeau didn\u2019t know how to respond, and wrangled the topic back to the matter at hand. \u201cListen, okay? Cleaning I can do. Removing this guy? I mean, he\u2019s got a gun, I don\u2019t really-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t paying you to mull it over. This frog better be gone by the morning or I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m calling your manager.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa. No need for that.\u201d Beau swallowed at the thought of anyone except Dee chewing him out. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 figure it out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAttaboy! Just make sure you lock up afterwards.\u201d He tossed a spare key to Beau and started to head out.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Wait, are you not gonna stay to make sure that I finish the job?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got plans with the, uh, ladies, ya know? I mean come on, it\u2019s Friday, I got a couple of bills burnin\u2019 a hole in my pocket. I got better things to do than fuck around with a frog after the 9-5. So uh, get to it, janitor man.\u201d The store owner walked out, and Beau looked away from his filthy attire. He felt a lot better being\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mercifully separated from the malodorous store owner. He peered around the corner at the frog, who seemed to be fiddling with the Glock before tossing it to the floor. Beau then looked down at the key in his palm as he heard the door shut behind Watkins.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Friday. And everyone has plans.\u201d He turned his head over to the frog, who was ominously much closer than before, having approached silently. It was looking at the janitor expectantly.\n\n\n\n\u201cYo.\u201d The frog greeted, taking the cigarette out of its mouth and flicking some ash onto the tile floor. It had a deep gravelly voice, not what Beau had expected.\n\n\n\n\u201cUhhhh, yo?\u201d Beau responded, forcing himself to have nerves of steel he didn\u2019t really possess.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Gary. You said your name was Beau?\u201d The frog took another drag from the cigarette as he finished speaking.\n\n\n\nBeau blinked twice, figuring he must have heard him outside. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d The frog took several more drags from the stick, and Beau watched it as a sweat bead dribbled down his wet face. \u201cSo what brings you to, uh, the corner store? Didn\u2019t know frogs liked\u2026 convenience?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog dropped into a splayed out sitting position, his body making a profoundly loud \u2018splop\u2019 noise as it collided with the smoothly tiled floor. \u201cI love frozen dinners and menthols, brother. Can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. This place has \u2018em in spades.\u201d \u2018Gary\u2019 seemed to believe that was reason enough, and went back to taking drags from his cig.\n\n\n\n\u201cStrange combination.\u201d Beau hoped that this would be a lot smoother than he was fearing it would have been. \u201cSoooooo, is there like a home I can help you get back to?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog shook his head in the negative, which really meant he shook his entire torso more or less. \u201cAin\u2019t goin\u2019 home. Too much heat on me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHeat? What\u2026 what did you do?\u201d Beau leaned in, morbidly curious.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famous. You never heard of the Chugwater Frogman?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is a Chugwater?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTown in Wyoming. I\u2019m their local frogman. Got tired of their bullshit.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau hoped there would be more of an explanation, or at least justification, but he was left wanting. \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay in this corner store, the uhm\u2026 the owner is gonna kill you. With a gun. A really big gun.\u201d Beau lied once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother wisp of menthol wafted through the air. \u201cNah, I could take it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA\u2026 a bullet? You\u2019re saying you can take a bullet?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I've had worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cL-like what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGot hit by a car once.\u201d The frog looked Beau dead in the eyes, and said, \u201cDo you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau blinked and swallowed. \u201cNo, I don't think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c...Have you?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frog stood up, his feet making little plap noises on the floor as he paced. \u201cListen, this place has everything a frogman could need, except for a nice Olive Garden platter, flat screen, and a DVR so I can watch Big Brother\u2026 sittin\u2019 on a sofa, rubbing my belly, scratchin\u2019 my-\u201d\n\n\n\nThe janitor loudly cleared his throat. \u201cWell, look, that sounds awesome but my job right now is to clean this place up. If you want, I can get you somewhere wet at least? Do frogs like wet things?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m more of a branch guy, but wet is a good start.\u201d Beau thought that over\u2026\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, Beau had situated Gary on a mop handle he had haphazardly placed inside of a trucker shower stall. Gary was gripping onto it, using it like a branch. It was liable to fall apart any second, but the lukewarm water cascading down Gary\u2019s back giving him a serene expression oddly made it all worth it. Sort of.\n\n\n\nIt was much less fun when he had to start wheeling his mop bucket setup back and forth from the main store back to the janitor closet, the same room with the shower stall, and began the arduous task of the clean up. It was going to be quite a long one, between all the spilled food and drinks, cigarette ashes, poop\u2013\n\n\n\n\u201cHey wait a minute.\u201d Beau said, looking at Gary as he was dumping out the bucket into the mop sink. Gary opened his eyes, and looked annoyed that he was being talked to. \u201cWhy did you shit all over the store - aren\u2019t you like, basically a human frog?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFrogman.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRight, so\u2026 Why? Do they not house train frogmen in Wyoming?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am burrow trained, thank you very much. That Tony guy just reminds me of the damn truckers who\u2019d come through. Always littering, fouling up the water. One of the reasons I left. I don\u2019t take shit from nobody, but I will shit on people who I think deserve it.\u201d\n\n\n\nMan, Beau wished he could do that. Well, not shit on people\u2019s floors - that would be weird. But he definitely liked the rest of that attitude. \u201cYeah, that Tony guy is\u2026 not great. I\u2019d go so far as to say I think he\u2019s an ass.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDude he smells like shit, at least you only smell like bleach and sadness.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man winced, looking down at his sullied beige uniform. \u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d He felt the soreness in his legs more profoundly, and decided to take a break by sitting down and leaning against the wall. \u201cI guess I am kinda sad.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frogman looked over, peering out of the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotcha down? You seemed pretty confident back there, like a\u2026 real cleaning professional.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau sighed heavily and leaned on the handle of his mop. \u201cA cleaning professional that barely makes above minimum wage. But it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s the issue, I just\u2026 can\u2019t shake how lonely I feel in this town, y\u2019know? I\u2019m committed to cleaning up Pierre\u2019s messes but I\u2019ve got no one to be in a mess with.\u201d He looked up at the creature.\n\n\n\nThe frogman gazed at him with his large, unreadable golden eyes. There was something\u2026 utterly human in those eyes. \u201cNo one? Don\u2019t most people have someone else at home?\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau shrugged. \u201cWell, I have a roommate, but we don\u2019t really talk to each other, just kinda exist in the same space. He wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day even if I was made of money. We just pay rent together.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few moments passed, as the shower continued to run its water, splattering over the floor. Then, Beau looked up from the blue and grey tiles as a brown froggy foot stepped into view. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anybody either. It\u2019s always just been me, not even really sure where I came from but this place seems better than Chugwater. It\u2019s got better janitors at least. And it has more than one restaurant.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau smirked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to eat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau sat up straighter. \u201cNo way dude, me too! You fuck with a vanilla frosty?\u201d\n\n\n\nGary sat down with a wet noise next to Beau. \u201cThat and the breakfast baconator with the swiss cheese sauce.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe janitor nodded. \u201cI feel you, I feel you. Guy I live with only ever wants to order out Little Caesars - no taste whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck Little Caesars, they\u2019re cheap for sure but they taste like cardboard - and I\u2019ve eaten cardboard so I should know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! I don\u2019t wanna eat a fuckin hot and ready every weekend because he can\u2019t pick up some actual groceries.\u201d A few moments passed, the soothing sound of water on tiles the only noise in the store.\n\n\n\nThen, Gary turned to Beau. \u201cYo, I got a twenty, let\u2019s slam some Dominoes when you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2026 Really?\u201d Beau asked, stunned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah bro, least I can do after making you pick up my crap -\u201d\n\n\n\nA raucous shattering of glass followed by a series of thuds resonated through the store. The two budding fast food aficionados turned to see two people fall through the window on the side of the room. One man crashed directly onto the floor with a big thunk, while the woman landed more gracefully than her partner, though still not very professionally.\n\n\n\n\u201cCracker down\u2026.\u201d The man on the ground groaned.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, the Pizza Hut in this town is better than the Dominoes.\u201d The woman remarked, cleaning herself off before grabbing her partner and hoisting him up to his feet. Beau noted she used a mechanical arm that seemed to make lifting a grown man effortless. \u201cChudley, you're making us look bad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy you gotta say fuck me then? They didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He gestured to Gary and Beau, before desperately looking at them. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see that, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2026. can I help you?\u201d Beau was too dumbfounded to even react to Chudley\u2019s question.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can help us by staying out of the way, you damn spook.\u201d Maria scoffed.\n\n\n\nBeau blinked, and Gary chuckled. \u201cSpook?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things around here and we know you SCPeople are government contractors. Things that go bump in the night disappear around y'all, and you're always driving around in those fuckass Chevy vans.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a janitor, lady, and I don\u2019t have to explain myself to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to use a damn door!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re from Wyoming.\u201d Gary replied dryly. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of us know how to use doors. I broke that window over there when I came in.\u201d Gary pointed at another, larger window that was busted in.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna state for the record that I suggested we use a door but my partner wanted to make an entrance in style.\u201d Chudley stepped forward. \u201cThis is Maria Johnston, aspiring parabiologist. And I am Greg Chudley, aspiring has-been.\u201d\n\n\n\nGary looked at them with contempt. \u201cParabiology isn\u2019t real, dipshit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be a real science, once I have a chance to study you.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cThen those chuds at UW will finally see my brilliance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe realization hit Beau like a bag of bricks to who he was dealing with, \u201cYou two are college students?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria glared as though Beau had just said the dumbest thing she\u2019d heard in her entire life. \u201cYeah man. We\u2019re on summer break. Do you not spend your summer break chasing your local cryptid 500 miles to the capital of South Dakota?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d Beau asked, only to be easily thrown aside by Maria\u2019s metal limb. \n\n\n\nMaria pointed an accusing thumb at Greg, who was pretending not to sift through the bags on the ground of the convenience store. \u201cBlame this one\u2019s trust fund for enabling our insane tendencies. Now, Gary. We\u2019ve come a long way for this. I promise I\u2019m not going to hurt you but I need to take you back to my lab.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frogman made a loud, furious squeaking noise. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not going anywhere! Why does everyone want something from me?!\u201d Gary leapt with an incredible force across the room to distance himself from the pair. A lightbulb went off in his big froggy brain as he saw a discarded firearm on the ground. \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d Gary picked up his Glock 17 and took aim at the collegiate duo. Chudley immediately threw his hands up but Maria held her ground. \u201cYou two skeddaddle! I want to go to Dominoes with Beau and maybe roll around in the soil, just for a bit, and then binge Big Brother.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf the right side of Beau\u2019s body was aching from being thrown to the floor he would have felt all warm and tingly on the inside. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had wanted to hang out with him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you're being so loyal to Dominoes. Pizza Hut has the superior pepperoni.\u201d Maria continued to overcompliment Pizza Hut ignoring the fact she was being held at gunpoint.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you like wet dog food! Those \u2018ronis are too damn soggy. Stop trying to change the subject! I will shoot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can take it.\u201d Maria smirked confidently.\n\n\n\n\u201cStop being cocky, have you ever been shot before?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than getting hit by a car, do you know how many bullets you can fit in a car?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDepends on what kind of car. A smart car\u2019s worth of bullets is a lot of bullets but not as many bullets as a Sedan. \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I could get my boy to go get the van, could you take a van\u2019s worth of bullets?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI survived getting hit by a train. There isn\u2019t a single amount of goddamn bullets that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take!\u201d Maria screamed, and Gary clicked the safety to the off position.\n\n\n\nBeau crawled over to Chudley, who had just found a fifty in the corner and pocketed it. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2026is happening right now?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, uh, if you haven\u2019t noticed Maria is very\u2026. Particular about the semantics of things. She\u2019s never one to lose an argument, no matter how ridiculous. Or if a frog is pointing a gun at her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRiiight. Should we intervene before she gets herself shot?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI dunno man, she\u2019s got me convinced. Maybe she could take a cruise ship\u2019s worth of bullets.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeau tuned back into the conversation and decided he needed to act. He immediately jumped in between the pair again when Gary chambered a round, and they\u2019d gotten somewhere near space shuttles worth of munition endurance.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, none of you can take any FUCKING amount of bullets. Listen, Gary is the only person in this god forsaken town who seems to want to give me the time of day and I\u2019m not gonna let you take him.\u201d Beau said, impassioned. \u201cThis town is full of oddities, weirdos, and whatever the hell else. I would know. Just fucking pick one to write your paper on but not him, please.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaria stared daggers through Beau at the annoying frogman behind him but the janitor noticed a slight change in her demeanor before she turned around.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. You can take him.\u201d She said over her shoulder.\n\n\n\nBeau slumped with relief, and a little confusion. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re not gonna clock me again?\u201d\n\n\n\nA belabored sigh came from her as she walked away. \u201cWe've got other leads to follow up on. I'm sure we'll find something for the thesis.\u201d She turned around and signaled for Chudley to follow. \u201cWe'll be seeing you around Skipper, dunno how lenient I'll be next time.\u201d \n\n\n\nChudley gave a wordless salute as the pair disappeared into the night, leaving Beau and Gary dumbfounded.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, uh\u2026 You really mean all that?\u201d Gary asked as he put away his Glock into the place in which he was storing it.\n\n\n\nBeau looked down at the slightly shorter creature. \u201cOf course man. You think that old coot has got more loose bills lying around? I saw that Chudley guy pocket a fifty.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI like the way you think, funny man. Let's get ourselves some Dominoes money!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so Beau and Gary finished cleaning up the store to the best of their ability all except one mess that Gary had left behind in Tony's office, as well they managed to loot at least sixty more dollars from the backroom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTheir weekend would be filled with delicious pizza and getting Gary set up back at Beau's place. While they didn't have an extra television just for Gary , they did have a window with a convenient angle to their next door neighbor whose favorite show just happened to be Big Brother.\n", "references": ["sytycfanon"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "cleanliness-guaranteed", "greg-chudley", "tale"], "title": "A Wyoming Frog In Pierre - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-wyoming-frog-in-pierre", "year": 2026}, "abasedebase": {"created_at": "2026-01-13T14:58:00", "creator": "whenwerewe", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-13T14:58:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-13T15:00:00"}, {"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"black-diamond-billions-hub\".", "date": "2026-01-13T15:00:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Added tags: corporate, fantasy, first-person, ghost, marshall-carter-and-dark, science-fiction, slice-of-life.

Dropping back from the centre I try out an insouciant look: leaning against the far wall, examining the unscuffed mirror. As my back makes contact with the shuddering steel behind me I feel it. Shards of bass-thrum embed in my spine, grow around my skull, a premonition of the terrible music waiting for me above. Miserable proto-Sarkic noise-pop, dragged writhing from an \u201821 grave to haunt a \u201823 party.</p>\n<p>Okay. So my host has bad taste. That\u2019s just the job. People with good taste don\u2019t hire artists; they make art. Only one chance at this, so focus on what matters:</p>\n<p>In the reflection I\u2019m wiry in an ill-fitting suit, festooned in chains and miscellaneous leather accoutrements, with overgenerous eyeliner and ironical side-swept hair bringing the fit together. Incongruous blocky features, skin alabaster to the point of translucence, pupils fixed and staring even as the fascia move under my skin, brows knotting and unknotting. I\u2019m a kid from a scene that\u2019s yet to be reborn. The joke will land with this crowd, I\u2019m certain. I did a little market research beforehand, as they\u2019d call it. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019d think I was being tacky <em>sincerely</em>. Right?</p>\n<p>(But then again, they might see right through the winking self-deprecation, spear me through the heart with a thought, and then where will I be? If \u2014 )</p>\n<p>I bounce urgently off the wall, one leg springing me back to the centre of the pointlessly spacious lift, and my eyes dart around, taking in the detail, trying to drown the doubt. I can\u2019t afford to indulge my skittishness at this late hour.</p>\n<p>Opulence and beauty have a parabolic relationship; on the far side of the valley of kitsch is the rising cliff-face of real elegance. Absurdly, that\u2019s where the decor lands. Aside from the mirror on the east wall (redoubling the setting sun) every surface is covered in delicate trimmed-back gilding. Above me as I crane my neck are the twelvefold panels of a dome delicately enamelled with the lives of the apostles. As the lift rises past the mundane roof of the building, into the celestial floors, the figures take on a life of their own: laughing, praying, locked in bitter struggle.</p>\n<p>I narrow my eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an attempt at metacommentary, winking at the viewer, presumed some novice, at how it draws attention with tawdry motion while the grace of the original artist fades into the background. <em>God</em>, it says, <em>maybe we should install shortform video panels in all our galleries, and that\u2019ll get the kids in.</em> But this kind of moralising is hollow \u2014 they have made the work hideous, and not even interestingly hideous. This is the degree of infatuation with crude occult hackery I should have expected from my hosts, but still it disappoints. That\u2019s the second bad sign.</p>\n<p>A clear tone. The lambent far wall of the elevator slides open. Beyond is an unexpectedly narrow corridor, brightly lit by swooping crystal fixtures. To the right it ends abruptly, as if the architect simply walked away from the incomplete plans. The floor gives way to half a kilometre of whipping wind, and below it, spreadeagled, a vermillion world nearly bisected by a strip of slow whitecapped churn, where Lake Michigan rumbles against neo-gothic never-dead Chicago.</p>\n<p>I take it in for a heartbeat, and then back off. I don\u2019t want to be seen shying away, but heights have never agreed with me.</p>\n<p>Down the left-hand path is a blessedly plain oak door, attended by a woman wearing a sleek Bardot and a perfectly measured smile. No, not a woman, by that glimmer at her neckline, which is not quite a jewel: a gynoid, probably the single most contemptible innovation I\u2019ve ever heard of. I feel my mouth twitching into a sneer, but what if they see through her, and know my face? Instead I approach an image of meekness and nod at her with a curt quirk of my own lips. She \u2014 it? \u2014 fuck these people for doing this to me. The <em>thing</em> tilts its head one moment in what is surely an imitation of human curiosity, purposeless except in the sympathy it elicits, and asks:</p>\n<p>\u201cLukas Havel? I hope the journey treated you well.\u201d</p>\n<p>They chartered a private craft for me, and still managed to make me late. They <em>probably</em> aren\u2019t the types to lash out over a complaint, but why take the risk?</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty good! But please, call me by my work name. We will be professionals here, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>(Widening my nonchalant little smirk, playing up the eurojank for the audience.)</p>\n<p>It swings the door open and nods once, flicking its eyes in a once-over across my body, eyebrows raised in appreciation. Choke on it, Anderson, you rat, I think, and step inside.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing (the worst thing) is the music. I heard the bassline below the clouds, conducted unknowably through brass lines extending the whole length of the elevator, but the sound itself is contained to this room. A better word would be <em>concentrated</em>, because now that I\u2019m finally exposed it roars over and into me, worse than ever.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to pen down mentally an assessment of the lounge\u2019s aesthetic qualities, but in the blaring neon light, scintillating over two dozen sweaty bodies, it's impossible to make any real judgment. Instead, I make my way past wandering staff (who try to foist on me flutes of some obscure vintage) and head straight for the open bar, where the music is in a lull. It\u2019s done up in a faux-speakeasy getup, all dark panelling and bowtied vendors. I\u2019ve never scored a commission sober, so I snag a piquant vermouth negroni.</p>\n<p>Not a moment too soon: As I move away from the bar someone claps me on the back with a throaty bark.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s the man! We really did muck up the scheduling, but, well, no use crying over spilled milk, am I right?\u201d</p>\n<p>I do not grimace and turn toward the unctuous voice of Harold \u201cHarry\u201d Freeman, Chief of Marketing for Anderson\u2019s North American branch, recently hired after being caught up in the tertiary fallout of the infamous Foundation infilitration affair.</p>\n<p>He would have been handsome when he was younger, but something has wilted, and his features droop waxen down his face. Greying hair has beaten a retreat from his temples and his head is crowned in a widow\u2019s peak. Despite his withered muscles, his handshake is firm enough to crush my phalanges. I feel a heady flush, and then a stab of queasiness. If I piss this guy off enough, that's the last six months of networking wasted.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, he seems ebullient as he pumps my wrist erratically up and down, arms emerging from a carefully-fit and carelessly-dyed Hawaiian affair. He gestures magnanimously to the two others who have followed him to the bar, forming a circle.</p>\n<p>The first of them is a rather fetching lady in monochrome: white flats and palazzos, sable blouse, ivory jacket, jet sunglasses, etcetera. On any other day I would be stunned to be face-to-face with Beznash Bekele, egomantrix extraordinaire, one of whose shows set me on this path, but her accompaniment pins me to the spot with a glance.</p>\n<p>Those foppish manners, the peach fuzz on his lips, is that a short bob with bangs over his forehead? After a certain point one sets fashions rather than serving them, I suppose. I don\u2019t try to hide the tremor in my voice as I answer:</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t miss too much. Thanks for keeping an eye out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I address my remark to the second man, much to Harry\u2019s frowned displeasure \u2014 but so what? Only an idiot greets the Marshall heir <em>second</em>. \u2014 and give what I know must be a sickly smile.</p>\n<p>Ms. Bekele laughs, high and clear, and says:</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are not going to bite your head off, you know? And Harry has been talking you up all evening. If you are silent the rest of the night I am sure he will still be satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p>(She has the infamous Italian accent.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI do try to keep abreast of movements in the art world, you know. Now, I\u2019m no aficionado, certainly can\u2019t say I have Bez\u2019s knack for these things \u2014\u201d her expression dims a milliwatt, \u201c\u2014 but I could hardly miss out on <em>you</em>, young man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not wardens of culture, then we\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Chrysophilus\u2019 first contribution to the conversation, and he says it so drily that I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s mocking me. It sounds like he\u2019s quoting someone. He probably already hates my work, the insightless constructed lives, the brief forays into dadaist incoherence. Damn, damn, damn, I can save this.</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t catch the irony, or perhaps I\u2019m delusional, because he barrels on.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecisely! That\u2019s the insight that, well, that\u2019s kept our firm afloat all these years. Anderson, the man has <em>money</em>, more money than God, but petty cash can\u2019t buy <em>refinement</em>. People just can\u2019t take it seriously, all that cyber-network mainframe crap. That\u2019s why, Chris, you\u2019re going to inherit a keystone of the whole, this whole hidden subculture, and Anderson will just be another silicon catamite in ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chrysophilius nurses a tumbler of golden drink, and as he takes a sip I think I spy a grimace on that perfectly-framed face. Bekele manages his reproach for him (well-trained, I can\u2019t help but think).</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Freeman, it is no shame to have a transactional interest in the arts, but you are hardly supposed to <em>say it out loud</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws up his hands in defeat and gives a conciliatory wink around the circle.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you\u2019ve got me. Still the marketing man, eh? I do apologise, Lukas, Antispace, whatever name you\u2019d prefer, but these are the vulgar lines of questioning I exist to plumb. I get my hands dirty with all this low culture claptrap and the rest of the firm patronises the finer stuff in peace. But, please, enough about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mention of my pseudonym, which is probably the single most embarrassing aspect of my career, does not draw a wince from me, because I have been expecting it all evening. Instead I force a laugh alongside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my honour to be here. I cannot say that I expected the call, but of course for an opportunity to be among this company \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, do not flatter me,\u201d interjects Bekele, flicking one hand dismissively, \u201cThey\u2019ve been singing my praises for actual years. Instead,\u201d and she leans forward, stage-whispering, \u201cTell me what you think of the piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>I glance around wildly. Only one thing catches my eye: Bekele\u2019s centerpiece, a humming cylinder of cerebral tissue, ten feet tall, flayed by a hundred electrodes, to which a man screaming in vulgate Latin is being dragged. The other partygoers strap him into a purposefully rickety plastic chair as his face flashes through terror and ecstasy, and then he gets up laughing. From him a captive mind has been extracted and returned to its glisteningly organic container: the spirit of Valerius Solanus, who learned the secret name of Rome, and was condemned to wander the Earth eternal. Guests line up to pull him from his fleshy cage and let him live in them for sixty seconds, feel his hate and desperation, then reel him back out. Bekele\u2019s contemplation of how history inhabits us, they say.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s distinctive,\u201d I demur, not wanting to give her the tongue-lashing she deserves, \u201cAnd it\u2019s an excellent choice of subject; I mean, Christ, that Italian does not stop talking. I don\u2019t even speak the language and I feel bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>I chuckle and even Chrysophilius joins in, polite hollow <em>hahahaha</em>s, but unbelievably Harry has seen right through me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Lukas has to be diplomatic, poor guy\u2019s the ambassador of the new pseudo-identitarian wave, and I\u2019m not and I don\u2019t, so I\u2019ll say he thinks it\u2019s utter wank, if you\u2019ll forgive the expression. I mean, you set this thing up, basically treading on his toes, artificial experiences and so on, and all while we want to commission his own work. It\u2019s practically an insult, and anyone can see that though Bez has her vision, she just can\u2019t achieve the same depth with a <em>real</em> spirit that our boy Havel can with his homunculi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now: he\u2019s not wrong. I am a student of the artificial psychosphere; I build sixty-second slices of a life for any passerby to inhabit. This resurrectionism is a pale shadow of my art. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s confirmed he might want some work out of me. On the other had, <em>what the fuck is he doing</em>? I shoot him an expression of repressed horror, the kind of thing you have to use at public functions, but he\u2019s not looking at either of us artsy types. He has eyes only for his blonde leaseholder leashholder, who blows him off with a single skewed eye-roll.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard that little insight somewhere before,\u201d he replies, \u201cIn, oh, was it the <em>Deer College Odyssey</em>? As original as ever, buddy. I see why Dad brought you in.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes flick either side, to me and Bekele, as he shows just a hint of teeth, and Harry\u2019s own grin fades. That gaze holds some real spite (for who?) and Freeman quails. He looks away, to the bar, making some private illuminated sign that draws from the bartender two shots of girlish strawberry-scented vodka. Chrysophilius shakes his head. I want to take a jab myself, but \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Bekele, sparing me Harry\u2019s pique.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too old, madame, to stick to manly fashions. And you, I insist,\u201d he adds, passing me one saccharine sticky shotglass. I cast my eyes around but the other two seem unwilling to help me. Beznash raises her eyebrows (what are you waiting for, punk, inserts the grizzled voice I\u2019ve assigned her internally) and Chrysophilius could be mistaken for amused, but there\u2019s a tense aspect to him.</p>\n<p>I throw back the cloying liquor, do not make a face, and set down the glass on the bartop.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Harry.\u201d mutters Chrysophilius (perhaps he prefers Chris? I\u2019ll think of him that way; a preemptive strike on our friendship), \u201cUppers. Or downers. Not both, for God\u2019s sake. It is <em>not that fucking hard</em>.\u201d Like he wants to be angry, but can\u2019t quite summon it up. Something stuck in his craw?</p>\n<p>Now that I properly look at Freeman, though, there really is something electric to him, his breath and body thrillingly warm even as his skin dessicates, manic in his movements. I\u2019m not a biologist, but anartists love their allegory, and I\u2019m reminded of the sight of a rat twitching galvanically, reduced to a facsimile of life by an ampere.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow!\u201d he cries, inordinately loud, \u201cWhat do you think of the music? I think that\u2019s real Old Slavonic; Skitter had a spectral monk consulted on the proper forms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018Skitter\u2019 spreads his arms, feigning modesty (his type, obviously, cannot mean it).</p>\n<p>\u201cWe both know I\u2019m not a musician. I just gave my girl a little shove; the rest is her work, which means it\u2019s God\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>(By his expression he thinks he has said something wise.)</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I was never a music guy. Neither are you, of course, but there is a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to having a real <em>artiste</em>\u2019s view. Go on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why the fuck has he started spouting French? Does he think I\u2019m French? Is it some kind of bit? Bekele by his side clearly wants to make some acid remark, but Chris has gotten into the swing of things, now.</p>\n<p>\u201cFreeman, as he says, is a salesman. He thinks we pay artists so we can lure in more customers with some <em>pretty pictures</em>. It\u2019s hardly his fault, but what we know \u2014 and Bez, here, of course \u2014 is that it\u2019s backwards; all my money\u2019s good for nothing if it isn\u2019t good for art. What is the point of power if I can\u2019t build a little beauty, hm? That\u2019s all I really want to be able to say at the end, that I left this world prettier than I found it. Not that I hit some real good KPIs!\u201d</p>\n<p>(He is pulling this snobbery from somewhere outside himself: it\u2019s not in his nature to look down on good workers.)</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it work out, you think? Good piece?\u201d</p>\n<p>He probably does not realise that his rant sounds positively Hitlerian, and I definitely won\u2019t be the one to alert him. Now, how to massage his ego? I squint a little and listen in to the squealing riffs, the uninterestingly disharmonious spikes of signal, and what sound like neofolk lyrics that got horribly lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwful,\u201d I think, and say, because I really shouldn\u2019t have agreed to that shot. I have to go on, because commitment is the only way to save this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the most unmemorable thing I\u2019ve heard since I left the Vienna underground, and for them you could say they really were <em>experimental</em>, but this is imitation of indie, the worst kind of industry plant bullshit. I have no idea what you were thinking, and I would ask for a refund.\u201d</p>\n<p>God, I got too into it. I can hear the carefully neutral midwestern American accent fall away, that Czech snarl leaking back into my voice. And as expected, when I look at Chris\u2019 face, there\u2019s the disappointment, the irritation, even (though it\u2019s fathoms deep, this I know better than anything else) the hurt. But though he\u2019s dropped the shit-eating smirk I can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019s also happier than ever.</p>\n\n<p>I drift through the next hours semi-conscious, still not past the instant of terror where I thought I\u2019d wasted my chance on a cheap shot at his house musician. At some point we take a seat in some nook; Chris (who I cannot bring myself to think of as \u2018Skitter\u2019) buys us a round of nutty amaretto, though he doesn\u2019t partake, and Bekele some shockingly smaragdine sours. Other drinks diffuse between the three of us as he watches on, grimly sober. The conversation drifts away from me, as does Freeman, off to talk business with his \u2018lads\u2019 elsewhere. This is strictly still an industry meeting; the art is as always a showpiece first and foremost (the artists, too).</p>\n<p>A few mumbles carry me through the banal conversation we manage, and I let my attention wander as Chris halfheartedly tries to keep up with Bekele\u2019s talk on the contesting ontologies of historiography. She\u2019s a striking figure, though she often struggles to get out from under the shadow of her name. That melodic Latian accent is the product of a distinguished family history of which she prefers not to speak. She\u2019s not the type whose presence can be bought for any sane price, which means that improbably Chrissy has something she actually wants. She\u2019s a legendary laconic, having memorably excised her own last memory of her half-brother at a Glaswegian exhibition, so that means he has <em>hooks</em> in her, real barbed things gleaming with a promise, waiting for me too, if only I take the bait.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the junior Marshall. He cuts an indistinct figure: skim off the designer overwear, fix that <em>hair</em>, and he\u2019d blend seamlessly into any \u2014 every \u2014 crowd on the planet. (Isn\u2019t that a thought, pale skin and bone glimmering at the centre of some town square? But no, so lithe, not enough weight behind the tread, and altogether still too boyish, not my type.) He scarfs down the scant hors d\u2019ouevres, slivers of steak tartare still bloody, carmine running down the curve of his neck. He chews methodically, with a distant expression, like this is his day job. The lines of his face are distant as he looks, oh Christ he\u2019s looking right into my eyes, forcing a smile, bits of bovine filigree stuck in his teeth.</p>\n<p>He stands upright to my side of the table we\u2019re situated at and throws his arms about my shoulders in a stiff embrace.</p>\n<p>\u201cLukas, Luke, you really need to be more aggressive. You let that old scrote run circles around you. You need to be tapped in on this, marketplace attitude, on the balls of your feet.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grabs my shoulders, and I recede deeper into the plush of my seating, stickying the genuine leather with my sweat. His voice isn\u2019t slurring at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re rocking with the punches, then you\u2019ve got the <em>momentum</em>. Mo-<em>men</em>-tum. Be the man, my man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bekele is sat primly on the third seat, legs neatly folded, sipping her schnapps. It\u2019s not fair that she handles her drink better than either of us, but what can you do? She looks distinctly disdainful of the whole affair, and I can\u2019t pass any further judgment because now Skitter\u2019s face is right up in mine, breath rank against me, and I\u2019m not going to kiss him because he\u2019s definitely not doing that on purpose, the legendary bachelor. (But what if\u2014)</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>One finger crackles between us.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He twirls on one leg, and looks back over his shoulder at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like this? You\u2019re going to get a commission out of this, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because apparently I pissed all sanity out to make room for the third flavoured shot, calling up an old college memory for someone in the C-suite out in the crowd. I spent the entire trip here worrying about my financials and lost them the first wineglass someone passed me. I really should be down for this.</p>\n<p>He pivots to face me again, keeping his distance this time, and juts his chin out at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeak up. I didn\u2019t bring you here to mope.\u201d</p>\n<p>(This to Bekele, still sour on her own:)</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have seen this coming. Invite in my own Diogenes and what does he do? Sits in his barrel all day! I need a better class of cynic.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rounds away from me, on me, again and again. An insight: Foucault\u2019s pendulum is unvarying; when it seems to move it only tracks the motion of the Earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome <em>on</em>! You had an opinion just now. Do you know how many <em>new</em> peoples\u2019 opinions I get to hear in a year? Here's a hint, it\u2019s in the single digits. Just this fucking circle, over and over \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts off to take a breath, pressing down some memory. Something he just said finally clicks into a part of my brain gummed up by the acetate haze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me anywhere, Chris.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops, stunned, as do I. This backtalk will get me literally killed. I think I might have caught him offguard with the insight, oh God, what happens now?</p>\n<p>He makes a moue of displeasure.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Skitter</em>, please. Nobody calls me Chris. I\u2019m not a teenage model, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah. But then what \u2014</p>\n<p>Bekele polishes off her last mouthful and stands up to join Chris, (who is Skitter), leaving me feeling terminally surrounded. She shoots him a scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did say you would slip very fast, if you recall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, Bez, I\u2019m not done yet \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She ignores whatever he\u2019s about to say and strides over to me, hinging me up at the knees until I\u2019m vertical.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat he wants to say, Lukas, is that when he heard of you in the <em>Foundation Anart Almanac</em> he was so impressed that he set up this whole pantomime to reel you in. The overbearing executive and all. Because he thought it would be too humiliating to just ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBez\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris motions as if he\u2019s going to throw his glass, but she\u2019s still as a mirror.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut a charade revealed is worth nothing, so maybe now he will get up from behind that stage and talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>With one finger she pokes a silently fuming Chris \u2014 <em>Skitter</em> \u2014 right in the brow, sending him crosseyed, and then adds:</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and he asked me to help him out because he does not quite grasp that you think of me as a dilettante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man is for once lost for words, as she strides off into the ember-gathering, dying with the sunset. Outside it\u2019s pitch black, and dimming fast, plunging into an abyssal dark previously known only to squirming hadean things. I need to get out of this place, which now seems nothing more than an oversized coffin. But as I leave \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t done.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s that voice of command, the molten lead pouring down my spine, casting my limbs solid. The Marshall specialty. I take what I hoped would be one last look at him.</p>\n<p>He reaches out an affable hand. It\u2019s unmistakeably human. The first glimpse of anything like vulnerability. A frisson rolls over my skin, and I try not to recoil. Here is the miracle. Here is the killing-time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou came here wanting me to ask you for some work? Let\u2019s hammer out some terms.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He seats me back in the central lobby, on stools by a little round table only feet from the peristaltic cranial mass that holds the iconoclast tribune. At this hour the night has seeped into the room and rendered the guests immobile. The only movement is from corners too obscure for it to notice, where the secrecy of dyads and triads is undermined by their furtive giggling. By the entrance Freeman is spacing out on some kind of psychedelic. He opens.</p>\n<p>\u201cFive million, and six months. I want the memories of a week worth living, wholesome working-class joy, something for Amos to enjoy. He loves that shit. You know the man.\u201d</p>\n<p>(He doesn\u2019t feel the need to verify the latter; his confidence is well-placed.)</p>\n<p>He forgets his stool has no back and nearly leans far enough to fall, and hisses as he catches himself. His eyes do not meet mine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has to be <em>good</em>. Bez is solid, she knows her stuff, but she\u2019s not got the spark. I never understood why Dad felt that way, but if you agree then he\u2019s right. And he speaks well of you. Vindicate his faith.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bekele has wisely evacuated the suite entirely, leaving me alone with my first glimpse of his unvarnished desire, the thing that burns men to touch.</p>\n<p>Time to play dice with God. I\u2019d curse that I\u2019m so drunk, but really, how else can one shore up the arrogance for it? I think I know what he needs, if not what he wants.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>A microscopic sneer flickers across his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? I can do ten, whatever, don\u2019t quibble over pocket change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pay is fine. You don\u2019t have any idea what you actually want out of me. You\u2019re just gesturing at a portrait of the world, an ideal you want me to bridge to. I can\u2019t make your father respect you by following your genre conventions. I need a free hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the very first person to ever try the daddy issues line on me. I\u2019ve never heard that one before. You\u2019ve just pierced my fucking heart, great job. You think you know better what he\u2019ll like than me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t manage the deadpan he\u2019s going for. Instead the line comes out as if he really is about to cry. That contempt can\u2019t be faked, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get under your skin; I value mine. Yes, whatever, not my business if you get into shouting matches with daddy. But I can\u2019t use your ideas as a starting point. If your father respects me, trust in his taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>He narrows his eyes. That line doesn\u2019t work on him, but he prefers that it <em>seems</em> as if it did. Odd.</p>\n<p>I stroke my chin as if thinking. He probably doesn\u2019t grasp that mine is a nonsensical complaint. Of course I can work with direction, what use would I be otherwise? What he\u2019ll see is a man with principles, a pillar to anchor himself by.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d I add, before he can make a cackhanded attempt at a \u2018solution\u2019, \u201cYou said you forced Harold \u2014 whatever \u2014 to play the fool. Do you really have the Anderson C-suite so whipped?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an ungentlemanly snort as he turns to look at the sprawled form of the salesman on the far side of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf all of Anderson were so cooperative there wouldn\u2019t <em>be</em> an Anderson; there\u2019d be a Marshall robotics line and a screaming shrunken head labelled \u2018Vincent\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brows furrow parodically:</p>\n<p>\u201cBut there are certain downsides to being overleveraged when you\u2019re on the soul options market.\u201d</p>\n<p>A devilish little grin, and he taps the side of his nose. His hands whirl gracile and slow. I\u2019m so caught up in the delicate weave of his fingertips I hardly notice when Freeman twitches in his sleep.</p>\n<p>I do notice when he sits straight up, yells in animal terror, and frantically scans the room for three full seconds before falling back dead asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cWord of advice: never get assigned a put, and especially never get assigned on your <em>anima</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a light in his eyes. I won\u2019t have nightmares about this, but I\u2019ll think about it as I\u2019m about to go to sleep and shudder.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery classy,\u201d I drawl, \u201cIs that how you keep Bekele on side, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, her I just keep around because she\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>I raise my eyebrows at him, but he just shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can imagine how much pushback most people are willing to give me. I need something to keep me earthed. The stratosphere is pretty, but you\u2019ll drown in it as surely as any ocean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not sure what got him so eloquent, but I examine the back of my hand, projecting indifference so transparently he must see right through to the hope at the heart of me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, details aside, I do think your proposal has some merits. We can discuss trivialities later, but for now I really do need to get to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods slowly, fists clenching and unclenching.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it that last detail that brought you around? Freeman, the agent of history, now inhabited in turn? And my father said I didn\u2019t have the soul of a visionary.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t help it; I burst out laughing. My sides ache, I hunch over, tears briefly cloud my eyes. When I look up past the slow eye-roll and the feigned amusement, I see it again: a real and sustained injury.

Dropping back from the centre I try out an insouciant look: leaning against the far wall, examining the unscuffed mirror. As my back makes contact with the shuddering steel behind me I feel it. Shards of bass-thrum embed in my spine, grow around my skull, a premonition of the terrible music waiting for me above. Miserable proto-Sarkic noise-pop, dragged writhing from an \u201821 grave to haunt a \u201823 party.\n\n\n\nOkay. So my host has bad taste. That\u2019s just the job. People with good taste don\u2019t hire artists; they make art. Only one chance at this, so focus on what matters:\n\n\n\nIn the reflection I\u2019m wiry in an ill-fitting suit, festooned in chains and miscellaneous leather accoutrements, with overgenerous eyeliner and ironical side-swept hair bringing the fit together. Incongruous blocky features, skin alabaster to the point of translucence, pupils fixed and staring even as the fascia move under my skin, brows knotting and unknotting. I\u2019m a kid from a scene that\u2019s yet to be reborn. The joke will land with this crowd, I\u2019m certain. I did a little market research beforehand, as they\u2019d call it. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019d think I was being tacky //sincerely//. Right? \n\n\n\n(But then again, they might see right through the winking self-deprecation, spear me through the heart with a thought, and then where will I be? If -- )\n\n\n\nI bounce urgently off the wall, one leg springing me back to the centre of the pointlessly spacious lift, and my eyes dart around, taking in the detail, trying to drown the doubt. I can\u2019t afford to indulge my skittishness at this late hour.\n\n\n\nOpulence and beauty have a parabolic relationship; on the far side of the valley of kitsch is the rising cliff-face of real elegance. Absurdly, that\u2019s where the decor lands. Aside from the mirror on the east wall (redoubling the setting sun) every surface is covered in delicate trimmed-back gilding. Above me as I crane my neck are the twelvefold panels of a dome delicately enamelled with the lives of the apostles. As the lift rises past the mundane roof of the building, into the celestial floors, the figures take on a life of their own: laughing, praying, locked in bitter struggle.\n\n\n\nI narrow my eyes.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an attempt at metacommentary, winking at the viewer, presumed some novice, at how it draws attention with tawdry motion while the grace of the original artist fades into the background. //God//, it says, //maybe we should install shortform video panels in all our galleries, and that\u2019ll get the kids in.// But this kind of moralising is hollow -- they have made the work hideous, and not even interestingly hideous. This is the degree of infatuation with crude occult hackery I should have expected from my hosts, but still it disappoints. That\u2019s the second bad sign.\n\n\n\nA clear tone. The lambent far wall of the elevator slides open. Beyond is an unexpectedly narrow corridor, brightly lit by swooping crystal fixtures. To the right it ends abruptly, as if the architect simply walked away from the incomplete plans. The floor gives way to half a kilometre of whipping wind, and below it, spreadeagled, a vermillion world nearly bisected by a strip of slow whitecapped churn, where Lake Michigan rumbles against neo-gothic never-dead Chicago. \n\n\n\nI take it in for a heartbeat, and then back off. I don\u2019t want to be seen shying away, but heights have never agreed with me.\n\n\n\nDown the left-hand path is a blessedly plain oak door, attended by a woman wearing a sleek Bardot and a perfectly measured smile. No, not a woman, by that glimmer at her neckline, which is not quite a jewel: a gynoid, probably the single most contemptible innovation I\u2019ve ever heard of. I feel my mouth twitching into a sneer, but what if they see through her, and know my face? Instead I approach an image of meekness and nod at her with a curt quirk of my own lips. She -- it? -- fuck these people for doing this to me. The //thing// tilts its head one moment in what is surely an imitation of human curiosity, purposeless except in the sympathy it elicits, and asks:\n\n\n\n\u201cLukas Havel? I hope the journey treated you well.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey chartered a private craft for me, and still managed to make me late. They //probably// aren\u2019t the types to lash out over a complaint, but why take the risk?\n\n\n\n\u201cPretty good! But please, call me by my work name. We will be professionals here, yes?\u201d\n\n\n\n(Widening my nonchalant little smirk, playing up the eurojank for the audience.)\n\n\n\nIt swings the door open and nods once, flicking its eyes in a once-over across my body, eyebrows raised in appreciation. Choke on it, Anderson, you rat, I think, and step inside.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"ornament1\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe first thing (the worst thing) is the music. I heard the bassline below the clouds, conducted unknowably through brass lines extending the whole length of the elevator, but the sound itself is contained to this room. A better word would be //concentrated//, because now that I\u2019m finally exposed it roars over and into me, worse than ever. \n\n\n\nI\u2019d like to pen down mentally an assessment of the lounge\u2019s aesthetic qualities, but in the blaring neon light, scintillating over two dozen sweaty bodies, it's impossible to make any real judgment. Instead, I make my way past wandering staff (who try to foist on me flutes of some obscure vintage) and head straight for the open bar, where the music is in a lull. It\u2019s done up in a faux-speakeasy getup, all dark panelling and bowtied vendors. I\u2019ve never scored a commission sober, so I snag a piquant vermouth negroni.\n\n\n\nNot a moment too soon: As I move away from the bar someone claps me on the back with a throaty bark.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the man! We really did muck up the scheduling, but, well, no use crying over spilled milk, am I right?\u201d\n\n\n\nI do not grimace and turn toward the unctuous voice of Harold \u201cHarry\u201d Freeman, Chief of Marketing for Anderson\u2019s North American branch, recently hired after being caught up in the tertiary fallout of the infamous Foundation infilitration affair.\n\n\n\nHe would have been handsome when he was younger, but something has wilted, and his features droop waxen down his face. Greying hair has beaten a retreat from his temples and his head is crowned in a widow\u2019s peak. Despite his withered muscles, his handshake is firm enough to crush my phalanges. I feel a heady flush, and then a stab of queasiness. If I piss this guy off enough, that's the last six months of networking wasted.\n\n\n\nThankfully, he seems ebullient as he pumps my wrist erratically up and down, arms emerging from a carefully-fit and carelessly-dyed Hawaiian affair. He gestures magnanimously to the two others who have followed him to the bar, forming a circle.\n\n\n\nThe first of them is a rather fetching lady in monochrome: white flats and palazzos, sable blouse, ivory jacket, jet sunglasses, etcetera. On any other day I would be stunned to be face-to-face with Beznash Bekele, egomantrix extraordinaire, one of whose shows set me on this path, but her accompaniment pins me to the spot with a glance.\n\n\n\nThose foppish manners, the peach fuzz on his lips, is that a short bob with bangs over his forehead? After a certain point one sets fashions rather than serving them, I suppose. I don\u2019t try to hide the tremor in my voice as I answer:\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t miss too much. Thanks for keeping an eye out for me.\u201d\n\n\n\nI address my remark to the second man, much to Harry\u2019s frowned displeasure -- but so what? Only an idiot greets the Marshall heir //second//. -- and give what I know must be a sickly smile.\n\n\n\nMs. Bekele laughs, high and clear, and says:\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are not going to bite your head off, you know? And Harry has been talking you up all evening. If you are silent the rest of the night I am sure he will still be satisfied.\u201d\n\n\n\n(She has the infamous Italian accent.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI do try to keep abreast of movements in the art world, you know. Now, I\u2019m no aficionado, certainly can\u2019t say I have Bez\u2019s knack for these things \u2014\u201d her expression dims a milliwatt, \u201c\u2014 but I could hardly miss out on //you//, young man.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not wardens of culture, then we\u2019re nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Chrysophilus\u2019 first contribution to the conversation, and he says it so drily that I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s mocking me. It sounds like he\u2019s quoting someone. He probably already hates my work, the insightless constructed lives, the brief forays into dadaist incoherence. Damn, damn, damn, I can save this.\n\n\n\nHarry doesn\u2019t catch the irony, or perhaps I\u2019m delusional, because he barrels on.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely! That\u2019s the insight that, well, that\u2019s kept our firm afloat all these years. Anderson, the man has //money//, more money than God, but petty cash can\u2019t buy //refinement//. People just can\u2019t take it seriously, all that cyber-network mainframe crap. That\u2019s why, Chris, you\u2019re going to inherit a keystone of the whole, this whole hidden subculture, and Anderson will just be another silicon catamite in ten years.\u201d\n\n\n\nChrysophilius nurses a tumbler of golden drink, and as he takes a sip I think I spy a grimace on that perfectly-framed face. Bekele manages his reproach for him (well-trained, I can\u2019t help but think).\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Freeman, it is no shame to have a transactional interest in the arts, but you are hardly supposed to //say it out loud//.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe throws up his hands in defeat and gives a conciliatory wink around the circle.\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019ve got me. Still the marketing man, eh? I do apologise, Lukas, Antispace, whatever name you\u2019d prefer, but these are the vulgar lines of questioning I exist to plumb. I get my hands dirty with all this low culture claptrap and the rest of the firm patronises the finer stuff in peace. But, please, enough about me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe mention of my pseudonym, which is probably the single most embarrassing aspect of my career, does not draw a wince from me, because I have been expecting it all evening. Instead I force a laugh alongside him.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my honour to be here. I cannot say that I expected the call, but of course for an opportunity to be among this company \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, do not flatter me,\u201d interjects Bekele, flicking one hand dismissively, \u201cThey\u2019ve been singing my praises for actual years. Instead,\u201d and she leans forward, stage-whispering, \u201cTell me what you think of the piece.\u201d\n\n\n\nI glance around wildly. Only one thing catches my eye: Bekele\u2019s centerpiece, a humming cylinder of cerebral tissue, ten feet tall, flayed by a hundred electrodes, to which a man screaming in vulgate Latin is being dragged. The other partygoers strap him into a purposefully rickety plastic chair as his face flashes through terror and ecstasy, and then he gets up laughing. From him a captive mind has been extracted and returned to its glisteningly organic container: the spirit of Valerius Solanus, who learned the secret name of Rome, and was condemned to wander the Earth eternal. Guests line up to pull him from his fleshy cage and let him live in them for sixty seconds, feel his hate and desperation, then reel him back out. Bekele\u2019s contemplation of how history inhabits us, they say.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s distinctive,\u201d I demur, not wanting to give her the tongue-lashing she deserves, \u201cAnd it\u2019s an excellent choice of subject; I mean, Christ, that Italian does not stop talking. I don\u2019t even speak the language and I feel bad.\u201d\n\n\n\nI chuckle and even Chrysophilius joins in, polite hollow //hahahaha//s, but unbelievably Harry has seen right through me.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, Lukas has to be diplomatic, poor guy\u2019s the ambassador of the new pseudo-identitarian wave, and I\u2019m not and I don\u2019t, so I\u2019ll say he thinks it\u2019s utter wank, if you\u2019ll forgive the expression. I mean, you set this thing up, basically treading on his toes, artificial experiences and so on, and all while we want to commission his own work. It\u2019s practically an insult, and anyone can see that though Bez has her vision, she just can\u2019t achieve the same depth with a //real// spirit that our boy Havel can with his homunculi.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow: he\u2019s not wrong. I am a student of the artificial psychosphere; I build sixty-second slices of a life for any passerby to inhabit. This resurrectionism is a pale shadow of my art. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s confirmed he might want some work out of me. On the other had, //what the fuck is he doing//? I shoot him an expression of repressed horror, the kind of thing you have to use at public functions, but he\u2019s not looking at either of us artsy types. He has eyes only for his blonde leaseholder leashholder, who blows him off with a single skewed eye-roll.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard that little insight somewhere before,\u201d he replies, \u201cIn, oh, was it the //Deer College Odyssey//? As original as ever, buddy. I see why Dad brought you in.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis eyes flick either side, to me and Bekele, as he shows just a hint of teeth, and Harry\u2019s own grin fades. That gaze holds some real spite (for who?) and Freeman quails. He looks away, to the bar, making some private illuminated sign that draws from the bartender two shots of girlish strawberry-scented vodka. Chrysophilius shakes his head. I want to take a jab myself, but --\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d says Bekele, sparing me Harry\u2019s pique.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too old, madame, to stick to manly fashions. And you, I insist,\u201d he adds, passing me one saccharine sticky shotglass. I cast my eyes around but the other two seem unwilling to help me. Beznash raises her eyebrows (what are you waiting for, punk, inserts the grizzled voice I\u2019ve assigned her internally) and Chrysophilius could be mistaken for amused, but there\u2019s a tense aspect to him.\n\n\n\nI throw back the cloying liquor, do not make a face, and set down the glass on the bartop.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Harry.\u201d mutters Chrysophilius (perhaps he prefers Chris? I\u2019ll think of him that way; a preemptive strike on our friendship), \u201cUppers. Or downers. Not both, for God\u2019s sake. It is //not that fucking hard//.\u201d Like he wants to be angry, but can\u2019t quite summon it up. Something stuck in his craw?\n\n\n\nNow that I properly look at Freeman, though, there really is something electric to him, his breath and body thrillingly warm even as his skin dessicates, manic in his movements. I\u2019m not a biologist, but anartists love their allegory, and I\u2019m reminded of the sight of a rat twitching galvanically, reduced to a facsimile of life by an ampere.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d he cries, inordinately loud, \u201cWhat do you think of the music? I think that\u2019s real Old Slavonic; Skitter had a spectral monk consulted on the proper forms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018Skitter\u2019 spreads his arms, feigning modesty (his type, obviously, cannot mean it). \n\n\n\n\u201cWe both know I\u2019m not a musician. I just gave my girl a little shove; the rest is her work, which means it\u2019s God\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\n\n(By his expression he thinks he has said something wise.)\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I was never a music guy. Neither are you, of course, but there is a certain //je ne sais quoi// to having a real //artiste//\u2019s view. Go on.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy the fuck has he started spouting French? Does he think I\u2019m French? Is it some kind of bit? Bekele by his side clearly wants to make some acid remark, but Chris has gotten into the swing of things, now.\n\n\n\n\u201cFreeman, as he says, is a salesman. He thinks we pay artists so we can lure in more customers with some //pretty pictures//. It\u2019s hardly his fault, but what we know \u2014 and Bez, here, of course \u2014 is that it\u2019s backwards; all my money\u2019s good for nothing if it isn\u2019t good for art. What is the point of power if I can\u2019t build a little beauty, hm? That\u2019s all I really want to be able to say at the end, that I left this world prettier than I found it. Not that I hit some real good KPIs!\u201d \n\n\n\n(He is pulling this snobbery from somewhere outside himself: it\u2019s not in his nature to look down on good workers.)\n\n\n\n\u201cDid it work out, you think? Good piece?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe probably does not realise that his rant sounds positively Hitlerian, and I definitely won\u2019t be the one to alert him. Now, how to massage his ego? I squint a little and listen in to the squealing riffs, the uninterestingly disharmonious spikes of signal, and what sound like neofolk lyrics that got horribly lost.\n\n\n\n\u201cAwful,\u201d I think, and say, because I really shouldn\u2019t have agreed to that shot. I have to go on, because commitment is the only way to save this.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the most unmemorable thing I\u2019ve heard since I left the Vienna underground, and for them you could say they really were //experimental//, but this is imitation of indie, the worst kind of industry plant bullshit. I have no idea what you were thinking, and I would ask for a refund.\u201d\n\n\n\nGod, I got too into it. I can hear the carefully neutral midwestern American accent fall away, that Czech snarl leaking back into my voice. And as expected, when I look at Chris\u2019 face, there\u2019s the disappointment, the irritation, even (though it\u2019s fathoms deep, this I know better than anything else) the hurt. But though he\u2019s dropped the shit-eating smirk I can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019s also happier than ever.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"ornament2\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nI drift through the next hours semi-conscious, still not past the instant of terror where I thought I\u2019d wasted my chance on a cheap shot at his house musician. At some point we take a seat in some nook; Chris (who I cannot bring myself to think of as \u2018Skitter\u2019) buys us a round of nutty amaretto, though he doesn\u2019t partake, and Bekele some shockingly smaragdine sours. Other drinks diffuse between the three of us as he watches on, grimly sober. The conversation drifts away from me, as does Freeman, off to talk business with his \u2018lads\u2019 elsewhere. This is strictly still an industry meeting; the art is as always a showpiece first and foremost (the artists, too).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nA few mumbles carry me through the banal conversation we manage, and I let my attention wander as Chris halfheartedly tries to keep up with Bekele\u2019s talk on the contesting ontologies of historiography. She\u2019s a striking figure, though she often struggles to get out from under the shadow of her name. That melodic Latian accent is the product of a distinguished family history of which she prefers not to speak. She\u2019s not the type whose presence can be bought for any sane price, which means that improbably Chrissy has something she actually wants. She\u2019s a legendary laconic, having memorably excised her own last memory of her half-brother at a Glaswegian exhibition, so that means he has //hooks// in her, real barbed things gleaming with a promise, waiting for me too, if only I take the bait.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the junior Marshall. He cuts an indistinct figure: skim off the designer overwear, fix that //hair//,\u00a0\u00a0and he\u2019d blend seamlessly into any \u2014 every \u2014 crowd on the planet. (Isn\u2019t that a thought, pale skin and bone glimmering at the centre of some town square? But no, so lithe, not enough weight behind the tread, and altogether still too boyish, not my type.) He scarfs down the scant hors d\u2019ouevres, slivers of steak tartare still bloody, carmine running down the curve of his neck. He chews methodically, with a distant expression, like this is his day job. The lines of his face are distant as he looks, oh Christ he\u2019s looking right into my eyes, forcing a smile, bits of bovine filigree stuck in his teeth.\n\n\n\nHe stands upright to my side of the table we\u2019re situated at and throws his arms about my shoulders in a stiff embrace. \n\n\n\n\u201cLukas, Luke, you really need to be more aggressive. You let that old scrote run circles around you. You need to be tapped in on this, marketplace attitude, on the balls of your feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe grabs my shoulders, and I recede deeper into the plush of my seating, stickying the genuine leather with my sweat. His voice isn\u2019t slurring at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re rocking with the punches, then you\u2019ve got the //momentum//. Mo-//men//-tum. Be the man, my man.\u201d\n\n\n\nBekele is sat primly on the third seat, legs neatly folded, sipping her schnapps. It\u2019s not fair that she handles her drink better than either of us, but what can you do? She looks distinctly disdainful of the whole affair, and I can\u2019t pass any further judgment because now Skitter\u2019s face is right up in mine, breath rank against me, and I\u2019m not going to kiss him because he\u2019s definitely not doing that on purpose, the legendary bachelor. (But what if\u2014)\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne finger crackles between us.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe twirls on one leg, and looks back over his shoulder at me.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like this? You\u2019re going to get a commission out of this, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\nBecause apparently I pissed all sanity out to make room for the third flavoured shot, calling up an old college memory for someone in the C-suite out in the crowd. I spent the entire trip here worrying about my financials and lost them the first wineglass someone passed me. I really should be down for this.\n\n\n\nHe pivots to face me again, keeping his distance this time, and juts his chin out at me.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpeak up. I didn\u2019t bring you here to mope.\u201d\n\n\n\n(This to Bekele, still sour on her own:)\n\n\n\n\u201cI should have seen this coming. Invite in my own Diogenes and what does he do? Sits in his barrel all day! I need a better class of cynic.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe rounds away from me, on me, again and again. An insight: Foucault\u2019s pendulum is unvarying; when it seems to move it only tracks the motion of the Earth.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome //on//! You had an opinion just now. Do you know how many //new// peoples\u2019 opinions I get to hear in a year? Here's a hint, it\u2019s in the single digits. Just this fucking circle, over and over --\u201d\n\n\n\nHe cuts off to take a breath, pressing down some memory. Something he just said finally clicks into a part of my brain gummed up by the acetate haze. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me anywhere, Chris.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stops, stunned, as do I. This backtalk will get me literally killed. I think I might have caught him offguard with the insight, oh God, what happens now?\n\n\n\nHe makes a moue of displeasure.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Skitter//, please. Nobody calls me Chris. I\u2019m not a teenage model, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\n\nAh. But then what \u2014\n\n\n\nBekele polishes off her last mouthful and stands up to join Chris, (who is Skitter), leaving me feeling terminally surrounded. She shoots him a scowl.\n\n\n\n\u201cI did say you would slip very fast, if you recall.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck off, Bez, I\u2019m not done yet --\u201d\n\n\n\nShe ignores whatever he\u2019s about to say and strides over to me, hinging me up at the knees until I\u2019m vertical.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat he wants to say, Lukas, is that when he heard of you in the //Foundation Anart Almanac// he was so impressed that he set up this whole pantomime to reel you in. The overbearing executive and all. Because he thought it would be too humiliating to just ask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBez\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nChris motions as if he\u2019s going to throw his glass, but she\u2019s still as a mirror. \n\n\n\n\u201cBut a charade revealed is worth nothing, so maybe now he will get up from behind that stage and talk to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith one finger she pokes a silently fuming Chris \u2014 //Skitter// \u2014 right in the brow, sending him crosseyed, and then adds:\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, and he asked me to help him out because he does not quite grasp that you think of me as a dilettante.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe man is for once lost for words, as she strides off into the ember-gathering, dying with the sunset. Outside it\u2019s pitch black, and dimming fast, plunging into an abyssal dark previously known only to squirming hadean things. I need to get out of this place, which now seems nothing more than an oversized coffin. But as I leave \u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t done.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s that voice of command, the molten lead pouring down my spine, casting my limbs solid. The Marshall specialty. I take what I hoped would be one last look at him.\n\n\n\nHe reaches out an affable hand. It\u2019s unmistakeably human. The first glimpse of anything like vulnerability. A frisson rolls over my skin, and I try not to recoil. Here is the miracle. Here is the killing-time.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou came here wanting me to ask you for some work? Let\u2019s hammer out some terms.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"ornament3\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe seats me back in the central lobby, on stools by a little round table only feet from the peristaltic cranial mass that holds the iconoclast tribune. At this hour the night has seeped into the room and rendered the guests immobile. The only movement is from corners too obscure for it to notice, where the secrecy of dyads and triads is undermined by their furtive giggling. By the entrance Freeman is spacing out on some kind of psychedelic. He opens.\n\n\n\n\u201cFive million, and six months. I want the memories of a week worth living, wholesome working-class joy, something for Amos to enjoy. He loves that shit. You know the man.\u201d\n\n\n\n(He doesn\u2019t feel the need to verify the latter; his confidence is well-placed.)\n\n\n\nHe forgets his stool has no back and nearly leans far enough to fall, and hisses as he catches himself. His eyes do not meet mine.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has to be //good//. Bez is solid, she knows her stuff, but she\u2019s not got the spark. I never understood why Dad felt that way, but if you agree then he\u2019s right. And he speaks well of you. Vindicate his faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nBekele has wisely evacuated the suite entirely, leaving me alone with my first glimpse of his unvarnished desire, the thing that burns men to touch.\n\n\n\nTime to play dice with God. I\u2019d curse that I\u2019m so drunk, but really, how else can one shore up the arrogance for it? I think I know what he needs, if not what he wants.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\nA microscopic sneer flickers across his mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo? I can do ten, whatever, don\u2019t quibble over pocket change.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pay is fine. You don\u2019t have any idea what you actually want out of me. You\u2019re just gesturing at a portrait of the world, an ideal you want me to bridge to. I can\u2019t make your father respect you by following your genre conventions. I need a free hand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the very first person to ever try the daddy issues line on me. I\u2019ve never heard that one before. You\u2019ve just pierced my fucking heart, great job. You think you know better what he\u2019ll like than me?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t manage the deadpan he\u2019s going for. Instead the line comes out as if he really is about to cry. That contempt can\u2019t be faked, though.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get under your skin; I value mine. Yes, whatever, not my business if you get into shouting matches with daddy. But I can\u2019t use your ideas as a starting point. If your father respects me, trust in his taste.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe narrows his eyes. That line doesn\u2019t work on him, but he prefers that it //seems// as if it did. Odd.\n\n\n\nI stroke my chin as if thinking. He probably doesn\u2019t grasp that mine is a nonsensical complaint. Of course I can work with direction, what use would I be otherwise? What he\u2019ll see is a man with principles, a pillar to anchor himself by.\n\n\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d I add, before he can make a cackhanded attempt at a \u2018solution\u2019, \u201cYou said you forced Harold \u2014 whatever \u2014 to play the fool. Do you really have the Anderson C-suite so whipped?\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an ungentlemanly snort as he turns to look at the sprawled form of the salesman on the far side of the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf all of Anderson were so cooperative there wouldn\u2019t //be// an Anderson; there\u2019d be a Marshall robotics line and a screaming shrunken head labelled \u2018Vincent\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis brows furrow parodically:\n\n\n\n\u201cBut there are certain downsides to being overleveraged when you\u2019re on the soul options market.\u201d\n\n\n\nA devilish little grin, and he taps the side of his nose. His hands whirl gracile and slow. I\u2019m so caught up in the delicate weave of his fingertips I hardly notice when Freeman twitches in his sleep.\n\n\n\nI do notice when he sits straight up, yells in animal terror, and frantically scans the room for three full seconds before falling back dead asleep.\n\n\n\n\u201cWord of advice: never get assigned a put, and especially never get assigned on your //anima//.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a light in his eyes. I won\u2019t have nightmares about this, but I\u2019ll think about it as I\u2019m about to go to sleep and shudder.\n\n\n\n\u201cVery classy,\u201d I drawl, \u201cIs that how you keep Bekele on side, too?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, her I just keep around because she\u2019s a bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nI raise my eyebrows at him, but he just shrugs.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much pushback most people are willing to give me. I need something to keep me earthed. The stratosphere is pretty, but you\u2019ll drown in it as surely as any ocean.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot sure what got him so eloquent, but I examine the back of my hand, projecting indifference so transparently he must see right through to the hope at the heart of me.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, details aside, I do think your proposal has some merits. We can discuss trivialities later, but for now I really do need to get to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe nods slowly, fists clenching and unclenching.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it that last detail that brought you around? Freeman, the agent of history, now inhabited in turn? And my father said I didn\u2019t have the soul of a visionary.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t help it; I burst out laughing. My sides ache, I hunch over, tears briefly cloud my eyes. When I look up past the slow eye-roll and the feigned amusement, I see it again: a real and sustained injury. How strange, that he should care what I think. But it\u2019s the crack I\u2019ll need to pry open to win a lifetime position. So:\n\n\n\nThe shakes die down, and I stand, ready to descend icarine from the celestial suite back to terra firma, seedy ever-dead Chicago, and my comfortably drab hotel.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have not,\u201d I make very clear, \u201cGot a visionary bone in your body, not yet. But there is an ember in you, and if we tend it well, it might be a fire. For now\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nI fluff up my jacket to give it that perfect arhythm, and turn. //Here's// what he wants to hear.\n\n\n\n\u201cLeave the art to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n", "references": ["whenwerewe"], "tags": ["black-diamond-billions", "corporate", "fantasy", "first-person", "ghost", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "science-fiction", "skitter-marshall", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Tame Impaler - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/abasedebase", "year": 2026}, "acceptable-losses": {"created_at": "2026-01-14T09:55:00", "creator": "Loop11", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Rhys_and_wolves.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-14T09:55:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-14T09:55:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-14T09:56:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "corrected word count", "date": "2026-01-14T10:42:00"}, {"author": "Loop11", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/loop11", "comment": "Added tags: adventure, military-fiction.

Lying face down in the snow with blood streaming from his left shoulder, he considered his situation.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>The cold hit first, seeping through the torn layers of Kevlar into his skin. His arm, half exposed through the ruins of his sleeve, had already gone numb in the snow. He couldn\u2019t feel his fingers. Carefully, he managed to prop himself up with his back against a tree. He tried to move his left arm and regretted it immediately. Something in his shoulder tore as he shifted it and he had to fight back a scream. He let his arm slack again and focused on breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. It didn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>Through the pine trees, snowflakes drifted down. He could almost hear them falling, quiet as it was. He watched one settle on the back of his glove and vanish. Another followed. Then another. It distantly occurred to him that if he stayed here long enough, the snow would cover him completely and he would be like the others.</p>\n<p>The others.</p>\n<p>His squadron lay around him. He could tell by the stained red mounds of snow that covered them. Rhys closed his eyes for a moment and revelled in the darkness, but even the eigengrau wasn\u2019t safe as images of his friends being torn apart resurfaced in his mind's eye. His heart racing, he opened his eyes again, and stared at the forest floor until it stopped spinning. Having composed himself, Rhys ran his functional hand over his body. A few minor surface wounds, but aside from his shoulder he and his gear seemed mostly intact. Sitting there in the snow, 53\u00a0km deep into Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, he did the only thing he knew how to do: consult his training.</p>\n<p>He had dug out three of his fallen comrades before he found Stephen, their medpack carrier. He packed the deep bite and covered it with gauze, before tightly wrapping his shoulder and upper arm in bandages. He could feel the blood soak through the first few layers, but it would have to be enough for now. His left arm held up in a sling, he felt for the comm in his helmet.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'MTF Lambda-7, this is Agent Carter, come in,' he said, forcing the words out. His throat felt raw, like he had been screaming for hours. Maybe he had. It occurred to him that he had no idea how long he\u2019d be lying there, drifting in and out of consciousness. He tapped the side of his helmet twice, 'Command, do you read?'</p>\n<p>He lay there listening to the static, waiting for the click that meant he wasn\u2019t totally alone. Someone always answered. Even if Command didn\u2019t reply, even if the uplink failed, someone on their squad would come in with some smart-ass remark or a shaky 'yeah, I\u2019m here.' Nothing came. The dead line didn\u2019t even give him the courtesy of interference.</p>\n<p>Rhys shifted his head just enough to look beyond the base of a tree. Dense patches of spruce and pine stretched in all directions. Dark and pale trunks rose from the snow like his own personal prison bars. He could see shallow, pinkish tracks leading to a larger mound of snow, approximately thirty metres from his position. He knew what would be under there, something large and furry that vaguely reminded him of a Smilodon. It must have wandered off after massacring his squad and knocking him unconscious. It was dead. Small red blots seeping through the snow revealed the location of at least forty bullet-holes.</p>\n<p>Rhys caught himself feeling disappointment. That shocked him. After all, he was safer with it dead than alive. Still, the dread persisted, it was the knowledge that their capture mission had failed. Part of him had hoped that if he could face the thing again then maybe, just maybe he wouldn\u2019t die in vain. Perhaps he could still do something to help future squads catch and study it. Now, that hope melted away, and looking at the snow-covered corpse of the beast that had murdered his friends he felt well and truly alone.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'They\u2019re coming,' He muttered, though he wasn\u2019t sure who he meant. Extraction, QRF, anyone. It didn\u2019t matter. He knew the protocols, everyone did. Contact loss, presumed total casualty, they\u2019d redirect the comm line and divert resources elsewhere. That comm unit in his helmet was useful for nothing but decoration.</p>\n<p>He pictured some weaselly, bespectacled man already writing a neat line into his report, somewhere far south of the treeline. <em>MTF Lambda-7 neutralised during initial engagement. Recovery deemed nonviable.</em></p>\n<p><em>Nonviable</em>, he almost laughed.</p>\n<p>It was such a stupid word, too clinical in the face of it all. He tried to picture himself as a data point, an \u2018X\u2019 in a box, but the image refused to settle. His shoulder throbbed in time with his pulse. He tasted copper in his mouth. Slowly, he got up, his nearly empty M25 held out in front of him, and approached the bleeding mound that used to be the anomaly. Now closer, he could see tufts of frozen, light grey fur poking through the snow. He kicked it, then again, and again, screamed every profanity he knew at it and then some. It didn\u2019t move. Rhys cleared away some of the snow and sat against its side, knowing he was going to die.</p>\n<p>He'd just closed his eyes when he heard a cracking noise, subtle at first then louder. A distinct primal fear overtook him when he met the eyes of a wolf standing just a few metres from him. Three wolves, he noted soon after, three wolves circling him. It was funny, he hadn\u2019t been afraid when the anomaly charged them, but now, alone in the snow with one bullet left in his pistol, he was terrified of some ordinary wolves.</p>\n<p>Still facing the main wolf, Rhys awkwardly pushed himself onto the large back of the anomaly. It was a clumsy affair, with only one functional arm, but the wolves didn\u2019t advance. Perhaps they too, were confused as to what he was doing. They watched him with flat, unreadable eyes. Steam curled from their mouths in steady breaths. They were healthy, shiny coats, no visible ribs, not desperate. That, somehow, made it worse. Rhys kept the gun trained on the one in front, though the blood loss and the cold made his arm tremble badly enough that the sight wobbled in and out of line with its head. One bullet. He was acutely aware of it now, of the fact that even if he used it perfectly it wouldn\u2019t matter. Wolves didn\u2019t charge one at a time.</p>\n<p>Behind him, a wolf took a step closer. Rhys spun around.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'Stay back,' Rhys commanded. He raised his arm above his head, attempting to look as large as possible. Rhys was not a small man, but the blood now seeping through the bandage on his shoulder and the way he winced with every movement did nothing to help his threat display. He swallowed hard and tried again, louder. 'Go on, get out of here!'</p>\n<p>The wolf cocked its head, as if genuinely considering the offer. Its gaze flicked briefly from Rhys, to the bulk of the anomaly beneath him. Rhys felt a sudden, absurd surge of possessiveness. This thing was his now. It had killed his friends, but they had killed it, so now it belonged to him. He trained his pistol on the mass of the closest wolf again.</p>\n<p>The main wolf behind him moved forward, he heard its paws crunch in the snow. He didn\u2019t know if it actually was the lead wolf, or if wolves had a chain of command at all, but it seemed as good a name as any. A third stayed back in the treeline, a pale thing half swallowed by the snow. They\u2019d stopped circling him now, but he estimated he could easily touch one if he reached down, as close as they\u2019d gotten. He\u2019d barely even noticed it, but there they were, only an arms-length away. And him, standing atop the thing that killed his friends, brandishing a gun that wouldn\u2019t save him.</p>\n<p>Then the front wolf lowered its head and sniffed. Not at Rhys. At the anomaly. Its nose brushed a piece of blood-matted fur where the snow had fallen away. It recoiled instantly, fur on end, and let out a low growl. The other two reacted instantly, stiff, with their ears pinned back and teeth bared.</p>\n<p>Rhys noticed it then, too. The anomaly didn\u2019t smell of death, not exclusively at least. It had this sharp, metallic, yet strangely sweet scent about it. He hadn\u2019t even noticed it at first, because he\u2019d smelled it so many times before. That\u2019s just what lingers around things that don\u2019t quite belong. That <em>wrong</em> smell that made his stomach churn if he breathed too deeply. The wolves clearly knew it as well.</p>\n<p>The front wolf took a step back. Then another. The wolves lingered for a moment longer, eyes never leaving him, then one by one turned and melted back into the trees. The last thing he saw was the pale one, at the treeline, glancing over its shoulder before vanishing out of sight. Rhys let out a deep breath. His knees threatened to give out and he kneeled onto the body beneath him, digging his fingers into its pallid fur. He laughed then, a rough, broken sound that turned into something close to a sob. He pressed his forehead to the creature\u2019s back and stayed there, breathing deep, until the shaking passed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'Okay,' he whispered to no one particular. 'Okay, still here.'</p>\n<p>It occurred to him, then, that these were not the words of a man resigned to his inevitable demise. The realization crept up on him slowly, unwelcome yet utterly undeniable: this thing had protected him. Not intentionally, of course, but its presence, even in death, had kept him alive for a few minutes longer. That changed things.</p>\n<p>He pushed himself back upright, grimacing at the pain in his shoulder, and scanned the forest. No movement, the wolves were gone. Now, just a long, cold stretch of wilderness lay between him and anything resembling safety. Dying here was still an option, but it wasn\u2019t the only one anymore.</p>\n<p>Rhys carefully slid from the anomaly\u2019s back and looked it over. A massive ruin of a body with thick, albeit blood-soaked, fur. An idea began to take shape, one very much against protocol. He holstered his pistol and went for the knife at his belt.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'You\u2019re going to be useful,' he smiled. The forest did not protest as he began to work.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIt couldn\u2019t quite be called a cloak. The vaguely oblong swath of fur with a slit cut into it to wrap around his shoulders still dripped with blood, despite Rhys\u2019 best attempts to scrub it clean with snow. Skinning such a large creature one-handed had been no easy feat. It didn\u2019t help that the anomaly seemed to have some kind of thick, blubber-like layer into which his knife continuously lodged itself. In the end, he\u2019d given up on taking the entire skin and settled for carving out a patch of fur from the thing\u2019s side. While this left his end product looking less than presentable, the large size of the anomaly meant Rhys\u2019 new cloak was still more than big enough to wrap around his entire body like a parka.</p>\n<p>His work had left an open hole in the side of the thing, exposing its meat. Rhys wondered if it was edible. He\u2019d resigned himself to the fact that a very long hike was in his future, and he\u2019d need something to eat. He ran his knife along a rib, scraping off a thin sliver of marbled red meat and hesitantly placed it into his mouth. Rancid. That was the only word that came close to describing the taste Rhys stood trying to scrub from his tongue. He\u2019d spat it out immediately, gagging, but the sour taste lingered. He now understood why the wolves had growled at it, he was tempted to do the same.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'Fine,' Rhys muttered. 'Worth a try.'</p>\n<p>He shelved the thought of food for now. Logistics and tactics, that was safer ground for him. He took stock of what he had left with a familiar, detached efficiency that gave him a comforting sense of normal. One sidearm, good. One bullet in said sidearm, less good. An m4 carbine slung across his back, but that wouldn\u2019t do him much good with his motionless left arm. A knife dulled by bone and hide. An in-helmet communicator that might as well have been brick, and a well-stocked medpack which he was currently using to refresh his bandages.</p>\n<p>And time, maybe.</p>\n<p>He forced himself away from the body and gathered what he could from the snow around him. The ripped open pack of their field scout yielded a crushed ration brick and a plastic baggy with cigarettes and, more interestingly, a lighter. While clearing away snow from what he thought was an extra coat, he found only the frozen arm of one of his comrades. He left it where it was, but it reminded him of his most important duty. He dug out and lined up his fallen squadmates, then saluted them one by one.</p>\n<p>Before moving on, he returned to the anomaly once more. The dark hole he\u2019d left in its side still steamed faintly. Rhys hesitated for a moment, then plunged his hand into the open cavity. He rubbed a thick layer of blood all over his fur cloak and tactical gear, until he reeked to high heavens and had to fight his gag reflex. The wolves hadn\u2019t liked the smell. That was all that mattered.</p>\n<p>He saluted it, too.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span><span style=\"color: #c5d1c9\">DAY 1</span></span></h1>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>Rhys started counting his steps in intervals of three. It gave his mind something to do in the monotony of trees and snow.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d picked his direction quickly. While their tracks were long gone, they\u2019d moved in a relatively straight line, and walking away from the bodies soon brought Rhys to small landmarks he recognised. He knew his goal clearly: Two jeeps waited in a clearing, a few kilometres into the park. They'd ditched them there to avoid tipping off the anomaly. <em>Lotta good that did</em>, he thought.</p>\n<p>The fur cloak worked better than he\u2019d expected. Having to keep holding it shut tired him out, so he poked a small hole on either side of the slit and pinned it closed with a stick.

Here, away from the protection of the trees, the wind cut into him. He was reminded harshly of the damage his body had taken when a minor gust caused him to slip on a patch of ice. He crashed onto the frigid surface and his vision burst white. He lay there longer than he should have. He\u2019d learned, by now, that staying still for too long was a bad idea, the cold would creep into his bones no matter how tightly he pulled his fur around him. He lay on his back, gasping for air. <em>This is it, this is where I stop</em>, the thought flashed through his mind for only a moment before he forced it away. It took him a while to get back up. He struggled to find his balance on the slick surface. Eventually, he was able to use his knife to anchor himself into the ice and hoist himself up.</p>\n<p>Rhys thought a lot as he walked. Frankly, there wasn\u2019t much else to do. He thought of his friends, of how he\u2019d liked to have buried them proper, even though the ground was hard and frozen so he knew it was impossible. Of the anomaly, laying there in the vast wilderness. He imagined it contained in a sterile, white box. Pulling his cloak tight, he considered that maybe it was better off dead.</p>\n<p>Most of all, he thought about the Foundation.</p>\n<p>The even, undisturbed snow reminded him of the shiny white walls and the coats of researchers. Researchers who stood around watercoolers talking casually about monsters and how many had died to contain them. One day, on his way to windowless briefing room, he\u2019d overheard two weathered senior researchers comparing \u2018kill stats\u2019. They\u2019d boasted, trying to convince the other that <em>their</em> project was the more dangerous and impressive assignment.</p>\n<p>He'd believed in it once, too. In the idea that someone had to do the dirty work so the rest of the machine could pretend that things just materialised in boxes for them to study. That it mattered, that <em>they</em> mattered. Someone had to die in the dark. He wasn\u2019t sure when that faith had begun to crack. Maybe it had always been just a hollow fantasy he convinced himself of so he could sleep at night.</p>\n<p>He imagined a meeting room. Some suits who\u2019d never been in the field a day in their life saying his name in the past tense before moving on to the next point on the agenda. They\u2019d consider sending some other squad to go looking for the anomaly. Maybe they\u2019d even designate a new Lambda-7. His stomach stiffened and he tightened his jaw against the feeling.</p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t come looking. That was what stuck with him, kept him walking. No reply on the comms for a few hours had been enough to be written off.</p>\n<p>Rhys stumbled, caught himself on a rock and pressed his forehead to the icy stone. The hard, cold texture felt nice against his face, it soothed a burning there he hadn\u2019t even noticed existed. He elected to spend the night by the boulder, to shelter from the harsh winds that swept the plain. His eyes wandered over the smooth snow ahead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>'If I make it.'

He didn\u2019t even feel the hot pulse of his shoulder or the weight of his gear, not even after today\u2019s hours of walking. He trudged into some spindly bushes and elected to put his helmet back on to prevent the branches from whipping him in the face as he pushed through.</p>\n<p>Then, the foliage gave way and Rhys' eyes began to sting.</p>\n<p>A clearing with some frozen tarps and tape flapping about. Their shapes now seemed so alien he barely recognised what he was looking at. The jeeps. His jeep. He\u2019d imagined this moment a thousand times while he walked, yet now faced with his freedom he found himself overcome with a profound aimlessness. He regarded the jeeps with careful eyes. The keys of the one he\u2019d driven burned a hole in one of his many pockets. He wanted nothing more than to just get in, to be <em>inside</em> something again. Something gnawed at him, however.</p>\n<p>His gaze wandered to the roof of his jeep. From the smooth black, unmarked body rose the metre tall broadcast antenna. The more complex radio system in the jeep would let him talk directly to various command channels. He had his pick of open lines. For a long time, Rhys stared at the dark rod surrounded by smooth snow on the roof.</p>\n<p>He trained his pistol\u2019s sights on the antenna and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p>The thing exploded in a mess of plastic, metal and wires. He dropped his gun in the snow and looked at what he\u2019d done. <em>Worth it.</em></p>\n<p>He limped over to the driver\u2019s side and fumbled with the door. It took him two good tugs before it snapped open. The inside smelled like dusty fabric and cough drops. In that moment, it was the best smell in the world. He slid into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled the door closed behind him with a reverent <em>click</em>. For a moment he just sat there, his fur coat thrown messily into the seat next to him. Inside felt amazing. His first course of action was to turn the heat up as high as it would go. It soothed his aching muscles, but the warmth combined with the enclosed space made the terrible odour he\u2019d coated himself with all the more apparent. Maybe a shower should be his first stop, he considered, after the hospital of course. His fingers had turned black somewhere between day two and three.</p>\n<p>He turned the key all the way. The engine coughed once, then roared to life. The sound was deafening to him. Rhys let out a shaky breath and rested his hand on the wheel. He could drive north. Find some tiny town that didn\u2019t ask too many questions, blend in. He could head south. Dump the jeep, flag someone down on the side of the road and see how long it took before the men in unmarked cars arrived.</p>\n<p>He could go anywhere.</p>\n<p>The Foundation would notice eventually. Of course they would, Rhys held no illusions about that. They might notice their radio antenna going dark and figure it out, or come back here eventually and find one less jeep than there should be. They\u2019d open a file, and speculate quietly in windowless rooms.</p>\n<p>But they wouldn\u2019t know where he went.</p>\n<p>Rhys glanced in the rearview mirror. Covered in dried viscera, his hair standing stiff on his head, his arm transitioned from bright red to purply black and the beginnings of a beard covered his face. He barely recognised himself. He smiled.</p>\n<p><em>Nonviable.</em> The word didn\u2019t hurt as much anymore.</p>\n<p>He put the jeep in gear. The tires crunched in the snow as he pulled away. It would swallow his tracks like it had swallowed everything else. Rhys didn\u2019t look back. He drove until the sky began to change colour.

Lying face down in the snow with blood streaming from his left shoulder, he considered his situation. \n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nThe cold hit first, seeping through the torn layers of Kevlar into his skin. His arm, half exposed through the ruins of his sleeve, had already gone numb in the snow. He couldn\u2019t feel his fingers. Carefully, he managed to prop himself up with his back against a tree. He tried to move his left arm and regretted it immediately. Something in his shoulder tore as he shifted it and he had to fight back a scream. He let his arm slack again and focused on breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. It didn\u2019t help.\n\n\n\nThrough the pine trees, snowflakes drifted down. He could almost hear them falling, quiet as it was. He watched one settle on the back of his glove and vanish. Another followed. Then another. It distantly occurred to him that if he stayed here long enough, the snow would cover him completely and he would be like the others.\n\n\n\nThe others.\n\n\n\nHis squadron lay around him. He could tell by the stained red mounds of snow that covered them. Rhys closed his eyes for a moment and revelled in the darkness, but even the eigengrau wasn\u2019t safe as images of his friends being torn apart resurfaced in his mind's eye. His heart racing, he opened his eyes again, and stared at the forest floor until it stopped spinning. Having composed himself, Rhys ran his functional hand over his body. A few minor surface wounds, but aside from his shoulder he and his gear seemed mostly intact. Sitting there in the snow, 53 km deep into Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, he did the only thing he knew how to do: consult his training.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had dug out three of his fallen comrades before he found Stephen, their medpack carrier. He packed the deep bite and covered it with gauze, before tightly wrapping his shoulder and upper arm in bandages. He could feel the blood soak through the first few layers, but it would have to be enough for now. His left arm held up in a sling, he felt for the comm in his helmet.\n\n\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@'MTF Lambda-7, this is Agent Carter, come in,' he said, forcing the words out. His throat felt raw, like he had been screaming for hours. Maybe he had. It occurred to him that he had no idea how long he\u2019d be lying there, drifting in and out of consciousness. He tapped the side of his helmet twice, 'Command, do you read?'\n\n\n\nHe lay there listening to the static, waiting for the click that meant he wasn\u2019t totally alone. Someone always answered. Even if Command didn\u2019t reply, even if the uplink failed, someone on their squad would come in with some smart-ass remark or a shaky 'yeah, I\u2019m here.' Nothing came. The dead line didn\u2019t even give him the courtesy of interference.\n\n\n\nRhys shifted his head just enough to look beyond the base of a tree. Dense patches of spruce and pine stretched in all directions. Dark and pale trunks rose from the snow like his own personal prison bars. He could see shallow, pinkish tracks leading to a larger mound of snow, approximately thirty metres from his position. He knew what would be under there, something large and furry that vaguely reminded him of a Smilodon. It must have wandered off after massacring his squad and knocking him unconscious. It was dead. Small red blots seeping through the snow revealed the location of at least forty bullet-holes. \n\n\n\nRhys caught himself feeling disappointment. That shocked him. After all, he was safer with it dead than alive. Still, the dread persisted, it was the knowledge that their capture mission had failed. Part of him had hoped that if he could face the thing again then maybe, just maybe he wouldn\u2019t die in vain. Perhaps he could still do something to help future squads catch and study it. Now, that hope melted away, and looking at the snow-covered corpse of the beast that had murdered his friends he felt well and truly alone.\n\n\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@'They\u2019re coming,' He muttered, though he wasn\u2019t sure who he meant.

That comm unit in his helmet was useful for nothing but decoration.\n\n\n\nHe pictured some weaselly, bespectacled man already writing a neat line into his report, somewhere far south of the treeline. //MTF Lambda-7 neutralised during initial engagement. Recovery deemed nonviable.//\n\n\n\n//Nonviable//, he almost laughed.\n\n\n\nIt was such a stupid word, too clinical in the face of it all. He tried to picture himself as a data point, an \u2018X\u2019 in a box, but the image refused to settle. His shoulder throbbed in time with his pulse. He tasted copper in his mouth. Slowly, he got up, his nearly empty M25 held out in front of him, and approached the bleeding mound that used to be the anomaly. Now closer, he could see tufts of frozen, light grey fur poking through the snow. He kicked it, then again, and again, screamed every profanity he knew at it and then some. It didn\u2019t move. Rhys cleared away some of the snow and sat against its side, knowing he was going to die.\n\n\n\nHe'd just closed his eyes when he heard a cracking noise, subtle at first then louder. A distinct primal fear overtook him when he met the eyes of a wolf standing just a few metres from him. Three wolves, he noted soon after, three wolves circling him. It was funny, he hadn\u2019t been afraid when the anomaly charged them, but now, alone in the snow with one bullet left in his pistol, he was terrified of some ordinary wolves.\n\n\n\nStill facing the main wolf, Rhys awkwardly pushed himself onto the large back of the anomaly. It was a clumsy affair, with only one functional arm, but the wolves didn\u2019t advance. Perhaps they too, were confused as to what he was doing. They watched him with flat, unreadable eyes. Steam curled from their mouths in steady breaths. They were healthy, shiny coats, no visible ribs, not desperate. That, somehow, made it worse. Rhys kept the gun trained on the one in front, though the blood loss and the cold made his arm tremble badly enough that the sight wobbled in and out of line with its head. One bullet. He was acutely aware of it now, of the fact that even if he used it perfectly it wouldn\u2019t matter. Wolves didn\u2019t charge one at a time.\n\n\n\nBehind him, a wolf took a step closer. Rhys spun around.\n\n\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@'Stay back,' Rhys commanded. He raised his arm above his head, attempting to look as large as possible. Rhys was not a small man, but the blood now seeping through the bandage on his shoulder and the way he winced with every movement did nothing to help his threat display. He swallowed hard and tried again, louder. 'Go on, get out of here!'\n\n\n\nThe wolf cocked its head, as if genuinely considering the offer. Its gaze flicked briefly from Rhys, to the bulk of the anomaly beneath him. Rhys felt a sudden, absurd surge of possessiveness. This thing was his now. It had killed his friends, but they had killed it, so now it belonged to him. He trained his pistol on the mass of the closest wolf again.\n\n\n\nThe main wolf behind him moved forward, he heard its paws crunch in the snow. He didn\u2019t know if it actually was the lead wolf, or if wolves had a chain of command at all, but it seemed as good a name as any. A third stayed back in the treeline, a pale thing half swallowed by the snow. They\u2019d stopped circling him now, but he estimated he could easily touch one if he reached down, as close as they\u2019d gotten. He\u2019d barely even noticed it, but there they were, only an arms-length away. And him, standing atop the thing that killed his friends, brandishing a gun that wouldn\u2019t save him.\n\n\n\nThen the front wolf lowered its head and sniffed. Not at Rhys. At the anomaly. Its nose brushed a piece of blood-matted fur where the snow had fallen away. It recoiled instantly, fur on end, and let out a low growl. The other two reacted instantly, stiff, with their ears pinned back and teeth bared.\n\n\n\nRhys noticed it then, too. The anomaly didn\u2019t smell of death, not exclusively at least. It had this sharp, metallic, yet strangely sweet scent about it. He hadn\u2019t even noticed it at first, because he\u2019d smelled it so many times before. That\u2019s just what lingers around things that don\u2019t quite belong. That //wrong// smell that made his stomach churn if he breathed too deeply. The wolves clearly knew it as well.\n\n\n\nThe front wolf took a step back. Then another. The wolves lingered for a moment longer, eyes never leaving him, then one by one turned and melted back into the trees. The last thing he saw was the pale one, at the treeline, glancing over its shoulder before vanishing out of sight. Rhys let out a deep breath. His knees threatened to give out and he kneeled onto the body beneath him, digging his fingers into its pallid fur. He laughed then, a rough, broken sound that turned into something close to a sob. He pressed his forehead to the creature\u2019s back and stayed there, breathing deep, until the shaking passed.\n\n\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@'Okay,' he whispered to no one particular.

Not intentionally, of course, but its presence, even in death, had kept him alive for a few minutes longer. That changed things.\n\n\n\nHe pushed himself back upright, grimacing at the pain in his shoulder, and scanned the forest. No movement, the wolves were gone.

Skinning such a large creature one-handed had been no easy feat. It didn\u2019t help that the anomaly seemed to have some kind of thick, blubber-like layer into which his knife continuously lodged itself. In the end, he\u2019d given up on taking the entire skin and settled for carving out a patch of fur from the thing\u2019s side. While this left his end product looking less than presentable, the large size of the anomaly meant Rhys\u2019 new cloak was still more than big enough to wrap around his entire body like a parka.\n\n\n\nHis work had left an open hole in the side of the thing, exposing its meat. Rhys wondered if it was edible. He\u2019d resigned himself to the fact that a very long hike was in his future, and he\u2019d need something to eat. He ran his knife along a rib, scraping off a thin sliver of marbled red meat and hesitantly placed it into his mouth. Rancid. That was the only word that came close to describing the taste Rhys stood trying to scrub from his tongue. He\u2019d spat it out immediately, gagging, but the sour taste lingered.

Logistics and tactics, that was safer ground for him. He took stock of what he had left with a familiar, detached efficiency that gave him a comforting sense of normal. One sidearm, good. One bullet in said sidearm, less good. An m4 carbine slung across his back, but that wouldn\u2019t do him much good with his motionless left arm. A knife dulled by bone and hide. An in-helmet communicator that might as well have been brick, and a well-stocked medpack which he was currently using to refresh his bandages.\n\n\n\nAnd time, maybe.\n\n\n\nHe forced himself away from the body and gathered what he could from the snow around him.

Frankly, there wasn\u2019t much else to do. He thought of his friends, of how he\u2019d liked to have buried them proper, even though the ground was hard and frozen so he knew it was impossible. Of the anomaly, laying there in the vast wilderness. He imagined it contained in a sterile, white box. Pulling his cloak tight, he considered that maybe it was better off dead. \n\n\n\nMost of all, he thought about the Foundation.\n\n\n\nThe even, undisturbed snow reminded him of the shiny white walls and the coats of researchers. Researchers who stood around watercoolers talking casually about monsters and how many had died to contain them. One day, on his way to windowless briefing room, he\u2019d overheard two weathered senior researchers comparing \u2018kill stats\u2019. They\u2019d boasted, trying to convince the other that //their// project was the more dangerous and impressive assignment. \n\n\n\nHe'd believed in it once, too. In the idea that someone had to do the dirty work so the rest of the machine could pretend that things just materialised in boxes for them to study. That it mattered, that //they// mattered. Someone had to die in the dark. He wasn\u2019t sure when that faith had begun to crack. Maybe it had always been just a hollow fantasy he convinced himself of so he could sleep at night.\n\n\n\nHe imagined a meeting room. Some suits who\u2019d never been in the field a day in their life saying his name in the past tense before moving on to the next point on the agenda. They\u2019d consider sending some other squad to go looking for the anomaly. Maybe they\u2019d even designate a new Lambda-7. His stomach stiffened and he tightened his jaw against the feeling.\n\n\n\nThey hadn\u2019t come looking. That was what stuck with him, kept him walking. No reply on the comms for a few hours had been enough to be written off.\n\n\n\nRhys stumbled, caught himself on a rock and pressed his forehead to the icy stone. The hard, cold texture felt nice against his face, it soothed a burning there he hadn\u2019t even noticed existed. He elected to spend the night by the boulder, to shelter from the harsh winds that swept the plain. His eyes wandered over the smooth snow ahead.\n\n\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@'If I make it.'

He\u2019d never noticed it before, but after days of nothing but frost and pine the smell of gasoline was overwhelming.\n\n\n\nEvery step after that was weightless. He didn\u2019t even feel the hot pulse of his shoulder or the weight of his gear, not even after today\u2019s hours of walking. He trudged into some spindly bushes and elected to put his helmet back on to prevent the branches from whipping him in the face as he pushed through.\n\n\n\nThen, the foliage gave way and Rhys' eyes began to sting.\n\n\n\nA clearing with some frozen tarps and tape flapping about. Their shapes now seemed so alien he barely recognised what he was looking at. The jeeps. His jeep. He\u2019d imagined this moment a thousand times while he walked, yet now faced with his freedom he found himself overcome with a profound aimlessness. He regarded the jeeps with careful eyes. The keys of the one he\u2019d driven burned a hole in one of his many pockets. He wanted nothing more than to just get in, to be //inside// something again. Something gnawed at him, however.\n\n\n\nHis gaze wandered to the roof of his jeep. From the smooth black, unmarked body rose the metre tall broadcast antenna. The more complex radio system in the jeep would let him talk directly to various command channels. He had his pick of open lines. For a long time, Rhys stared at the dark rod surrounded by smooth snow on the roof.\n\n\n\nHe trained his pistol\u2019s sights on the antenna and pulled the trigger.\n\n\n\nThe thing exploded in a mess of plastic, metal and wires. He dropped his gun in the snow and looked at what he\u2019d done. //Worth it.// \n\n\n\nHe limped over to the driver\u2019s side and fumbled with the door. It took him two good tugs before it snapped open. The inside smelled like dusty fabric and cough drops. In that moment, it was the best smell in the world. He slid into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled the door closed behind him with a reverent //click//. For a moment he just sat there, his fur coat thrown messily into the seat next to him. Inside felt amazing. His first course of action was to turn the heat up as high as it would go. It soothed his aching muscles, but the warmth combined with the enclosed space made the terrible odour he\u2019d coated himself with all the more apparent. Maybe a shower should be his first stop, he considered, after the hospital of course. His fingers had turned black somewhere between day two and three.\n\n\n\nHe turned the key all the way. The engine coughed once, then roared to life. The sound was deafening to him. Rhys let out a shaky breath and rested his hand on the wheel. He could drive north. Find some tiny town that didn\u2019t ask too many questions, blend in. He could head south. Dump the jeep, flag someone down on the side of the road and see how long it took before the men in unmarked cars arrived.\n\n\n\nHe could go anywhere.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation would notice eventually. Of course they would, Rhys held no illusions about that. They might notice their radio antenna going dark and figure it out, or come back here eventually and find one less jeep than there should be. They\u2019d open a file, and speculate quietly in windowless rooms.\n\n\n\nBut they wouldn\u2019t know where he went.\n\n\n\nRhys glanced in the rearview mirror. Covered in dried viscera, his hair standing stiff on his head, his arm transitioned from bright red to purply black and the beginnings of a beard covered his face. He barely recognised himself. He smiled.\n\n\n\n//Nonviable.// The word didn\u2019t hurt as much anymore.\n\n\n\nHe put the jeep in gear. The tires crunched in the snow as he pulled away. It would swallow his tracks like it had swallowed everything else. Rhys didn\u2019t look back. He drove until the sky began to change colour. Eventually he drove from an unmarked patch of plains, onto an equally unmarked backwater road. He didn\u2019t know where he was going.\n\n\n\nOnly that he was going.\n\n\n\nAnd somewhere far away a report would eventually be written.\n\n\n\nIt would be drafted up, formatted perfectly and shoved into a dusty filing cabinet.\n\n\n\nIt would say:\n\n\n\n//MTF Lambda-7: no survivors.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nAnd for once, it would be wrong.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** Rhys_and_wolves.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Rhys_and_wolves\n\n> **Author:** Loop11\n\n> **License:**\u00a0\u00a0CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rhys_and_wolves.jpg\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_image", "_licensebox", "adventure", "military-fiction", "tale"], "title": "Acceptable Losses - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/acceptable-losses", "year": 2026}, "bedlam": {"created_at": "2026-01-16T19:55:00", "creator": "Ralliston", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"all-eyes-on-silesia-hub\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:55:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-16T19:55:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Prison.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:56:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Spodek.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:56:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Cairo.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:57:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Uploaded file \"CI-GOC.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:57:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Hospital.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:57:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Paraguay.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-16T19:57:00"}, {"author": "Heck_Tech", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heck-tech", "comment": "Added tags: _image, _licensebox, action, chaos-insurgency, from-120s-archives, global-occult-coalition, homo-sapiens-sidhe, military-fiction, tale, the-engineer.

Its streets and bazaars pulsed with commerce, music, and endless chatter, yet a shadow of uncertainty lingered all over the city. In spite of the recent victories, the Kingdom of Egypt had thrown itself into the Arab League war against the newly declared State of Israel, but the campaign had already revealed cracks in both the League's unity and King Farouk's grand political ambitions. Whispers of corruption and incompetence among the highest of echelons eroded the country, reinforcing the popular discontent with the still lingering influence of the Great Powers, their eyes focused on nothing but the Suez jewel in their crown.</p>\n<p>It was never merely a waterway \u2014 it was the greatest achievement of empire, carved into the very flesh of Egypt itself. While the dreams of the Pharaohs and the Caesars had once scratched at these sands to irrigate their crops, it was the machinery of modern imperialism that paved the way for the construction of a canal on an unprecedented scale. The desire for the Orient's riches literally tore through the desert with the hands of tens of thousands of local fellahin and imported labour, consumed by exhaustion, typhoid, and cholera. Many nameless, forgotten victims sacrificed upon the altar of the Great Powers, whose looming presence still reigned through the passing steel titans.</p>\n<p>Indeed: in a land wounded by many a scars, the need for radical change was brewing, and though it would take years still until one of the many groups would make it manifest under its own dictate, for now it was there to stay.</p>\n<p>Yet beneath the surface of mundane struggles of governments and kings, something much greater lurked restless. Cairo \u2014 long a refuge for various reprobates, revolutionaries, and philosophers of the seen and the unseen \u2014 had become a stage where hidden forces gathered. In smoky caf\u00e9s and discreet salons, where politics mixed with espionage and the occult, intrigues ran deeper than the newspapers for commoners had dared print. And in this moment of uncertainty, in this moment of a breath painfully held, the city had been chosen as the meeting ground for a faction in a conflict far older, stranger, and infinitely more dangerous than the wars of men \u2014 one that was soon to decide the fates of both sides of the Veil, whether they liked it or not.</p>\n<p>And here it came: under a scorching sun, a luxury Bentley rolled to a halt outside a warehouse in the industrial suburbs of Shubr\u0101 al-Khaymah, just north of the capital. Its polished novelty stood in stark contrast to the grit of factory smoke and harshness of the desert climate.</p>\n<p>The two armed soldiers standing nearby \u2014 dressed in British-style uniforms to avoid suspicion \u2014 were already prepared for its arrival; they had been expecting it for many hours at this point. They straightened out their postures for one final time, and tightened the grips on their guns.</p>\n<p>Much was at stake today. The wheels set in motion over the last few months \u2014 countless meetings, setting up networks of sympathisers, plans and preparations \u2014 reached their conclusion in this unassuming place. What was required of them was nothing less than perfection.</p>\n<p>The last of the dust settled from under the car's tires, and from inside the vehicle stepped out a European man, his immaculate suit shifting as he adjusted the lapel. At once, the soldiers snapped to attention, saluting with rigid precision.</p>\n<p>\"The session has already begun, sir,\" one of them reported, voice clipped and mechanical.</p>\n<p>The guest did not answer; instead, his eyes swept over the pair with quiet scrutiny, a wordless command to proceed. Without hesitation, the soldiers pulled open the heavy warehouse doors.</p>\n<p>The place had been chosen by him, intentionally, so that it would be larger than they could ever need \u2014 far from a surprise, given its previous occupation \u2014 but as he stepped into the main hall proper, he realized that he might have miscalculated his original assessment. The voices of all the gathered thundered across the warehouse with enough might and fervour that one would be forgiven for thinking that the place was, indeed, full.</p>\n<p>\"\u2014Which is exactly why we <em>need</em> a new mode of operations, better than that of the Overseers! The reforms of the <a href=\"/ralliston-s-proposal\">Directive</a> are insufficient, which I have always vocally expressed, and now, with a clear break, we will find allies behind our cause to\u2014\" He recognized the voice of Dr. Elizabeth Tate, Vice Chair of the Ethics Committee in all but intent.</p>\n<p>The man also recognized the person who interrupted her: it was impossible to mistake the tall, sturdy fellow, tight military clothing all around his sun-burnt skin, for anyone but General Joseph Armstrong, second in command of the Foundation's armed forces. \"And what, let anarchy reign? Let another occult war break out? It is <em>exactly these reforms</em> which are a prime example of this very incompetence!\"</p>\n<p>His military prowess was met with murmurs of approval throughout the room.</p>\n<p>\"Joseph is partially correct, though he stops short of the necessary conclusion,\" this time, it was Dr. Julian Roy of the Department of Ontokinetics who spoke, with much less vigor but equal confidence as the preceding speaker. \"Though we cannot parrot the old modus operandi, it is clear that we also cannot fully subvert it. If we are to determine the future of the human race, we cannot be fettered by the fear of <em>going too far</em>. Only with a clear path forward, not limited by any\u2014\"</p>\n<p>The man finally cleared his throat, seizing the opportunity in the discussion.</p>\n<p>\"Gentlemen\u2014\" At once, all eyes were on him. \"\u2014and ladies.\" He nodded at those present, and walked slowly towards the triangular table, towards the only chair still missing its occupant. He took his seat, and eyed everyone who was there to join him.</p>\n<p>There was much more of them than he had dared hope. He refused the urge to smile.</p>\n<p>Good. Very good.</p>\n<p>He had feared that most who had first joined their scheme would prove cowards when push came to shove, but from what he could see, all of them were present. All those who had declared loyalty to their cause when they had first begun putting their plan together had carried through their plans as intended, <em>and</em> also actually shown up. He was almost impressed.</p>\n<p>\"I am somewhat surprised to see that you had begun without me, but I will take that as only a sign of your enthusiasm to our cause.\" A few chuckles came as a response. He put his hands together, and continued, \"Now, before we begin, I hope I must not say this: as of this very moment, you are all committed to our movement. There is no going back.\"</p>\n<p>As if on command, they all nodded. He was right \u2014 all around the globe, the research centers and Sites and Areas which had been their homes for so long were aflame by a fire of their own design. They had struck fast and hard, setting the Foundation's assets loose and planting charges were necessary, and they took Overwatch by surprise. A surprise that had, just as they had expected, turned the Overseers' attention away from its oriental fronts and onto the mainland, right where his companions were not \u2014 a perfect opportunity to meet and organize before they could strike again, this time for good.</p>\n<p>They were all certain of their cause, all those who surrounded the man \u2014 he could see the common thread of doubt uniting them all, no matter their different backgrounds and ethnicities and indeed plans for how they were to proceed. He could see the disillusionment at the Foundation's decadence, resulting in its inability to stop another Great War of the mundane and occult varieties; at its growing inability to stand as a bulwark against darkness. At its weakness, made manifest in its willingness to bend under the push of the new age that was to come.</p>\n<p>\"As of today's morning, you have all become traitors to the SCP Foundation. Your superiors and subordinates may not yet realize this, but you must know that this is what you are. You cannot return. You will never be a part of that organization again.\"</p>\n<p>A few loud cheers and bangs against the table followed. He could see the common spirit overtake them: the name and moniker under which they had gathered had stuck. The new Delta Command, a declaration of its intention to change the world already in its name, was taking shape faster than he had expected. Faster, certainly, than he had ever dreamt; that all the hardened types that made it up, mostly of the military type, could organize like this with each other was almost a miracle.</p>\n<p>\"But, if we play the hand we had taken right, the Foundation will not stand for much longer.\" He cleared his throat again, and gestured to the nearby soldier to come forward. He complied, bringing with him a suitcase full of documents. The soldier presented them to the man, and he grabbed the manilla folder, throwing it onto the table with great strength, with great determination. \"Our declaration of war has already been prepared, and come evening, it shall be sent to all places within the organization that still matter.\"</p>\n<p>And he was right \u2014 laying there in front of them all was a letter, a manifesto, his own moniker and the numbers for which he stood signed right at the bottom of them. The mantle of the Engineer, of the creator of a new structured order that was to come after their victory, stood proudly in red letters below what they had to say. What they had to protest, against the joke that the Foundation had become. He would never use his own name, of course \u2014 although some officers accepted entrusting command to the nephew of Foundation Overseer Three, Gabriel Miller, he still had to win over the rest \u2014 but oh how he could wait until he would. The look on that old monster's face once they take their Site-01 by force and replace them, ready to steer the organization back onto proper tracks, will be nothing short of marvelous.</p>\n<p>\"You have already stricken fear into their hearts with our first move. They will not resist paranoia, and they will not resist slopiness. And we will be ready.\"</p>\n<p>The soldier from before took out more folders, this time putting one copy before each of the gathered.</p>\n<p>\"What you will find inside is the role each of you will play in the upcoming week. Our first step had already taken them off guard \u2014 we do not need much to push the already off-kilter <em>thing</em> which the Foundation had become into full chaos. We do not need much to scatter their attention and strike right in the heart of their treacherous, delusional rule \u2014 the very same heart which they still think remains hidden to us.\"</p>\n<p>He could see the excitement in the eyes of his new subjects turn into full on fortitude right as he said those words. He could see that, in this very moment, they would go with him to hell and back \u2014 all in a last ditch effort to bring the organization they had dedicated their life to from falling away from their grip. From falling away into change.</p>\n<p>\"We will strike and we will succeed, taking their thrones for ourselves to share. And when we are done, dear friends\u2014\" He clasped his hands. \"\u2014we shall again change the world.\"</p>\n<p>Thunderous applause followed the second he stopped speaking. For a moment, he let himself bask in the glory, standing up and eyeing them enthusiastically. He only stopped once he noticed a single, frail hand rising at the edge of the table. He nodded at the participant, then sat back up.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026And what will we do after?\" asked harshly Elizabeth Tate. \"Would it not be better to draft up our plans now, so that we could present a clear case to what shall remain, once we take over? So that we may drive more to our side with reason?\"</p>\n<p>She had always been the most uncertain element of this coalition \u2014 too idealistic, too willing to grant points and men to <a href=\"/serpent-s-hand-hub\">communist bookfuckers</a> \u2014 but that wasn't a concern for now. Now, a united front against the Overseers was all that mattered, and every potential ally had to be on board.</p>\n<p>The Engineer only smiled apologetically, and waved his hand. \"My friend, we may have wisdom now, but it is a narrow one \u2014 it is a view that might be clear, yes, but one that does not yet see the full extent of the duty that shall be bequeathed to us. One not yet baptised in the fire to come.</p>\n<p>\"The foundations that this organization was built upon are putrid, rotten. We cannot hope to build anything that will last, that will endure, from that which we are already given. We cannot hope to find clarity in the ways for which it stands \u2014 there, we will only find madness.</p>\n<p>\"No, there is no saving that which exists now. No way to find a clear path forward amidst all of their decadence. We are united by the shared understanding that the Overseers tarnished the Foundation's potential \u2014 that their incompetence led to the tragedy of the Second World War and its occult side. There is no way to find a road upon which humanity could walk together, for a future that we were robbed of the second it decided to bend and break.</p>\n<p>\"But that which shall withstand the fire will prove pure and great; it will prove strong and resilient. It will prove <em>true</em>, for all of man to see. It will prove final and unbroken \u2014 an order that we shall at last return to.</p>\n<p>\"And only from those ashes shall we build a new way, a new law: one that will be great and righteous. One that will be eternal. And one that will be unbroken, no matter what comes its way.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><strong>Silesia</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>NOW</strong></span></p>\n<p>\u2014 \u25cf \u2014</p>\n<img alt=\"Spodek.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bedlam/Spodek.jpg\"/></div>\n<p>T-plus fifteen minutes after Heaven falls down, they drag him out by his feet, kicking and screaming.

Today, he shares the streets with the rats he so desperately despises.</p>\n<p>And one of the rats is there indeed, to witness his final humiliation: slowly but surely, Ry'hle Kiera walks out of the ruined Saucer, a cigarette right between his two bloodied fingertips. Its smoke joins the thick thaumic cloud pouring out of his back, and he grins. He grins, but he does not give the enemy fallen before him the dignity of acknowledgment \u2014 he turns the gesture towards the soldiers which he knows are there to take the New Engineer.</p>\n<p>For a while, they stand there, the three of them, and they exchange glances. There is no respect in the gesture, but there is an understanding: both the Coalition gun and the A.R.G.U.S. wizard know that the battle they've won, but most certainly not the war. It is the twenty-first century, and if something happens in this grand, unknown world, it is recorded and televised and put unto the shared digital psychosis for all eleven-point-half billion people on Earth to see \u2014 the escape and humiliation of their leaders was no different. There's footage \u2014 and if there's footage, there's outrage.</p>\n<p>They have already lost their face and they have already lost their honor \u2014 the least they can do is hang on to the facsimile they've created: the facsimile that they're peacekeepers that took up their arms for the good of Silesia. That they were here to liberate and not control \u2014 that they were here here for the people, and not for their own status quo.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the twenty-first century: here it comes right before them. A camera drone \u2014 unVeiled, Kiera figures? \u2014 slowly moves down, finally free to traverse the sky above Katowice now that the Insurgency was shot and left out to bleed in a puddle of its own piss. The drone is looking directly at the three, and the soldiers understand that this is their cue: the scrantonite manacles snap around the New Engineer's hands, tying down his magic once and for all.</p>\n<p>A red light turns on, then hovers for a few seconds, and the drone flies off, its bounty right in its digital claws.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt in the minds of the three men that this photo will be remembered for decades to come.</p>\n<p>Kiera takes another drag, breathing a sigh of relief for the first time in six months, and he turns his eyes, filled with wartorn exhaustion, towards the skyline. It is tranquil again. He does not remember when it was last so. There is still movement in the distance, the last sons of the Insurgency shot and stabbed and turned to viscera, but before long the sun will go down and Silesia will go to sleep without fearing for its own children.</p>\n<p>He exhales again, this time towards the two soldiers.</p>\n<p>Beneath them three, the New Engineer babbles incoherently, switching from English to German to Polish to something else that neither can quite make out \u2014 he shouts how this isn't over, only his head moving up from the ground he is pinned down to, and he screams about a fire and about ashes and after a while Kiera tunes it all out. Even when the Insurgent looks at him directly, cursing him out and blabbering on, he turns his eyes back to the two men who actually matter here.</p>\n<p>Again a pregnant silence overtakes them, but is soon broken up by the soldiers nodding towards Kiera. Another acknowledgment falls: that this is his city, fair and square, and that this is his Silesia. They have fought for it under the pretense of propriety and they have lost.</p>\n<p>There is nothing more to be said and there is nothing more to be done. The cards are no longer theirs to give out \u2014 they will deal with the hand that they will be given when the time comes.</p>\n<p>Smoke falls from between Kiera's lips, and as it goes up and up, it is broken up by the rotors of the Coalition helicopter, here to take the New Engineer and deliver him to a trial whose verdict was already decided.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><strong>Foundation Civil War</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>THEN</strong></span></p>\n<p>\u2014 \u25cf \u2014</p>\n<img alt=\"Paraguay.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bedlam/Paraguay.jpg\"/></div>\n<p>If Joseph Armstrong were to say which animal he was most similar to, he would have to invoke the name of the wolf.</p>\n<p>Everything that he had achieved in his life he had won through strength, through violence \u2014 through power made manifest first in his fists, then in his bullets, and at last in his orders. He was a hunter, through and through, and he had known nothing but force for all of his life. Over the many winters he had survived it had shaped him into a sturdy man, a resilient man; one who would stand no matter the circumstances and certainly no matter the enemy. One who would see the pack subservient to him make it through, no matter the blood and no matter the sweat.</p>\n<p>He fancied himself an alpha, one who would not back down from any fight or any challenge \u2014 right now, though, he lived more like a fox. More like a mouse, a rat, a disgusting piece of vermin that had scuttled away and hidden from its own dignity.</p>\n<p>Cowering away in a Paraguayan cave or basement or run-down factory or whatever other nonsense it was this week was certainly not his idea of a fight, of a war. Not his idea of buying time and not his idea of retreating until another chance presented itself.</p>\n<p>But none of this mattered: just like a true wolf, he would make do. He had to.</p>\n<p>He sighed, the dampness of the half-abandoned shack heavy on his lungs, and went back to cutting what they could barely call vegetables back into the pot.</p>\n<p>There were maybe thirty other men with him down here, all of them what little remained of his unit, and he didn't need any words to see that they too were starving. Had he more energy left in him, he would be furious \u2014 but he had to save what was still left, so that their night escapades into the nearby warehouses and forests and clearings to gather whatever they could find would be successful. He could not afford to be wasteful; he had to do what which he had always done best, and conserve.</p>\n<p>This is not how he had imagined it would all go. Not when they had first come together to form their Insurgency, not when they had gathered in Cairo to lay out a precise plan for the coup. Everything had gone smoothly at first \u2014 the Foundation's leadership had been paralyzed by uncertain internal loyalty, the swift takeover of its facilities, their acquisition of hundreds of anomalous artifacts, and the sabotage of its infrastructure \u2014 but then came the fateful assault on Site-01. The event that had tested the internal strengths and affiliations of the Insurgency. The event that had revealed its internal cracks for the whole world to see. The event that had forced them to retreat, losing more and more ground to the Overseers, hiding until a moment could come.</p>\n<p>One which <em>would</em> inevitably come, he was sure \u2014 between the rising tensions of the Cold War and internal pressure inside the Foundation building up like never before, they all knew that their time would sooner or later come again. That it would come and grant them victory at last, victory long since awaited and victory long since earned: victory promised and victory prophetic. Victory complete, for a final, perfect order to be thrust upon the world.</p>\n<p>He just wished it would come sooner than later \u2014 that they didn't have to hide away there, this far from civilization, until the Foundation's counteroffensive loses momentum. That they did not have to waste away in goddamned Paraguay out of all places. That they could again be warriors, again be victors, and not waste away like cowards.</p>\n<p>Armstrong was aware of the grim truth: although no one wanted to admit it yet, they had lost this battle. There was no other way to put it. The rest of Delta Command believed in the false hope that a magical divine army would come and save them, salvaging their attempt to regicide the Overseers. But he knew that their mistakes were too deep to be salavaged, this far into the war.</p>\n<p>Still: it was not nearly as bad as it could have been, of this he was certain. The recent changes in their haven \u2014 partially the reason why they had chosen Paraguay \u2014 made it the tiniest bit more bearable to stay here. The recent victory of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_Civil_War_(1947)\">steady strong-arm rule over the Reds</a> mostly kept away the insanity Armstrong so desperately despised at bay. It also gave him the opportunity to meet many officers and young general of German descent who, just like Armstrong, knew and respected strength.</p>\n<p>Armstrong blinked twice, snapping back into relative reality, and took a taste of the thing brewing in the pot before him. Although they had the blessing of the local junta, everything was done under the table, so they were on their own. The soup tasted just as tart as it always had, but it was also hot and liquid and that was all that they needed, this far into their withdrawal. Besides: it had the mushrooms in them. They would help the Insurgents pass the time.</p>\n<p>Armstrong's men had first found them up west, when their trudge through Bolivia had taken them through mountains and caves and ravines. There, at the bottom of the continent and at the bottom of their desperation, they found the last hope that could save them from starvation: patches of mushrooms, growing deep, deep in caves far beyond the reach of light and man. They tasted worse \u2014 and far more alien, nothing like Armstrong had ever tasted, <a href=\"/scp-7600\">almost as if they were not of this cave and certainly not of this continent</a> \u2014 than the pain growling in their stomachs, but they had to carry on, and the fungi made for an unexpectedly full meal.</p>\n<p>But they did so much more, too. They showed Armstrong and his men images, glorious visions \u2014 promises that had given them far more energy to remain in the fight than the food did.</p>\n<p>From that point on they had decided that they needed the mushrooms to remain in the fold, to remain in the struggle; that the fungi continued to sprout along their path down south felt almost like a sign from god himself that they were just. Like some miracle sent specifically to grant them hope amidst greatest desperation. They gathered as many as they could and they had eaten and Seen regularly since then, to remain high on spirit \u2014 and tonight, it would be no different.</p>\n<p>The clay bowl felt heavy under Armstrong's tired arms. He looked upon it, his heavy reflection greeting him from the thick liquid. He did not sigh, though he much wanted to. He did not look at his companions, either \u2014 he did not need to know that they were already drowning in their own myths of the near future.</p>\n<p>He took a breath, and drank the liquid whole.</p>\n<p>It did not take long for the visions to come.</p>\n<p>They were familiar at first, much more so than he had hoped: shifting like shadow, shifting like the wind. He saw his days of glory under the arm of the regime, under the Foundation as the leader of their Alpha-1. He saw again all the vermin that they had <a href=\"/carroll-022-the-last-stand\">weeded out</a> during his tenure as soldier and commander \u2014 he saw the strength they were allowed to wield back when his superiors had still not yet turned into cowards. He saw the fire and felt again the weight of the gun; he bled out the wounds and stitched up the scars, and he stood back up, his mind and soul shifting, ready to accept that which he would become.</p>\n<p>And the world again fell on him, throwing him sideways and into conflict \u2014 he saw again the halls of Site-01, the cold concrete lined with his dead. Once more he saw the blood and the shame and the pain, so much pain, and he was not General but Victim, but Martyr, sentenced to watch as his men die under the blades of those of the Red Right Hand who have Remained and Survived. He again saw Overseer Three, strangling his own kin without any hesitation whatsoever, and he again saw the plane coming down upon the hidden clearing, ready to take them to fight and die another day. Ready to take them back to shame \u2014 shame that washed upon him and took him down, down to an abyss so dark that inside it he could barely see.</p>\n<p>But again see he did, this time shown a path he had not yet seen before. One paved with chanting and one paved with red, so much red, waving in the background as they all saluted in his name. Long live the Insurgency, they all shouted, long live the Engineer and the General. And they all meant it, too \u2014 he could see it in the fervour in their eyes, in the pins that they all have clipped to their coats and dresses and shirts. He could see it in the way that they stood up for him and his Engineer and his cause and brought about an era of reason and strength, rooting out the weakness and cowardice and contrast right by its stems, their path paving over all remnants of the Foundation and the Hand and the Company, and\u2014</p>\n<p>For a moment, he forgot how to breathe.</p>\n<p>He then took his spoon back up and dug into the almost-empty pot for whatever still remained, shoving the food right into his mouth over and over until nothing was left.</p>\n<p>He never noticed the fire under the pot go out; he was already back in his dreams, ready to see that which he was sure would inevitably await him.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><strong>Silesia</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>NOW</strong></span></p>\n<p>\u2014 \u25cf \u2014</p>\n<img alt=\"Hospital.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bedlam/Hospital.jpg\"/></div>\n<p>The first thing that Anna \u015awito\u0144 remembers is the words, their pressure breaking through the blinding light and right into her brain, kickstarting it back into existence.</p>\n<p>The second thing that she remembers is their meaning.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Z drogi!</em>\" shouts a woman whose voice \u015awito\u0144 cannot quite place, both young and old at the same time, pushing the stretchers forward, always forward. She repeats her mantra a few more times, and the regular, circular (?) sound swirling in \u015awito\u0144's ears gives way first to white buzzing, then to wheels turning in great haste, then to the sound of metal cutting metal.</p>\n<p>There is a spark, then a curse, and the Yeren surgeon she suddenly remembers her company hiring digs into her guts, his fingertings sharper than diamond and his instinct more precise than blades.</p>\n<p>She never feels the sedative take hold.</p>\n<p>She dreams strangely, once they refill her fluids and hook her up to something that reminds her that she is alive. She dreams of great mountains, great deserts, great steppes and great forests \u2014 all withering away but not quite dying under an eternal tomb as a cloud larger than life overtakes them all. She dreams of thunder rolling forward, its echo rippling like feminine laughter; she dreams of a two-pronged wound first in the world and then in herself, the planet's oceans filled with blood that isn't just hers. She dreams of a crown of thorns and and gold and bone, put upon the temple of She Who Will Remain, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014and then another bright light comes, plunging her from the darkness and back into existence.</p>\n<p>The Yeren coughs, looking her straight in those glass eyes, and he renders his verdict.</p>\n<p>He tells her that she will never walk again and that she will never cast again \u2014 that it will be a miracle if she makes it out from under the IV. He tells her that never again will she see battle and that she is only laying here thanks to the miracles built from metal and crystal that made up more of her body than flesh did. He tells her that, unless she listens, she will die.</p>\n<p>This is not news to her. She has heard these words more times than she can count \u2014 she does not doubt she will hear them many times more.</p>\n<p>Still: she nods in understanding, knowing the right buttons to push, until the doctor heads towards another victim of this battle, leaving her alone in the twenty square meter room. Only the empty chair, the beeping of the thing she owes her life to, and the boxy TV \u2014 they know she likes it old-fashioned \u2014 remain as her companions.</p>\n<p>For a while she just lies there, enjoying the beating of her own heart. Then, inevitably, she sighs with a ragged breath, and turns the TV on. She has already witnessed the truth herself, on the frontlines of the conflict: she is curious what sensation the world will spin it into.</p>\n<p>For hours she listens as they speak of tragedy and speak of loss; she listens as they give statistics and interviews and as they render judgment on an oh so clear-and-cut case. She looks as they show her in battle, breaking those little Insurgents one by one during her ascent, and for a while she almost smiles \u2014 right until they say that the Coalition has began its withdrawal alongside A.R.G.U.S. and the Witch Slayers, leaving the no longer Chaotic ruins of Silesia to those still willing to dwell inside.</p>\n<p>So that's how it ends \u2014 with a battle she's fought and won, only for it to be surrendered from one insanity unto another.</p>\n<p>She sighs again. Such is life; if nothing before broke her, neither will this.</p>\n<p>For a while, she wonders whether or not they will call it the Eight Occult War, once the dust settles and intellectualism veers its parasitic tendrils into the politics; whether the Coalition will have the balls necessary to admit defeat in one of its missions and acknowledge this final milestone upon their end of history. But then she understands: if the <a href=\"http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/krew-proch-i-wrzosy\">British Civil War</a>, another Greek-Turkish bloodshed, or any other of the minor post-Veil smirkishes were refused this moniker, so will this one.</p>\n<p>And history will move on.</p>\n<p>Still: whether or not the Silesian Insurrection will be given the honor of carrying the mantle of the Eight, she does not doubt that it will be a turning point for humanity, going forward. That the Coalition could let a country slip away from under its own dictate and tear a new front unto Europe is not something that will go away lightly; and neither will the five million new mages created overnight from the Insurgency's stupidity. From over her thoughts she hears that there's talks of independence for Silesia \u2014 of real independence, this time around \u2014 and for a while worry crosses her mind: a nation full of mages, as industrialized as this, popping up in the heart of the Old Continent is nothing to scoff at. There will surely be many who will not be happy about it \u2014 that is unless Poland and the new Silesia, whatever form it may take, will be able to forget their grudges, of course.</p>\n<p>Well: it's not like it'll be her problem to fix, anyhow. She has long since given up caring about petty national squabbles.</p>\n<p>She has heard all that she wants to hear. She turns the TV off before it gets too deep into her mind. The screen goes black again, and once more a reflection of \u015awito\u0144 comes to greet her: but this time there is no adrenaline of survival, no smugness of victory. There is only Anna \u015awito\u0144 \u2014 a broken woman older than the world she's come to inherit, breathing only thanks to a machine she can no longer hope to understand.</p>\n<p>For the first time in ages, the weight of her life falls upon her shoulders, and with it so does a realization: she is no longer a warrior, and she is no longer a leader. She is an old hag whose treatment will cost her company more than she is worth as an asset.</p>\n<p>Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep.</p>\n<p>At first comes anger \u2014 unjustified but nevertheless righteous \u2014 that they would ever dare put someone else in her place. It'll probably be some earring-wearing faggot, she fumes through tightened lips, who has never seen war but is fluent in Adamic or Errikeshan and has hair colorful enough to fit in with the Fae recruits. Someone new and fresh to be put in place of someone like her, a relic of times long-gone, and\u2014</p>\n<p>And then comes clarity, and with it \u2014 understanding. Understanding that, however it will not hurt, this will be good for her. That this is the last chance she will ever get at living a decade more \u2014 that this is the only way her story can end not under the foot of some soldier manufactured with sensibilities that don't remember a time before Yugoslavia.</p>\n<p>She lets herself fall deeper into the bed.</p>\n<p>She has enough saved up in offshore accounts that this forced retirement will not be a problem \u2014 whether or not she has little enough ego, she supposes only time will tell.</p>\n<p>For a moment, she stares at the cold concrete ceiling, taking in each of the breaths that she was allowed to have. Then she calms her thoughts, ready for rest \u2014 she will need it.</p>\n<p>Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep.</p>\n<p><em>Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep.</em></p>\n<p>Anna \u015awito\u0144 closes her eyes, and with her goes to sleep a memory of an age of magic and war and duty that will never see the light of day again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><strong>Foundation Civil War</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>THEN</strong></span></p>\n<p>\u2014 \u25cf \u2014</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"CI-GOC.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bedlam/CI-GOC.jpg\"/>\n<p>The secretary stood at the head of the long, makeshift table, her hands trembling so violently that the single sheet of paper she had just read aloud rattled like dry leaves in the wind. She looked small, diminished by the weight of the words she had spoken.</p>\n<p>Every pair of eyes in the stifling warehouse was drilled into her \u2014 a collective gaze of hatred, paranoia, and bone-deep exhaustion. There was complete and utter silence in the air. Though she had placed the letter on the table, invisible suffocating shackles kept her paralyzed in the spot. She was like a gazelle that had stumbled into a den of starving lions.</p>\n<p>Eventually, one of the men in a lab coat seated on the right flank of the table \u2014 Julian Roy \u2014 pushed his chair back. The scrape of metal legs against concrete sounded like a gunshot. He stood, smoothing the front of a lab coat and offered a sharp, dismissive nod to the secretary \u2014 a silent permission to return to her workstation. The woman immediately seized this privilege with relief.</p>\n<p>Roy turned to the assembly.</p>\n<p>\"It is a forgery, naturally,\" he declared, his voice possessing the distinct scholarly certainty. \"I am certain of it. This is theater. Yet another desperate provocation by the Overseers to sow discord among us. It is the only rational explanation. We must attempt to re-establish contact\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Rational?\"</p>\n<p>The word cut through the air, interrupting the professor mid-sentence. A man in a military uniform rose from the opposite side of the table. His demeanor commanded jingoistic respect, but beneath his facade of gravitas lay a long-accumulated rage.</p>\n<p>\"With your rational, you justified earlier plans that failed, doctor. So how can you be certain of that?\" the Officer demanded.</p>\n<p>His voice rippled through the room, and at once a terrible silence fell upon it: there was only those two men, eying each other from across the table with the kind of resolve reserved only for dying beasts. Had it not been for the <em>khamsin</em> beating mercilessly against the windows of the Cairo warehouse, the bystanders were certain that they would be able to hear their raging hearts, their ragged breaths.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Julian replied: \"Just look at it. It's ridiculous. It's nonsense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Armstrong was right from the start,\" the Officer spat, leaning over the table. \"We cannot trust the United Nations. They are infiltrated by commies and sympathizers. Of course they will defend the Overseers. We should have listened to General Armstrong. We should contact the US Army immediately. Old Stan Bowe would support our\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Bowe is a rabid dog currently on the Overseers' leash. And your savior Armstrong is rotting away in some hell hole in South America.\" Roy snapped, losing his cool veneer for a fraction of a second.</p>\n<p>The Officer looked Roy up and down, eyes narrowing into slits. He raised his chin, looking down at the scientist with the palpable contempt.</p>\n<p>\"Weren't you the first to preach about creating a New Order? About <em>determining the future of humankind</em>? And now you want to sell us to those UN bureaucrats?\" The man approached the scientist, dangerously closing the space between them. \"How do we know it isn't <em>you</em> who sold us in exchange for amnesty, you little <em>rat</em>\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"That's enough!\" The Engineer's voice rippled through the warehouse. At once, all eyes were on him. \"That's enough.\" He looked at the Officer. \"Stop this insanity. It's a ridiculous farce.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>I</em> do not care what your reasoning is. There is already too little of us left. We do not need further division.\"</p>\n<p>For just a moment, both men stopped paying attention only to themselves and <em>looked</em> around \u2014 and then saw that their leader was right.</p>\n<p>There was maybe dozen of them sitting at the table, all holed up in the last place that they could still call safe. There used to be more, during the first sessions of the Delta Command, but those days had long passed. They were no longer a bulwark against the Foundation \u2014 they were a flock, lost amidst a desert, and they were are all looking at the Officer, standing there like a raging bull. They were all looking at the duo without as much as uttering a word \u2014 there was only consternation and deep hidden uncertainty where he would expect resolve.</p>\n<p>The sight made both of them back down; slowly returning to their reserved seats, and turning their sight towards the Engineer. However, neither of them would admit defeat; both were opposing unstoppable forces. They both sat in silence giving the Engineer his floor.</p>\n<p>He nodded in quiet appreciation. \"It does not matter whether that letter is real or not. It could just as well be fake\u2014\" He looked at Roy silently. \"\u2014but it does not change the fact that we have failed to ally ourselves with the Coalition. We must learn to live in this world, and act accordingly.\"</p>\n<p>He cleared his throat, and eyed all of the gathered. Roy couldn't tell what it was that he saw in the gesture \u2014 whether it was an attempt to buy time or to get their spirit up, not like it mattered \u2014 but for a while the Engineer just looked at them, the leaders of the strongest cells still standing. Of the only ones strong enough not to had been culled by the blades of the Foundation.</p>\n<p>\"It is clear to me that the situation that we had found ourselves in is not one we had envisioned,\" he said, putting his hands behind his back. \"But this does not mean that it is lost. It does not mean that it is wasted.</p>\n<p>\"No; there is still a long way ahead of us. A way that will be filled with hardship, no doubt, but one from which I am certain we will emerge victorious. We did not win this battle, this attempted coup, but wars have been won with worse odds \u2014 wars built on causes far less pure than ours.</p>\n<p>\"I need you to stay strong, my friends. I need you to remain by my side for after each storm always come calm waters \u2014 and we are nothing if not experienced sailors. We will still steer this boat right into the harbour of victory, I assure each one of you, but the only way to do so is <em>together</em>. Only with a crew that rows alongside each other can we make it \u2014 and we will make it, of that I am sure. It is only a matter of time, a matter of our own determination, until truth triumphs over evil.</p>\n<p>\"This is how it has always been, and this is how it will be again.\"</p>\n<p>A woman in a lab coat was the first one to speak up. \"So how are we to proceed?\" she asked, looking at those seated next to her. \"What is our plan forward?\"</p>\n<p>Before the Engineer got a chance to say anything, Julian tapped his fingers against the table. \"It is clear to me that we cannot continue to solely rely on our military power. If we have not bested the Foundation yet, we will certainly not do so now. We <em>need</em> to diversify our efforts\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"And turn ourselves into town preachers?\" the silenced Officer asked.</p>\n<p>\"No, I'm just saying that if we speak only of the gun we will be seen as\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"As what? We are already seen as not worthy of the Coalition's attention!\" came another voice. \"Maybe it's because of talk like this that they treat us like a joke, like a\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2014You <em>fucking</em>\u2014\"</p>\n<p>All at once, the room exploded, drowning in a torrent of voices coming from mouths fully aware that they had gambled their life on an altar of righteousness, ready to do anything not to surrender to the fate they had inevitably sentenced themselves to.</p>\n<p>For the Engineer of the Insurgency, however, that inevitable fate brought a paralyzing clarity. He realized, finally, the profound foolishness of his decision. He had sacrificed his life for a cause that was supposed to bring him Heaven, but brought nothing. A cause he had built not for ideology, as he had told them, but for the power it would give him. For the might and honor that he would receive, finally surpassing the shadow of his uncle's own position.</p>\n<p>It was a decision from which there was, truly, no turning back.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><strong>Silesia</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>NOW</strong></span></p>\n<p>\u2014 \u25cf \u2014</p>\n<img alt=\"Prison.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bedlam/Prison.jpg\"/></div>\n<p>The New Engineer has not seen the light of the Sun in many days \u2014 he expects it'll be many more before he is granted that comfort again.</p>\n<p>He wouldn't have it any other way.</p>\n<p>This is good, he knows, for darkness is a friend to truth, to revolution \u2014 change conspires in dark alleyways and in basements hidden beneath bustling cities. To live and die in its shadow is an honor; the man who walks when it's still bright has nothing to hide. And a man who has nothing to hide is a man ready to die complacent. Ready to die <em>cattle</em>. And here, in a concrete cell deep enough under the Hague to be mistaken for a cave, he has plenty of shade to become a friend to.</p>\n<p>He almost laughs. The fools. <em>The fools</em>.</p>\n<p>Again the cosmopolitan hydra of the Coalition has shown the true colors of its idiocy \u2014 once more it has proven before the whole world that it lacks the conviction or indeed strength needed to be the guide of humanity. Had it the balls to bear its weapons with the might required it would have taken him there and then, putting a bullet between his eyes before he could blink; but the idiots that they are, they will give him a trial \u2014 a trial! They will grant him an audience before the whole world, one ready to listen to a truth that will free it from the chains of cosmopolitanism and insanity. They will grant him an audience to capture and rapture \u2014 an audience to turn into the vessels for his revolution.</p>\n<p>Yes, he can already see it, as clear as day \u2014 billions around the world picking up the red banner of the Insurgency, his name on their lips, and\u2014</p>\n<p>He coughs hard enough to nearly spit out his lungs, and at once insanity gives place to fear. The neurons bleeding the hallucinogenic in his brain stop for just a second, and in that second the remaining high wears off \u2014 the last particle of the faux-Engine's fungi leaves his blood, and with it his soul. His eyes snap back open, seeing everything for what it really is, and he feels his heart beating in an irregular, terrible rhythm.</p>\n<p>A pain unlike anything he can remember splits his temples, and the guidance of prophetic providence leaves him, once and for all. He blinks twice, and consciousness takes back control of his body, at last robbed of its ambrosia.</p>\n<p>He feels the world again. He feels the <em>cold</em> again.</p>\n<p>Terrified out of his mind from the newfound clarity, he starts to shake. Neither the blanket they have provided him with nor the rays of sunlight that he notices for the first time in days help with it; there is only a great chill now, deep in his mind and deep in his bones, and he remembers everything.</p>\n<p>He remembers the Witch, he remembers the General, and he remembers the Rat.</p>\n<p>He remembers the fists of the city coming down upon him; he remembers his loss at the altar of weakness.</p>\n<p>At once, his heart begins beating faster, and the fear turns to <em>rage</em> \u2014 the only thing that can still keep him alive, bereft of the spores which have fed him truth for the last six months. Rage that, were he a different man, he would see is coming from within himself <em>at</em> himself \u2014 but he is Nathan Lee Simmons, and he is the New Engineer. The only fault in his movement that he can see is the weakness of others; the cowardice of their humanity and the frailty of their plurality.</p>\n<p>And oh how much of this weakness he can remember. His mind does not need to wander far to find all the seams creaking in his life against his effort and indeed against his will: first those traitors from PENTAGRAM, the ones who promised him glory and normalcy and <em>freedom</em> but gave only excuses and mockery and servitude. He remembers the fading light in the eyes of those who they allowed to man their bases \u2014 the disgust that he felt looking at what the organization he had hoped would help save first America and then the world had let infiltrate its ranks. Then, another image comes: this time of the Insurgency itself \u2014 of all the other cells that were not under his command, yet another image of decadence, their mission and truth led astray by the <em><a href=\"/sc-05-321-05-335\">thing</a></em> that they let take up their crown. The <em>thing</em> to the lie of which he himself has surrendered for many, many years. And then, at the very last, a flash of the tall woman all in black, her tie and suit yet another broken promise of support for his cause, her money a lie that\u2014</p>\n<p>Another wave of shivers hits him, this time strong enough to make his whole body spasm and fall from the bed and onto the floor. He does not get up for what feels like hours. He is unable to.</p>\n<p>He just lies there, more worm than man now, and stares at the walls of his prison. He stares until from the farthest depths of solitude comes a realization: that it does not matter that he is here. That it does not matter what judgment they render upon him in the week to come; that it is of no significance anymore whether he hangs or is left to rot in some cold waste until his heart gives out. He has already left his mark. He has already left his spark.</p>\n<p>It isn't quite madness that overcomes him again \u2014 for without the spores he is but a defeated, broken man \u2014 but the sensation nevertheless heats him up enough to regain his composure. He sees now, that he has cast forward his truth the second he decided Silesia needed to be free \u2014 that even though he was beaten and caged, that for which he stands for they cannot contain, they cannot kill. The word has been spread, and with it an eternal promise was given to the world; just like when Napoleon came upon Europe and shown the eternal light of pride to the whole continent, so did the New Engineer bring forward a revelation. A revelation that the Coalition is not immortal, and neither is its status quo \u2014 that the world needs naught but a push to fall back onto the right tracks; to fall back into the embrace of the dignity that the new order has so desperately tried to rob it of.</p>\n<p>His truth is here, and just like the truth of those who came before him it is here to stay.</p>\n<p>Those who will follow in his footsteps \u2014 and he does not doubt there will be many, now that those fools have made him the most significant man alive \u2014 will not be the same as him and will certainly not wear the same shoes, but they will find the same path. They will find the outlines of his work, and they will build from there \u2014 and they will find a way back into civility. A way back into dignity and a way back into a world built not on insanity but on the same values the civilization of Man has always relied on.</p>\n<p>And they will not be able to get them all, once the fire spreads. They will not be able to silence the great voice that will come as an echo of his own, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014and again his whole body spasms, screaming to be reunited with the substance which has kept it alive for so long. A sharp tear passes through each of his muscles, then his nerves, and he no longer feels his hands and he no longer feels his legs. There is only a great and terrible craving, one which overtakes all of his civility and all of his instinct.</p>\n<p>The last clear thought that he remembers having, before the hunger overrides him with strength enough to make him but an animal for the hours to come, is the image of a great cerulean banner, consumed by a flame redder and more tumultuous than anything he can imagine.</p>\n<p><em>The Insurgency is dead.

Its streets and bazaars pulsed with commerce, music, and endless chatter, yet a shadow of uncertainty lingered all over the city. In spite of the recent victories, the Kingdom of Egypt had thrown itself into the Arab League war against the newly declared State of Israel, but the campaign had already revealed cracks in both the League's unity and King Farouk's grand political ambitions. Whispers of corruption and incompetence among the highest of echelons eroded the country, reinforcing the popular discontent with the still lingering influence of the Great Powers, their eyes focused on nothing but the Suez jewel in their crown.\n\n\n\nIt was never merely a waterway -- it was the greatest achievement of empire, carved into the very flesh of Egypt itself. While the dreams of the Pharaohs and the Caesars had once scratched at these sands to irrigate their crops, it was the machinery of modern imperialism that paved the way for the construction of a canal on an unprecedented scale. The desire for the Orient's riches literally tore through the desert with the hands of tens of thousands of local fellahin and imported labour, consumed by exhaustion, typhoid, and cholera. Many nameless, forgotten victims sacrificed upon the altar of the Great Powers, whose looming presence still reigned through the passing steel titans.\n\n\n\nIndeed: in a land wounded by many a scars, the need for radical change was brewing, and though it would take years still until one of the many groups would make it manifest under its own dictate, for now it was there to stay.\n\n\n\nYet beneath the surface of mundane struggles of governments and kings, something much greater lurked restless. Cairo -- long a refuge for various reprobates, revolutionaries, and philosophers of the seen and the unseen -- had become a stage where hidden forces gathered. In smoky caf\u00e9s and discreet salons, where politics mixed with espionage and the occult, intrigues ran deeper than the newspapers for commoners had dared print. And in this moment of uncertainty, in this moment of a breath painfully held, the city had been chosen as the meeting ground for a faction in a conflict far older, stranger, and infinitely more dangerous than the wars of men -- one that was soon to decide the fates of both sides of the Veil, whether they liked it or not.\n\n\n\nAnd here it came: under a scorching sun, a luxury Bentley rolled to a halt outside a warehouse in the industrial suburbs of Shubr\u0101 al-Khaymah, just north of the capital. Its polished novelty stood in stark contrast to the grit of factory smoke and harshness of the desert climate. \n\n\n\nThe two armed soldiers standing nearby -- dressed in British-style uniforms to avoid suspicion -- were already prepared for its arrival; they had been expecting it for many hours at this point. They straightened out their postures for one final time, and tightened the grips on their guns.\n\n\n\nMuch was at stake today. The wheels set in motion over the last few months -- countless meetings, setting up networks of sympathisers, plans and preparations -- reached their conclusion in this unassuming place. What was required of them was nothing less than perfection. \n\n\n\nThe last of the dust settled from under the car's tires, and from inside the vehicle stepped out a European man, his immaculate suit shifting as he adjusted the lapel. At once, the soldiers snapped to attention, saluting with rigid precision.\n\n\n\n\"The session has already begun, sir,\" one of them reported, voice clipped and mechanical.\n\n\n\nThe guest did not answer; instead, his eyes swept over the pair with quiet scrutiny, a wordless command to proceed. Without hesitation, the soldiers pulled open the heavy warehouse doors. \n\n\n\nThe place had been chosen by him, intentionally, so that it would be larger than they could ever need -- far from a surprise, given its previous occupation -- but as he stepped into the main hall proper, he realized that he might have miscalculated his original assessment. The voices of all the gathered thundered across the warehouse with enough might and fervour that one would be forgiven for thinking that the place was, indeed, full.\n\n\n\n\"\u2014Which is exactly why we //need// a new mode of operations, better than that of the Overseers! The reforms of the [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Directive]]] are insufficient, which I have always vocally expressed, and now, with a clear break, we will find allies behind our cause to\u2014\" He recognized the voice of Dr. Elizabeth Tate, Vice Chair of the Ethics Committee in all but intent.\n\n\n\nThe man also recognized the person who interrupted her: it was impossible to mistake the tall, sturdy fellow, tight military clothing all around his sun-burnt skin, for anyone but General Joseph Armstrong, second in command of the Foundation's armed forces. \"And what, let anarchy reign? Let another occult war break out? It is //exactly these reforms// which are a prime example of this very incompetence!\"\n\n\n\nHis military prowess was met with murmurs of approval throughout the room.\n\n\n\n\"Joseph is partially correct, though he stops short of the necessary conclusion,\" this time, it was Dr. Julian Roy of the Department of Ontokinetics who spoke, with much less vigor but equal confidence as the preceding speaker. \"Though we cannot parrot the old modus operandi, it is clear that we also cannot fully subvert it. If we are to determine the future of the human race, we cannot be fettered by the fear of //going too far//. Only with a clear path forward, not limited by any\u2014\"\n\n\n\nThe man finally cleared his throat, seizing the opportunity in the discussion.\n\n\n\n\"Gentlemen\u2014\" At once, all eyes were on him. \"\u2014and ladies.\" He nodded at those present, and walked slowly towards the triangular table, towards the only chair still missing its occupant. He took his seat, and eyed everyone who was there to join him.\n\n\n\nThere was much more of them than he had dared hope. He refused the urge to smile. \n\n\n\nGood. Very good. \n\n\n\nHe had feared that most who had first joined their scheme would prove cowards when push came to shove, but from what he could see, all of them were present. All those who had declared loyalty to their cause when they had first begun putting their plan together had carried through their plans as intended, //and// also actually shown up. He was almost impressed.\n\n\n\n\"I am somewhat surprised to see that you had begun without me, but I will take that as only a sign of your enthusiasm to our cause.\" A few chuckles came as a response. He put his hands together, and continued, \"Now, before we begin, I hope I must not say this: as of this very moment, you are all committed to our movement. There is no going back.\"\n\n\n\nAs if on command, they all nodded. He was right -- all around the globe, the research centers and Sites and Areas which had been their homes for so long were aflame by a fire of their own design. They had struck fast and hard, setting the Foundation's assets loose and planting charges were necessary, and they took Overwatch by surprise. A surprise that had, just as they had expected, turned the Overseers' attention away from its oriental fronts and onto the mainland, right where his companions were not -- a perfect opportunity to meet and organize before they could strike again, this time for good.\n\n\n\nThey were all certain of their cause, all those who surrounded the man -- he could see the common thread of doubt uniting them all, no matter their different backgrounds and ethnicities and indeed plans for how they were to proceed. He could see the disillusionment at the Foundation's decadence, resulting in its inability to stop another Great War of the mundane and occult varieties; at its growing inability to stand as a bulwark against darkness. At its weakness, made manifest in its willingness to bend under the push of the new age that was to come.\n\n\n\n\"As of today's morning, you have all become traitors to the SCP Foundation. Your superiors and subordinates may not yet realize this, but you must know that this is what you are. You cannot return. You will never be a part of that organization again.\"\n\n\n\nA few loud cheers and bangs against the table followed. He could see the common spirit overtake them: the name and moniker under which they had gathered had stuck. The new Delta Command, a declaration of its intention to change the world already in its name, was taking shape faster than he had expected. Faster, certainly, than he had ever dreamt; that all the hardened types that made it up, mostly of the military type, could organize like this with each other was almost a miracle.\n\n\n\n\"But, if we play the hand we had taken right, the Foundation will not stand for much longer.\" He cleared his throat again, and gestured to the nearby soldier to come forward. He complied, bringing with him a suitcase full of documents. The soldier presented them to the man, and he grabbed the manilla folder, throwing it onto the table with great strength, with great determination. \"Our declaration of war has already been prepared, and come evening, it shall be sent to all places within the organization that still matter.\"\n\n\n\nAnd he was right -- laying there in front of them all was a letter, a manifesto, his own moniker and the numbers for which he stood signed right at the bottom of them. The mantle of the Engineer, of the creator of a new structured order that was to come after their victory, stood proudly in red letters below what they had to say. What they had to protest, against the joke that the Foundation had become. He would never use his own name, of course -- although some officers accepted entrusting command to the nephew of Foundation Overseer Three, Gabriel Miller, he still had to win over the rest -- but oh how he could wait until he would. The look on that old monster's face once they take their Site-01 by force and replace them, ready to steer the organization back onto proper tracks, will be nothing short of marvelous.\n\n\n\n\"You have already stricken fear into their hearts with our first move. They will not resist paranoia, and they will not resist slopiness. And we will be ready.\"\n\n\n\nThe soldier from before took out more folders, this time putting one copy before each of the gathered.\n\n\n\n\"What you will find inside is the role each of you will play in the upcoming week. Our first step had already taken them off guard -- we do not need much to push the already off-kilter //thing// which the Foundation had become into full chaos. We do not need much to scatter their attention and strike right in the heart of their treacherous, delusional rule -- the very same heart which they still think remains hidden to us.\"\n\n\n\nHe could see the excitement in the eyes of his new subjects turn into full on fortitude right as he said those words. He could see that, in this very moment, they would go with him to hell and back -- all in a last ditch effort to bring the organization they had dedicated their life to from falling away from their grip. From falling away into change.\n\n\n\n\"We will strike and we will succeed, taking their thrones for ourselves to share. And when we are done, dear friends\u2014\" He clasped his hands. \"\u2014we shall again change the world.\"\n\n\n\nThunderous applause followed the second he stopped speaking. For a moment, he let himself bask in the glory, standing up and eyeing them enthusiastically. He only stopped once he noticed a single, frail hand rising at the edge of the table. He nodded at the participant, then sat back up.\n\n\n\n\"...And what will we do after?\" asked harshly Elizabeth Tate. \"Would it not be better to draft up our plans now, so that we could present a clear case to what shall remain, once we take over? So that we may drive more to our side with reason?\"\n\n\n\nShe had always been the most uncertain element of this coalition -- too idealistic, too willing to grant points and men to [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|communist bookfuckers]]] -- but that wasn't a concern for now. Now, a united front against the Overseers was all that mattered, and every potential ally had to be on board.\n\n\n\nThe Engineer only smiled apologetically, and waved his hand. \"My friend, we may have wisdom now, but it is a narrow one -- it is a view that might be clear, yes, but one that does not yet see the full extent of the duty that shall be bequeathed to us. One not yet baptised in the fire to come.\n\n\n\n\"The foundations that this organization was built upon are putrid, rotten. We cannot hope to build anything that will last, that will endure, from that which we are already given. We cannot hope to find clarity in the ways for which it stands -- there, we will only find madness.\n\n\n\n\"No, there is no saving that which exists now. No way to find a clear path forward amidst all of their decadence. We are united by the shared understanding that the Overseers tarnished the Foundation's potential -- that their incompetence led to the tragedy of the Second World War and its occult side. There is no way to find a road upon which humanity could walk together, for a future that we were robbed of the second it decided to bend and break.\n\n\n\n\"But that which shall withstand the fire will prove pure and great; it will prove strong and resilient. It will prove //true//, for all of man to see. It will prove final and unbroken -- an order that we shall at last return to.\n\n\n\n\"And only from those ashes shall we build a new way, a new law: one that will be great and righteous. One that will be eternal. And one that will be unbroken, no matter what comes its way.\"\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[size 175%]]**Silesia**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**NOW**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n-- \u25cf --\n\n\n\n[[image Spodek.jpg class=\"image\"]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nT-plus fifteen minutes after Heaven falls down, they drag him out by his feet, kicking and screaming. They drag him out into the evening breeze, for all the world to see.\n\n\n\nHe curses them out in a language that both speak but neither was born with, but his words would be of no impact even if the two soldiers were natives. He has lost his might and he has lost his army -- he has remained great only in title. Today, right when history is decided, the New Engineer -- what a grand moniker for such a little boy -- is barely a man. Today, he shares the streets with the rats he so desperately despises.\n\n\n\nAnd one of the rats is there indeed, to witness his final humiliation: slowly but surely, Ry'hle Kiera walks out of the ruined Saucer, a cigarette right between his two bloodied fingertips. Its smoke joins the thick thaumic cloud pouring out of his back, and he grins. He grins, but he does not give the enemy fallen before him the dignity of acknowledgment -- he turns the gesture towards the soldiers which he knows are there to take the New Engineer.\n\n\n\nFor a while, they stand there, the three of them, and they exchange glances. There is no respect in the gesture, but there is an understanding: both the Coalition gun and the A.R.G.U.S. wizard know that the battle they've won, but most certainly not the war. It is the twenty-first century, and if something happens in this grand, unknown world, it is recorded and televised and put unto the shared digital psychosis for all eleven-point-half billion people on Earth to see -- the escape and humiliation of their leaders was no different. There's footage -- and if there's footage, there's outrage.\n\n\n\nThey have already lost their face and they have already lost their honor -- the least they can do is hang on to the facsimile they've created: the facsimile that they're peacekeepers that took up their arms for the good of Silesia. That they were here to liberate and not control -- that they were here here for the people, and not for their own status quo.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the twenty-first century: here it comes right before them. A camera drone -- unVeiled, Kiera figures? -- slowly moves down, finally free to traverse the sky above Katowice now that the Insurgency was shot and left out to bleed in a puddle of its own piss. The drone is looking directly at the three, and the soldiers understand that this is their cue: the scrantonite manacles snap around the New Engineer's hands, tying down his magic once and for all.\n\n\n\nA red light turns on, then hovers for a few seconds, and the drone flies off, its bounty right in its digital claws.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt in the minds of the three men that this photo will be remembered for decades to come.\n\n\n\nKiera takes another drag, breathing a sigh of relief for the first time in six months, and he turns his eyes, filled with wartorn exhaustion, towards the skyline. It is tranquil again. He does not remember when it was last so. There is still movement in the distance, the last sons of the Insurgency shot and stabbed and turned to viscera, but before long the sun will go down and Silesia will go to sleep without fearing for its own children.\n\n\n\nHe exhales again, this time towards the two soldiers.\n\n\n\nBeneath them three, the New Engineer babbles incoherently, switching from English to German to Polish to something else that neither can quite make out -- he shouts how this isn't over, only his head moving up from the ground he is pinned down to, and he screams about a fire and about ashes and after a while Kiera tunes it all out. Even when the Insurgent looks at him directly, cursing him out and blabbering on, he turns his eyes back to the two men who actually matter here.\n\n\n\nAgain a pregnant silence overtakes them, but is soon broken up by the soldiers nodding towards Kiera. Another acknowledgment falls: that this is his city, fair and square, and that this is his Silesia. They have fought for it under the pretense of propriety and they have lost.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing more to be said and there is nothing more to be done. The cards are no longer theirs to give out -- they will deal with the hand that they will be given when the time comes.\n\n\n\nSmoke falls from between Kiera's lips, and as it goes up and up, it is broken up by the rotors of the Coalition helicopter, here to take the New Engineer and deliver him to a trial whose verdict was already decided.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[size 175%]]**Foundation Civil War**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**THEN**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n-- \u25cf --\n\n\n\n[[image Paraguay.jpg class=\"image\"]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nIf Joseph Armstrong were to say which animal he was most similar to, he would have to invoke the name of the wolf.\n\n\n\nEverything that he had achieved in his life he had won through strength, through violence -- through power made manifest first in his fists, then in his bullets, and at last in his orders. He was a hunter, through and through, and he had known nothing but force for all of his life. Over the many winters he had survived it had shaped him into a sturdy man, a resilient man; one who would stand no matter the circumstances and certainly no matter the enemy. One who would see the pack subservient to him make it through, no matter the blood and no matter the sweat.\n\n\n\nHe fancied himself an alpha, one who would not back down from any fight or any challenge -- right now, though, he lived more like a fox. More like a mouse, a rat, a disgusting piece of vermin that had scuttled away and hidden from its own dignity.\n\n\n\nCowering away in a Paraguayan cave or basement or run-down factory or whatever other nonsense it was this week was certainly not his idea of a fight, of a war. Not his idea of buying time and not his idea of retreating until another chance presented itself.\n\n\n\nBut none of this mattered: just like a true wolf, he would make do. He had to.\n\n\n\nHe sighed, the dampness of the half-abandoned shack heavy on his lungs, and went back to cutting what they could barely call vegetables back into the pot.\n\n\n\nThere were maybe thirty other men with him down here, all of them what little remained of his unit, and he didn't need any words to see that they too were starving. Had he more energy left in him, he would be furious -- but he had to save what was still left, so that their night escapades into the nearby warehouses and forests and clearings to gather whatever they could find would be successful. He could not afford to be wasteful; he had to do what which he had always done best, and conserve.\n\n\n\nThis is not how he had imagined it would all go. Not when they had first come together to form their Insurgency, not when they had gathered in Cairo to lay out a precise plan for the coup. Everything had gone smoothly at first\u00a0\u00a0-- the Foundation's leadership had been paralyzed by uncertain internal loyalty, the swift takeover of its facilities, their acquisition of hundreds of anomalous artifacts, and the sabotage of its infrastructure -- but then came the fateful assault on Site-01. The event that had tested the internal strengths and affiliations of the Insurgency. The event that had revealed its internal cracks for the whole world to see. The event that had forced them to retreat, losing more and more ground to the Overseers, hiding until a moment could come. \n\n\n\nOne which //would// inevitably come, he was sure -- between the rising tensions of the Cold War and internal pressure inside the Foundation building up like never before, they all knew that their time would sooner or later come again. That it would come and grant them victory at last, victory long since awaited and victory long since earned: victory promised and victory prophetic. Victory complete, for a final, perfect order to be thrust upon the world.\n\n\n\nHe just wished it would come sooner than later -- that they didn't have to hide away there, this far from civilization, until the Foundation's counteroffensive loses momentum. That they did not have to waste away in goddamned Paraguay out of all places. That they could again be warriors, again be victors, and not waste away like cowards.\n\n\n\nArmstrong was aware of the grim truth: although no one wanted to admit it yet, they had lost this battle. There was no other way to put it. The rest of Delta Command believed in the false hope that a magical divine army would come and save them, salvaging their attempt to regicide the Overseers. But he knew that their mistakes were too deep to be salavaged, this far into the war.\n\n\n\nStill: it was not nearly as bad as it could have been, of this he was certain. The recent changes in their haven -- partially the reason why they had chosen Paraguay -- made it the tiniest bit more bearable to stay here. The recent victory of [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_Civil_War_(1947)|steady strong-arm rule over the Reds]]] mostly kept away the insanity Armstrong so desperately despised at bay. It also gave him the opportunity to meet many officers and young general of German descent who, just like Armstrong, knew and respected strength.\n\n\n\nArmstrong blinked twice, snapping back into relative reality, and took a taste of the thing brewing in the pot before him. Although they had the blessing of the local junta, everything was done under the table, so they were on their own. The soup tasted just as tart as it always had, but it was also hot and liquid and that was all that they needed, this far into their withdrawal. Besides: it had the mushrooms in them. They would help the Insurgents pass the time.\n\n\n\nArmstrong's men had first found them up west, when their trudge through Bolivia had taken them through mountains and caves and ravines. There, at the bottom of the continent and at the bottom of their desperation, they found the last hope that could save them from starvation: patches of mushrooms, growing deep, deep in caves far beyond the reach of light and man. They tasted worse -- and far more alien, nothing like Armstrong had ever tasted, [[[scp-7600|almost as if they were not of this cave and certainly not of this continent]]] -- than the pain growling in their stomachs, but they had to carry on, and the fungi made for an unexpectedly full meal. \n\n\n\nBut they did so much more, too. They showed Armstrong and his men images, glorious visions -- promises that had given them far more energy to remain in the fight than the food did.\n\n\n\nFrom that point on they had decided that they needed the mushrooms to remain in the fold, to remain in the struggle; that the fungi continued to sprout along their path down south felt almost like a sign from god himself that they were just. Like some miracle sent specifically to grant them hope amidst greatest desperation. They gathered as many as they could and they had eaten and Seen regularly since then, to remain high on spirit -- and tonight, it would be no different.\n\n\n\nThe clay bowl felt heavy under Armstrong's tired arms. He looked upon it, his heavy reflection greeting him from the thick liquid. He did not sigh, though he much wanted to. He did not look at his companions, either -- he did not need to know that they were already drowning in their own myths of the near future.\n\n\n\nHe took a breath, and drank the liquid whole.\n\n\n\nIt did not take long for the visions to come.\n\n\n\nThey were familiar at first, much more so than he had hoped: shifting like shadow, shifting like the wind. He saw his days of glory under the arm of the regime, under the Foundation as the leader of their Alpha-1. He saw again all the vermin that they had [[[carroll-022-the-last-stand|weeded out]]] during his tenure as soldier and commander -- he saw the strength they were allowed to wield back when his superiors had still not yet turned into cowards. He saw the fire and felt again the weight of the gun; he bled out the wounds and stitched up the scars, and he stood back up, his mind and soul shifting, ready to accept that which he would become.\n\n\n\nAnd the world again fell on him, throwing him sideways and into conflict -- he saw again the halls of Site-01, the cold concrete lined with his dead. Once more he saw the blood and the shame and the pain, so much pain, and he was not General but Victim, but Martyr, sentenced to watch as his men die under the blades of those of the Red Right Hand who have Remained and Survived. He again saw Overseer Three, strangling his own kin without any hesitation whatsoever, and he again saw the plane coming down upon the hidden clearing, ready to take them to fight and die another day. Ready to take them back to shame -- shame that washed upon him and took him down, down to an abyss so dark that inside it he could barely see.\n\n\n\nBut again see he did, this time shown a path he had not yet seen before. One paved with chanting and one paved with red, so much red, waving in the background as they all saluted in his name. Long live the Insurgency, they all shouted, long live the Engineer and the General. And they all meant it, too -- he could see it in the fervour in their eyes, in the pins that they all have clipped to their coats and dresses and shirts. He could see it in the way that they stood up for him and his Engineer and his cause and brought about an era of reason and strength, rooting out the weakness and cowardice and contrast right by its stems, their path paving over all remnants of the Foundation and the Hand and the Company, and--\n\n\n\nFor a moment, he forgot how to breathe.\n\n\n\nHe then took his spoon back up and dug into the almost-empty pot for whatever still remained, shoving the food right into his mouth over and over until nothing was left.\n\n\n\nHe never noticed the fire under the pot go out; he was already back in his dreams, ready to see that which he was sure would inevitably await him.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[size 175%]]**Silesia**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**NOW**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n-- \u25cf --\n\n\n\n[[image Hospital.jpg class=\"image\"]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nThe first thing that Anna \u015awito\u0144 remembers is the words, their pressure breaking through the blinding light and right into her brain, kickstarting it back into existence.\n\n\n\nThe second thing that she remembers is their meaning.\n\n\n\n\"//Z drogi!//\" shouts a woman whose voice \u015awito\u0144 cannot quite place, both young and old at the same time, pushing the stretchers forward, always forward.

She dreams of great mountains, great deserts, great steppes and great forests -- all withering away but not quite dying under an eternal tomb as a cloud larger than life overtakes them all. She dreams of thunder rolling forward, its echo rippling like feminine laughter; she dreams of a two-pronged wound first in the world and then in herself, the planet's oceans filled with blood that isn't just hers. She dreams of a crown of thorns and and gold and bone, put upon the temple of She Who Will Remain, and--\n\n\n\n--and then another bright light comes, plunging her from the darkness and back into existence.\n\n\n\nThe Yeren coughs, looking her straight in those glass eyes, and he renders his verdict.\n\n\n\nHe tells her that she will never walk again and that she will never cast again -- that it will be a miracle if she makes it out from under the IV. He tells her that never again will she see battle and that she is only laying here thanks to the miracles built from metal and crystal that made up more of her body than flesh did. He tells her that, unless she listens, she will die.\n\n\n\nThis is not news to her. She has heard these words more times than she can count -- she does not doubt she will hear them many times more.\n\n\n\nStill: she nods in understanding, knowing the right buttons to push, until the doctor heads towards another victim of this battle, leaving her alone in the twenty square meter room. Only the empty chair, the beeping of the thing she owes her life to, and the boxy TV -- they know she likes it old-fashioned -- remain as her companions.\n\n\n\nFor a while she just lies there, enjoying the beating of her own heart. Then, inevitably, she sighs with a ragged breath, and turns the TV on. She has already witnessed the truth herself, on the frontlines of the conflict: she is curious what sensation the world will spin it into.\n\n\n\nFor hours she listens as they speak of tragedy and speak of loss; she listens as they give statistics and interviews and as they render judgment on an oh so clear-and-cut case. She looks as they show her in battle, breaking those little Insurgents one by one during her ascent, and for a while she almost smiles -- right until they say that the Coalition has began its withdrawal alongside A.R.G.U.S. and the Witch Slayers, leaving the no longer Chaotic ruins of Silesia to those still willing to dwell inside.\n\n\n\nSo that's how it ends -- with a battle she's fought and won, only for it to be surrendered from one insanity unto another.\n\n\n\nShe sighs again. Such is life; if nothing before broke her, neither will this.\n\n\n\nFor a while, she wonders whether or not they will call it the Eight Occult War, once the dust settles and intellectualism veers its parasitic tendrils into the politics; whether the Coalition will have the balls necessary to admit defeat in one of its missions and acknowledge this final milestone upon their end of history. But then she understands: if the [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/krew-proch-i-wrzosy British Civil War], another Greek-Turkish bloodshed, or any other of the minor post-Veil smirkishes were refused this moniker, so will this one.\n\n\n\nAnd history will move on.\n\n\n\nStill: whether or not the Silesian Insurrection will be given the honor of carrying the mantle of the Eight, she does not doubt that it will be a turning point for humanity, going forward. That the Coalition could let a country slip away from under its own dictate and tear a new front unto Europe is not something that will go away lightly; and neither will the five million new mages created overnight from the Insurgency's stupidity. From over her thoughts she hears that there's talks of independence for Silesia -- of real independence, this time around -- and for a while worry crosses her mind: a nation full of mages, as industrialized as this, popping up in the heart of the Old Continent is nothing to scoff at. There will surely be many who will not be happy about it -- that is unless Poland and the new Silesia, whatever form it may take, will be able to forget their grudges, of course.\n\n\n\nWell: it's not like it'll be her problem to fix, anyhow. She has long since given up caring about petty national squabbles.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe has heard all that she wants to hear. She turns the TV off before it gets too deep into her mind.

She looked small, diminished by the weight of the words she had spoken.\n\n\n\nEvery pair of eyes in the stifling warehouse was drilled into her -- a collective gaze of hatred, paranoia, and bone-deep exhaustion. There was complete and utter silence in the air. Though she had placed the letter on the table, invisible suffocating shackles kept her paralyzed in the spot. She was like a gazelle that had stumbled into a den of starving lions.\n\n\n\nEventually, one of the men in a lab coat seated on the right flank of the table -- Julian Roy -- pushed his chair back. The scrape of metal legs against concrete sounded like a gunshot. He stood, smoothing the front of a lab coat and offered a sharp, dismissive nod to the secretary -- a silent permission to return to her workstation. The woman immediately seized this privilege with relief.\n\n\n\nRoy turned to the assembly. \n\n\n\n\"It is a forgery, naturally,\" he declared, his voice possessing the distinct scholarly certainty. \"I am certain of it. This is theater. Yet another desperate provocation by the Overseers to sow discord among us. It is the only rational explanation. We must attempt to re-establish contact--\"\n\n\n\n\"Rational?\"\n\n\n\nThe word cut through the air, interrupting the professor mid-sentence. A man in a military uniform rose from the opposite side of the table. His demeanor commanded jingoistic respect, but beneath his facade of gravitas lay a long-accumulated rage.\n\n\n\n\"With your rational, you justified earlier plans that failed, doctor. So how can you be certain of that?\" the Officer demanded.\n\n\n\nHis voice rippled through the room, and at once a terrible silence fell upon it: there was only those two men, eying each other from across the table with the kind of resolve reserved only for dying beasts. Had it not been for the //khamsin// beating mercilessly against the windows of the Cairo warehouse, the bystanders were certain that they would be able to hear their raging hearts, their ragged breaths.\n\n\n\nEventually, Julian replied: \"Just look at it. It's ridiculous. It's nonsense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Armstrong was right from the start,\" the Officer spat, leaning over the table. \"We cannot trust the United Nations. They are infiltrated by commies and sympathizers. Of course they will defend the Overseers. We should have listened to General Armstrong. We should contact the US Army immediately. Old Stan Bowe would support our--\"\n\n\n\n\"Bowe is a rabid dog currently on the Overseers' leash. And your savior Armstrong is rotting away in some hell hole in South America.\" Roy snapped, losing his cool veneer for a fraction of a second.\n\n\n\nThe Officer looked Roy up and down, eyes narrowing into slits. He raised his chin, looking down at the scientist with the palpable contempt.\n\n\n\n\"Weren't you the first to preach about creating a New Order? About //determining the future of humankind//? And now you want to sell us to those UN bureaucrats?\" The man approached the scientist, dangerously closing the space between them. \"How do we know it isn't //you// who sold us in exchange for amnesty, you little //rat//--\"\n\n\n\n\"That's enough!\" The Engineer's voice rippled through the warehouse. At once, all eyes were on him. \"That's enough.\" He looked at the Officer. \"Stop this insanity. It's a ridiculous farce.\"\n\n\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\n\n\"//I// do not care what your reasoning is. There is already too little of us left. We do not need further division.\"\n\n\n\nFor just a moment, both men stopped paying attention only to themselves and //looked// around -- and then saw that their leader was right.\n\n\n\nThere was maybe dozen of them sitting at the table, all holed up in the last place that they could still call safe. There used to be more, during the first sessions of the Delta Command, but those days had long passed. They were no longer a bulwark against the Foundation -- they were a flock, lost amidst a desert, and they were are all looking at the Officer, standing there like a raging bull. They were all looking at the duo without as much as uttering a word -- there was only consternation and deep hidden uncertainty where he would expect resolve.\n\n\n\nThe sight made both of them back down; slowly returning to their reserved seats, and turning their sight towards the Engineer. However, neither of them would admit defeat; both were opposing unstoppable forces. They both sat in silence giving the Engineer his floor.\n\n\n\nHe nodded in quiet appreciation. \"It does not matter whether that letter is real or not. It could just as well be fake\u2014\" He looked at Roy silently. \"\u2014but it does not change the fact that we have failed to ally ourselves with the Coalition. We must learn to live in this world, and act accordingly.\"\n\n\n\nHe cleared his throat, and eyed all of the gathered. Roy couldn't tell what it was that he saw in the gesture -- whether it was an attempt to buy time or to get their spirit up, not like it mattered -- but for a while the Engineer just looked at them, the leaders of the strongest cells still standing. Of the only ones strong enough not to had been culled by the blades of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\"It is clear to me that the situation that we had found ourselves in is not one we had envisioned,\" he said, putting his hands behind his back. \"But this does not mean that it is lost. It does not mean that it is wasted.\n\n\n\n\"No; there is still a long way ahead of us. A way that will be filled with hardship, no doubt, but one from which I am certain we will emerge victorious. We did not win this battle, this attempted coup, but wars have been won with worse odds -- wars built on causes far less pure than ours.\n\n\n\n\"I need you to stay strong, my friends. I need you to remain by my side for after each storm always come calm waters -- and we are nothing if not experienced sailors. We will still steer this boat right into the harbour of victory, I assure each one of you, but the only way to do so is //together//. Only with a crew that rows alongside each other can we make it -- and we will make it, of that I am sure. It is only a matter of time, a matter of our own determination, until truth triumphs over evil.\n\n\n\n\"This is how it has always been, and this is how it will be again.\"\n\n\n\nA woman in a lab coat was the first one to speak up. \"So how are we to proceed?\" she asked, looking at those seated next to her. \"What is our plan forward?\"\n\n\n\nBefore the Engineer got a chance to say anything, Julian tapped his fingers against the table. \"It is clear to me that we cannot continue to solely rely on our military power. If we have not bested the Foundation yet, we will certainly not do so now. We //need// to diversify our efforts--\"\n\n\n\n\"And turn ourselves into town preachers?\" the silenced Officer asked.\n\n\n\n\"No, I'm just saying that if we speak only of the gun we will be seen as--\"\n\n\n\n\"As what? We are already seen as not worthy of the Coalition's attention!\" came another voice. \"Maybe it's because of talk like this that they treat us like a joke, like a--\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2014You //fucking//\u2014\"\n\n\n\nAll at once, the room exploded, drowning in a torrent of voices coming from mouths fully aware that they had gambled their life on an altar of righteousness, ready to do anything not to surrender to the fate they had inevitably sentenced themselves to.\n\n\n\nFor the Engineer of the Insurgency, however, that inevitable fate brought a paralyzing clarity. He realized, finally, the profound foolishness of his decision. He had sacrificed his life for a cause that was supposed to bring him Heaven, but brought nothing. A cause he had built not for ideology, as he had told them, but for the power it would give him. For the might and honor that he would receive, finally surpassing the shadow of his uncle's own position.\n\n\n\nIt was a decision from which there was, truly, no turning back.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[size 175%]]**Silesia**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**NOW**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n-- \u25cf --\n\n\n\n[[image Prison.jpg class=\"image\"]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nThe New Engineer has not seen the light of the Sun in many days -- he expects it'll be many more before he is granted that comfort again.\n\n\n\nHe wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\n\nThis is good, he knows, for darkness is a friend to truth, to revolution -- change conspires in dark alleyways and in basements hidden beneath bustling cities. To live and die in its shadow is an honor; the man who walks when it's still bright has nothing to hide. And a man who has nothing to hide is a man ready to die complacent. Ready to die //cattle//. And here, in a concrete cell deep enough under the Hague to be mistaken for a cave, he has plenty of shade to become a friend to. \n\n\n\nHe almost laughs. The fools. //The fools//.\n\n\n\nAgain the cosmopolitan hydra of the Coalition has shown the true colors of its idiocy -- once more it has proven before the whole world that it lacks the conviction or indeed strength needed to be the guide of humanity. Had it the balls to bear its weapons with the might required it would have taken him there and then, putting a bullet between his eyes before he could blink; but the idiots that they are, they will give him a trial -- a trial! They will grant him an audience before the whole world, one ready to listen to a truth that will free it from the chains of cosmopolitanism and insanity. They will grant him an audience to capture and rapture -- an audience to turn into the vessels for his revolution.\n\n\n\nYes, he can already see it, as clear as day -- billions around the world picking up the red banner of the Insurgency, his name on their lips, and--\n\n\n\nHe coughs hard enough to nearly spit out his lungs, and at once insanity gives place to fear. The neurons bleeding the hallucinogenic in his brain stop for just a second, and in that second the remaining high wears off -- the last particle of the faux-Engine's fungi leaves his blood, and with it his soul. His eyes snap back open, seeing everything for what it really is, and he feels his heart beating in an irregular, terrible rhythm.\n\n\n\nA pain unlike anything he can remember splits his temples, and the guidance of prophetic providence leaves him, once and for all. He blinks twice, and consciousness takes back control of his body, at last robbed of its ambrosia.\n\n\n\nHe feels the world again. He feels the //cold// again. \n\n\n\nTerrified out of his mind from the newfound clarity, he starts to shake. Neither the blanket they have provided him with nor the rays of sunlight that he notices for the first time in days help with it; there is only a great chill now, deep in his mind and deep in his bones, and he remembers everything.\n\n\n\nHe remembers the Witch, he remembers the General, and he remembers the Rat.\n\n\n\nHe remembers the fists of the city coming down upon him; he remembers his loss at the altar of weakness.\n\n\n\nAt once, his heart begins beating faster, and the fear turns to //rage// -- the only thing that can still keep him alive, bereft of the spores which have fed him truth for the last six months. Rage that, were he a different man, he would see is coming from within himself //at// himself -- but he is Nathan Lee Simmons,\u00a0\u00a0and he is the New Engineer. The only fault in his movement that he can see is the weakness of others; the cowardice of their humanity and the frailty of their plurality.\n\n\n\nAnd oh how much of this weakness he can remember. His mind does not need to wander far to find all the seams creaking in his life against his effort and indeed against his will: first those traitors from PENTAGRAM, the ones who promised him glory and normalcy and //freedom// but gave only excuses and mockery and servitude. He remembers the fading light in the eyes of those who they allowed to man their bases -- the disgust that he felt looking at what the organization he had hoped would help save first America and then the world had let infiltrate its ranks. Then, another image comes: this time of the Insurgency itself -- of all the other cells that were not under his command, yet another image of decadence, their mission and truth led astray by the //[[[sc-05-321-05-335|thing]]]// that they let take up their crown. The //thing// to the lie of which he himself has surrendered for many, many years. And then, at the very last, a flash of the tall woman all in black, her tie and suit yet another broken promise of support for his cause, her money a lie that--\n\n\n\nAnother wave of shivers hits him, this time strong enough to make his whole body spasm and fall from the bed and onto the floor. He does not get up for what feels like hours. He is unable to.\n\n\n\nHe just lies there, more worm than man now, and stares at the walls of his prison. He stares until from the farthest depths of solitude comes a realization: that it does not matter that he is here. That it does not matter what judgment they render upon him in the week to come; that it is of no significance anymore whether he hangs or is left to rot in some cold waste until his heart gives out. He has already left his mark. He has already left his spark.\n\n\n\nIt isn't quite madness that overcomes him again -- for without the spores he is but a defeated, broken man -- but the sensation nevertheless heats him up enough to regain his composure. He sees now, that he has cast forward his truth the second he decided Silesia needed to be free -- that even though he was beaten and caged, that for which he stands for they cannot contain, they cannot kill. The word has been spread, and with it an eternal promise was given to the world; just like when Napoleon came upon Europe and shown the eternal light of pride to the whole continent, so did the New Engineer bring forward a revelation. A revelation that the Coalition is not immortal, and neither is its status quo -- that the world needs naught but a push to fall back onto the right tracks; to fall back into the embrace of the dignity that the new order has so desperately tried to rob it of.\n\n\n\nHis truth is here, and just like the truth of those who came before him it is here to stay.\n\n\n\nThose who will follow in his footsteps -- and he does not doubt there will be many, now that those fools have made him the most significant man alive -- will not be the same as him and will certainly not wear the same shoes, but they will find the same path. They will find the outlines of his work, and they will build from there -- and they will find a way back into civility. A way back into dignity and a way back into a world built not on insanity but on the same values the civilization of Man has always relied on.\n\n\n\nAnd they will not be able to get them all, once the fire spreads. They will not be able to silence the great voice that will come as an echo of his own, and--\n\n\n\n--and again his whole body spasms, screaming to be reunited with the substance which has kept it alive for so long. A sharp tear passes through each of his muscles, then his nerves, and he no longer feels his hands and he no longer feels his legs. There is only a great and terrible craving, one which overtakes all of his civility and all of his instinct.\n\n\n\nThe last clear thought that he remembers having, before the hunger overrides him with strength enough to make him but an animal for the hours to come, is the image of a great cerulean banner, consumed by a flame redder and more tumultuous than anything he can imagine.\n\n\n\n//The Insurgency is dead.

The most serious orphan source incident in mundane history was the Goi\u00e2nia accident, which occurred when a cesium-137 radiation source was stolen from an abandoned radiotherapy clinic in Brazil; four people died, and two hundred and fifty were exposed to significant levels of radiation.</p>\n<p>The Chanhassen Catastrophe claimed more lives in the first thirty seconds.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ionizing radiation sources are all, broadly speaking, the same. You need a radioactive isotope; you need a container to hold it; you need shielding around that container. Every source of thanatic energy is different. They are born from tragedies, hundreds or thousands of deaths at the same place or time; the only attempts to systematize their creation have been prosecuted as crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>They are not as rare as one would hope.</p>\n<p>Nearly every battle of the Second World War created a thanatic source, the death-energy concentrating around a particular totem: an officer's ancestral katana, a tank crew's lucky charm, or a particularly bloodthirsty general's corn-cob pipe.

Exposure to the Volga Core can turn a healthy living human into a walking corpse in less than fifteen seconds. It was originally kept as part of the Soviet Union's paraweapon stockpile by the KGB Division of Special Circumstances; its current whereabouts are unknown, and it may be in the hands of the criminal organization known as \"Scarlet Hammer\".</p>\n<p>The thanatic source that caused the Chanhassen Catastrophe was not nearly that powerful. Originally recovered from the site of the Civil War Battle of Stones River, the Chanhassen source was a human femur from the body of Union Army Lieutenant Jeremiah Hackwell. It was engraved with an array of focusing sigils by the 19th-century scientist and necromancer Archibald Gravestone, one of the founders of Prometheus Labs, and further modified with inset silver circuitry by Prometheus Medical thanaturges. It was, as these things go, safe to be around; if undamaged, the Chanhassen source would take over a week of passive exposure to kill a healthy adult.</p>\n<p>You will note that there are four variables in that sentence: \"undamaged\", \"passive\", \"healthy\" and \"adult\".

It has a population of approximately twenty-five thousand, and is home to the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum; the Temple of Eck, headquarters of the new-age religious movement Eckankar; and Paisley Park, the former estate of the late musician Prince, now a recording studio and museum. It was also home to Athanasia Radiology, the Prometheus Medical subsidiary which conducted thanatotherapy trials in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Athanasia Radiology did not make it through the paratech crash, and shuttered its doors in 1997. All the mundane radiation sources were removed during the company's liquidation; Lieutenant Hackwell's femur was not. It remained untouched in a basement storage room for a quarter of a century, slightly lowering the life expectancy of the abandoned laboratory's rodent population and occasionally reanimating an insect. And there it would have stayed, if not for the intervention of a group of local teens.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>On October 31st, 2023, around 10:30 PM, a group of six Chanhassen High School seniors broke in to the Athanasia Radiology facility on a dare. All the teenagers were mildly intoxicated, and two of them had smoked a small amount of cannabis. One of those two, Keith Dahl, had also consumed a dose of psilocybin mushrooms; unbeknownst to him, this psychedelic experience had awakened his latent thaumaturgic talent.</p>\n<p>The ringleader, Mike Nelson, led the group into the basement, intending to hold a seance. The storage room containing the Chanhassen source was chosen, as it had the \"spookiest vibes\", and the teenagers soon found the source, deciding to use it as a prop for their seance. They lit candles, attempted to invoke the spirits of the dead, and passed around the femur. When Keith Dahl was given the femur, and called out to the spirit of its former owner, the Chanhassen Catastrophe began.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the framework of Universal Thaumatology, there are three components to any thaumatological working (or, in layman's terms, a spell): energy, action, and will. Energy is given purpose by the caster's will and form by their action. Purpose guides form, leading to change. In the case of Keith Dahl's accidental working, the energy was the thanatic power of the Chanhassen source; the action was his invocation of Lieutenant Hackwell's spirit; and the will was his own desire to, in his own words, \"see some spooky Halloween shit\". The result of this malformed spell was predictably disastrous.</p>\n<p>First: the summoning succeeded. Jeremiah Hackwell's shade was conjured up from Hell, the Tartarean realm where it had resided for the past 160 years. He was disoriented and only semi-sapient.

With a Loose weave, we expect backlash of around 75% the original intensity, or approximately 1.8 Kilocaspers. Hue goes from Sapphire to Lemon, reducing the blatancy of the effect; pitch goes from Sharp to Flat, resulting in a destructive effect. The Chanhassen source's inlaid circuitry was partially destroyed by a burst of heat, and as a result, the source began actively and uncontrollably emitting thanatic energy, killing and reanimating all six teenagers.</p>\n<p>Secondary backlash occured with an intensity of about 1.25 Kilocaspers, and the same hue and pitch as the original spell. This bound the ghost of Jeremiah Hackwell into the Chanhassen source, and the ghost of Keith Dahl into his own reanimated corpse, allowing him to regain control of his body; the ghosts of the remaining teenagers were too weak to survive the binding, and dissipated.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Post-mortem sapience is possible for most thaumaturges, given sufficient study of the necromantic arts, but rarely desireable. Even the most powerful ghosts are limited by their existence as energy constructs, unable to work magic without destabilizing their animating essence and damaging their own memories. Revenants, like the unfortunate Mr. Dahl, are slightly hardier, and can safely cast spells using external EVE sources, but they require expensive chemical treatments and regular embalming sessions to stave off decay. Most mages simply prefer to die, and leave their legacy to their heirs.</p>\n<p>Keith Dahl was luckier than most revenants, in that his body was in near-perfect condition; thanatic energy kills by interrupting metabolic processes, much like cyanide, leading to cell death without gross tissue damage. He had yet to realize that he was dead. His first reaction, upon regaining consciousness and seeing the corpses of his friends, was to call 911. The tertiary backlash (subtle, destructive) of his accidental spell had damaged his cell phone, but his friend Mary Anderson's was still functional, and he made the call. An ambulance was sent to the abandoned laboratory, followed by a Carver County sheriff's deputy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Mr. Dahl made his way out of the basement to wait for emergency services, still holding the Chanhassen source. The ambulance arrived first, and the EMTs, Carlos Gutierrez and Julie Vang, quickly identified Mr. Dahl's lack of any vital signs. Given his continued animation, the human bone still clutched in his left hand, and the date, they decided to \"get the fuck out before [they] got zombified too.\" They gave him a space blanket and a hand warmer, and fled the scene. This saved their lives.</p>\n<p>Deputy Eli Johanssen was not so lucky. He had been warned about Mr. Dahl's undead nature by the paramedics, and came out of his squad car with his pistol drawn. Unfortunately, Carver County sheriff's uniforms are grey, and Jeremiah Hackwell's bound spirit was startled. Believing Deputy Johanssen to be a member of the Confederate Army, Hackwell used his nascent control over the Chanhassen source to shoot a focused beam of thanatic energy at Deputy Johanssen's heart, killing him instantly.</p>\n<p>At this point, Mr. Dahl fled back into the abandoned laboratory with the Chanhassen source. His decision to hide, rather than to make his way into town in search of medical attention or an authority figure, likely saved many lives. Within two hours, alerted by keywords in local law enforcement radio transmissions, Moblie Task Force Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\") had arrived on the scene, and quickly contained Mr. Dahl and the Chanhassen source.</p>\n<p>At his request, Mr. Dahl's spirit was banished after a brief interview; his body and the bodies of his friends were deanimated and returned to their families for burial. Standard cover story CO-3, \"Carbon Monoxide Inhalation,\" was disseminated to the press. The EMTs, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Vang, were amnesticized and implanted with false memories of discovering the bodies of the children and the sheriff's deputy in the laboratory basement. The Chanhassen source is classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is contained in a lead-lined containment locker at Storage Site-23.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>There are three primary lessons to be learned from the Chanhassen Catastrophe.</p>\n<p>First, that paratechnology must be contained. If the Athanasia Radiology clinic had been located in a paranormal enclave such as Three Portlands, it is likely that the Chanhassen Source would not have been abandoned in the first place; and if it had, anyone who encountered it would have been better equipped to recognize it as a dangerous occult artifact. The spread of paratechnology into unveiled society is dangerous, and preventing that spread is one of the primary purposes of the Foundation; nexuses and freeports are the lesser of two evils.</p>\n<p>Second, that thaumatology is inherently dangerous. Even operatives of the Global Occult Coalition sometimes fail to sufficiently account for backlash; if the best-trained occultists in the world can be killed by an unmanaged spell, self-trained civilian thaumaturges stand no chance. The Coalition's near-monopoly on thaumatological education probably causes more good than harm, at least for now, but the Foundation, in the interest of public safety and the continuity of humanity, has a duty to contain or eliminate any thaumaturges not affiliated with the GOC.</p>\n<p>And finally, that civilian cowardice saves lives. The EMTs immediately left the scene when they realized that Mr. Dahl's condition was anomalous; after the death of Deputy Johanssen, Mr. Dahl himself hid from further human contact. Both these actions prevented deaths, and more could have been prevented if Mr. Dahl and his friends had been too scared to enter the abandoned laboratory in the first place. Foundation social engineering programs since the end of the Cold War have done an admirable job at maintaining high levels of fear and anxiety in the American populace, and consistently prove their worth; if adolescent male bravado can be further tempered, it is estimated that civilian contact with the anomalous could be reduced by up to 15%. A scared populace is a quiet populace.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/dig-u-better-dead\">Dig U Better Dead</a>\" by ch00bakka, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The tertiary backlash (subtle, destructive) of his accidental spell had damaged his cell phone, but his friend Mary Anderson's was still functional, and he made the call. An ambulance was sent to the abandoned laboratory, followed by a Carver County sheriff's deputy. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMr. Dahl made his way out of the basement to wait for emergency services, still holding the Chanhassen source. The ambulance arrived first, and the EMTs, Carlos Gutierrez and Julie Vang, quickly identified Mr. Dahl's lack of any vital signs. Given his continued animation, the human bone still clutched in his left hand, and the date, they decided to \"get the fuck out before [they] got zombified too.\" They gave him a space blanket and a hand warmer, and fled the scene. This saved their lives. \n\n\n\nDeputy Eli Johanssen was not so lucky. He had been warned about Mr. Dahl's undead nature by the paramedics, and came out of his squad car with his pistol drawn. Unfortunately, Carver County sheriff's uniforms are grey, and Jeremiah Hackwell's bound spirit was startled. Believing Deputy Johanssen to be a member of the Confederate Army, Hackwell used his nascent control over the Chanhassen source to shoot a focused beam of thanatic energy at Deputy Johanssen's heart, killing him instantly. \n\n\n\nAt this point, Mr. Dahl fled back into the abandoned laboratory with the Chanhassen source. His decision to hide, rather than to make his way into town in search of medical attention or an authority figure, likely saved many lives. Within two hours, alerted by keywords in local law enforcement radio transmissions, Moblie Task Force Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\") had arrived on the scene, and quickly contained Mr. Dahl and the Chanhassen source. \n\n\n\nAt his request, Mr. Dahl's spirit was banished after a brief interview; his body and the bodies of his friends were deanimated and returned to their families for burial. Standard cover story CO-3, \"Carbon Monoxide Inhalation,\" was disseminated to the press. The EMTs, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Vang, were amnesticized and implanted with false memories of discovering the bodies of the children and the sheriff's deputy in the laboratory basement. The Chanhassen source is classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and is contained in a lead-lined containment locker at Storage Site-23.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThere are three primary lessons to be learned from the Chanhassen Catastrophe. \n\n\n\nFirst, that paratechnology must be contained. If the Athanasia Radiology clinic had been located in a paranormal enclave such as Three Portlands, it is likely that the Chanhassen Source would not have been abandoned in the first place; and if it had, anyone who encountered it would have been better equipped to recognize it as a dangerous occult artifact. The spread of paratechnology into unveiled society is dangerous, and preventing that spread is one of the primary purposes of the Foundation; nexuses and freeports are the lesser of two evils.\n\n\n\nSecond, that thaumatology is inherently dangerous. Even operatives of the Global Occult Coalition sometimes fail to sufficiently account for backlash; if the best-trained occultists in the world can be killed by an unmanaged spell, self-trained civilian thaumaturges stand no chance. The Coalition's near-monopoly on thaumatological education probably causes more good than harm, at least for now, but the Foundation, in the interest of public safety and the continuity of humanity, has a duty to contain or eliminate any thaumaturges not affiliated with the GOC. \n\n\n\nAnd finally, that civilian cowardice saves lives. The EMTs immediately left the scene when they realized that Mr. Dahl's condition was anomalous; after the death of Deputy Johanssen, Mr. Dahl himself hid from further human contact. Both these actions prevented deaths, and more could have been prevented if Mr. Dahl and his friends had been too scared to enter the abandoned laboratory in the first place. Foundation social engineering programs since the end of the Cold War have done an admirable job at maintaining high levels of fear and anxiety in the American populace, and consistently prove their worth; if adolescent male bravado can be further tempered, it is estimated that civilian contact with the anomalous could be reduced by up to 15%. A scared populace is a quiet populace.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "ghost", "halloween", "no-dialogue", "prometheus", "tale", "third-law"], "title": "Dig U Better Dead - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dig-u-better-dead", "year": 2026}, "digital-woe": {"created_at": "2026-01-19T11:12:00", "creator": "softseal", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "softseal", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/softseal", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Due to the high employee turnover, it wouldn't open until August 3rd, 1894. Despite this delay, the town of Millwood welcomed their new train station with open arms and a celebration. While the station boosted the town's economy, this prosperity would be short-lived.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 08/12/16 (Fri) 02:10:21 #83921963</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>On August 10th, 1894, a week after the Millwood Station\u2019s opening, Charles would begin to exhibit odd behaviors that were unusual even for him.

In a journal entry, a railroad officer claimed to have seen him wandering near the station at night.</p>\n<p>Charles would go missing briefly from September 21st until October 5th of the same year, when he arrived at Millwood's police station. There, Arthur Moore, the town's detective, took him for a brief statement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Listen here, you can make fun of me <em>all</em> you want. I don't care what you or anyone else in this town thinks of me. But heed my warning, don't follow the tracks. If you do, may God have mercy on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After further questioning, Arthur would release Charles from police custody. He would go missing again three days later on October 8th, 1894. This time, Charles would never return, and here's where it gets interesting.

In one particular account, Charles dismissed an employee following a disagreement over work hours.\n\n\n\nThe Millwood Station was originally scheduled to open on May 21st, 1894. Due to the high employee turnover, it wouldn't open until August 3rd, 1894. Despite this delay, the town of Millwood welcomed their new train station with open arms and a celebration. While the station boosted the town's economy, this prosperity would be short-lived.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 08/12/16 (Fri) 02:10:21 #83921963\n\n----\n\nOn August 10th, 1894, a week after the Millwood Station\u2019s opening, Charles would begin to exhibit odd behaviors that were unusual even for him. According to the residents, he would lock himself in his house during the day, never coming out even for groceries. In a journal entry, a railroad officer claimed to have seen him wandering near the station at night.\n\n\n\nCharles would go missing briefly from September 21st until October 5th of the same year, when he arrived at Millwood's police station. There, Arthur Moore, the town's detective, took him for a brief statement.\n\n\n\n> Listen here, you can make fun of me //all// you want. I don't care what you or anyone else in this town thinks of me. But heed my warning, don't follow the tracks. If you do, may God have mercy on you.\n\n\n\nAfter further questioning, Arthur would release Charles from police custody. He would go missing again three days later on October 8th, 1894. This time, Charles would never return, and here's where it gets interesting. Just a week later, on October 15th, Arthur stopped showing up to work.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 08/12/16 (Fri) 02:45:59 #83921021\n\n----\n\nIn a letter addressed to his sister, according to his wife, Arthur didn\u2019t isolate himself in his home. Unlike Charles, Arthur would always be near the train tracks no matter the time of day. He never had a notepad, pen, or even the tobacco pipe he always carried around. Arthur would walk by the railroad, whistling for no purpose or cause.\n\n\n\nDespite his wife\u2019s efforts to return him home, Arthur would always go back to Millwood Station. He would then go missing on, November 3rd, 1894 and never be seen again. It was around this time people started to leave Millwood.\n\n\n\nToday, the town of Millwood and its railroad station remains as a historical site. Despite its evacuation, based on images, everything appears to be untouched. My roommate claimed it\u2019s like they never left.\n\n\n\nOn their website, the owners of the area dismiss these claims as rumors and have closed their reviews. However, according to multiple feedback sites, people claim to hear whistling down the tracks.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "art-exchange", "mystery", "parawatch", "tale"], "title": "Down The Tracks - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/down-the-tracks", "year": 2026}, "everything-in-its-right-place": {"created_at": "2026-01-01T22:49:00", "creator": "Doctor Cimmerian", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-01T22:49:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T05:07:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T05:07:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Her workday ended an hour ago. Cold LED lights hum.</p>\n<p>She taps her foot, refreshes her Foundation email inbox. It's Friday. No one is sending her messages after hours.</p>\n<p>The department's been in a bit of a mess recently. There aren't many staff members, so any absences cause a lot of work to shift around. She's seen it before. This time, everyone was kind enough to assign her as little of Ben Schultz's work as possible. It's the closest thing she gets to bereavement leave.</p>\n<p>He died 12 days ago. Major stroke. They found him on a park bench, told her he looked \"at peace.\" Quick, painless, he went the way everyone wants to go. Allegedly.</p>\n<p>Noam picks at the gunk under her nails. She checks the hallway. No one \u2014 even the janitor is out.</p>\n<div class=\"dossier\">\n<p>Exploring the limits of necromancy remains a long-term goal of the SCP Foundation. Necromadic communication has the potential to become a key source of intelligence for the Foundation as well as other veiled-world actors. As of January 1998, the Foundation's application of necromadic communication remains limited. Budgeting remains a key constraint given the ever-expanding cost of containing anomalies.</p>\n</div>\n<p>She'd brought someone back three days ago. Yussuf Ben-Saeed, an engineer who designed surveying data for anomalous geology. Prostate cancer. She'd never met him, but the Foundation gave her his file. Name, face, life story, correspondence with other staff, and a colored pencil drawing of him and his son. With a little familiarity and the proper equipment, she could find his fragments in the noosphere. Take what other people thought of him, piece those together, and you get an image of a human being sharp enough to compare to the noosphere's background radiation. There's residue of Ben-Saeed's conscious thought in that radiation, slowly decaying. The image lets you pick out the residue, and combining the residue with the image gives the most accurate reconstruction of their consciousness.</p>\n<p>She talked to his reconstruction for three hours. It's not <em>really</em> him, but it's good enough. The Foundation got the information they needed \u2014 the dead's expertise applied to whatever problem had stumped the living. And she got to go home after filling out the paperwork.</p>\n<div class=\"dossier\">\n<p>The Foundation's capacity for necromancy is also limited by our ability to recruit necromadic mediums. While existing Foundation faculty can be trained, only a select few meet the physiological requirements to be a medium.</p>\n<p>Most people are disqualified at birth, lacking the necessary type O- blood. Many more become ineligible due to environmental factors. What would otherwise be considered moderate levels of alcohol, lead, THC, mercury, opiates, and certain pesticides have been shown to sharply reduce necromadic potential. It is estimated that roughly 30% of all strains of influenza halt necromadic development outright.</p>\n<p>Because it is difficult to discreetly screen civilians for these risk factors, the Foundation instead screens Foundation staff with O- blood (as disclosed by staff in case of medical emergency) who refrain from alcohol and cannabis (as self-reported by staff members). Candidates who pass this screening are given partial training as necromadic mediums before being assessed on their performance.</p>\n<p>Candidates who perform significantly below the performance threshold are assumed to have an undetectable risk factor (such as pesticide consumption or viral infection) and are deemed ineligible. Candidates who pass the threshold are incentivized to transfer to the Department of Applied Necromancy via pay raise and/or through the Fire Suppression Department. Family members of a candidate who passes are also screened due to their increased likelihood of being viable mediums.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>I finish my lunch while Noam chats about football. I always eat slower than her, and the beef stir fry I made has too much salt, so I have to keep stopping to drink water. I get another glass and ask her if she wants to smoke a little before lunch is over. She says yes, as usual. It's the least I can do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"preclass\">\n<p>The cashier slides Noam's items across the scanner. Milk, eggs, oranges, chicken breast\u2014 \"How's your day been?\"</p>\n<p>There's a moment of silence where Noam hasn't realized that this question is for her, right here, right now. She snaps awake. \"I'm just looking forward to the weekend.\"</p>\n<p>\"That kind of week, huh?\" The cashier smiles. \"I'm off Wednesday and Thursday, so my weekend just ended.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hopefully you got to relax.\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I had to take my dog to the hospital\u2026\" She sees the way Noam is looking at her. \"He's fine. He's just\u2014 God, what a nightmare.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can imagine.\"</p>\n<p>A bottle of vanilla extract passes over the scanner. It's her last item.</p>\n<p>\"Do you want a receipt?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 No, thank you.\"</p>\n<p>The cashier crumples it in one hand, drops it into a trashcan with 139 other receipts.</p>\n<p>\"Have a nice day.\"</p>\n<p>\"You too!\"</p>\n<p>Soon, they will both forget this conversation. And yet, the cashier is one of only three people Noam will speak to that day. For the cashier, Noam is one of 120.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>\"Were you close?\"</p>\n<p>She exhales, turning the cigarette between her fingers. I can't tell if she's deliberating my question or distracting herself.</p>\n<p>\"He was an asshole. He yelled at me \u2014 a lot. More than at my mother. I didn't want to be like him, but-\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean, just because you worked the same job-\"</p>\n<p>\"-I know, I'm more than my fucking job. I only took it because he would be on the opposite side of the world.\"</p>\n<p>She takes a long drag. She's trying to hide how much it burns. I think trying not to cough makes her feel like a kid again.</p>\n<p>\"I don't even know what I want to say to him.\" She says, a wisp of smoke escaping off her tongue.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 Maybe you want him to apologize?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hah-\" Now she coughs. \"Do you want it to rain money? Of course I want him to apologize \u2014 I don't <em>(cough)</em> think it'll happen.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>She takes her personal laptop out of her bag. Setting it beside her office desktop. She has to push her office keyboard out of the way for everything to fit. The machine \u2014 the <em>1993 Necromadic Communication Device</em> \u2014 is already on the desk. It never leaves this room.</p>\n<p>The <em>NCD-93</em> is a beige rectangle the size of a first-aid kit. There are a few buttons, a switch, a latch, and an adjustable slot on the shape of a human hand. Inside of the slot are 12 retracted needles, ready to strike. It looks like a tech showcase, too sleek and featureless to be intuitive. She turns the plastic shell over in her hand, pops open the compartment in the back, pulls out a serial cable. She takes a short cable and a small, dense block of plastic out of her bag. The block has a serial port on one end and a USB port on the other. The cable is USB on both ends. The block goes onto the serial cable, then the USB cable into the block, then the cable into her personal laptop.</p>\n<p>She'd already put all the necessary software on this laptop. She'd nicked the CD-ROM four days ago, put it back a year before anyone else would need it. Now, she makes sure everything is set up correctly. Her mouse pauses over a single checkbox:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><tt><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">+--------------------------------------+</span></tt></strong><br/>\n<strong><tt><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">|     [ ] RECORD SESSION ACTIVITY?     |</span></tt></strong><br/>\n<strong><tt><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">+--------------------------------------+</span></tt></strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>She could have his words forever. She could create the most damning evidence possible. But she knows the Foundation is better at finding secrets than she is at hiding them, so what harm could more evidence do? She checks the box.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>\"Bring him\u2014 Christ, Noam, you can't be serious.\"</p>\n<p>A lazy cloud of smoke curls out of her mouth. She shrugs.</p>\n<p>\"They'll fire you! I mean, there'll be a whole tribunal!\"</p>\n<p>She watches the embers at the end of her cigarette. \"They're not going to fire me. Do you know how many mediums they have? Four.

We understand that mediums interface with the deceased through their residual imprints on the noosphere, but it's unclear how drawing blood from the medium aids this process. We understand that O- blood is more useful because it's universally compatible with the blood of the deceased, but it remains unclear why the blood type of the deceased is relevant when the noosphere is intangible. We understand that hands are relevant to the noosphere by proxy of their physical, social, and symbolic importance throughout all historic and contemporary human societies. However, it's unclear why necromancy is most effective when a medium's blood is drawn from their hand.</p>\n<p>Each component of necromancy can be explained by cryptobiology or noospherics. However, a unifying theory of necromancy (a so-called \"theory of everything\") would also have to unify cryptobiology and noospherics. This requires treating these fields as two interlocking systems rather than mutually exclusive explanations for anomalous behavior. Prevailing theories in both fields do not support this unification. While fringe theories that relate the two do exist, they present their own problems for necromancy.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A needle stabs her middle finger so quickly that it's out almost before it is in. She can feel her pulse there, her veins swelling slightly around the wound. But she can't think about that \u2014 she needs to think about him. His fragments are out there, spinning in the noosphere, rebounding off of ideas far more important and now more whole than he is. She can sense everyone holding onto him, the fragments slowly eroding. He is survived by four drinking buddies, a mouse that chewed a hole into his pantry, a lemon tree that lives in spite of his negligence, a neighbor who's noticed that the mail is piling up outside his door, a lady who saw him walk by two hours before the stroke and thought he was sexy, a cat which he pets on his Saturday morning walks, an ex-wife who hasn't spoken to him in over a decade, a mechanic he yelled at for giving him a deal that wasn't all that bad, the man at the hardware store he would always chat to about baseball, two cousins he would visit during the holidays, three crows, his physician, his optometrist, his cardiologist, and a daughter.</p>\n<p>She's done more with less.</p>\n<p>Two more needles had gone in and she didn't even notice.

Her workday ended an hour ago. Cold LED lights hum. \n\n\n\nShe taps her foot, refreshes her Foundation email inbox. It's Friday. No one is sending her messages after hours. \n\n\n\nThe department's been in a bit of a mess recently. There aren't many staff members, so any absences cause a lot of work to shift around. She's seen it before. This time, everyone was kind enough to assign her as little of Ben Schultz's work as possible. It's the closest thing she gets to bereavement leave.\n\n\n\nHe died 12 days ago. Major stroke. They found him on a park bench, told her he looked \"at peace.\" Quick, painless, he went the way everyone wants to go. Allegedly.\n\n\n\nNoam picks at the gunk under her nails. She checks the hallway. No one -- even the janitor is out.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dossier\"]]\n\nExploring the limits of necromancy remains a long-term goal of the SCP Foundation. Necromadic communication has the potential to become a key source of intelligence for the Foundation as well as other veiled-world actors. As of January 1998, the Foundation's application of necromadic communication remains limited. Budgeting remains a key constraint given the ever-expanding cost of containing anomalies. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nShe'd brought someone back three days ago. Yussuf Ben-Saeed, an engineer who designed surveying data for anomalous geology. Prostate cancer. She'd never met him, but the Foundation gave her his file. Name, face, life story, correspondence with other staff, and a colored pencil drawing of him and his son. With a little familiarity and the proper equipment, she could find his fragments in the noosphere. Take what other people thought of him, piece those together, and you get an image of a human being sharp enough to compare to the noosphere's background radiation. There's residue of Ben-Saeed's conscious thought in that radiation, slowly decaying. The image lets you pick out the residue, and combining the residue with the image gives the most accurate reconstruction of their consciousness. \n\n\n\nShe talked to his reconstruction for three hours. It's not //really// him, but it's good enough. The Foundation got the information they needed -- the dead's expertise applied to whatever problem had stumped the living. And she got to go home after filling out the paperwork. \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dossier\"]]\n\nThe Foundation's capacity for necromancy is also limited by our ability to recruit necromadic mediums. While existing Foundation faculty can be trained, only a select few meet the physiological requirements to be a medium. \n\n\n\nMost people are disqualified at birth, lacking the necessary type O- blood. Many more become ineligible due to environmental factors. What would otherwise be considered moderate levels of alcohol, lead, THC, mercury, opiates, and certain pesticides have been shown to sharply reduce necromadic potential. It is estimated that roughly 30% of all strains of influenza halt necromadic development outright. \n\n\n\nBecause it is difficult to discreetly screen civilians for these risk factors, the Foundation instead screens Foundation staff with O- blood (as disclosed by staff in case of medical emergency) who refrain from alcohol and cannabis (as self-reported by staff members). Candidates who pass this screening are given partial training as necromadic mediums before being assessed on their performance. \n\n\n\nCandidates who perform significantly below the performance threshold are assumed to have an undetectable risk factor (such as pesticide consumption or viral infection) and are deemed ineligible. Candidates who pass the threshold are incentivized to transfer to the Department of Applied Necromancy via pay raise and/or through the Fire Suppression Department. Family members of a candidate who passes are also screened due to their increased likelihood of being viable mediums.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nI finish my lunch while Noam chats about football. I always eat slower than her, and the beef stir fry I made has too much salt, so I have to keep stopping to drink water. I get another glass and ask her if she wants to smoke a little before lunch is over. She says yes, as usual. It's the least I can do.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"preclass\"]]\n\nThe cashier slides Noam's items across the scanner. Milk, eggs, oranges, chicken breast-- \"How's your day been?\"\n\n\n\nThere's a moment of silence where Noam hasn't realized that this question is for her, right here, right now. She snaps awake. \"I'm just looking forward to the weekend.\"\n\n\n\n\"That kind of week, huh?\" The cashier smiles. \"I'm off Wednesday and Thursday, so my weekend just ended.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully you got to relax.\"\n\n\n\n\"No. I had to take my dog to the hospital...\" She sees the way Noam is looking at her. \"He's fine. He's just-- God, what a nightmare.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can imagine.\"\n\n\n\nA bottle of vanilla extract passes over the scanner. It's her last item.\n\n\n\n\"Do you want a receipt?\"\n\n\n\n\"... No, thank you.\"\n\n\n\nThe cashier crumples it in one hand, drops it into a trashcan with 139 other receipts. \n\n\n\n\"Have a nice day.\"\n\n\n\n\"You too!\"\n\n\n\nSoon, they will both forget this conversation. And yet, the cashier is one of only three people Noam will speak to that day. For the cashier, Noam is one of 120.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\"Were you close?\"\n\n\n\nShe exhales, turning the cigarette between her fingers. I can't tell if she's deliberating my question or distracting herself.\n\n\n\n\"He was an asshole. He yelled at me -- a lot. More than at my mother. I didn't want to be like him, but-\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean, just because you worked the same job-\"\n\n\n\n\"-I know, I'm more than my fucking job. I only took it because he would be on the opposite side of the world.\"\n\n\n\nShe takes a long drag. She's trying to hide how much it burns. I think trying not to cough makes her feel like a kid again.\n\n\n\n\"I don't even know what I want to say to him.\" She says, a wisp of smoke escaping off her tongue.\n\n\n\n\"... Maybe you want him to apologize?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hah-\" Now she coughs. \"Do you want it to rain money? Of course I want him to apologize -- I don't //(cough)// think it'll happen.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nShe takes her personal laptop out of her bag. Setting it beside her office desktop. She has to push her office keyboard out of the way for everything to fit. The machine -- the //1993 Necromadic Communication Device// -- is already on the desk. It never leaves this room.\n\n\n\nThe //NCD-93// is a beige rectangle the size of a first-aid kit. There are a few buttons, a switch, a latch, and an adjustable slot on the shape of a human hand. Inside of the slot are 12 retracted needles, ready to strike. It looks like a tech showcase, too sleek and featureless to be intuitive. She turns the plastic shell over in her hand, pops open the compartment in the back, pulls out a serial cable. She takes a short cable and a small, dense block of plastic out of her bag. The block has a serial port on one end and a USB port on the other. The cable is USB on both ends. The block goes onto the serial cable, then the USB cable into the block, then the cable into her personal laptop.\n\n\n\nShe'd already put all the necessary software on this laptop. She'd nicked the CD-ROM four days ago, put it back a year before anyone else would need it. Now, she makes sure everything is set up correctly. Her mouse pauses over a single checkbox: \n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**{{@@+--------------------------------------+@@}}**\n\n**{{@@|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[ ] RECORD SESSION ACTIVITY?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|@@}}**\n\n**{{@@+--------------------------------------+@@}}**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nShe could have his words forever. She could create the most damning evidence possible. But she knows the Foundation is better at finding secrets than she is at hiding them, so what harm could more evidence do? She checks the box.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\"Bring him-- Christ, Noam, you can't be serious.\"\n\n\n\nA lazy cloud of smoke curls out of her mouth. She shrugs.\n\n\n\n\"They'll fire you! I mean, there'll be a whole tribunal!\"\n\n\n\nShe watches the embers at the end of her cigarette. \"They're not going to fire me. Do you know how many mediums they have? Four. That's //worldwide//... Used to be five...\" She glances at me, then off somewhere else. \"Even if they find out, they can't afford to get rid of me.\"\n\n\n\n\"But you don't know that for sure! I don't want you to throw your life away for-\" I can't bring myself to say it in front of her. //For your father. For someone who's already dead.// There's no combination of words that's salvageable. \"Please, just think about what's at stake here.\"\n\n\n\nA bird hops along the pavement below us, picks at the crumbs inside of a box of fries.\n\n\n\nNoam looks at me out of the corner of her eye before she turns inside. \"I'll think about it.\" And then, she's gone.\n\n\n\nLunch ended seven minutes ago. I ash my cigarette. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**{{@@+---------------------------+@@}}**\n\n**{{@@|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DEVICE WARMING...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|@@}}**\n\n**{{@@+---------------------------+@@}}**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nThe machine hums.

We understand that mediums interface with the deceased through their residual imprints on the noosphere, but it's unclear how drawing blood from the medium aids this process. We understand that O- blood is more useful because it's universally compatible with the blood of the deceased, but it remains unclear why the blood type of the deceased is relevant when the noosphere is intangible. We understand that hands are relevant to the noosphere by proxy of their physical, social, and symbolic importance throughout all historic and contemporary human societies. However, it's unclear why necromancy is most effective when a medium's blood is drawn from their hand.\n\n\n\nEach component of necromancy can be explained by cryptobiology or noospherics. However, a unifying theory of necromancy (a so-called \"theory of everything\") would also have to unify cryptobiology and noospherics. This requires treating these fields as two interlocking systems rather than mutually exclusive explanations for anomalous behavior. Prevailing theories in both fields do not support this unification. While fringe theories that relate the two do exist, they present their own problems for necromancy. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA needle stabs her middle finger so quickly that it's out almost before it is in. She can feel her pulse there, her veins swelling slightly around the wound. But she can't think about that -- she needs to think about him. His fragments are out there, spinning in the noosphere, rebounding off of ideas far more important and now more whole than he is. She can sense everyone holding onto him, the fragments slowly eroding. He is survived by four drinking buddies, a mouse that chewed a hole into his pantry, a lemon tree that lives in spite of his negligence, a neighbor who's noticed that the mail is piling up outside his door, a lady who saw him walk by two hours before the stroke and thought he was sexy, a cat which he pets on his Saturday morning walks, an ex-wife who hasn't spoken to him in over a decade, a mechanic he yelled at for giving him a deal that wasn't all that bad, the man at the hardware store he would always chat to about baseball, two cousins he would visit during the holidays, three crows, his physician, his optometrist, his cardiologist, and a daughter.\n\n\n\nShe's done more with less.\n\n\n\nTwo more needles had gone in and she didn't even notice. A third comes now, makes her lips tight. Her hand never moves. \n\n\n\nThe laptop's hard drive spins up, encoding his fragments onto shining platters. \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\"Can I ask a slightly weird question.\"\n\n\n\nNoam looks up at her. \"...

It barrels through the uncaring skies with a fervor and a tenor, its engines blaring at twenty five thousand rotations per minute. Exhaust billows as sixty hundred gallons of jet fuel are churned, burned and discarded inside a ten ton turbine. The chassis screeches and bends against the turbulence, the winds, straining against the unerring forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as eight dozen titanium screws combat the wrath of nature and win.</p>\n<p>It's dark over Denver. The sun set behind the towering mountains hours ago, all that remains is darkness. The Mile High City shines brilliantly against the oppressive shadow, bringing forth a warm vibrant yellow light that breaks out even unto the heavens, stretching through the cabin of the screeching metal plane.</p>\n<p>Gibbs doesn't hate flying. Her colleagues do. Doctor Rune, tall, bespectacled, prim proper and academic, the son of a miner and trapped in those shadows, hates flying. He claims it's because of corporate greed, a hatred in protest of penny-pinching bureaucrats in dusty white offices striking six keystrokes to separate a family into disparate seats lest they pay a tax to remain. That is true, but it is only half the truth. The other half is that when the wheels spin up two hundred fifty kilometers per hour and rubber meets road at unholy speed and the chassis lurches upwards towards the spiraling clouds, Rune feels like he is going to die. Not in a crash, a crash would be a comfort, it implies the presence of an Earth. No, Rune believes he will die of absence, as though there were never an Earth at all.</p>\n<p>Her other colleagues have more measured responses, the tall ones complain about the legroom, everyone else belts their small criticisms, they all eventually agree that flying is a necessary evil, except for Hargroves, she loves it, she loves to fly, she loves to <em>soar</em>.</p>\n<p>But Gibbs, Gibbs is fine with flying.</p>\n<p>And so it is that as she sits in the screeching metal bird in the darkness above Denver between two not-quite-asleep skiers with her shoulders pulled in to avoid an unwanted brush, sipping on a plastic-bottle margarita that's too strong to be refreshing but to weak to be comforting, that she smiles, because she's fine with flying, and she's almost there.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty minutes pass. Twenty more minutes of screaming steel and shaking iron, followed by one hundred thirty nine seconds of bowel tightening impact as the plane lands. The wheels fly from zero to two hundred a fifty kilometers an hour as rubber meets road at unholy speed and twelve decades of engineering roar to life in an instant to bring the lurching eagle to a halt. The ten ton turbines quiet.</p>\n<p>Gibbs gazes out at the runway, which is awash in technicolor, each chromatic path designated to aid pilots in navigating the blanketing dark. She continues to relax even as four hundred fifty persons flutter out to a three foot wide hallway, as twelve hundred hundred pounds of luggage are heaved down from shockingly flimsy cupboards. As twenty three men and women in bright orange vests embark to clean the shitty fabric seats.</p>\n<p>She opens her eyes, sets a determined march, retrieves her backpack, and is the last passenger to leave the plane. She gives a curt nod to the stewardess as she departs the vessel.</p>\n<p>She enters into the beckoning maw of Denver International Airport, its pristine shining metal contrasting harshly with the drab grey of the jetway. She takes rapid steps through bustling halls until she stumbles upon her mark, a payphone. She approaches and produces a beaten quarter from a stained leather wallet. She struggles to press it into the small metal slot, almost dropping it but not, failing to fail. An ageing mechanism within bemoaningly creaks to life as she rapidly enters precisely ten digits onto the syrup-sticky keypad. She realizes with a sigh that there is a IHOP immediately adjacent. She wipes three sticky fingers on her jeans as the telephonic machinery roars, whimperingly, to life.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>JULIAN EDEN:</strong> Ahoy?</p>\n<p><strong>HELLEN GIBBS:</strong> Hey Jules, it's me.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Hellen! Good to hear from you. How was your flight?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Unremarkable.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Ah. So, how is Colorado?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Inconclusive, I haven't left the airport yet.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Are you sure this is how you want to spend your winter break? If you come back right now you could still catch Rune's Christmas party.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> It's fine. I've got a beautiful campsite in mind. I'd rather spend that night under the stars anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Do you really think you'll find any traces of 9990 in Garden of the Gods? Those rocks are young, only date back to the Pleistocene.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> It's called Garden of the <em>Gods</em>, Julian, that screams 9990. Regardless, maybe there is nothing there, so what? I still get a restful break.</p>\n<p><strong>EDEN:</strong> Fair enough. Keep me posted.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Will do. Enjoy your break!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: midnightblue; color: white; padding: .5rem; text-align: center; border: 4px white double; width: 100px; float: left; margin-left: -10rem; display: var(--display-mobile);\">\n<p><tt>DISPLAYING NOTE 1/3</tt></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: rgb(var(--basalt-undertone));\">\n<h1 id=\"toc8\"><span>1983</span></h1>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc9\"><span>December 23</span></h3>\n<hr/></div>\n<p>A pristine red rental-corolla barrels down a mountain highway at two point four times the posted speed limit, shale and gravel accelerating rapidly under the tires and flying wildly into the canyon-esque walls.</p>\n<p>Six nails are hammered into the Earth by an experienced weathered and muscled arm. Six strings are wrapped rapidly into these sutures in the flesh of the planet. An unremarkable tent is erected in the surgery. An ever deflating mattress pad is filled over an afternoon and three hundred and twenty two breaths. It is winter in Colorado. There is a chill in the air.</p>\n<p>A bundle of Chevron-sourced plastic-wrapped logs are freed from their entrapment by calloused hands. Kindling is collected from the feast of dying grass. A match is struck three times and tossed in the kindling. A fire roars to life.</p>\n<p>Doctor Hellen Gibbs takes a deep breath of the wintry air, retrieves a pot from the bright red tent and pours two quarter gallons of water within. She hoists it atop the roiling fire and watches with satisfaction as it comes to boil smiling as the steam brushes against her face. She pours half of the pot into dehydrated stir fry and the other into equally thirsting peach crumble. The smells blanket the night, but they do not abate the ever present twinge of cold on her skin and in the air she breaths.</p>\n<p>She produces three pieces of silverware; mounted together through a ring in their hinds; from her jacket pocket. They gleam brilliantly in the moonlight, but they do not gleam so purely nor magically as the rocks. She stares out at the beating black sky; there's almost no light pollution here; as she presses the first bites of steaming hot food into her mouth.</p>\n<p>Truth is, she's never been very interested in the sky. From the time she was a very small girl, she's been interested in the Earth. Space is old, yes, but it is inconceivably old. \"The nebulous age of Eternity\", as one particularly pretentious physics major had monologued at her one day. But the Earth is <em>old</em>, in a way that made sense. In a way that she could chart and catalogue and understand. She does not care of cosmos thirteen billion years old, she is much more partial to the notion of mountains older than bone.</p>\n<p>Garden of the Gods does not share this age. These pillars of sedimentary rock aren't even that much older than homo <em>sapiens</em>. Garden of the Gods is young, is does not, <em>could</em> not posses 9990 phenomenon. She knows this, Eden knows this. Neither of them care. This is her time, he is happy to give it to her. She loves <a href=\"/run-the-river-red-hub\">Site-898</a>, but it's nice to get away on occasion. To be alone, if only for a little while.</p>\n<p>She smiles as the frost brushes against her cheeks. This is her time, she's going to make the most of it.</p>\n\n<p>Worn leather mountain boots tread steadily up an ancient dirt path towards the roaring fire. They are unhurried, but not unafraid. Each step carries a weight with it, a history. They have been on this trail before, they are not happy to return.</p>\n<p>Doctor Rudy Weller marches with determination. His lungs heave in his chest, he's accustomed to the elevation, but not the air. The air here is thin, he can feel it slip through his teeth and chill his gums. It's dry, too, it's not full; there's no depth to it, no texture. It's almost hollow, as absurd of an accusation as that is.</p>\n<p>His laces are tied, though there's only half of them, and half a pair of shoes. A large, metal protrusion demarks the space where a left leg ought to be in a naive anatomy. It's spiked to provide better grip on crags and rocks. A younger, more foolish version of him might have once mourned the 'loss', but the cave-in was thirteen years ago, that's an entire childhood, well, a childhood up to those messy years at least. Now he doesn't get foot cramps, as he often jokes.</p>\n<p>It did hurt, though. <a href=\"/scp-8272\">It hurt like a motherfucker</a>.</p>\n<p>He can still remember that pain, but he does not live in fear of it. He will not allow himself too. And so his steps are steady as he presses up the long, worn road.</p>\n<p>When he at last arrives at the makeshift hearth, eyes weary from many hours on mountain roads, there's already a cup of hot apple cider ready for him. He picks it up gratefully, and consumes it in lavish, starved gulps. It is just a matter of time before his host emerges from her tarp-ish cocoon to greet him, raising a gloved hand and waving with abandon. She wears these gloves even when she is in her sleeping bag. It is cold in Colorado.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Dr. Gibbs.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Rudy, we're fifteen hundred miles away from protocol and the chain of command.

She emerges from her tent, wandering out into the morning air and the layer of dew permeating it. Her eyes take in the nascent Rudy Weller's tent, a compact blue affair smaller even than her own. The sun is just starting to peak over the distant Rockies, casting the Earth in a purple hue. The hairs on her arms prickle with excitement and her heart pulses eight beats per minute faster. It's time for fieldwork.</p>\n<p>The first mile of her journey is exciting. The second, exhilarating. It is seven thirteen ante-meridiem, and already rock climbers sprawl across the many spires of the garden, clambering across them with abandon and rope. Their picks chop deep yet shallow into the rock, slowly and repeatedly scarring the Earth with a thousand cuts. Of course, these cuts are small, and the Earth will forget them, as it always does.</p>\n<p>One of the climbers, an older man, yet still below the halfway mark of his life, who really ought to have something better to do on a Saturday morning, looks down at her, noting her archeological garb. He gives her a salute, knowing she is one of the elite few who appreciates this rock as much as he does. She returns the gesture, though is slightly confused by it.</p>\n<p>What she does not know, and what he does not know, is that this place, this rock, is going to betray them. Tonight will be a blizzard for the ages, the coldest Christmas Eve there ever was and ever would be. He does not know that in six hours, she will be wrapped up in her tent, shuddering against the cold, trying desperately to cling to life and warmth. She does not know that in six hours, he will be lying in the trunk of his Camaro, blasting the heat and burning through the gas. Neither know that in six hours, temperatures will plummet. They will fall to thirty two, and then ten, and then zero, and they will not stop. They will fall through negative fifteen, and negative thirty five, and still they will fall. Tonight, it will be seventy five degrees Fahrenheit below zero.</p>\n\n<p>There is no coal in Garden of the Gods. That's not fully true, a little coal exists, but no large, useful deposits. Certainly none resembling akivite coal. 'Garden of the Gods' is a name, and just a name. But she knew that, or was pretty sure of that long before she ever came here. The investigation was warranted, but it was very much a formality.</p>\n<p>Still, she continues walking. Dust collects on her boots and on her coat. Slightly melted snow joins it. She walks another hour, barely checking her watch, breathing at ease even through the thin air.</p>\n<p>It is then she finds the door.</p>\n<p>It is so almost missable, but she does not miss it. It is a slight demarcation in the sedimentary rock. She approaches with nothing more than mild curiosity, curiosity that is rewarded. It is tall, that's the first thing she notices, very tall, bordering on towering. It is at least twice as tall as her, around three point three meters if she were to guess. It is significantly thinner, however, no wider than a normal door. The rock is worn, as all the rock here is on the rare occasion that it rains in Colorado, but some of the wear is different, special. The grooves are most certainly intentional.</p>\n<p>The grooves are shaped like tendrils of smoke, spanning the length of the door and spiraling as wisps, cut six to eight centimeters deep. A light flicks on in her brain, but it takes her time to pinpoint it. The realization happens all at once and much too fully. The grooves are the exact same shape as the patterns on her arms. And the patterns on Nerys' arms. They are a mark in a tongue never spoken by man, an ancient language of elden things. They convey a universal message: 'HERE BE DRAGONS'.</p>\n<p>The very last thing she notices is the plaque, a metal trunk with a plastic face, engraved with a stylized picture of a bird. The words read:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Carved in 1860 by Prospector Gleann Dennis, an Irish immigrant who set out for Colorado during the Pike's Peak gold rush, Dennis spent some time camping near this area, at the base of the peak. A successful prospector, he would eventually settle down in Manitou Springs. His legacy of mining would continue until his grandson was killed in an <a href=\"/scp-8987\">unrelated mining accident</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>It is unknown why Dennis made this carving, or what the significance of its patterns are, though this remains a topic of debate and discussion among locals.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Hellen Gibbs finishes reading the plaque and spends several minutes staring at the door. She sighs. It's time to head back to camp.</p>\n<p>At least she won't come back empty handed.</p>\n\n<p>The curvature of Rudy Weller's lips instantly betrays his stress. He looks anxiously at Gibbs as she approaches up the hill and paces in circles around the still roaring fire. He can hardly wait to speak as she approaches, but he does. Through great restraint, he allows her the first word.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Hey.</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Hey, how was your walk?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Good.</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> Find any traces of 9990?</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> What do you think?</p>\n<p><strong>WELLER:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Go with your gut.

Darkness and snow shroud the Earth and her tent as a million million snowflakes are cast from the heavens and crash violently unto the dust. She is cocooned in her sleeping bag, warmed mostly by the proximity of her limbs to each other, constantly radiating heat in a cycle driven by her beating heart. But that beating is slower now.</p>\n<p>The other, former, source of her warmth, indeed of her survival, is the fire. Before he left, she had Rudy offer up some gasoline from his tank. She whipped up a drip feed by taking a frying pan and angling it such that only a couple drops flow out at once. It worked well, the fire was kept full and burning strong and hot even against the rhythmic cold. But something has changed.</p>\n<p>The fire's gone out.</p>\n<p>She doesn't want to believe it, at first. Wants to believe its just the storm taking a turn for the worse, but it isn't. The storm has mostly passed, it's up to zero Fahrenheit. Yet she can feel the blood stilling in her veins.</p>\n<p>She sighs in acknowledgement, before wriggling out of her sleeping bag. She pops on her shoes and ties them in a double knot, then reluctantly crosses the threshold to the cold. The first thing she checks is the fire, it is indeed out. It's not hard to find the culprit, the gasoline froze last night. It's only just beginning to thaw now, and without it the wood was burned through quickly. She shakes her head.</p>\n<p>She could restart the fire, try and go to bed. But then again, it's not <em>that</em> cold out, she'll be fine as long as she can get her blood flowing and stay moving. Plus, this may be her best shot to mess around with the door without anyone around. She smiles, the excitement has her feeling warmer already.</p>\n\n<p>Two miles in the cold is easier said than done. She can feel her heart pumping, her boots pounding relentlessly into the dirt. The human spirit to just keep going and never give up swells within her. She rubs her hands together and hugs herself for warmth. She crushes two hand-warmers in her palms and feels heat inject into her flesh. Yet these factors, all of them, melt away to reveal one singular, absolute truth:</p>\n<p>She is fucking cold.</p>\n<p>At first her thoughts are varied, even scattered. Thinking about the implications of the door, or of an instance, all the way out here. She thinks of tests to conduct, questions to ask. She wonders if the instance is even alive. Then her thoughts, too, converge, and soon she can only think that she is cold.</p>\n<p>She almost misses the door, yet again. This time she does not even succeed in distinguishing it from the rock. She notices only the metal trunk of the bronze plaque, which shines harshly against the snow. She approaches, crossing sixteen meters in forty eight steps.</p>\n<p>Were her faculties in order, she would examine the door. She would look for a handle, or a switch, or any mechanism at all. But her mind, as any mind would be, has been muted by cold. And so she knocks. First with candor, then with an unnecessary desperation. It is not <em>that</em> cold, she is in no danger, though her mind conceals this truth from her as well.</p>\n<p>It is on the third knock that the door opens and her arms burn. She desperately pulls up her sleeves, gazing down at the marks. They do not glow any brighter, but they do burn. Somehow, this brings her no pain. She feels only warmth as she is recognized. Only joy as she is known.</p>\n\n<p>The door slides open with a groan as an ancient mechanism is triggered revealing an interior lined with shining schist giving way to a spiraling series of stairs. She approaches with caution, but finds the endeavor wildly comforting. It is warm inside. Very warm.</p>\n<p>The first steps she takes are slow, cautious, but they quickly increase in vigor as her blood defrost and her scientific curiosity grows. She makes many many steps deep into the Earth, but not too deep, no more than two hundred feet, this place was, after all, still carved by human hands. The steps grow rougher, more uneven as she arrives closer to the bottom. Then end on a small, barren plain, decorated only by a few rocky outcroppings.</p>\n<p>She looks around, disappointed. There is nothing here. And then there is something. And it is an eye. A massive eye, forty six meters in diameter. It is an eye she has scarcely seen before, and always in circumstances much more desperate than this.</p>\n<p>When it speaks to her, it is only through the pact that it gets through at all. But this is an imperfect medium, it is akin to forcing the Mississippi through a diner straw. On the first word alone she can feel her brain go numb and her nose start to bleed. A tempest rages within her mind as the enormity of the dragons thoughts come to rest upon her mind.</p>\n<p>But this isn't her first rodeo. She grits her teeth, steels her mind, and chokes out a greeting.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><strong>GIBBS:</strong> Nice to meet you.

You must stay for dinner.]</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Dinner with a dragon is much like anything else with a dragon, awe inspiring, mystical, and kind of scary. They speak for a while more first, before eating, the pact struggles to translate, within fifteen minutes she gets a headache, within another fifteen, a nosebleed. This half hour is not entirely unproductive, however. She learns this instance's name is 'Slumbering Shallow, Whisper of Vacant Winds'. And, she'd been able to answer her biggest question:</p>\n<p>How does it survive?</p>\n<p>Typical 8007 instances live in volcanoes, and subsist off of the magma therein. Colorado has only one single active volcano, the Dotsero crater, and it's on the other end of the state. The answer, ultimately, is wind. The instance is covered in holes, she'd initially assumed they were wounds, similar to those found in deceased instances, but there's a doubt there, they are too irregular, too natural. They are, of course, not wounds, they are funnels, catching and intensifying the wind and pushing it towards a series of stone gears within. They churn in unholy gear ratios amplifying the energy until they reach the central chamber of the dragon's chest. Rather than a magmatic heart, there is a turbine. It translates this energy into the heat which keeps the instance alive and hot. While the instance's internals are very different, it's externals are very consistent with other instances. It is, still, a fire breathing dragon.</p>\n<p>Below the turbine, there is a circuit of gears that all run into each other. This serves almost as a battery, allowing the instance to survive even when the wind is not blowing. This is rare, however. The dragon's spines form the garden of the gods and are covered in the funnels. They receive massive amounts of wind, especially on a night like tonight.</p>\n<p>And so the dragon is very warm, and so the same for all her food.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon does not eat food. It is full to bursting with an utter glut of wind.</p>\n<p>This is good, as she does not have much food. Four Chevron-sourced slim-jims, a pack of fifty-eight honey roasted peanuts, and raspberry-honey caffeine gummies made for runners that she underestimates the strength of until she eats three two many and feels her heart accelerate to one hundred and twelve beats per minute.</p>\n<p>The dragon offers to warm up the food for her as excess heat billows from its mouth in the form of steam and smoke. She politely declines as she does not want her food heat to eleven hundred degrees Celsius. And also because the notion of even lukewarm slim-jim makes her sick to her stomach.</p>\n<p>Though, she does accept the entities aid in the beverage department.</p>\n<p>Tea is fine, to her. The rest of the department likes it a lot, some to a sociopathic degree. In the break room, right next to the coffee pot, there's a matching pot of tea, keyed to the 'flavor of the day'. That changes, there's a calendar which specifies it, which Eden controls. Gibbs doesn't know it off of the top of her head. She's never actually bothered to read it. When asked what her favorite flavor of tea is, she's always replied 'Long Island'.</p>\n<p>Her central tension with tea is not the flavor, or lack thereof, but with the process. Waiting several minutes for the water to boil, made all the longer given how weak the power is; the outlets in the break room are fifty volts max; for a end product that is only slightly better than water. She's willing to go through the process for coffee, mostly because she's probably chemically addicted to it, but it's just not worth it for tea.</p>\n<p>This is a complaint that evaporates instantly in the presence of a dragon which can boil water in five sixteenths of a second. And, as a responsible hiker, she does carry both tea and water. Within half a minute there's a complete, steaming cup of peppermint tea.</p>\n<p>Still, she'd prefer it were Long Island.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon does not speak as she eats, it leaves her mind, and the pact, in peace. It is only when she is done and fed and full; relatively at least; that it again imposes its mind.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\">[The gnashing of teeth.

Her fingers tense in pain as she white knuckles each crag and approaches the three hundred foot summit. She's in no real danger, the dragon is helping her, blowing warm wind on her hands and face so that they do not chill or freeze. Additionally, she is secured by a rope and years of experience. Still, this is a rather extreme physical feat for her, or, well, anybody.</p>\n<p>The first hundred feet are tiring. The second hundred are miserable. The last hundred are herculean. They are altogether easier than her doctoral thesis.</p>\n<p>The winds blow ferociously at her as the forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r combine to push her away from the rock, where the forces of gravity will return her swiftly to the Earth. But she does not fall. And her knuckles strain. And her arms strain.</p>\n<p>The energy given unto her by the slim-jims is quickly expended, followed by lunch and breakfast and six more meals before that. After the first five minutes she is sweating water she never even drank.</p>\n<p>She only ever actually slips once. A patch of ice in a hold that she cannot see when she grasps it. Her palm slips out of it and is scraped up by the sharp rock, her other hand fails to fully compensate and slips out too, and she falls. She clambers desperately for the rope, grasping on with vigor and swinging towards the rock. She kicks her feet towards the wall repeatedly to slow her descent until she can reestablish the hold. She loses at most twenty five feet overall, though her confidence is, slightly, shaken.</p>\n<p>And so it is that she is thoroughly exhausted by the time she reaches the peak.</p>\n<p>She hefts her shaking, freezing form up onto the ridge, her torso splayed across the edge. Every one of her pores dilates in frigidity and her teeth chatter in defiance of the stillness. She is not done.</p>\n<p>Slowly, but certainly, limb by limb, she rights herself, so that her feet balance precariously on the peak. She is truly cold, now. The dragon's air cannot warm her, it does not want to risk blowing her off.</p>\n<p>She gazes up at the wintry moon, it's color is the same as the snow. But then, she's never been one for gazing at the sky.</p>\n<p>She then looks out, over the landscape. Out into the expanse, away from the Rockies. There is low visibility, she cannot see far, likely no farther than twenty miles, but that is not what matters. She understands, now, why Slumbering Shallow came out here. It is breathtaking, it is unlike anywhere she has ever been. It is unique and singular and singularly unique and more than any of these things it is isolated and alone and lonely. If she wanted, as it had suggested, to run away, there would be no finer a place.</p>\n<p>But that is not what she wants. Not at all.

It barrels through the uncaring skies with a fervor and a tenor, its engines blaring at twenty five thousand rotations per minute. Exhaust billows as sixty hundred gallons of jet fuel are churned, burned and discarded inside a ten ton turbine. The chassis screeches and bends against the turbulence, the winds, straining against the unerring forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as eight dozen titanium screws combat the wrath of nature and win.\n\n\n\nIt's dark over Denver. The sun set behind the towering mountains hours ago, all that remains is darkness. The Mile High City shines brilliantly against the oppressive shadow, bringing forth a warm vibrant yellow light that breaks out even unto the heavens, stretching through the cabin of the screeching metal plane.\n\n\n\nGibbs doesn't hate flying. Her colleagues do. Doctor Rune, tall, bespectacled, prim proper and academic, the son of a miner and trapped in those shadows, hates flying. He claims it's because of corporate greed, a hatred in protest of penny-pinching bureaucrats in dusty white offices striking six keystrokes to separate a family into disparate seats lest they pay a tax to remain. That is true, but it is only half the truth. The other half is that when the wheels spin up two hundred fifty kilometers per hour and rubber meets road at unholy speed and the chassis lurches upwards towards the spiraling clouds, Rune feels like he is going to die. Not in a crash, a crash would be a comfort, it implies the presence of an Earth. No, Rune believes he will die of absence, as though there were never an Earth at all.\n\n\n\nHer other colleagues have more measured responses, the tall ones complain about the legroom, everyone else belts their small criticisms, they all eventually agree that flying is a necessary evil, except for Hargroves, she loves it, she loves to fly, she loves to //soar//.\n\n\n\nBut Gibbs, Gibbs is fine with flying.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is that as she sits in the screeching metal bird in the darkness above Denver between two not-quite-asleep skiers with her shoulders pulled in to avoid an unwanted brush, sipping on a plastic-bottle margarita that's too strong to be refreshing but to weak to be comforting, that she smiles, because she's fine with flying, and she's almost there.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes pass. Twenty more minutes of screaming steel and shaking iron, followed by one hundred thirty nine seconds of bowel tightening impact as the plane lands. The wheels fly from zero to two hundred a fifty kilometers an hour as rubber meets road at unholy speed and twelve decades of engineering roar to life in an instant to bring the lurching eagle to a halt. The ten ton turbines quiet.\n\n\n\nGibbs gazes out at the runway, which is awash in technicolor, each chromatic path designated to aid pilots in navigating the blanketing dark. She continues to relax even as four hundred fifty persons flutter out to a three foot wide hallway, as twelve hundred hundred pounds of luggage are heaved down from shockingly flimsy cupboards. As twenty three men and women in bright orange vests embark to clean the shitty fabric seats.\n\n\n\nShe opens her eyes, sets a determined march, retrieves her backpack, and is the last passenger to leave the plane. She gives a curt nod to the stewardess as she departs the vessel.\n\n\n\nShe enters into the beckoning maw of Denver International Airport, its pristine shining metal contrasting harshly with the drab grey of the jetway. She takes rapid steps through bustling halls until she stumbles upon her mark, a payphone. She approaches and produces a beaten quarter from a stained leather wallet. She struggles to press it into the small metal slot, almost dropping it but not, failing to fail. An ageing mechanism within bemoaningly creaks to life as she rapidly enters precisely ten digits onto the syrup-sticky keypad. She realizes with a sigh that there is a IHOP immediately adjacent. She wipes three sticky fingers on her jeans as the telephonic machinery roars, whimperingly, to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**JULIAN EDEN:** Ahoy?\n\n\n\n**HELLEN GIBBS:** Hey Jules, it's me.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Hellen!

If you come back right now you could still catch Rune's Christmas party.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** It's fine. I've got a beautiful campsite in mind. I'd rather spend that night under the stars anyway.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Do you really think you'll find any traces of 9990 in Garden of the Gods? Those rocks are young, only date back to the Pleistocene.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** It's called Garden of the //Gods//, Julian, that screams 9990. Regardless, maybe there is nothing there, so what? I still get a restful break.\n\n\n\n**EDEN:** Fair enough. Keep me posted.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Will do.

Six strings are wrapped rapidly into these sutures in the flesh of the planet. An unremarkable tent is erected in the surgery. An ever deflating mattress pad is filled over an afternoon and three hundred and twenty two breaths. It is winter in Colorado. There is a chill in the air.\n\n\n\nA bundle of Chevron-sourced plastic-wrapped logs are freed from their entrapment by calloused hands. Kindling is collected from the feast of dying grass. A match is struck three times and tossed in the kindling. A fire roars to life.\n\n\n\nDoctor Hellen Gibbs takes a deep breath of the wintry air, retrieves a pot from the bright red tent and pours two quarter gallons of water within. She hoists it atop the roiling fire and watches with satisfaction as it comes to boil smiling as the steam brushes against her face. She pours half of the pot into dehydrated stir fry and the other into equally thirsting peach crumble. The smells blanket the night, but they do not abate the ever present twinge of cold on her skin and in the air she breaths.\n\n\n\nShe produces three pieces of silverware; mounted together through a ring in their hinds; from her jacket pocket. They gleam brilliantly in the moonlight, but they do not gleam so purely nor magically as the rocks. She stares out at the beating black sky; there's almost no light pollution here; as she presses the first bites of steaming hot food into her mouth.\n\n\n\nTruth is, she's never been very interested in the sky. From the time she was a very small girl, she's been interested in the Earth. Space is old, yes, but it is inconceivably old. \"The nebulous age of Eternity\", as one particularly pretentious physics major had monologued at her one day. But the Earth is //old//, in a way that made sense. In a way that she could chart and catalogue and understand. She does not care of cosmos thirteen billion years old, she is much more partial to the notion of mountains older than bone.\n\n\n\nGarden of the Gods does not share this age. These pillars of sedimentary rock aren't even that much older than homo //sapiens//. Garden of the Gods is young, is does not, //could// not posses 9990 phenomenon. She knows this, Eden knows this. Neither of them care. This is her time, he is happy to give it to her. She loves [[[Run the River Red Hub|Site-898]]], but it's nice to get away on occasion. To be alone, if only for a little while.\n\n\n\nShe smiles as the frost brushes against her cheeks. This is her time, she's going to make the most of it.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWorn leather mountain boots tread steadily up an ancient dirt path towards the roaring fire. They are unhurried, but not unafraid. Each step carries a weight with it, a history. They have been on this trail before, they are not happy to return.\n\n\n\nDoctor Rudy Weller marches with determination. His lungs heave in his chest, he's accustomed to the elevation, but not the air. The air here is thin, he can feel it slip through his teeth and chill his gums. It's dry, too, it's not full; there's no depth to it, no texture. It's almost hollow, as absurd of an accusation as that is.\n\n\n\nHis laces are tied, though there's only half of them, and half a pair of shoes. A large, metal protrusion demarks the space where a left leg ought to be in a naive anatomy. It's spiked to provide better grip on crags and rocks. A younger, more foolish version of him might have once mourned the 'loss', but the cave-in was thirteen years ago, that's an entire childhood, well, a childhood up to those messy years at least. Now he doesn't get foot cramps, as he often jokes.\n\n\n\nIt did hurt, though. [[[SCP-8272|It hurt like a motherfucker]]].\n\n\n\nHe can still remember that pain, but he does not live in fear of it. He will not allow himself too. And so his steps are steady as he presses up the long, worn road.\n\n\n\nWhen he at last arrives at the makeshift hearth, eyes weary from many hours on mountain roads, there's already a cup of hot apple cider ready for him. He picks it up gratefully, and consumes it in lavish, starved gulps. It is just a matter of time before his host emerges from her tarp-ish cocoon to greet him, raising a gloved hand and waving with abandon. She wears these gloves even when she is in her sleeping bag. It is cold in Colorado.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**WELLER:** Dr. Gibbs.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Rudy, we're fifteen hundred miles away from protocol and the chain of command.

She emerges from her tent, wandering out into the morning air and the layer of dew permeating it. Her eyes take in the nascent Rudy Weller's tent, a compact blue affair smaller even than her own. The sun is just starting to peak over the distant Rockies, casting the Earth in a purple hue. The hairs on her arms prickle with excitement and her heart pulses eight beats per minute faster. It's time for fieldwork.\n\n\n\nThe first mile of her journey is exciting. The second, exhilarating. It is seven thirteen ante-meridiem, and already rock climbers sprawl across the many spires of the garden, clambering across them with abandon and rope. Their picks chop deep yet shallow into the rock, slowly and repeatedly scarring the Earth with a thousand cuts. Of course, these cuts are small, and the Earth will forget them, as it always does.\n\n\n\nOne of the climbers, an older man, yet still below the halfway mark of his life, who really ought to have something better to do on a Saturday morning, looks down at her, noting her archeological garb. He gives her a salute, knowing she is one of the elite few who appreciates this rock as much as he does. She returns the gesture, though is slightly confused by it.\n\n\n\nWhat she does not know, and what he does not know, is that this place, this rock, is going to betray them. Tonight will be a blizzard for the ages, the coldest Christmas Eve there ever was and ever would be. He does not know that in six hours, she will be wrapped up in her tent, shuddering against the cold, trying desperately to cling to life and warmth. She does not know that in six hours, he will be lying in the trunk of his Camaro, blasting the heat and burning through the gas. Neither know that in six hours, temperatures will plummet. They will fall to thirty two, and then ten, and then zero, and they will not stop. They will fall through negative fifteen, and negative thirty five, and still they will fall. Tonight, it will be seventy five degrees Fahrenheit below zero.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThere is no coal in Garden of the Gods. That's not fully true, a little coal exists, but no large, useful deposits. Certainly none resembling akivite coal. 'Garden of the Gods' is a name, and just a name. But she knew that, or was pretty sure of that long before she ever came here. The investigation was warranted, but it was very much a formality.\n\n\n\nStill, she continues walking. Dust collects on her boots and on her coat. Slightly melted snow joins it. She walks another hour, barely checking her watch, breathing at ease even through the thin air.\n\n\n\nIt is then she finds the door.\n\n\n\nIt is so almost missable, but she does not miss it. It is a slight demarcation in the sedimentary rock. She approaches with nothing more than mild curiosity, curiosity that is rewarded. It is tall, that's the first thing she notices, very tall, bordering on towering. It is at least twice as tall as her, around three point three meters if she were to guess. It is significantly thinner, however, no wider than a normal door. The rock is worn, as all the rock here is on the rare occasion that it rains in Colorado, but some of the wear is different, special. The grooves are most certainly intentional.\n\n\n\nThe grooves are shaped like tendrils of smoke, spanning the length of the door and spiraling as wisps, cut six to eight centimeters deep. A light flicks on in her brain, but it takes her time to pinpoint it. The realization happens all at once and much too fully. The grooves are the exact same shape as the patterns on her arms. And the patterns on Nerys' arms. They are a mark in a tongue never spoken by man, an ancient language of elden things. They convey a universal message: 'HERE BE DRAGONS'.\n\n\n\nThe very last thing she notices is the plaque, a metal trunk with a plastic face, engraved with a stylized picture of a bird. The words read:\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n//Carved in 1860 by Prospector Gleann Dennis, an Irish immigrant who set out for Colorado during the Pike's Peak gold rush, Dennis spent some time camping near this area, at the base of the peak. A successful prospector, he would eventually settle down in Manitou Springs. His legacy of mining would continue until his grandson was killed in an [[[SCP-8987|unrelated mining accident]]].//\n\n\n\n//It is unknown why Dennis made this carving, or what the significance of its patterns are, though this remains a topic of debate and discussion among locals.//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nHellen Gibbs finishes reading the plaque and spends several minutes staring at the door. She sighs. It's time to head back to camp.\n\n\n\nAt least she won't come back empty handed.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe curvature of Rudy Weller's lips instantly betrays his stress. He looks anxiously at Gibbs as she approaches up the hill and paces in circles around the still roaring fire. He can hardly wait to speak as she approaches, but he does. Through great restraint, he allows her the first word. \n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** Hey.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Hey, how was your walk?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Good.\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** Find any traces of 9990?\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** What do you think?\n\n\n\n**WELLER:** No.\n\n\n\n**GIBBS:** Go with your gut.

She is cocooned in her sleeping bag, warmed mostly by the proximity of her limbs to each other, constantly radiating heat in a cycle driven by her beating heart. But that beating is slower now.\n\n\n\nThe other, former, source of her warmth, indeed of her survival, is the fire. Before he left, she had Rudy offer up some gasoline from his tank. She whipped up a drip feed by taking a frying pan and angling it such that only a couple drops flow out at once. It worked well, the fire was kept full and burning strong and hot even against the rhythmic cold. But something has changed.\n\n\n\nThe fire's gone out.\n\n\n\nShe doesn't want to believe it, at first. Wants to believe its just the storm taking a turn for the worse, but it isn't. The storm has mostly passed, it's up to zero Fahrenheit. Yet she can feel the blood stilling in her veins.\n\n\n\nShe sighs in acknowledgement, before wriggling out of her sleeping bag. She pops on her shoes and ties them in a double knot, then reluctantly crosses the threshold to the cold. The first thing she checks is the fire, it is indeed out. It's not hard to find the culprit, the gasoline froze last night. It's only just beginning to thaw now, and without it the wood was burned through quickly. She shakes her head.\n\n\n\nShe could restart the fire, try and go to bed. But then again, it's not //that// cold out, she'll be fine as long as she can get her blood flowing and stay moving. Plus, this may be her best shot to mess around with the door without anyone around. She smiles, the excitement has her feeling warmer already.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nTwo miles in the cold is easier said than done. She can feel her heart pumping, her boots pounding relentlessly into the dirt. The human spirit to just keep going and never give up swells within her. She rubs her hands together and hugs herself for warmth. She crushes two hand-warmers in her palms and feels heat inject into her flesh. Yet these factors, all of them, melt away to reveal one singular, absolute truth:\n\n\n\nShe is fucking cold.\n\n\n\nAt first her thoughts are varied, even scattered. Thinking about the implications of the door, or of an instance, all the way out here. She thinks of tests to conduct, questions to ask. She wonders if the instance is even alive. Then her thoughts, too, converge, and soon she can only think that she is cold.\n\n\n\nShe almost misses the door, yet again. This time she does not even succeed in distinguishing it from the rock. She notices only the metal trunk of the bronze plaque, which shines harshly against the snow. She approaches, crossing sixteen meters in forty eight steps.\n\n\n\nWere her faculties in order, she would examine the door. She would look for a handle, or a switch, or any mechanism at all. But her mind, as any mind would be, has been muted by cold. And so she knocks. First with candor, then with an unnecessary desperation. It is not //that// cold, she is in no danger, though her mind conceals this truth from her as well.\n\n\n\nIt is on the third knock that the door opens and her arms burn. She desperately pulls up her sleeves, gazing down at the marks. They do not glow any brighter, but they do burn. Somehow, this brings her no pain. She feels only warmth as she is recognized. Only joy as she is known.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe door slides open with a groan as an ancient mechanism is triggered revealing an interior lined with shining schist giving way to a spiraling series of stairs. She approaches with caution, but finds the endeavor wildly comforting. It is warm inside. Very warm.\n\n\n\nThe first steps she takes are slow, cautious, but they quickly increase in vigor as her blood defrost and her scientific curiosity grows. She makes many many steps deep into the Earth, but not too deep, no more than two hundred feet, this place was, after all, still carved by human hands. The steps grow rougher, more uneven as she arrives closer to the bottom. Then end on a small, barren plain, decorated only by a few rocky outcroppings.\n\n\n\nShe looks around, disappointed. There is nothing here. And then there is something. And it is an eye. A massive eye, forty six meters in diameter. It is an eye she has scarcely seen before, and always in circumstances much more desperate than this.\n\n\n\nWhen it speaks to her, it is only through the pact that it gets through at all. But this is an imperfect medium, it is akin to forcing the Mississippi through a diner straw. On the first word alone she can feel her brain go numb and her nose start to bleed. A tempest rages within her mind as the enormity of the dragons thoughts come to rest upon her mind.\n\n\n\nBut this isn't her first rodeo. She grits her teeth, steels her mind, and chokes out a greeting.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n**GIBBS:** Nice to meet you.

You must stay for dinner.] [[/span]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nDinner with a dragon is much like anything else with a dragon, awe inspiring, mystical, and kind of scary. They speak for a while more first, before eating, the pact struggles to translate, within fifteen minutes she gets a headache, within another fifteen, a nosebleed. This half hour is not entirely unproductive, however. She learns this instance's name is 'Slumbering Shallow, Whisper of Vacant Winds'. And, she'd been able to answer her biggest question:\n\n\n\nHow does it survive?\n\n\n\nTypical 8007 instances live in volcanoes, and subsist off of the magma therein. Colorado has only one single active volcano, the Dotsero crater, and it's on the other end of the state. The answer, ultimately, is wind. The instance is covered in holes, she'd initially assumed they were wounds, similar to those found in deceased instances, but there's a doubt there, they are too irregular, too natural. They are, of course, not wounds, they are funnels, catching and intensifying the wind and pushing it towards a series of stone gears within. They churn in unholy gear ratios amplifying the energy until they reach the central chamber of the dragon's chest. Rather than a magmatic heart, there is a turbine. It translates this energy into the heat which keeps the instance alive and hot. While the instance's internals are very different, it's externals are very consistent with other instances. It is, still, a fire breathing dragon.\n\n\n\nBelow the turbine, there is a circuit of gears that all run into each other. This serves almost as a battery, allowing the instance to survive even when the wind is not blowing. This is rare, however. The dragon's spines form the garden of the gods and are covered in the funnels. They receive massive amounts of wind, especially on a night like tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd so the dragon is very warm, and so the same for all her food.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe dragon does not eat food. It is full to bursting with an utter glut of wind.\n\n\n\nThis is good, as she does not have much food. Four Chevron-sourced slim-jims, a pack of fifty-eight honey roasted peanuts, and raspberry-honey caffeine gummies made for runners that she underestimates the strength of until she eats three two many and feels her heart accelerate to one hundred and twelve beats per minute.\n\n\n\nThe dragon offers to warm up the food for her as excess heat billows from its mouth in the form of steam and smoke. She politely declines as she does not want her food heat to eleven hundred degrees Celsius. And also because the notion of even lukewarm slim-jim makes her sick to her stomach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThough, she does accept the entities aid in the beverage department.\n\n\n\nTea is fine, to her. The rest of the department likes it a lot, some to a sociopathic degree. In the break room, right next to the coffee pot, there's a matching pot of tea, keyed to the 'flavor of the day'. That changes, there's a calendar which specifies it, which Eden controls. Gibbs doesn't know it off of the top of her head. She's never actually bothered to read it. When asked what her favorite flavor of tea is, she's always replied 'Long Island'.\n\n\n\nHer central tension with tea is not the flavor, or lack thereof, but with the process. Waiting several minutes for the water to boil, made all the longer given how weak the power is; the outlets in the break room are fifty volts max; for a end product that is only slightly better than water. She's willing to go through the process for coffee, mostly because she's probably chemically addicted to it, but it's just not worth it for tea.\n\n\n\nThis is a complaint that evaporates instantly in the presence of a dragon which can boil water in five sixteenths of a second. And, as a responsible hiker, she does carry both tea and water. Within half a minute there's a complete, steaming cup of peppermint tea.\n\n\n\nStill, she'd prefer it were Long Island.\n\n\n\n[[=image peaks.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: .5rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe dragon does not speak as she eats, it leaves her mind, and the pact, in peace. It is only when she is done and fed and full; relatively at least; that it again imposes its mind.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(var(--basalt-tertiary-color)); padding: .5rem 1rem;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #ff670f;\"]] [The gnashing of teeth.

Her fingers tense in pain as she white knuckles each crag and approaches the three hundred foot summit. She's in no real danger, the dragon is helping her, blowing warm wind on her hands and face so that they do not chill or freeze. Additionally, she is secured by a rope and years of experience. Still, this is a rather extreme physical feat for her, or, well, anybody.\n\n\n\nThe first hundred feet are tiring. The second hundred are miserable. The last hundred are herculean. They are altogether easier than her doctoral thesis.\n\n\n\nThe winds blow ferociously at her as the forces of G\u01ce-oh and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r combine to push her away from the rock, where the forces of gravity will return her swiftly to the Earth. But she does not fall. And her knuckles strain. And her arms strain.\n\n\n\nThe energy given unto her by the slim-jims is quickly expended, followed by lunch and breakfast and six more meals before that. After the first five minutes she is sweating water she never even drank.\n\n\n\nShe only ever actually slips once. A patch of ice in a hold that she cannot see when she grasps it. Her palm slips out of it and is scraped up by the sharp rock, her other hand fails to fully compensate and slips out too, and she falls. She clambers desperately for the rope, grasping on with vigor and swinging towards the rock. She kicks her feet towards the wall repeatedly to slow her descent until she can reestablish the hold. She loses at most twenty five feet overall, though her confidence is, slightly, shaken.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is that she is thoroughly exhausted by the time she reaches the peak.\n\n\n\nShe hefts her shaking, freezing form up onto the ridge, her torso splayed across the edge. Every one of her pores dilates in frigidity and her teeth chatter in defiance of the stillness. She is not done.\n\n\n\nSlowly, but certainly, limb by limb, she rights herself, so that her feet balance precariously on the peak. She is truly cold, now. The dragon's air cannot warm her, it does not want to risk blowing her off.\n\n\n\nShe gazes up at the wintry moon, it's color is the same as the snow. But then, she's never been one for gazing at the sky.\n\n\n\nShe then looks out, over the landscape. Out into the expanse, away from the Rockies. There is low visibility, she cannot see far, likely no farther than twenty miles, but that is not what matters. She understands, now, why Slumbering Shallow came out here. It is breathtaking, it is unlike anywhere she has ever been. It is unique and singular and singularly unique and more than any of these things it is isolated and alone and lonely. If she wanted, as it had suggested, to run away, there would be no finer a place.\n\n\n\nBut that is not what she wants. Not at all. What matters about this view, about these twenty miles, is that past the storm, past another twenty miles and another and a hundred and a thousand and a couple hundred more, there is Site-898, and they are staring right back at her, probably through dorky yellow binoculars.\n\n\n\nShe smiles, she feels the cold winds brush against her rosy cheeks and chill her frigid skin as she stands three hundred feet above the sallow Earth.\n\n\n\nAnd for a moment she is on top of the world.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** crags.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/crags.html\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** peaks.png\n\n> **Author:** Lorc\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/peaks.html\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** divider.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user sprawlingstar]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** SCP Wiki\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** header-bg.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Dicklyon\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_of_the_Gods_central_gardens_from_the_north.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** planyourtrip.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Daniel Schwen\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_of_the_Gods_Sunset.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** supportconservation.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_135.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** witnessrestoration.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_175.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** spotthedifference.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2025-01-01_Garden_of_the_Gods_-_Coyotes,_Deer_-_026.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** foreverfree.jpg\n\n> **Author:** mark byzewski\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2024-10-08_Garden_of_the_Gods_Sunrise_-_034.jpg\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-6448", "classification-committee-memo", "scp-8007", "scp-9990", "run-the-river-red-hub", "scp-8272", "scp-8987", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["adventure", "art-exchange", "from-120s-archives", "heartwarming", "mystery", "tale"], "title": "GARDEN OF THE GODS - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/garden-of-the-gods", "year": 2026}, "girlraisingproject": {"created_at": "2026-01-02T01:16:00", "creator": "whenwerewe", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:16:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"goat.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:19:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:19:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"light.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:20:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"woods.jpg\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:20:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Uploaded file \"ruin.webp\".", "date": "2026-01-02T01:21:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:23:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:24:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-02T01:27:00"}, {"author": "whenwerewe", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whenwerewe", "comment": "Added tags: black-comedy, body-horror, fantasy, tale.

Three spears were thrust into my back, and a fourth into the neck had killed me.</p>\n<p>While I was dead, the fifth had taken her, too.</p>\n<p>As I blearily cracked open my eyes, already stiffening with rigor mortis, she trembled beside me. Her last breath was drowned out by bickering.</p>\n<p>Behind, the men who had killed us argued loudly in a foreign tongue about what to do next. The tallest of them, disfigured by a twisted arm and muscles like an ox, gestured violently towards the hills we\u2019d descended from. Perhaps some of my band had escaped. It was bitter comfort to me now.</p>\n<p>I rose slowly to my feet. I held her by the wrist as I had so many times before, and she fell limply by the arm beside me. She was too light.</p>\n<p>What? Oh. I\u2019ve never had one of you try to <em>comfort</em> me before. That was a long time ago, anyway.</p>\n<p>The mud-brick village we had tried to raid was not yet called Uruk, and the men were not yet the Sumerians. Even the pale and weedy grass they gnawed at was not yet really wheat. They were a stunted lot, and might have been pitiable if they hadn\u2019t taken my daughter.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t look at me like that. We were starving. They had been pushing us out of the plains and into the high valleys all my life.</p>\n<p>Not that any of this matters. I\u2019m beyond trying to claw at the <em>moral high ground</em>.</p>\n<p>My fellows were scattered around me, dead to the last. We didn\u2019t know how to fight their numbers, their corded slings and taut bows, their weapons of strange and shining stone. They\u2019d died so easily.</p>\n<p>So I woke them up.</p>\n<p>One by one the dead rose. Seized joints cracked with unexpected flexion, tendon and sinew hesitantly peeled apart. Their blood pooled thickly at their feet.</p>\n<p>The men turned around to look at me, and them. Their faces were portraits of dread. When I have trouble sleeping I think of them and drift off. Then \u2014 there was all the tedious struggle, and all the tedious begging. But I had them in the end. One made it two hours down the packed dirt path that was not yet the world\u2019s first road, throwing his brothers behind him, in cowardice or appeasement.</p>\n<p>And there was my daughter. I carried her all the way. She was slight, and stiff, and as the sun set she began to cool until by touch I could not distinguish her from the earth in which I lay her.</p>\n<p>There is nothing pretty about the dead, no matter what the fanatics say. They\u2019ll rant at you as long as you care to listen, about beauty, certainty, symmetry. They\u2019re just insane; anyone who would do this is, really. I was ready to leave the meat of my daughter in the earth. But just before I did, something rose out of her, that was not breath, and clung to me. I thought I might as well keep it around. At the time I didn\u2019t let myself think something so stupid, but it would be nice to have her back.</p>\n<p>Yes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, obviously. It\u2019s always nice to have perceptive material. But try not to yell too much, it strains the diaphragm; you\u2019ll want that nice and fresh for later.</p>\n<p>I had lost other children, of course. You think of it as the ultimate tragedy. None of you can guess how lucky you are. Even just three centuries ago\u2026 it was something mothers expected. Which is not to say that it was ever easy. I would have called all of them back to life, if I could. But only her soul remained to me, and I am less sentimental about these things than most.</p>\n<p>Mhm. Still sentimental enough to cut you up.</p>\n<p>Oh? Well, this is the last time you\u2019ll be able to speak for a while, so I might as well.</p>\n<p>Once, when I was the same age my daughter was when she died, I ran into a leprous hundred-headed snake. Not that any of us knew what leprosy was in those days. But its skin was peeling and ulcerating; great blisters and cancers riddled every inch of exposed muscle; its eyes were spasming as it begged me for a drop of blood.</p>\n<p>And because I was young and stupid, I cut open my palm with a flint and let it drink, and it skittered off, begging me not to speak of its appearance to anyone. When three days later I ran into two beautiful men, fire-skinned and stinking of what I now realise must have been incense, I told them everything they asked me. They laughed in a voice like cracking ice and promised me their Queen\u2019s blessing.</p>\n<p>That probably had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>It now occurs to me they were definitely Mab\u2019s. I think I took a side in their civil war by doing that. I had a lot of headaches over the topic, later.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that\u2019s where it began. Now, nod if you\u2019d rather be blind for this next bit.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"goat.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/goat.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>We have both been reshaped by men. This sweet little thing is nothing like the huge beasts I knew in my youth. It became domestic; I went the other way. My dead razed village and town for generations, made me the enemy of all the settled peoples. But I returned to the ruins to find five more sprouting. I simply could not keep up. So when they offered me copper and iron, which I barely understood, I accepted. When they showed me the strange shapes they\u2019d carved into their clay, I learned. And I found that I had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ereshkigal\">new name</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>There. That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?</p>\n<p>Just a little joke! I don\u2019t get to talk to a lot of people. If you try to be funny near a Karcist they look at you like you\u2019re an alien.</p>\n<p>Really, though, you\u2019ll be fine. The vertebra fused back into place; you\u2019re practically good as new.</p>\n<p>Look, just don\u2019t pay attention to the lathe. No, no, if you keep panicking yourself like that I\u2019ll have to paralyse you again. Just think about something else. This really shouldn\u2019t be hurting that much.</p>\n<p>Do you want to hear more about me?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll take that as a yes.</p>\n<p>It was during the Hussite Wars\u2014</p>\n<p>Stop looking confused, they weren\u2019t occult. You people just don\u2019t know anything about your ancestors these days. I\u2019d be angry if I hadn\u2019t known how worthless they were personally. This was around the fourteen-hundreds. Is that good enough for you?</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t wail or I\u2019ll block your trachea. Thank you.</p>\n<p>Now, as I was saying, I was searching for a fleshsmith. This is skipping millennia of my life, but they weren\u2019t very <em>dense</em> millennia. Fill in about six hours of me narrating executions of uncouth men on the road, if you want. I had come to Esterberg, the hidden city. In those days there were far less humans, and many more faeries, and those odd ape-things. It stank like dead fish and liceridden fur. The city, like all cities in those days, was an open sore in the world. But it was the only place I could find someone who could stitch my daughter\u2019s soul back into a body.</p>\n<p>Yes, despite ten thousand years of wandering, I did not exactly have my finger on the pulse of the occult world (what a hilarious expression!). I had brushed up against the edges of Fae activity \u2014 and immediately fled \u2014 and I had run into fleshcarves and cogkindred on the road or in the hovels the peasants gave me in return for their lives. But I was only vaguely aware of, for example, the existence of the Daevites.</p>\n<p>It does not help that I did not hold, and indeed still do not hold, with cities. I can tolerate a thousand people living together, but once you start to lose count that\u2019s a bad sign.</p>\n<p>Sorry, this is besides the point. The tendonwork is distracting me. There, you should be able to speak again. Now, where was I?</p>\n<p>I had found after endless searching a suitable fleshcrafter, brought him my daughter\u2019s soul and a spare girl-child, and after deploying enough threats I was sure he wouldn\u2019t simply dispose of her errant spirit I set out into the city.</p>\n<p>I wanted to see if I could find some useful contacts, perhaps some tips on the location of other nexuses. To my later dismay, it turned out the city was quite firmly antiroyalist territory. And you know how Fae get; they just have this way about them. They learn things they have no right knowing.</p>\n<p>So I walked into the square with my retinue\u2014</p>\n<p>I kept about two dozen of the dead with me at all times. Had them in low-brimmed hats, big cloaks, stuffed them with herbs and so on. Mostly I got away with claiming to be a wandering priestess, though it didn\u2019t work in Esterberg, of course.</p>\n<p>In the square there was an eyeless beggar. And by eyeless I mean great divots had been sunk all over his bared skin, so you could see the half a hundred weeping sockets that must have once seen unimaginable sights. When I walked past him, he pointed straight at me. Every single face in the square turned to stare right at me within three seconds.</p>\n<p>Now, you understand, I was in what is today Poland. I had been born near Iraq. I was <em>used</em> to standing out. It wasn\u2019t anything like today, obviously, but I got little stares, kids either knew I was the funniest thing around or squealed when they saw me, you get the idea. They thought I was a Turk, which got a laugh the first time they said it to my face.</p>\n<p>What it felt like when that entire square, probably five thousand people, turned to bore into my head? I cannot describe it. I barely heard what the beggar said next. Something about crimes revealed and reconciled, a trial before the House of the Inventor, pardon-by-years. I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the words while everyone looked at me. Blank and confident, like men who hold shining stars in their hands, and know that not only can you not save yourself, you cannot save <em>anyone</em>.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I admit it, I panicked. I ordered my dead to lash out and fled in the terror. Anyone who died I raised too, to buy me my hour. It turns out that for all their staring most of the people in the square were basically civilians. And two dozen doesn\u2019t sound like many, but if they don\u2019t die when you kill them they can do a lot. So today I think they have a little plaque where the beggar used to sit, for the thanatotic riot of 1433. Killed about eight hundred, supposedly.</p>\n<p>While the citizens ran about like headless chickens I collected my project and dispatched the uncooperative Karcist with my favourite trick.</p>\n<p>That was the fifty-seventh time I died.</p>\n<p>I fled the city with her in my arms, all my dead lost to its militia, the happiest I\u2019d been in centuries. To call back a soul, well-formed, from <em>millenia</em> of sleep? Every two-bit reanimator called it impossible.</p>\n<p>Oh, come on, you know me better than that. I wouldn\u2019t do this to you for <em>fun</em>; I\u2019m not such a sadist I\u2019d risk the Coalition\u2019s wrath. Obviously something didn\u2019t work out.</p>\n<p>My daughter woke up. Her flesh was as cold as mine, but that was no burden. She would never be hungry again, and if she ever left me I knew I could bring her back. I would try to teach her, somehow, and let her do the same to me. We would pass through the ages of man together. That was the first time I really thought about my power, in detail.</p>\n<p>Yes, try and pull what remains of your face into a smirk, very classy. I was raised when the cutting edge of technology was <em>writing</em>. It took me fully three thousand years to realise the priests of Ashur and Marduk could not literally talk to the gods. I had to essentially invent the entire notion of necromancy from scratch.</p>\n<p>Well, thank you! But of course I don\u2019t seem that old. If I did, I would have gone insane a very long time ago. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to see a warhorse, an automobile, a spacecraft?</p>\n<p>Wait, wait, sorry. I\u2019m letting you rile me up. Back to the story.</p>\n<p>My daughter was the child I\u2019d loved, in every detail. Exactly every detail. She did not gain new traits, or lose old ones. It was as if her soul was frozen in amber. Something about the way it connected to her newly-conquered flesh was defective. She could puppeteer the body, but the body could not embed memories in her being. So she remembered only the last month, at best. She is an eternal youth, and can never grow.</p>\n<p>For a while, I thought her perfect as she was. Though I had not known it, this had been what I was missing all those empty years. The two of us lived out the Thirty Years\u2019 War in an obscure hut, mother and child (much later did we learn this was also the <em>Fifth</em> Occult War). I taught her a hundred times, to weave, to write, to feel safe. She did not feel an empty belly even once, and occasionally I entertained her by dismembering lost <em>landsknechte</em>.</p>\n<p>But I couldn\u2019t stay satisfied forever. Every mother wants to see her daughter grow into herself. She should have been my equal, and risen a queen of the dead alongside me. We would resurrect each other cyclically, until the last city fell.</p>\n<p>You people never fail to irritate me. No, don\u2019t flinch, just \u2014 if you want to ask something, <em>ask it</em>! What\u2019s the point of this ridiculous \u201cMay I ask\u201d nonsense? It\u2019s not as if tiptoeing around will make me any more merciful.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>You want to know <em>that</em>, do you. Why do I tell these stories in such varying tones. Why am I so cavalier about everything except my daughter. How insightful.</p>\n<p>You know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being totally <em>sincere</em> in your questioning. I think you\u2019re trying to make some sort of <em>point</em>. Perhaps to imply a false and saccharine equivalence between her and <em>other</em> people.</p>\n<p>So let me answer your question with a question of my own: what do you think happens if you supercharge a person\u2019s amygdala for five minutes? Do they just have a heart attack? Let\u2019s find out, shall we?</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"woods.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/woods.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>I have had no small number of encounters with <span style=\"color:green\">the abode of quiet</span>.

It might also scramble your internal body-model, though. It\u2019ll give you, what\u2019s the word? Dysphoria? A shot of that, real concentrated, but over quick.</p>\n<p>That expression there is\u2026 Let me tell you another story. This one might even give you context on what\u2019s happening to you. Concentrate on the words, please.</p>\n<p>So I was in Chernobyl\u2014</p>\n<p>Oh, alright, fine. I\u2019d spent the past three hundred years looking for someone who knew how to help my daughter\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p>Well, I say that, but it\u2019s not strictly true. I spent fifty years searching, and then I realised I\u2019d have to do it myself. I learnt at the feet of the great soul-sages; I did favours for children of the Scarlet Fool; I even managed to win a lesson off one of the Wild Hunt on a bet. I began to put together something like a <em>theory</em> of necromancy. I was inspired by what was in the air in those days. All those philosophers, those men of science! There was something romantic about the idea the world could be understood.</p>\n<p>I knew firsthand it was false, of course.</p>\n<p>So I set out on a course of experimentation. That\u2019s when I began collecting material in earnest, and yes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here, you poor thing.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I said, I was in Chernobyl. After the Russians cursed the land, they evacuated the whole town. The margins of error for that kind of thing are large enough to lose a lot of people. Ripe pickings for little old me.</p>\n<p>What do you mean \u201ctalk like that\u201d? I talk like <em>myself</em>. If I wasn\u2019t able to change with the times I would have lost my mind a long time ago. Even last century, there was barely such a thing as a Foundation, and now they\u2019ve fallen apart. If I adapted any slower the pace of events would overtake me, you understand?</p>\n<p>Right, so, outskirts of Chernobyl, going shopping for new material. I couldn\u2019t bring my dead everywhere, the way I used to. The stink was too obvious, the scarves and hats too blatant. There were cameras metastasising on every street corner. I had to struggle just to carry one or two along with me those days.</p>\n<p>So there I was, walking around in a ridiculous coat and sunglasses, dragging this briefcase by my side. My daughter was never the type to cling to my skirts. She was away somewhere in the city. It wouldn\u2019t do to spend all my time worrying about her survival, so in the past hundred years I\u2019d fit her with a few extra features.</p>\n<p>If you are about to call me a bad parent, then be warned that I might start trying to be a good one, <em>starting with my research efforts</em>.</p>\n<p>No? Excellent.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d had my fair share of encounters with what are now hilariously called \u201cnormalcy preservation organisations\u201d. Bloodless and wretched things. They\u2019d tried to chain my daughter more times than I can count. I could accept that they\u2019d come after me, but she was just a slip of a girl. Their cruelty knew no bounds.</p>\n<p>One moment I was walking down an emptying street, and the next three agents leapt out from a decrepit old house and blew a neat triplet of holes in my torso.</p>\n<p>Of course by this point I was really quite hard to kill, but the three of them were backed up by two brutes in hazmat armour. They caught me about the neck with a loop of rope like some kind of animal and emptied their magazines. I was still conscious, but there\u2019s not really a lot you can do with gaping holes in every major muscle group.</p>\n<p>They dragged me into the base they\u2019d set up in their shack, which inside was done up like some kind of watchpost. I recognised vaguely the equipment and the general style: they were with Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, or one of its descendants.</p>\n<p>This\u2014</p>\n<p>It was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt. Even the day I lost my daughter, there was a kind of lingering apathy. I let the waves wash over me until my head only rarely broke the surface, and I almost forgot what loss was at all.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t like that. They were right there, in the room with me, and I couldn\u2019t move. She was out there, waiting for me, and when she came to find me, and she found <em>them</em>, and I would have to watch, if she found them would they even capture her or just pulp her fucking brain again\u2014</p>\n<p>Oops!</p>\n<p>Sorry. It\u2019ll reattach, don\u2019t worry. And anyway, you\u2019re not going to miss it for long.</p>\n<p>Hmph.</p>\n<p>Suffice to say I wasn\u2019t feeling great. They put me in cuffs, and were preparing some kind of sedative, which might even have worked. But\u2026</p>\n<p>One of them had taken <em>my briefcase</em>. And you know how they are. Their type just cannot stand an unanswered question. I don\u2019t know who they thought I was. If they\u2019d known exactly who they\u2019d found they would have burned it. But instead poor idiot mister Foundation popped the locks.</p>\n<p>The layers of the dermis aren\u2019t actually connected very strongly, you know? Once you puncture the membrane somewhere, you can work your way through the subcutaneous tissue pretty easy. Especially if you\u2019re using, say, human jaws.</p>\n<p>He reeled back and half his face was missing, torn off by the thing in the case. He screamed \u2014 I think he was trying to cry for help, but it had gotten into his muscles, too \u2014 and the rest of the agents opened up on my poor valiant servant.</p>\n<p>Then she arrived. Must have tracked her mother by scent, or perhaps she was playing stalk-and-catch. I was so proud of her.</p>\n<p>Just walked in through the front door, quiet as could be. I think the field team were a little off kilter for some reason, so they didn\u2019t shoot her. One of them screamed at her to get back while the other three tried to wrangle my homunculus. He actually ran over and tried to grab her and get out of the house!</p>\n<p>Well, my daughter popped his head off, of course. Then they turned their attention to her properly, but now there were only three of them against two of my dead and my dear girl. It was quick, and then it was slow.</p>\n<p>Two of them surrendered. I was worried they\u2019d hurt her, but she was only superficially perforated. At worst it was inconvenient. I\u2019d have to reattach her spinal cord where a stray round had pierced it to get her lower body functional again, that was all.</p>\n<p>As soon as I broke my restraints I embraced her and praised her for that display of bravery. We left at once, with the two captives restrained and lugged with us. One of them begged us the whole way to release his subordinate. I told him I\u2019d do his job for him and reprimand her and he made such a noise. It was a great pick-me-up after everything.</p>\n<p>When we got back I scrapped him for parts \u2014 in fact, look back there, you can still see his spine wriggling in the pneumatitrator! Isn\u2019t it kind of cute? No?</p>\n<p>Oh, be sullen, then. When my daughter gets like this I give her a chocolate and some leftovers, but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t work on you.</p>\n<p>I would have found somewhere for his inferior to make herself useful, too, but it turned out the paralytic had made its way to her lungs.</p>\n<p>Ho hum. He did get his wish; that was my good deed for the decade. Afterwards I took the kid out for a treat. Blue steak in Lyon.</p>\n<p>And, oh dear, speaking of hypoxia I do think your airway is blocked. Why didn\u2019t you <em>say</em> any\u2014</p>\n<p>Right, you don\u2019t have an isolation chamber for your larynx. My bad. Can you hear me right now? Were you even conscious for the back half of my story? It\u2019s awfully rude of you to choke on your blood while I was doing all this helpful work on your intestines, and I shall have my recompense, I say.</p>\n<p>Ha. Oh, what a mess.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t get another one of you, it\u2019d be such a headache.

Hm?</p>\n<p>Oh, the slurring isn\u2019t too bad. I was worried I\u2019d rendered you incogent. Monologuing is only fun with a lucid audience.</p>\n<p>Well, that episode wasn\u2019t all that interesting, regardless. I was just explaining how much I love my daughter, indulging in my motherly urges and so on. I know <em>you types</em> aren\u2019t a fan.</p>\n<p>What? Strike a nerve?</p>\n<p>Hm. You\u2019ve gone soft in your old age, regardless. No, not \u2014 don\u2019t look at me like that. Yes, you\u2019re very young, and I\u2019m sure that hair is attractive to\u2026 somebody. But <em>you</em>, the Foundation, whatever you call yourselves nowadays. What you\u2019ve been getting up to is positively pathetic. The other day I heard a \u201cVanguard\u201d pharmacy put out a call for vampires to come in for conditioning treatment! Did you get so lazy you decided you\u2019d try and get all your enemies to just go willingly to their dissection and death? If even one of the daughters of the great Impaler appeared I\u2019d eat my shoes.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t hear you; the nerve damage has really got to your tongue. Try harder.</p>\n<p>Listen, I like to joke with the material, but that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to tell me a lie, make it believable. You\u2019re so awful at subterfuge I\u2019m probably doing good by increasing the competence of your agency.</p>\n<p>No, come on, this persistence is pathetic. Even if you did somehow hoodwink <em>ten</em> bloodsuckers into showing up, you don\u2019t need to keep up this pretense about, what do you call it, \u201charm reduction\u201d, around <em>me</em>. Look at me! I\u2019m not going to judge you if you admit you scattered their ashes in the river.</p>\n<p>I have to respect your commitment. Maybe you even believe it. The Foundation were always masters of self-deception. I thought Vanguard had turned a new leaf. This has been an educational exchange for the <em>both</em> of us.</p>\n<p>Ah, but their new era has not been without its upsides. I am a great appreciator of your people\u2019s newfound openmindedness. If they\u2019d adopted this attitude from the start, we\u2019d all be deathless by now. To think of how much easier things would have been if they hadn\u2019t clung to their idiot notions\u2026 I could strangle those pitiful Overseers.</p>\n<p>Still, I didn\u2019t say no to the amnesty when they offered it.</p>\n<p>Oh, you look like a kicked puppy. Yes, one of their liaisons offered me a pardon if I\u2019d agree to test on their mimicflesh and swear off the good stuff. I did try it for a few months, but it\u2019s just not the same. There are all these obscure occult properties, and the mimics don\u2019t even scream properly.</p>\n<p>Yes, and that\u2019s you caught up to the modern day, more or less. I skipped over a variety of encounters with dullards who thought they\u2019d be the one to kill me, but nothing worth telling.</p>\n<p>I absolutely <em>do</em> have to do this. My daughter\u2019s memory is up to a nice round two years, which is about ten thousand short of what I\u2019ll accept.</p>\n<p>Oh, good job on the smile! I thought your zygomaticus was halfway to necrosis, congratulations. Can I ask what brought it on? Would it have anything to do with the dozen Coalition jackboots fumbling out of their base toward my pretty little abode?</p>\n<p>You remain an awful liar, dear. Of course you know what I\u2019m talking about. You called them here with that goetic beacon in your pericardial cavity. Or maybe not; the world is full of coincidences.</p>\n<p>And there goes the grin. It\u2019s a shame, it looks good on you. Really shows off your incisors. I think those will be your main input into my next project.</p>\n<p>Every single sneering warden thinks they have me pegged. Here\u2019s a doddering old lady from before we invented writing, who\u2019s escaped capture by slinking away from everything dangerous, burdened by an imbecile daughter barely capable of feeding herself. I\u2019ve seen what you write about me. You have such interesting <em>opinions</em> about my work. And even though I have slipped through the nets of a hundred generations, every two-bit Director is just so sure he\u2019ll be the one to bring this antique into the reliquary that is her rightful place. Chernobyl was the closest you ever came, and you were still <em>pretty damn far</em>.</p>\n<p>I told you: if I could not adapt to the world as it is, I would have gone mad eons ago. And yet every time one of your technicians invent some new gimmick you try to catch me with it. The Scythians tried riding me down with their precious cavalry, old Rameses had a go with chariots, Metternich cornered me with grenadiers, De Gaulle\u2019s goons poisoned me with some fancy paralytic. All of them are decorating the east wall of the lab, now. Don\u2019t look! I just said I want your teeth, and the vomit does terrible things to the enamel.</p>\n<p>And your precious Coalition, with their newest hack. These unbinding mechanists have made a right mess. You know a month ago, the thrall they were interviewing on TV, where they had to keep redacting segments of her life story because her master was a wanted criminal? That was <em>me</em>! I mean, the embarrassment I felt, I just wanted a hole to open up and swallow her. Having my reputation tarnished in front of half the country by a spare worker! I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on an unbinder and see what makes them tick for just <em>so</em> long.</p>\n<p>So: thank you for putting together this whole operation. I was worried they might not bother, but it seems Vanguard has rubbed off on them. They were just so filled with <em>humanitarian concern</em> that they brought one! So sweet. I should have the countermeasure up by next week.</p>\n<p>Why on Earth did you step up as bait? Did you think they\u2019d pull you out while you were still recognisable? Because I can promise you that even if they did cage me, you are not in a fixable state.</p>\n<p>Hm. I do not think the word for what you have done here is <em>bravery</em>, exactly; even we Levantine hunter-gatherers had words for \u201csuicidal\u201d. It should make your cerebrum an interesting reagent, if nothing else.</p>\n<p>Ah, and here they come. They\u2019re just going through the chaff upstairs. I do wish you\u2019d never invented gunpowder. Those things are just far too loud.</p>\n<p>Eve! Come on upstairs, dear. There are some very rude men upstairs.</p>\n<p>Yes, isn\u2019t she just adorable? It took me a while to work out the telescoping ribcage. Put that away, darling, you\u2019re getting lymph everywhere. And those fingernails! I\u2019ll have you know they can hit a sparrow at half a kilometre.</p>\n<p>Just go on up, sweet.</p>\n<p>Dinner\u2019s served.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"light.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/light.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>When I was a child, I dreamt of the paradise I was promised my spirit would one day rise to.

I held the whole world away from her with my hands and my ribs and my skull. Three spears were thrust into my back, and a fourth into the neck had killed me.\n\n\n\nWhile I was dead, the fifth had taken her, too.\n\n\n\nAs I blearily cracked open my eyes, already stiffening with rigor mortis, she trembled beside me. Her last breath was drowned out by bickering.\n\n\n\nBehind, the men who had killed us argued loudly in a foreign tongue about what to do next. The tallest of them, disfigured by a twisted arm and muscles like an ox, gestured violently towards the hills we\u2019d descended from. Perhaps some of my band had escaped. It was bitter comfort to me now.\n\n\n\nI rose slowly to my feet. I held her by the wrist as I had so many times before, and she fell limply by the arm beside me. She was too light.\n\n\n\nWhat? Oh. I\u2019ve never had one of you try to //comfort// me before. That was a long time ago, anyway.\n\n\n\nThe mud-brick village we had tried to raid was not yet called Uruk, and the men were not yet the Sumerians. Even the pale and weedy grass they gnawed at was not yet really wheat. They were a stunted lot, and might have been pitiable if they hadn\u2019t taken my daughter.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t look at me like that. We were starving. They had been pushing us out of the plains and into the high valleys all my life. \n\n\n\nNot that any of this matters. I\u2019m beyond trying to claw at the //moral high ground//.\n\n\n\nMy fellows were scattered around me, dead to the last. We didn\u2019t know how to fight their numbers, their corded slings and taut bows, their weapons of strange and shining stone. They\u2019d died so easily.\n\n\n\nSo I woke them up.\n\n\n\nOne by one the dead rose. Seized joints cracked with unexpected flexion, tendon and sinew hesitantly peeled apart. Their blood pooled thickly at their feet.\n\n\n\nThe men turned around to look at me, and them. Their faces were portraits of dread. When I have trouble sleeping I think of them and drift off. Then -- there was all the tedious struggle, and all the tedious begging. But I had them in the end. One made it two hours down the packed dirt path that was not yet the world\u2019s first road, throwing his brothers behind him, in cowardice or appeasement.\n\n\n\nAnd there was my daughter. I carried her all the way. She was slight, and stiff, and as the sun set she began to cool until by touch I could not distinguish her from the earth in which I lay her.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing pretty about the dead, no matter what the fanatics say. They\u2019ll rant at you as long as you care to listen, about beauty, certainty, symmetry. They\u2019re just insane; anyone who would do this is, really. I was ready to leave the meat of my daughter in the earth. But just before I did, something rose out of her, that was not breath, and clung to me. I thought I might as well keep it around. At the time I didn\u2019t let myself think something so stupid, but it would be nice to have her back.\n\n\n\nYes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, obviously. It\u2019s always nice to have perceptive material. But try not to yell too much, it strains the diaphragm; you\u2019ll want that nice and fresh for later.\n\n\n\nI had lost other children, of course. You think of it as the ultimate tragedy. None of you can guess how lucky you are. Even just three centuries ago\u2026 it was something mothers expected. Which is not to say that it was ever easy. I would have called all of them back to life, if I could. But only her soul remained to me, and I am less sentimental about these things than most.\n\n\n\nMhm. Still sentimental enough to cut you up.\n\n\n\nOh? Well, this is the last time you\u2019ll be able to speak for a while, so I might as well.\n\n\n\nOnce, when I was the same age my daughter was when she died, I ran into a leprous hundred-headed snake. Not that any of us knew what leprosy was in those days. But its skin was peeling and ulcerating; great blisters and cancers riddled every inch of exposed muscle; its eyes were spasming as it begged me for a drop of blood.\n\n\n\nAnd because I was young and stupid, I cut open my palm with a flint and let it drink, and it skittered off, begging me not to speak of its appearance to anyone. When three days later I ran into two beautiful men, fire-skinned and stinking of what I now realise must have been incense, I told them everything they asked me. They laughed in a voice like cracking ice and promised me their Queen\u2019s blessing.\n\n\n\nThat probably had something to do with it.\n\n\n\nIt now occurs to me they were definitely Mab\u2019s. I think I took a side in their civil war by doing that. I had a lot of headaches over the topic, later.\n\n\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s where it began. Now, nod if you\u2019d rather be blind for this next bit.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/goat.jpg |\n\ncaption=We have both been reshaped by men.

That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\n\n\n\nJust a little joke! I don\u2019t get to talk to a lot of people. If you try to be funny near a Karcist they look at you like you\u2019re an alien.\n\n\n\nReally, though, you\u2019ll be fine. The vertebra fused back into place; you\u2019re practically good as new.\n\n\n\nLook, just don\u2019t pay attention to the lathe. No, no, if you keep panicking yourself like that I\u2019ll have to paralyse you again. Just think about something else. This really shouldn\u2019t be hurting that much.\n\n\n\nDo you want to hear more about me?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\n\n\n\nIt was during the Hussite Wars--\n\n\n\nStop looking confused, they weren\u2019t occult. You people just don\u2019t know anything about your ancestors these days. I\u2019d be angry if I hadn\u2019t known how worthless they were personally. This was around the fourteen-hundreds. Is that good enough for you?\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t wail or I\u2019ll block your trachea. Thank you.\n\n\n\nNow, as I was saying, I was searching for a fleshsmith. This is skipping millennia of my life, but they weren\u2019t very //dense// millennia. Fill in about six hours of me narrating executions of uncouth men on the road, if you want. I had come to Esterberg, the hidden city. In those days there were far less humans, and many more faeries, and those odd ape-things. It stank like dead fish and liceridden fur. The city, like all cities in those days, was an open sore in the world. But it was the only place I could find someone who could stitch my daughter\u2019s soul back into a body.\n\n\n\nYes, despite ten thousand years of wandering, I did not exactly have my finger on the pulse of the occult world (what a hilarious expression!). I had brushed up against the edges of Fae activity -- and immediately fled -- and I had run into fleshcarves and cogkindred on the road or in the hovels the peasants gave me in return for their lives. But I was only vaguely aware of, for example, the existence of the Daevites.\n\n\n\nIt does not help that I did not hold, and indeed still do not hold, with cities. I can tolerate a thousand people living together, but once you start to lose count that\u2019s a bad sign.\n\n\n\nSorry, this is besides the point. The tendonwork is distracting me. There, you should be able to speak again. Now, where was I?\n\n\n\nI had found after endless searching a suitable fleshcrafter, brought him my daughter\u2019s soul and a spare girl-child, and after deploying enough threats I was sure he wouldn\u2019t simply dispose of her errant spirit I set out into the city.\n\n\n\nI wanted to see if I could find some useful contacts, perhaps some tips on the location of other nexuses. To my later dismay, it turned out the city was quite firmly antiroyalist territory. And you know how Fae get; they just have this way about them. They learn things they have no right knowing. \n\n\n\nSo I walked into the square with my retinue--\n\n\n\nI kept about two dozen of the dead with me at all times. Had them in low-brimmed hats, big cloaks, stuffed them with herbs and so on. Mostly I got away with claiming to be a wandering priestess, though it didn\u2019t work in Esterberg, of course.\n\n\n\nIn the square there was an eyeless beggar. And by eyeless I mean great divots had been sunk all over his bared skin, so you could see the half a hundred weeping sockets that must have once seen unimaginable sights. When I walked past him, he pointed straight at me. Every single face in the square turned to stare right at me within three seconds.\n\n\n\nNow, you understand, I was in what is today Poland. I had been born near Iraq. I was //used// to standing out. It wasn\u2019t anything like today, obviously, but I got little stares, kids either knew I was the funniest thing around or squealed when they saw me, you get the idea. They thought I was a Turk, which got a laugh the first time they said it to my face.\n\n\n\nWhat it felt like when that entire square, probably five thousand people, turned to bore into my head? I cannot describe it. I barely heard what the beggar said next. Something about crimes revealed and reconciled, a trial before the House of the Inventor, pardon-by-years. I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the words while everyone looked at me. Blank and confident, like men who hold shining stars in their hands, and know that not only can you not save yourself, you cannot save //anyone//.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, I admit it, I panicked. I ordered my dead to lash out and fled in the terror. Anyone who died I raised too, to buy me my hour. It turns out that for all their staring most of the people in the square were basically civilians. And two dozen doesn\u2019t sound like many, but if they don\u2019t die when you kill them they can do a lot. So today I think they have a little plaque where the beggar used to sit, for the thanatotic riot of 1433. Killed about eight hundred, supposedly.\n\n\n\nWhile the citizens ran about like headless chickens I collected my project and dispatched the uncooperative Karcist with my favourite trick.\n\n\n\nThat was the fifty-seventh time I died.\n\n\n\nI fled the city with her in my arms, all my dead lost to its militia, the happiest I\u2019d been in centuries. To call back a soul, well-formed, from //millenia// of sleep? Every two-bit reanimator called it impossible.\n\n\n\nOh, come on, you know me better than that. I wouldn\u2019t do this to you for //fun//; I\u2019m not such a sadist I\u2019d risk the Coalition\u2019s wrath. Obviously something didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\n\nMy daughter woke up. Her flesh was as cold as mine, but that was no burden. She would never be hungry again, and if she ever left me I knew I could bring her back. I would try to teach her, somehow, and let her do the same to me. We would pass through the ages of man together. That was the first time I really thought about my power, in detail.\n\n\n\nYes, try and pull what remains of your face into a smirk, very classy. I was raised when the cutting edge of technology was //writing//. It took me fully three thousand years to realise the priests of Ashur and Marduk could not literally talk to the gods. I had to essentially invent the entire notion of necromancy from scratch.\n\n\n\nWell, thank you! But of course I don\u2019t seem that old. If I did, I would have gone insane a very long time ago. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to see a warhorse, an automobile, a spacecraft?\n\n\n\nWait, wait, sorry. I\u2019m letting you rile me up. Back to the story.\n\n\n\nMy daughter was the child I\u2019d loved, in every detail. Exactly every detail. She did not gain new traits, or lose old ones. It was as if her soul was frozen in amber. Something about the way it connected to her newly-conquered flesh was defective. She could puppeteer the body, but the body could not embed memories in her being. So she remembered only the last month, at best. She is an eternal youth, and can never grow.\n\n\n\nFor a while, I thought her perfect as she was. Though I had not known it, this had been what I was missing all those empty years. The two of us lived out the Thirty Years\u2019 War in an obscure hut, mother and child (much later did we learn this was also the //Fifth// Occult War). I taught her a hundred times, to weave, to write, to feel safe. She did not feel an empty belly even once, and occasionally I entertained her by dismembering lost //landsknechte//.\n\n\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stay satisfied forever. Every mother wants to see her daughter grow into herself. She should have been my equal, and risen a queen of the dead alongside me. We would resurrect each other cyclically, until the last city fell.\n\n\n\nYou people never fail to irritate me. No, don\u2019t flinch, just -- if you want to ask something, //ask it//! What\u2019s the point of this ridiculous \u201cMay I ask\u201d nonsense? It\u2019s not as if tiptoeing around will make me any more merciful.\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\nYou want to know //that//, do you.

I mean, empirically. I haven\u2019t experienced it myself.\n\n\n\nNow, good news. This next part will actually be totally painless! I\u2019m going to anaesthetise you. It might also scramble your internal body-model, though. It\u2019ll give you, what\u2019s the word? Dysphoria? A shot of that, real concentrated, but over quick.\n\n\n\nThat expression there is\u2026 Let me tell you another story. This one might even give you context on what\u2019s happening to you. Concentrate on the words, please.\n\n\n\nSo I was in Chernobyl--\n\n\n\nOh, alright, fine. I\u2019d spent the past three hundred years looking for someone who knew how to help my daughter\u2019s situation.\n\n\n\nWell, I say that, but it\u2019s not strictly true. I spent fifty years searching, and then I realised I\u2019d have to do it myself. I learnt at the feet of the great soul-sages; I did favours for children of the Scarlet Fool; I even managed to win a lesson off one of the Wild Hunt on a bet. I began to put together something like a //theory// of necromancy. I was inspired by what was in the air in those days. All those philosophers, those men of science! There was something romantic about the idea the world could be understood.\n\n\n\nI knew firsthand it was false, of course.\n\n\n\nSo I set out on a course of experimentation. That\u2019s when I began collecting material in earnest, and yes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here, you poor thing.\n\n\n\nAnyway, as I said, I was in Chernobyl. After the Russians cursed the land, they evacuated the whole town. The margins of error for that kind of thing are large enough to lose a lot of people. Ripe pickings for little old me.\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean \u201ctalk like that\u201d? I talk like //myself//. If I wasn\u2019t able to change with the times I would have lost my mind a long time ago. Even last century, there was barely such a thing as a Foundation, and now they\u2019ve fallen apart. If I adapted any slower the pace of events would overtake me, you understand?\n\n\n\nRight, so, outskirts of Chernobyl, going shopping for new material. I couldn\u2019t bring my dead everywhere, the way I used to. The stink was too obvious, the scarves and hats too blatant. There were cameras metastasising on every street corner. I had to struggle just to carry one or two along with me those days.\n\n\n\nSo there I was, walking around in a ridiculous coat and sunglasses, dragging this briefcase by my side. My daughter was never the type to cling to my skirts. She was away somewhere in the city. It wouldn\u2019t do to spend all my time worrying about her survival, so in the past hundred years I\u2019d fit her with a few extra features.\n\n\n\nIf you are about to call me a bad parent, then be warned that I might start trying to be a good one, //starting with my research efforts//.\n\n\n\nNo? Excellent.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d had my fair share of encounters with what are now hilariously called \u201cnormalcy preservation organisations\u201d. Bloodless and wretched things. They\u2019d tried to chain my daughter more times than I can count. I could accept that they\u2019d come after me, but she was just a slip of a girl. Their cruelty knew no bounds.\n\n\n\nOne moment I was walking down an emptying street, and the next three agents leapt out from a decrepit old house and blew a neat triplet of holes in my torso.\n\n\n\nOf course by this point I was really quite hard to kill, but the three of them were backed up by two brutes in hazmat armour. They caught me about the neck with a loop of rope like some kind of animal and emptied their magazines. I was still conscious, but there\u2019s not really a lot you can do with gaping holes in every major muscle group.\n\n\n\nThey dragged me into the base they\u2019d set up in their shack, which inside was done up like some kind of watchpost. I recognised vaguely the equipment and the general style: they were with Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, or one of its descendants.\n\n\n\nThis--\n\n\n\nIt was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt. Even the day I lost my daughter, there was a kind of lingering apathy. I let the waves wash over me until my head only rarely broke the surface, and I almost forgot what loss was at all.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t like that. They were right there, in the room with me, and I couldn\u2019t move. She was out there, waiting for me, and when she came to find me, and she found //them//, and I would have to watch, if she found them would they even capture her or just pulp her fucking brain again--\n\n\n\nOops!\n\n\n\nSorry. It\u2019ll reattach, don\u2019t worry. And anyway, you\u2019re not going to miss it for long.\n\n\n\nHmph.\n\n\n\nSuffice to say I wasn\u2019t feeling great. They put me in cuffs, and were preparing some kind of sedative, which might even have worked. But\u2026\n\n\n\nOne of them had taken //my briefcase//. And you know how they are. Their type just cannot stand an unanswered question. I don\u2019t know who they thought I was. If they\u2019d known exactly who they\u2019d found they would have burned it. But instead poor idiot mister Foundation popped the locks.\n\n\n\nThe layers of the dermis aren\u2019t actually connected very strongly, you know? Once you puncture the membrane somewhere, you can work your way through the subcutaneous tissue pretty easy. Especially if you\u2019re using, say, human jaws.\n\n\n\nHe reeled back and half his face was missing, torn off by the thing in the case. He screamed -- I think he was trying to cry for help, but it had gotten into his muscles, too -- and the rest of the agents opened up on my poor valiant servant.\n\n\n\nThen she arrived. Must have tracked her mother by scent, or perhaps she was playing stalk-and-catch. I was so proud of her.\n\n\n\nJust walked in through the front door, quiet as could be. I think the field team were a little off kilter for some reason, so they didn\u2019t shoot her. One of them screamed at her to get back while the other three tried to wrangle my homunculus. He actually ran over and tried to grab her and get out of the house!\n\n\n\nWell, my daughter popped his head off, of course. Then they turned their attention to her properly, but now there were only three of them against two of my dead and my dear girl. It was quick, and then it was slow.\n\n\n\nTwo of them surrendered. I was worried they\u2019d hurt her, but she was only superficially perforated. At worst it was inconvenient. I\u2019d have to reattach her spinal cord where a stray round had pierced it to get her lower body functional again, that was all.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I broke my restraints I embraced her and praised her for that display of\u00a0\u00a0bravery. We left at once, with the two captives restrained and lugged with us. One of them begged us the whole way to release his subordinate. I told him I\u2019d do his job for him and reprimand her and he made such a noise. It was a great pick-me-up after everything.\n\n\n\nWhen we got back I scrapped him for parts -- in fact, look back there, you can still see his spine wriggling in the pneumatitrator! Isn\u2019t it kind of cute? No?\n\n\n\nOh, be sullen, then. When my daughter gets like this I give her a chocolate and some leftovers, but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t work on you. \n\n\n\nI would have found somewhere for his inferior to make herself useful, too, but it turned out the paralytic had made its way to her lungs.\n\n\n\nHo hum. He did get his wish; that was my good deed for the decade. Afterwards I took the kid out for a treat. Blue steak in Lyon.\n\n\n\nAnd, oh dear, speaking of hypoxia I do think your airway is blocked. Why didn\u2019t you //say// any--\n\n\n\nRight, you don\u2019t have an isolation chamber for your larynx. My bad. Can you hear me right now? Were you even conscious for the back half of my story? It\u2019s awfully rude of you to choke on your blood while I was doing all this helpful work on your intestines, and I shall have my recompense, I say. \n\n\n\nHa. Oh, what a mess.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t get another one of you, it\u2019d be such a headache.

Monologuing is only fun with a lucid audience.\n\n\n\nWell, that episode wasn\u2019t all that interesting, regardless. I was just explaining how much I love my daughter, indulging in my motherly urges and so on. I know //you types// aren\u2019t a fan.\n\n\n\nWhat? Strike a nerve?\n\n\n\nHm. You\u2019ve gone soft in your old age, regardless. No, not -- don\u2019t look at me like that. Yes, you\u2019re very young, and I\u2019m sure that hair is attractive to\u2026 somebody. But //you//, the Foundation, whatever you call yourselves nowadays. What you\u2019ve been getting up to is positively pathetic. The other day I heard a \u201cVanguard\u201d pharmacy put out a call for vampires to come in for conditioning treatment! Did you get so lazy you decided you\u2019d try and get all your enemies to just go willingly to their dissection and death? If even one of the daughters of the great Impaler appeared I\u2019d eat my shoes.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t hear you; the nerve damage has really got to your tongue. Try harder.\n\n\n\nListen, I like to joke with the material, but that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to tell me a lie, make it believable. You\u2019re so awful at subterfuge I\u2019m probably doing good by increasing the competence of your agency.\n\n\n\nNo, come on, this persistence is pathetic. Even if you did somehow hoodwink //ten// bloodsuckers into showing up, you don\u2019t need to keep up this pretense about, what do you call it, \u201charm reduction\u201d, around //me//. Look at me! I\u2019m not going to judge you if you admit you scattered their ashes in the river.\n\n\n\nI have to respect your commitment. Maybe you even believe it. The Foundation were always masters of self-deception. I thought Vanguard had turned a new leaf. This has been an educational exchange for the //both// of us.\n\n\n\nAh, but their new era has not been without its upsides. I am a great appreciator of your people\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0newfound openmindedness. If they\u2019d adopted this attitude from the start, we\u2019d all be deathless by now. To think of how much easier things would have been if they hadn\u2019t clung to their idiot notions\u2026 I could strangle those pitiful Overseers.\n\n\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t say no to the amnesty when they offered it.\n\n\n\nOh, you look like a kicked puppy. Yes, one of their liaisons offered me a pardon if I\u2019d agree to test on their mimicflesh and swear off the good stuff. I did try it for a few months, but it\u2019s just not the same. There are all these obscure occult properties, and the mimics don\u2019t even scream properly.\n\n\n\nYes, and that\u2019s you caught up to the modern day, more or less. I skipped over a variety of encounters with dullards who thought they\u2019d be the one to kill me, but nothing worth telling.\n\n\n\nI absolutely //do// have to do this. My daughter\u2019s memory is up to a nice round two years, which is about ten thousand short of what I\u2019ll accept.\n\n\n\nOh, good job on the smile! I thought your zygomaticus was halfway to necrosis, congratulations. Can I ask what brought it on? Would it have anything to do with the dozen Coalition jackboots fumbling out of their base toward my pretty little abode?\n\n\n\nYou remain an awful liar, dear. Of course you know what I\u2019m talking about. You called them here with that goetic beacon in your pericardial cavity. Or maybe not; the world is full of coincidences.\n\n\n\nAnd there goes the grin. It\u2019s a shame, it looks good on you. Really shows off your incisors. I think those will be your main input into my next project. \n\n\n\nEvery single sneering warden thinks they have me pegged. Here\u2019s a doddering old lady from before we invented writing, who\u2019s escaped capture by slinking away from everything dangerous, burdened by an imbecile daughter barely capable of feeding herself. I\u2019ve seen what you write about me. You have such interesting //opinions// about my work. And even though I have slipped through the nets of a hundred generations, every two-bit Director is just so sure he\u2019ll be the one to bring this antique into the reliquary that is her rightful place. Chernobyl was the closest you ever came, and you were still //pretty damn far//.\n\n\n\nI told you: if I could not adapt to the world as it is, I would have gone mad eons ago. And yet every time one of your technicians invent some new gimmick you try to catch me with it. The Scythians tried riding me down with their precious cavalry, old Rameses had a go with chariots, Metternich cornered me with grenadiers, De Gaulle\u2019s goons poisoned me with some fancy paralytic. All of them are decorating the east wall of the lab, now. Don\u2019t look! I just said I want your teeth, and the vomit does terrible things to the enamel.\n\n\n\nAnd your precious Coalition, with their newest hack. These unbinding mechanists have made a right mess. You know a month ago, the thrall they were interviewing on TV, where they had to keep redacting segments of her life story because her master was a wanted criminal? That was //me//! I mean, the embarrassment I felt, I just wanted a hole to open up and swallow her. Having my reputation tarnished in front of half the country by a spare worker! I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on an unbinder and see what makes them tick for just //so// long.\n\n\n\nSo: thank you for putting together this whole operation. I was worried they might not bother, but it seems Vanguard has rubbed off on them. They were just so filled with //humanitarian concern// that they brought one! So sweet. I should have the countermeasure up by next week.\n\n\n\nWhy on Earth did you step up as bait?\u00a0\u00a0Did you think they\u2019d pull you out while you were still recognisable? Because I can promise you that even if they did cage me, you are not in a fixable state.\n\n\n\nHm. I do not think the word for what you have done here is //bravery//, exactly; even we Levantine hunter-gatherers had words for \u201csuicidal\u201d. It should make your cerebrum an interesting reagent, if nothing else.\n\n\n\nAh, and here they come. They\u2019re just going through the chaff upstairs. I do wish you\u2019d never invented gunpowder. Those things are just far too loud.\n\n\n\nEve! Come on upstairs, dear. There are some very rude men upstairs.\n\n\n\nYes, isn\u2019t she just adorable? It took me a while to work out the telescoping ribcage. Put that away, darling, you\u2019re getting lymph everywhere. And those fingernails! I\u2019ll have you know they can hit a sparrow at half a kilometre.\n\n\n\nJust go on up, sweet.\n\n\n\nDinner\u2019s served.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wide-image-sizer\">:scp-wiki:component:wide-image-sizer</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/girlraisingproject/light.jpg |\n\ncaption=When I was a child, I dreamt of the paradise I was promised my spirit would one day rise to.

If I hadn\u2019t made you guys help me, you\u2019d still be free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> inducted <em>you</em> into the Serpent\u2019s Hand,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe knew the risks and chose to take them. Resistance is dangerous. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the Jailors\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. You wouldn\u2019t have come to this place if it weren\u2019t for me, and it all turned out to be for nothing. Evan was\u2026\u201d I look up at him. I see no confusion, only concern. He knows. Of course he does. Jack and Mike saw Evan betray me. It was probably the first thing they told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing an MTF uniform. He was eating with them. I was so stupid to trust him.\u201d An edge of anger creeps into my voice. Anger at Evan, for betraying me, and anger at myself, for falling for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us knew it was a possibility,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was wearing a uniform!\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t make a mistake, but a lot of people probably would have done the same thing. Besides, at least your brother hasn\u2019t been suffering this whole time. He\u2019s probably better off in that task force than in a cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened is worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s an enemy, now. He betrayed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean admits. He looks at me for a moment and seems to think better of continuing to speak, as if afraid his opinion on the issue would offend me.</p>\n<p>I take a moment to contemplate what he\u2019s suggesting, that Evan rotting miserable in a cell for six years would have been worse than what happened.</p>\n<p>I spent six years having nightmares about my brother rotting alone in a cell. The entire time he was gone, I had no idea how he was being treated. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was still alive.</p>\n<p>Once I entered the Library and learned about the Foundation, the fearful unknown was replaced with a vivid image of Evan being treated the way Sean was treated as a teenager, the way most humanoid anomalies are treated by the Foundation. Do I really wish I\u2019d found Evan like that?</p>\n<p>I have to, don\u2019t I? Not because I want him to suffer, but because, if he\u2019d been a prisoner, he would have followed me to the Wanderer\u2019s Library. I\u2019d have brought him into the Hand, and my parents would\u2019ve finally learned that their son was still alive.</p>\n<p>A new image flashes in my head. Somewhere, right now, my mom is in tears, believing that she outlived both of her sons. The Jailors surely faked my death just as they did Evan\u2019s, so now my parents think they\u2019ve lost both their children.</p>\n<p>Evan knew they\u2019d do that when he helped the Jailors capture me. Whatever misery she\u2019s suffering now, it\u2019s his fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been okay since we last saw you?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>Of course not. No one in containment is okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to worry about each other,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere\u2019s no helping that.\u201d</p>\n<p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell them what I\u2019ve been doing. I don\u2019t want to tell them that I\u2019ve also been helping the Jailors. Even though they trained me not to. Even though they spent months teaching me to shut down and give our enemies nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t lie to them, though. I can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t failed them. That would be yet another betrayal.</p>\n<p>Tears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping them, too,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asks. There it is. The anger I deserve. It\u2019s almost comforting, knowing that, at least after this, I won\u2019t be able to disappoint them any further.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been letting them use my powers,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve been putting people in front of me, civilians, victims of mind-control, and I\u2019ve been curing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Sean asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, and the tidbit of information I used to get the four of us in here. It was about the Fifth Church. I don\u2019t think they could use it against the Hand. Still\u2026 I failed you. You trained me to ignore them, to force my mind out of my body and give them nothing. Instead, I\u2019ve been letting them manipulate and bargain with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey put a victim in front of me, someone who\u2019d been cursed. I tried to do the fire thing. I tried to summon a vivid image to my mind and ignore them like you trained me to, but I only held out for a few minutes before I gave in and cured them of the spell that was torturing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>I expect anger. Judgement. Disappointment. Failing that, I expect some sugarcoating attempt to cheer me up. The last thing I expect is the genuine relief that passes across their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a horrible thing for them to do,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not holding out,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that they can use me to cure people, my brother is free to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but given that he\u2019s a loyal Jailor, it\u2019s probably bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sean says, \u201cI hate them too, but, if I had your powers, and if they locked me in a room with someone like that, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. It might\u2019ve even been the right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>I look up at him. Is he serious? Could he really have just said that? \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m helping them,\u201d I say. \u201cHow could that be the right thing to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doing anything that helps them hurt anyone?\u201d Jack asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot directly,\u201d I admit, after a moment, \u201cbut what I\u2019m doing used to be my brother\u2019s primary job. Now that I\u2019m doing it, he\u2019s free to go do Jailor things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d refused to treat those people,\u201d Mike asks, \u201cwould the Jailors have used Evan to cure them, or would he be off doing whatever he\u2019s doing, leaving them untreated?\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes me a moment to process the significance of this question. \u201cThe latter,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Evan said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I think you made the right choice,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThose people don\u2019t deserve to languish in a containment cell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least you got the Jailors to let someone go,\u201d Jack adds.</p>\n<p>I stare up at them.</p>\n<p>The argument they just made, Evan also made it when he tried to recruit me to the Jailors right after he captured me.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI decrease the number of people in Foundation custody. Before I came around, there were hundreds of mental anomalies whose victims had to be kept in containment for the rest of their lives. I\u2019ve cured thousands of people like that, allowing them to be sent back to their families. I\u2019ve freed more people from Foundation containment than the Serpent\u2019s Hand ever will.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Am I really hearing the same argument from Sean?</p>\n<p>I try to keep my shock off my face, but, clearly, I\u2019m failing.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jack says, \u201call we\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re being forced to make hard choices in here. Try to cut yourself some slack, okay? You\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The best I can?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 actually think that?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Sean says. The others nod in agreement.</p>\n<p>Could it be that they\u2019re just saying this to cheer me up?</p>\n<p>No. They wouldn\u2019t lie to me like that. They wouldn\u2019t treat me like a child. If they\u2019re saying my decision is understandable, perhaps even <em>defensible</em>, that\u2019s what they honestly believe.</p>\n<p>I want to argue back, to explain why they should be disappointed in me, but I can\u2019t find the words, and after I spend close to a minute trying and trying to think of something to say, I once again cave to temptation, and change the subject. \u201cHow have you guys been?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been worse off than me.</p>\n<p>Sean was moved to Site-17 almost immediately after his capture, and he\u2019s been in high security containment ever since. All three of them have suffered the same mind-numbing isolation, only they haven\u2019t had interactions with Evan, Dr. Light, my patients, or any other scrap of human contact. They\u2019ve been completely alone for months.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer like that for my failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got us out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to you we\u2019re in here. We can never thank you enough for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the least I could do, after getting you stuck here,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe embarked on this mission together. We got captured together. We got in here together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d still be out if it weren\u2019t for me,\u201d I repeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been on your mission, we would\u2019ve been on another,\u201d Sean says. \u201cIt could have gone South, just like this one did. If that had happened, we probably never would have escaped solitary.\u201d</p>\n<p>My eyes are moist. I shake my head, but, once again, I\u2019m not able to formulate an argument. I did get them out of high security containment, and taking Light\u2019s deal was the only way I could\u2019ve done that. In almost any other situation, that would\u2019ve been impossible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d I say. \u201cI had to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We embarked on this mission together, we failed together, and we\u2019re still together now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The others seem to agree with that, and I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with them.</p>\n<p>The heavy conversation dies down after that, and we set about just spending time together. We spend some time on the foosball table, and another chunk of time watching TV.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another music video on, by the pop star Jimmy Pheonix. He\u2019s a young singer, around Evan\u2019s age. He exploded onto the scene about half a decade ago and has become one of the most popular musicians in the world.</p>\n<p>His style could be best described as aggressively inoffensive, one of those pop stars cooked up in a corporate boardroom for maximumly broad appeal. I\u2019m sure people who care deeply about music regard him as absolute trash. For example:</p>\n<p>\u201cGods, do they have to play this?\u201d Mike asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, I think it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>The other two turn to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Mike says, looking away. \u201cYou can like whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably an actual reason they\u2019re playing this,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why they\u2019d actively want to rot our brains with something mindless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the four chords.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of his songs use the four chords,\u201d Jack says. \u201cDo you even know which chords the \u2018four chords of pop music\u2019 are?\u201d</p>\n<p>After half a minute of embarrassing silence, Mike admits he does not.</p>\n<p>Socialization goes on for two hours. When it\u2019s over, me and my comrades are allowed to exchange goodbyes, then we\u2019re sent back to our cells.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re all still prisoners. They\u2019re still suffering immensely for my failure, but at least I\u2019m lightening their burden. At least they\u2019re with friends, some of the time.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s pathetic that the bar has sunk so low, but this is the best day I\u2019ve had in months. I can only hope it was for them, too. That\u2019s the least I owe them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Evan</strong></p>\n<p>Callum tilts his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he admits, \u201cyou have me curious. What\u2019s this epiphany you\u2019ve had?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know who Veronica Hall is?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe magician?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Fifthist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she? I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s probably a lie, but it\u2019s not an important one right now, so Evan doesn\u2019t allow himself to get distracted by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI talked to her yesterday,\u201d Evan says. \u201cShe said some very interesting things. She knew about the Galaxy Plaza ritual, and she seemed to think of <em>you</em> as the one primarily responsible for its failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum raises a brow. \u201cDid she? I will admit that\u2019s a bit interesting. I suppose it could be seen as my fault. The ritual might have worked if I hadn\u2019t had it moved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he says. For a second, he has to fight down his nerves. He\u2019s about to make a big claim. If he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to make himself look really stupid, which could permanently damage his rapport with Callum.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not wrong, though. His theory makes sense. It explains everything. It explains what all of this has to do with Cassidy Redwood. It explains why Callum chose to meddle with such an important ritual, when he could have easily taken revenge on Evan in another way. It explains how Callum could have been foolish enough to think that a ritual designed to require thousands of sacrifices would still work with only a few dozen.</p>\n<p>Or, rather, it explains that he was never that foolish.</p>\n<p>Evan looks Callum right in the eye. \u201cI think you got the ritual moved to Galaxy Plaza knowing that would cause it to fail,\u201d Evan says. \u201cI think you wanted it to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Callum is frozen. He\u2019s clearly surprised. But is it the correctness of the claim that has him shocked, or its absurdity?</p>\n<p>The smile that slowly creeps across Callum\u2019s face does little to resolve this ambiguity. \u201cOh?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHall said something very interesting to me yesterday. <em>\u2018I told them that what didn\u2019t work for Redwood wouldn\u2019t work for us.\u2019</em> She meant Cassidy Redwood, the Ortothan who tried and failed to resurrect her god with a blood sacrifice. Redwood left behind extensive notes detailing how she tried to reduce the number of sacrifices her ritual required.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted that you approached your father and asked him to move the ritual to Galaxy Plaza. I always took it for granted that you had enough pull with him to get him to say yes, but that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it? This ritual was the most important thing the church had ever attempted. There\u2019s no way your father would allow its effectiveness to be jeopardized just so you could get revenge against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it was moved,\u201d Callum observes. \u201cClearly I <em>did</em> manage to convince the Church to move it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in order to do that, you had to pair your proposal with an argument that the ritual would still work. You had to provide some kind of explanation, grounded in thaumaturgic theory, for why such a tiny number of sacrifices would still be enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the giant machine Cassidy Redwood built? There was nothing like that at the Galaxy Plaza.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you altered the details of the plan. You didn\u2019t need to use every trick she did. You just borrowed enough ideas to create a somewhat convincing case that the ritual could be completed with fewer sacrifices. You didn\u2019t even need to admit you got the idea from Redwood. Maybe Hall just made that connection later. Either way, you must have told them something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you know I was lying?\u201d Callum asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I have honestly believed the ritual would work with fewer sacrifices?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You know magical theory too well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a Fifthist. The same people who tried to take a bus to another solar system, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019d been interacting with me for months. Fifthism\u2019s grip on your mind had weakened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes one more second to push down his nerves. It\u2019s time for the killing blow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think that weakened grip <em>just</em> made you too smart to think the ritual would still work. I think it made you want it to fail. I think, after months of being friends with me, my voice eroding the Starfish\u2019s influence on you, a tiny bit of your conscience showed itself, just enough that you didn\u2019t want to end the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum stares up at Evan for several seconds. Slowly, as if out to milk the tension in the room for as long as he can, he closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cTsk, tsk, Evan. For a second, I really thought you had it all figured out, but then you had to start blabbering about my conscience.\u201d He pauses for a moment, then looks Evan right in the eye. \u201cMy choice to sabotage the ritual had nothing to do with morality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what did it have to do with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realized that I liked the world the way it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that different?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it had less than nothing to do with other people\u2019s wellbeing. Before you had me captured, I had money, power, and magic, and I was in a position to lord those things over the masses who lacked them. Most people didn\u2019t even know magic existed. None of them had any way of protecting themselves against my spells. I could do whatever I wanted. I could make them do whatever I wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Evan grimace. Jerry said something similar, a while back, that the Veil helps the world\u2019s monsters by ensuring ordinary people don\u2019t know how to defend themselves against them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the appeal of it,\u201d Callum continues. \u201cIn a clueless world, there was nothing stopping me from taking anything I wanted. I wanted a tome of arcane lore? I made someone sell it to me for a pittance. I wanted the hottest girl I knew to date me? She did. Everything I wanted, I got. I had power, and other people didn\u2019t. Do you know enough about Fifthist doctrine to know what\u2019s supposed to happen once the Fifth Church finally wins?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world turns into a hellscape based on the Starfish\u2019s warped imagination.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd with that newfound power, the Starfish destroys the barrier between desire and reality. All desires become real. <em>All</em> desires. Everyone would be able to bend reality to their whim, and if they decided they wanted to bend me, they\u2019d be just as likely to succeed as they\u2019d be to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy would a wolf want the helpless sheep he fed on to become wolves as well? My family\u2019s money wouldn\u2019t matter. My magic wouldn\u2019t be anything special. Everyone on earth would become my peer, and I don\u2019t want peers. I want the kind of power that can only exist in an ordered world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan stares at Callum. Somehow, even though Evan\u2019s initial guess was mostly right, Callum still managed to surprise and disappoint him.</p>\n<p>Maybe Evan should have known better. He wants so badly to believe his high-school best friend is buried somewhere deep inside Callum, but maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe that person was only ever a mask, and the real Callum could only have sick, selfish reasons to do anything, even save the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was right about the rest of it, though?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight enough that I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Callum admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I said I moved the ritual to Galaxy Plaza because I wanted revenge against you. I really did hate you for taking so much power away from me. At the same time, with the help of your magic voice, I\u2019d come to recognize that the Church\u2019s ultimate victory would, in its own way, do the same, so I hatched a plan to take care of both problems at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got my hands on Cassidy Redwood\u2019s notes. I drafted a similar proposal for our ritual and presented it to my father. I argued that the smaller number of sacrifices would attract less attention. Bullshit, of course. I knew a few dozen sacrifices could never be enough. I knew that the only thing my new ritual would succeed at doing was luring you into danger. I told you something would happen, knowing you\u2019d show up and try to save everyone. I thought you\u2019d run in and get yourself killed, and once you did, everything would be back to the way it was before I met you, with me ruling as crown prince over a town of magicless simpletons.\u201d</p>\n<p>There it is, then. After six years, the full truth about the Galaxy Plaza disaster, with no loose ends or lingering questions.</p>\n<p>As cathartic as it is to see it all laid out, Evan needs more than that to save the world again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the Church were going to try the same ritual again,\u201d Evan says, \u201cwhat kind of venue would they need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t insult my intelligence by pretending you\u2019re talking about a hypothetical. You\u2019re here because something happened. Just come out and tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan sighs. On paper, he isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose the situation to Callum. However, Callum\u2019s talking right now because Evan earned a bit of his respect by figuring out what he did six years ago. For Callum to continue talking, Evan needs to keep that respect.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I admit it. They\u2019re trying again. What kind of venue do they need?\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful to hear. I hope they succeed. I certainly won\u2019t be telling you anything that would help you stop them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just established that you don\u2019t want the world to end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>didn\u2019t</em> want it to end six years ago. My circumstances have changed since then. I no longer have money, power, or freedom. I\u2019m not in a position to lord my magic over anyone. Compared to my life in here, maybe the Fifth Church\u2019s new world would be an upgrade?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir new world would be hell for anyone sane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of it; there wouldn\u2019t be anyone sane.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan shakes his head. \u201cI would still be sane, as would anyone I chose to interact with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think I <em>don\u2019t</em> want you to experience eternal torment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if I can drag you down with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>That finally wipes the smile off Callum\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Evan says, \u201cif the Fifth Church does remake the world, and it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t tell me how to stop it, I will make <em>sure</em> you\u2019re perfectly sane until the end of time. I will find you, and I will force you to endure every second of our new eternity just as agonizingly lucid as me.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment of trepidation, Callum shakes his head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t capable of that kind of vindictiveness. If the world is already beyond saving, you won\u2019t torture me just out of spite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn most situations, you\u2019d be right,\u201d Evan admits, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting something. Jerry has my powers. He\u2019d also be sane, trapped in an insane world of eternal torment.\u201d Evan looks Callum in the eye. \u201cI swear to you, if that happens to my little brother, and it\u2019s your fault, I will <em>happily</em> dedicate the rest of my existence to punishing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Callum meets his gaze for a moment. His smugness falters.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Callum says, through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does the ritual work, and how would we stop it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>Starlight Saga</em> books have a memetic agent inside of them, similar to the one we put in <em>Star Signals</em>,\u201d Callum says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We tested them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tested whether the books have any effect on your stupid D-Class. Your tests came back negative because the meme doesn\u2019t do anything after it\u2019s first implanted. It just lingers there, waiting to be activated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActivated?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the ritual is for. It\u2019s all part of a deal we made with an extra-universal entity. A tiny piece of that being\u2019s essence is implanted in everyone who reads those books.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Evan asks. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s read <em>the Starlight Saga</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Callum\u2019s smugness returns. \u201cEvery last one. As we speak, our trigger waits, latent, in tens of millions of readers all over the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes a step backwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce we give the entity the sacrifice we owe it,\u201d Callum continues, \u201cit\u2019ll activate the trigger. All those minds will be ours, and they\u2019ll start remaking the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tens of millions. Tens of millions of people. The implications are so heavy that it\u2019s hard to stay standing. \u201cTens of millions would start to develop Ojai syndrome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t \u2018start to\u2019 develop it. They\u2019d become fully affected, instantly, just as if they\u2019d read <em>Star Signals</em> cover to cover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInstantly\u2026\u201d Evan doesn\u2019t want to show Callum\u2019s weakness, but he can\u2019t keep the horror off his face. For that many people to fall fully under the control of the Fifth Church would be the greatest disaster in human history, anomalous or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Callum\u2019s delight is no less obvious than Evan\u2019s fear. \u201cThe problem with <em>Star Signals</em> is that it was too slow. We\u2019d barely started to spread the book when you identified it as a threat and started shutting us down, so the Church created a new memetic agent which would activate all at once, after it was already widespread. Once those millions of minds are under the Church\u2019s control, they\u2019ll begin the same ritual the <em>Star Signals</em> readers started, and, about two weeks later, the world will be remade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan takes a deep breath. Focus. He can\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed. He needs to keep his head in the game. His job is to save the world. That\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we figure out when and where the sacrifice will take place?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I interfered, the Church was going to do it at some massive nerd convention in California.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe people we sacrifice have to be affected by the memetic agent. Part of the deal. Something about the entity getting to keep their souls. If the Church is planning to try again, they\u2019ll pick somewhere where thousands of <em>Starlight Saga</em> readers have gathered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back at the height of those books\u2019 popularity, any large gathering of sci-fi fans would be full of people who\u2019ve read them. Six years later\u2026 honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be that different. There\u2019d be thousands of events that could potentially qualify, and even if the Foundation identified and stopped one, all that would do is buy a bit of time. So long as that seed is prevalent, the Church can try again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there any way of purging that memetic seed from people?\u201d Evan asks.</p>\n<p>Callum shrugs. \u201cYou might be able to do it. You\u2019re pretty good at cleaning magic gunk out of people\u2019s brains. Still, given how many people there are to cure, and given that you have no way of identifying them, I don\u2019t like your odds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan doesn\u2019t like the Foundation\u2019s odds, either.</p>\n<p>The Foundation\u2019s people need to have a very, very long talk about this information, and that talk needs to begin as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s all my questions for now,\u201d Evan says. \u201cThank you. What you just said might save the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say? Threatening to torture someone for all eternity is a good way to get their secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, you\u2019ve done a good thing today. Maybe there\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvan, it\u2019s been five minutes since we went over this. You haven\u2019t dug up some faint echo of my better nature. I don\u2019t have a better nature. I said what I said because you threatened me. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Evan says. \u201cGoodbye, then. Me or another Foundation agent may be back with more questions later. Be candid with them, or else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Goodbye, and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost enough to goad Evan into taking the last word, but that\u2019d be as much of a victory for Callum as anything. Evan leaves.</p>\n<p>Light is waiting outside. \u201cGood work,\u201d she says, though there isn\u2019t any cheer in her voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Evan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m arranging an emergency meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Light\u2019s gaze lingers on him for a moment. He meets it. He does his best to force the worry off of his face.</p>\n<p>She can probably still see it. After, he can tell she\u2019s doing the same. The truth is, unless everything Callum just said is completely wrong, this is the gravest situation Evan has ever faced. Unless the Foundation does something very clever, very quickly, tens of millions of minds are going to be brought under the Fifth Church\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>Once that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s hard to imagine how even the Foundation could save the world.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-hub\">Series Hub</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster\">\u25c0\u25c0 First Entry</a> | <a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall\">\u25c0 Previous Entry</a> | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent\">Next Entry \u25b6</a></p>\n<p><sub><a href=\"/xhawk77x\">More by this Author</a></sub></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/i-didn-t-forget-pt-18-callum-michaels\">I Didn't Forget Pt 18: Callum Michaels</a>\" by XHAWK77X, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The former Fifthist looks up at him from across the table, smug as ever.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we really doing this again so soon?\u201d Callum asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be different this time,\u201d Evan says.\n\n\n\nCallum sighs. \u201cFine. It\u2019s not like I have anything better to do. I suppose you have more questions?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. This time, I think I have answers.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Jerry**\n\n\n\nThe day after I made my arrangement with Dr. Light, I\u2019m escorted to the medium security socialization area after a long day treating civilians with mental afflictions.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a well-guarded room, totally enclosed and located deep within Site-17.\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of chairs and tables in the room, along with a handful of entertainment objects. There are some board games on shelves in the corner. There\u2019s a foosball table near the center, and a television on the wall that is currently showing a music video.\n\n\n\nHowever, each of these amenities is carefully controlled. All furniture is nailed to the floor or affixed firmly to the wall. There\u2019s nothing in the room that can be thrown or used as a weapon, and nothing that could allow prisoners to communicate with the outside world.\n\n\n\nAdd to that the heavy metal door, the armed guards, and the fact that any escaping humanoid would have an entire facility to navigate before they got out, and this room is quite secure.\n\n\n\nStill, for members of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, to be allowed in here is an enormous privilege, one the Foundation is granting only on an extremely probative basis.\n\n\n\nLight neglected to mention that part of the deal. The Foundation is allowing us in here in exchange for the information I gave, but if any of us piss off the Jailors, we\u2019ll all be yanked back into solitary confinement.\n\n\n\nThat means I can\u2019t fuck up. I can\u2019t do anything that would prompt the Jailors to take this away from my comrades. Even though I know that\u2019s exactly what the Jailors want me to think, I still can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s my fault Sean and the others got captured. I can\u2019t do anything that would make their captivity worse.\n\n\n\nThere are around two dozen humanoids in medium security. Most of them are strangers, but my eyes snap right to the ones who are familiar.\n\n\n\nThere, sitting in a corner, already talking to each other, are Jack, Mike, and Sean. They turn to look at me as I enter the room.\n\n\n\nI look back at them. They wear the same bluish uniforms all imprisoned anomalies wear, but I don\u2019t see any wounds or scars. Their mood is somber, but they don\u2019t seem broken.\n\n\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the clusterfuck I dragged them into, they\u2019re doing a lot better than they could be.\n\n\n\nThat should make me feel better, but it doesn\u2019t. If it weren\u2019t for me, they\u2019d still be free. They gave up their freedom for me, for my mission, a mission that was doomed from the start.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the guards undo my cuffs, I run up to them. I hug all three of them in turn, tears trickling to the floor beneath me. Words I\u2019ve wanted to say for months come spilling out of me like water from a burst pipe. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I pulled you into all this.\u201d\n\n\n\nSean shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not my fault just to make me feel better. You got captured trying to rescue my brother. If I hadn\u2019t made you guys help me, you\u2019d still be free.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c//I// inducted //you// into the Serpent\u2019s Hand,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe knew the risks and chose to take them. Resistance is dangerous. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the Jailors\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nI shake my head. \u201cNo. You wouldn\u2019t have come to this place if it weren\u2019t for me, and it all turned out to be for nothing. Evan was\u2026\u201d I look up at him. I see no confusion, only concern. He knows. Of course he does. Jack and Mike saw Evan betray me. It was probably the first thing they told him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing an MTF uniform. He was eating with them. I was so stupid to trust him.\u201d An edge of anger creeps into my voice. Anger at Evan, for betraying me, and anger at myself, for falling for it.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of us knew it was a possibility,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was wearing a uniform!\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t make a mistake, but a lot of people probably would have done the same thing. Besides, at least your brother hasn\u2019t been suffering this whole time. He\u2019s probably better off in that task force than in a cell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened is worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s an enemy, now. He betrayed me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sean admits. He looks at me for a moment and seems to think better of continuing to speak, as if afraid his opinion on the issue would offend me.\n\n\n\nI take a moment to contemplate what he\u2019s suggesting, that Evan rotting miserable in a cell for six years would have been worse than what happened.\n\n\n\nI spent six years having nightmares about my brother rotting alone in a cell. The entire time he was gone, I had no idea how he was being treated. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was still alive.\n\n\n\nOnce I entered the Library and learned about the Foundation, the fearful unknown was replaced with a vivid image of Evan being treated the way Sean was treated as a teenager, the way most humanoid anomalies are treated by the Foundation. Do I really wish I\u2019d found Evan like that?\n\n\n\nI have to, don\u2019t I? Not because I want him to suffer, but because, if he\u2019d been a prisoner, he would have followed me to the Wanderer\u2019s Library. I\u2019d have brought him into the Hand, and my parents would\u2019ve finally learned that their son was still alive.\n\n\n\nA new image flashes in my head. Somewhere, right now, my mom is in tears, believing that she outlived both of her sons. The Jailors surely faked my death just as they did Evan\u2019s, so now my parents think they\u2019ve lost both their children.\n\n\n\nEvan knew they\u2019d do that when he helped the Jailors capture me. Whatever misery she\u2019s suffering now, it\u2019s his fault.\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you been okay since we last saw you?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\nOf course not. No one in containment is okay.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to worry about each other,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere\u2019s no helping that.\u201d\n\n\n\nI close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell them what I\u2019ve been doing. I don\u2019t want to tell them that I\u2019ve also been helping the Jailors. Even though they trained me not to. Even though they spent months teaching me to shut down and give our enemies nothing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t lie to them, though. I can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t failed them. That would be yet another betrayal.\n\n\n\nTears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping them, too,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asks. There it is. The anger I deserve. It\u2019s almost comforting, knowing that, at least after this, I won\u2019t be able to disappoint them any further.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been letting them use my powers,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve been putting people in front of me, civilians, victims of mind-control, and I\u2019ve been curing them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Sean asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, and the tidbit of information I used to get the four of us in here. It was about the Fifth Church. I don\u2019t think they could use it against the Hand. Still\u2026 I failed you. You trained me to ignore them, to force my mind out of my body and give them nothing. Instead, I\u2019ve been letting them manipulate and bargain with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey put a victim in front of me, someone who\u2019d been cursed. I tried to do the fire thing. I tried to summon a vivid image to my mind and ignore them like you trained me to, but I only held out for a few minutes before I gave in and cured them of the spell that was torturing them.\u201d\n\n\n\nI expect anger. Judgement. Disappointment. Failing that, I expect some sugarcoating attempt to cheer me up. The last thing I expect is the genuine relief that passes across their faces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was a horrible thing for them to do,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not holding out,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that they can use me to cure people, my brother is free to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but given that he\u2019s a loyal Jailor, it\u2019s probably bad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Sean says, \u201cI hate them too, but, if I had your powers, and if they locked me in a room with someone like that, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. It might\u2019ve even been the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nI look up at him. Is he serious? Could he really have just said that? \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m helping them,\u201d I say. \u201cHow could that be the right thing to do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you doing anything that helps them hurt anyone?\u201d Jack asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot directly,\u201d I admit, after a moment, \u201cbut what I\u2019m doing used to be my brother\u2019s primary job. Now that I\u2019m doing it, he\u2019s free to go do Jailor things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d refused to treat those people,\u201d Mike asks, \u201cwould the Jailors have used Evan to cure them, or would he be off doing whatever he\u2019s doing, leaving them untreated?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt takes me a moment to process the significance of this question. \u201cThe latter,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Evan said.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I think you made the right choice,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThose people don\u2019t deserve to languish in a containment cell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least you got the Jailors to let someone go,\u201d Jack adds.\n\n\n\nI stare up at them.\n\n\n\nThe argument they just made, Evan also made it when he tried to recruit me to the Jailors right after he captured me.\n\n\n\n//\u201cI decrease the number of people in Foundation custody. Before I came around, there were hundreds of mental anomalies whose victims had to be kept in containment for the rest of their lives. I\u2019ve cured thousands of people like that, allowing them to be sent back to their families. I\u2019ve freed more people from Foundation containment than the Serpent\u2019s Hand ever will.\u201d//\n\n\n\nAm I really hearing the same argument from Sean?\n\n\n\nI try to keep my shock off my face, but, clearly, I\u2019m failing.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Jack says, \u201call we\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re being forced to make hard choices in here. Try to cut yourself some slack, okay? You\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe best I can?\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 actually think that?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Sean says. The others nod in agreement.\n\n\n\nCould it be that they\u2019re just saying this to cheer me up?\n\n\n\nNo. They wouldn\u2019t lie to me like that. They wouldn\u2019t treat me like a child. If they\u2019re saying my decision is understandable, perhaps even //defensible//, that\u2019s what they honestly believe.\n\n\n\nI want to argue back, to explain why they should be disappointed in me, but I can\u2019t find the words, and after I spend close to a minute trying and trying to think of something to say, I once again cave to temptation, and change the subject. \u201cHow have you guys been?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ve been worse off than me.\n\n\n\nSean was moved to Site-17 almost immediately after his capture, and he\u2019s been in high security containment ever since. All three of them have suffered the same mind-numbing isolation, only they haven\u2019t had interactions with Evan, Dr. Light, my patients, or any other scrap of human contact. They\u2019ve been completely alone for months.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer like that for my failure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou got us out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to you we\u2019re in here. We can never thank you enough for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was the least I could do, after getting you stuck here,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe embarked on this mission together. We got captured together. We got in here together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d still be out if it weren\u2019t for me,\u201d I repeat.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been on your mission, we would\u2019ve been on another,\u201d Sean says. \u201cIt could have gone South, just like this one did. If that had happened, we probably never would have escaped solitary.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy eyes are moist. I shake my head, but, once again, I\u2019m not able to formulate an argument. I did get them out of high security containment, and taking Light\u2019s deal was the only way I could\u2019ve done that. In almost any other situation, that would\u2019ve been impossible.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d I say. \u201cI had to help you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean says. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We embarked on this mission together, we failed together, and we\u2019re still together now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe others seem to agree with that, and I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with them.\n\n\n\nThe heavy conversation dies down after that, and we set about just spending time together. We spend some time on the foosball table, and another chunk of time watching TV.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another music video on, by the pop star Jimmy Pheonix. He\u2019s a young singer, around Evan\u2019s age. He exploded onto the scene about half a decade ago and has become one of the most popular musicians in the world.\n\n\n\nHis style could be best described as aggressively inoffensive, one of those pop stars cooked up in a corporate boardroom for maximumly broad appeal. I\u2019m sure people who care deeply about music regard him as absolute trash. For example:\n\n\n\n\u201cGods, do they have to play this?\u201d Mike asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\n\u201cEh, I think it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\nThe other two turn to look at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mike says, looking away. \u201cYou can like whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably an actual reason they\u2019re playing this,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why they\u2019d actively want to rot our brains with something mindless.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the four chords.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of his songs use the four chords,\u201d Jack says. \u201cDo you even know which chords the \u2018four chords of pop music\u2019 are?\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter half a minute of embarrassing silence, Mike admits he does not.\n\n\n\nSocialization goes on for two hours. When it\u2019s over, me and my comrades are allowed to exchange goodbyes, then we\u2019re sent back to our cells.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re all still prisoners. They\u2019re still suffering immensely for my failure, but at least I\u2019m lightening their burden. At least they\u2019re with friends, some of the time.\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s pathetic that the bar has sunk so low, but this is the best day I\u2019ve had in months. I can only hope it was for them, too. That\u2019s the least I owe them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Evan**\n\n\n\nCallum tilts his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he admits, \u201cyou have me curious. What\u2019s this epiphany you\u2019ve had?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know who Veronica Hall is?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe magician?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Fifthist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs she? I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s probably a lie, but it\u2019s not an important one right now, so Evan doesn\u2019t allow himself to get distracted by it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI talked to her yesterday,\u201d Evan says. \u201cShe said some very interesting things. She knew about the Galaxy Plaza ritual, and she seemed to think of //you// as the one primarily responsible for its failure.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum raises a brow. \u201cDid she? I will admit that\u2019s a bit interesting. I suppose it could be seen as my fault. The ritual might have worked if I hadn\u2019t had it moved.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he says. For a second, he has to fight down his nerves. He\u2019s about to make a big claim. If he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to make himself look really stupid, which could permanently damage his rapport with Callum.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong, though. His theory makes sense. It explains everything. It explains what all of this has to do with Cassidy Redwood. It explains why Callum chose to meddle with such an important ritual, when he could have easily taken revenge on Evan in another way. It explains how Callum could have been foolish enough to think that a ritual designed to require thousands of sacrifices would still work with only a few dozen.\n\n\n\nOr, rather, it explains that he was never that foolish.\n\n\n\nEvan looks Callum right in the eye. \u201cI think you got the ritual moved to Galaxy Plaza knowing that would cause it to fail,\u201d Evan says. \u201cI think you wanted it to fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Callum is frozen. He\u2019s clearly surprised. But is it the correctness of the claim that has him shocked, or its absurdity?\n\n\n\nThe smile that slowly creeps across Callum\u2019s face does little to resolve this ambiguity. \u201cOh?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHall said something very interesting to me yesterday. //\u2018I told them that what didn\u2019t work for Redwood wouldn\u2019t work for us.\u2019// She meant Cassidy Redwood, the Ortothan who tried and failed to resurrect her god with a blood sacrifice. Redwood left behind extensive notes detailing how she tried to reduce the number of sacrifices her ritual required.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted that you approached your father and asked him to move the ritual to Galaxy Plaza. I always took it for granted that you had enough pull with him to get him to say yes, but that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it? This ritual was the most important thing the church had ever attempted. There\u2019s no way your father would allow its effectiveness to be jeopardized just so you could get revenge against me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it was moved,\u201d Callum observes. \u201cClearly I //did// manage to convince the Church to move it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd in order to do that, you had to pair your proposal with an argument that the ritual would still work. You had to provide some kind of explanation, grounded in thaumaturgic theory, for why such a tiny number of sacrifices would still be enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the giant machine Cassidy Redwood built? There was nothing like that at the Galaxy Plaza.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you altered the details of the plan. You didn\u2019t need to use every trick she did. You just borrowed enough ideas to create a somewhat convincing case that the ritual could be completed with fewer sacrifices. You didn\u2019t even need to admit you got the idea from Redwood. Maybe Hall just made that connection later. Either way, you must have told them something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd how do you know I was lying?\u201d Callum asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I have honestly believed the ritual would work with fewer sacrifices?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. You know magical theory too well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a Fifthist. The same people who tried to take a bus to another solar system, remember?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d been interacting with me for months. Fifthism\u2019s grip on your mind had weakened.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes one more second to push down his nerves. It\u2019s time for the killing blow.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think that weakened grip //just// made you too smart to think the ritual would still work. I think it made you want it to fail. I think, after months of being friends with me, my voice eroding the Starfish\u2019s influence on you, a tiny bit of your conscience showed itself, just enough that you didn\u2019t want to end the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum stares up at Evan for several seconds. Slowly, as if out to milk the tension in the room for as long as he can, he closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cTsk, tsk, Evan. For a second, I really thought you had it all figured out, but then you had to start blabbering about my conscience.\u201d He pauses for a moment, then looks Evan right in the eye. \u201cMy choice to sabotage the ritual had nothing to do with morality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen what did it have to do with?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI realized that I liked the world the way it was.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that different?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it had less than nothing to do with other people\u2019s wellbeing. Before you had me captured, I had money, power, and magic, and I was in a position to lord those things over the masses who lacked them. Most people didn\u2019t even know magic existed. None of them had any way of protecting themselves against my spells. I could do whatever I wanted. I could make them do whatever I wanted.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat makes Evan grimace. Jerry said something similar, a while back, that the Veil helps the world\u2019s monsters by ensuring ordinary people don\u2019t know how to defend themselves against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the appeal of it,\u201d Callum continues. \u201cIn a clueless world, there was nothing stopping me from taking anything I wanted. I wanted a tome of arcane lore? I made someone sell it to me for a pittance. I wanted the hottest girl I knew to date me? She did. Everything I wanted, I got. I had power, and other people didn\u2019t. Do you know enough about Fifthist doctrine to know what\u2019s supposed to happen once the Fifth Church finally wins?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe world turns into a hellscape based on the Starfish\u2019s warped imagination.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd with that newfound power, the Starfish destroys the barrier between desire and reality. All desires become real. //All// desires. Everyone would be able to bend reality to their whim, and if they decided they wanted to bend me, they\u2019d be just as likely to succeed as they\u2019d be to fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum shakes his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy would a wolf want the helpless sheep he fed on to become wolves as well? My family\u2019s money wouldn\u2019t matter. My magic wouldn\u2019t be anything special. Everyone on earth would become my peer, and I don\u2019t want peers. I want the kind of power that can only exist in an ordered world.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan stares at Callum. Somehow, even though Evan\u2019s initial guess was mostly right, Callum still managed to surprise and disappoint him.\n\n\n\nMaybe Evan should have known better. He wants so badly to believe his high-school best friend is buried somewhere deep inside Callum, but maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe that person was only ever a mask, and the real Callum could only have sick, selfish reasons to do anything, even save the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was right about the rest of it, though?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight enough that I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Callum admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I said I moved the ritual to Galaxy Plaza because I wanted revenge against you. I really did hate you for taking so much power away from me. At the same time, with the help of your magic voice, I\u2019d come to recognize that the Church\u2019s ultimate victory would, in its own way, do the same, so I hatched a plan to take care of both problems at once.\n\n\n\n\u201cI got my hands on Cassidy Redwood\u2019s notes. I drafted a similar proposal for our ritual and presented it to my father. I argued that the smaller number of sacrifices would attract less attention. Bullshit, of course. I knew a few dozen sacrifices could never be enough. I knew that the only thing my new ritual would succeed at doing was luring you into danger. I told you something would happen, knowing you\u2019d show up and try to save everyone. I thought you\u2019d run in and get yourself killed, and once you did, everything would be back to the way it was before I met you, with me ruling as crown prince over a town of magicless simpletons.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere it is, then. After six years, the full truth about the Galaxy Plaza disaster, with no loose ends or lingering questions.\n\n\n\nAs cathartic as it is to see it all laid out, Evan needs more than that to save the world again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Church were going to try the same ritual again,\u201d Evan says, \u201cwhat kind of venue would they need?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t insult my intelligence by pretending you\u2019re talking about a hypothetical. You\u2019re here because something happened. Just come out and tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan sighs. On paper, he isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose the situation to Callum. However, Callum\u2019s talking right now because Evan earned a bit of his respect by figuring out what he did six years ago. For Callum to continue talking, Evan needs to keep that respect.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. I admit it. They\u2019re trying again. What kind of venue do they need?\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful to hear. I hope they succeed. I certainly won\u2019t be telling you anything that would help you stop them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe just established that you don\u2019t want the world to end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI //didn\u2019t// want it to end six years ago. My circumstances have changed since then. I no longer have money, power, or freedom. I\u2019m not in a position to lord my magic over anyone. Compared to my life in here, maybe the Fifth Church\u2019s new world would be an upgrade?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir new world would be hell for anyone sane.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of it; there wouldn\u2019t be anyone sane.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan shakes his head. \u201cI would still be sane, as would anyone I chose to interact with.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you think I //don\u2019t// want you to experience eternal torment?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot if I can drag you down with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat finally wipes the smile off Callum\u2019s face.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Evan says, \u201cif the Fifth Church does remake the world, and it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t tell me how to stop it, I will make //sure// you\u2019re perfectly sane until the end of time. I will find you, and I will force you to endure every second of our new eternity just as agonizingly lucid as me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a moment of trepidation, Callum shakes his head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t capable of that kind of vindictiveness. If the world is already beyond saving, you won\u2019t torture me just out of spite.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn most situations, you\u2019d be right,\u201d Evan admits, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting something. Jerry has my powers. He\u2019d also be sane, trapped in an insane world of eternal torment.\u201d Evan looks Callum in the eye. \u201cI swear to you, if that happens to my little brother, and it\u2019s your fault, I will //happily// dedicate the rest of my existence to punishing you.\u201d\n\n\n\nCallum meets his gaze for a moment. His smugness falters.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Callum says, through gritted teeth.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow does the ritual work, and how would we stop it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe //Starlight Saga// books have a memetic agent inside of them, similar to the one we put in //Star Signals//,\u201d Callum says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We tested them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou tested whether the books have any effect on your stupid D-Class. Your tests came back negative because the meme doesn\u2019t do anything after it\u2019s first implanted. It just lingers there, waiting to be activated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cActivated?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the ritual is for. It\u2019s all part of a deal we made with an extra-universal entity. A tiny piece of that being\u2019s essence is implanted in everyone who reads those books.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Evan asks. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s read //the Starlight Saga//?\u201d\n\n\n\nWith that, Callum\u2019s smugness returns. \u201cEvery last one. As we speak, our trigger waits, latent, in tens of millions of readers all over the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes a step backwards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce we give the entity the sacrifice we owe it,\u201d Callum continues, \u201cit\u2019ll activate the trigger. All those minds will be ours, and they\u2019ll start remaking the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nTens of millions. Tens of millions of people. The implications are so heavy that it\u2019s hard to stay standing. \u201cTens of millions would start to develop Ojai syndrome?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t \u2018start to\u2019 develop it. They\u2019d become fully affected, instantly, just as if they\u2019d read //Star Signals// cover to cover.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInstantly\u2026\u201d Evan doesn\u2019t want to show Callum\u2019s weakness, but he can\u2019t keep the horror off his face. For that many people to fall fully under the control of the Fifth Church would be the greatest disaster in human history, anomalous or otherwise.\n\n\n\nCallum\u2019s delight is no less obvious than Evan\u2019s fear. \u201cThe problem with //Star Signals// is that it was too slow. We\u2019d barely started to spread the book when you identified it as a threat and started shutting us down, so the Church created a new memetic agent which would activate all at once, after it was already widespread. Once those millions of minds are under the Church\u2019s control, they\u2019ll begin the same ritual the //Star Signals// readers started, and, about two weeks later, the world will be remade.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan takes a deep breath. Focus. He can\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed. He needs to keep his head in the game. His job is to save the world. That\u2019s all that matters.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can we figure out when and where the sacrifice will take place?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I interfered, the Church was going to do it at some massive nerd convention in California.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy there?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people we sacrifice have to be affected by the memetic agent. Part of the deal. Something about the entity getting to keep their souls. If the Church is planning to try again, they\u2019ll pick somewhere where thousands of //Starlight Saga// readers have gathered.\u201d\n\n\n\nBack at the height of those books\u2019 popularity, any large gathering of sci-fi fans would be full of people who\u2019ve read them. Six years later\u2026 honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be that different. There\u2019d be thousands of events that could potentially qualify, and even if the Foundation identified and stopped one, all that would do is buy a bit of time. So long as that seed is prevalent, the Church can try again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs there any way of purging that memetic seed from people?\u201d Evan asks.\n\n\n\nCallum shrugs. \u201cYou might be able to do it. You\u2019re pretty good at cleaning magic gunk out of people\u2019s brains. Still, given how many people there are to cure, and given that you have no way of identifying them, I don\u2019t like your odds.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvan doesn\u2019t like the Foundation\u2019s odds, either.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s people need to have a very, very long talk about this information, and that talk needs to begin as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all my questions for now,\u201d Evan says. \u201cThank you. What you just said might save the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? Threatening to torture someone for all eternity is a good way to get their secrets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cStill, you\u2019ve done a good thing today. Maybe there\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEvan, it\u2019s been five minutes since we went over this. You haven\u2019t dug up some faint echo of my better nature. I don\u2019t have a better nature. I said what I said because you threatened me. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Evan says. \u201cGoodbye, then. Me or another Foundation agent may be back with more questions later. Be candid with them, or else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. Goodbye, and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost enough to goad Evan into taking the last word, but that\u2019d be as much of a victory for Callum as anything. Evan leaves.\n\n\n\nLight is waiting outside. \u201cGood work,\u201d she says, though there isn\u2019t any cheer in her voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Evan says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m arranging an emergency meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\n\nLight\u2019s gaze lingers on him for a moment. He meets it. He does his best to force the worry off of his face.\n\n\n\nShe can probably still see it. After, he can tell she\u2019s doing the same. The truth is, unless everything Callum just said is completely wrong, this is the gravest situation Evan has ever faced. Unless the Foundation does something very clever, very quickly, tens of millions of minds are going to be brought under the Fifth Church\u2019s control.\n\n\n\nOnce that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s hard to imagine how even the Foundation could save the world.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[[i-didn-t-forget-hub|Series Hub]]]**\n\n\n\n[[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster|\u25c0\u25c0 First Entry]]] | [[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall|\u25c0 Previous Entry]]] | [[[i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent|Next Entry \u25b6]]]\n\n\n\n,,[[[xhawk77x|More by this Author]]],,\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["i-didn-t-forget-hub", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-17-veronica-hall", "i-didn-t-forget-pt-19-the-memetic-agent", "xhawk77x", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "doctor-light", "fifthist", "first-person", "last-hope", "mystery", "resurrection", "serpents-hand", "tale"], "title": "I Didn't Forget Pt 18: Callum Michaels - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-didn-t-forget-pt-18-callum-michaels", "year": 2026}, "icaran-feathers": {"created_at": "2026-01-08T14:05:00", "creator": "Jacob Conwell", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Jacob Conwell", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jacob-conwell", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, tale.

The exhausted executive idly crept across the hardwood floor towards a rarely used armchair by the window. Beyond, the skyline of the city below stretched on through urban darkness. Shades of white, grey, and black intermingled with the sharp angles of contemporary interior design. These generic shapes all passed his glazed eyes without registering. Torres set himself down, sighed, and then looked around to remind himself of his surroundings. Save for an occasional piece of abstract art in the same minimalist hues of the rest of the apartment, the open concept kitchen/dining room/living room was without decor.</p>\n<p>He turned his gaze to the side table beside the chair. Upon it, in a neat pile organized by his PA, was his non-urgent personal mail from the last so many weeks. The technocrat nodded to himself and began to go through them. Torres paused when a hand addressed letter in familiar writing worked its way to the surface. Unlike the rest of the inane print in the pile, the name of the sender refused to abandon his attention.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Alicia Torres</em></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torres gingerly opened the seal and unfolded the letter inside. He found that it too was hand written. The superfluous flowing script brought with it the memories of the slender woman with long brown hair he had grown up with. As he began to read the contents, it took him a moment to remember the specifics of her voice: soft spoken, and typically offering you just enough rope to hang yourself with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Sim\u00f3n,</em></p>\n<p><em>Normally I feel it would be warranted to call someone with bad news. However, your number seems to change each hour. Even then I am relegated to your assistant who promises me to relay the information on to you. Whether the fact you would rarely respond was due to the message getting lost upon the way, or your own neglect, remains to be seen. As such, this is the path you have left me to reach you.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am writing to inform you that our mother has passed away. Despite the toll the dementia took on her, in the end pneumonia was what claimed her. We plan to bury her in the family plot beside our grandfather. Perhaps if you get this early enough you can be there for the funeral. I've included the details below. You know how to reach me otherwise.</em></p>\n<p><em>Alicia</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torres stared at the letter in silence. As he glanced at the particulars of his mothers funeral he realized that the occasion had already passed.</p>\n<p>\"Damn you,\" he said under his breath.</p>\n<p>He sighed and collected his thoughts. Torres carefully returned the letter to its envelope, and returned it to the stack on the table beside him. The billionaire swiftly produced a cell phone from his person, and within a minimal number of keystrokes was already awaiting his PA's answer.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Torres?\"</p>\n<p>\"I need you to clear my schedule for a few days,\" he replied, brushing aside the grogginess in the young man's voice who answered.</p>\n<p>There was no more time to lose.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Despite his clothes being well out of date in the typical company he kept, Sim\u00f3n Torres still looked the part of one of the world's movers and shakers as he entered an unassuming cafe in the city he was born. Naturally, his security detail remained nearby, though out of sight. While unlikely to be the case, they remained ever vigilant in case such a display drew the wrong type of attention that Torres so frequently craved. Much to his chagrin, outside of the occasional curious glance, few there seemed to recognize him.</p>\n<p>Torres scanned the modest restaurant, his eyes eventually falling onto a slender middle aged woman. What once where gorgeous locks of long brown hair were now streaked with grey. The lines and creases of over half a century of worry and caregiving decorated her brow and, in his mind, made her look older than he knew she was. Her gaze fell upon him almost the instant he walked in the door. He offered her a small smile. She returned with a frown that dripped with disappointment. This caused the captain of industry to blink. While he was no stranger to dishing out such looks, it was rare he was on the receiving end. Eventually she gestured for him to take the seat across the table.</p>\n<p>\"One tinto, please,\" he said to a passing waitress as he took his seat. \"You look well, Alicia. It's good to see you again. How are your children?\"</p>\n<p>\"My children are grown, Sim\u00f3n,\" she replied curtly.</p>\n<p>Torres paused. The images of his rather mediocre niece and nephew flashed through his mind. Infants unto toddlers unto school children unto teenagers. It was when he couldn't remember seeing them beyond that point he realized how long it had been since he had spoken to them in person.</p>\n<p>\"On to bigger and better things then, I suppose?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"They do alright,\" Alicia replied.</p>\n<p>The waitress from before brought Torres his coffee. He graciously accepted the beverage, taking a small sip of the bitter brew before nodding in satisfaction. Modest as the restaurant was, it knew what it was doing. He savored another sip, and finally reached into the interior pocket of his jacket to produce the letter he had received.</p>\n<p>\"Not even an attempt to call?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Don't act like it would have brought you here any quicker,\" Alicia sighed.</p>\n<p>\"Of course it would have,\" Torres frowned. \"This was monstrous of you. I'm deeply hurt.\"</p>\n<p>Alicia didn't respond. Instead, she silently maintained her gaze upon her brother, wholly unimpressed with him. Torres eventually broke his gaze away, and looked into his coffee before taking another sip.</p>\n<p>\"How did she die?\" he eventually asked.</p>\n<p>\"Scared, and lost in her own mind,\" she quickly replied. \"Crying out for a husband who was dead, and a son who was nowhere to be found in the mansion in which he locked her away.\"</p>\n<p>Torres's cup made a clang as he aggressively set it down. The typical veneer of smugness and superiority melted away, and a scowl of true anger took its place.</p>\n<p>\"How dare you,\" he hissed. \"I ensured she had everything she could have possibly have wanted. The finest house, the finest doctors, the finest caregivers! I ensured you had <em>everything.</em> You couldn't even begin to imagine the mountains I've moved. The enemies I've made. And this is what you do? Bite the hand that feeds you? Who do you think you are?\"</p>\n<p>A small smile crept upon Alicia's face as she conceded with a nod.</p>\n<p>\"You're right, of course,\" she said. \"You helped provide us all with a life of comfort that few can imagine. I was able to quit my job and guide our mother through her failing health. None of that would have been possible without you. I have no choice but to thank you.\"</p>\n<p>The about-face of her words hit Torres like an unexpected slap.</p>\n<p>\"But no matter how much money you throw at a problem,\" she continued, \"you're not above criticism for your methods.\"</p>\n<p>\"And is that why you agreed to meet with me then,\" he asked. \"To criticise my methods?\"</p>\n<p>\"The fanatics you surround yourself with certainly won't,\" she scoffed.</p>\n<p>\"Then by all means,\" Torres gestured toward her. \"The floor is yours.\"</p>\n<p>Alicia offered her brother the same smile he reserved for others when he caught them in a trap.</p>\n<p>\"Very well,\" she said. \"Do you know what the difference between you, our father, and the grandfather you so revere is?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose you're going to tell me.\" An intrigued smirk came to Torres's face.</p>\n<p>\"For all their genius,\" Alicia continued, \"for all their faults, and missteps, <em>they were still there.</em> And that is a thing I don't think you know how to be. Not when you can elevate yourself on some pedestal somewhere.\"</p>\n<p>Torres opened his mouth, a quip already half formed on his tongue. Before the words could leave his mouth, memories of his grandfather came forth. Quiet moments with a man he loved, and who loved him. His mouth slowly closed, and his eyes fell to the floor.</p>\n<p>Alicia chuckled and stood, placing down a few pesos to cover the bill.</p>\n<p>\"I won't stick around for you to admit you were wrong,\" she said softly. \"I know that's another thing you are incapable of.\"</p>\n<p>Torres remained silent. Without another word between the two, his sister took her leave.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Torres family plot was far from the grandest in the cemetery, but it certainly was among the best kept. Simple granite headstones, regularly cleaned of moss and grime by caretakers at the receiving end of Sim\u00f3n Torres's fortune, diligently ensured that. Still, as tech moguls stood there before the mundanity of it all, he couldn't help but feel disappointed. In truth, if he had his way, long ago the monuments to his predecessors would have been replaced with a grand mausoleum. The rest of the family did not share this vision.</p>\n<p>Torres took a knee, and gingerly placed a bouquet of flowers atop the newest addition to the plot. He lingered there for several moments, his out of date but still expensive suit allowed to become dirty for the first time. He slowly traced his finger across the engraving on the headstone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Gabriela Torres</em></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Regardless as to what anyone says,\" he said to himself, \"I did what was needed.

Torres shook his head as he worked it out of his system.</p>\n<p>\"Despite what they think, no one can ask for more,\" he repeated. \"I hope you are in a better place.\"</p>\n<p>His gaze continued to wander until it landed on the headstone of his grandfather. He frowned briefly, then nodded to the aged granite slab.</p>\n<p>\"I know you'd be proud of me.\"</p>\n<p>After several moments of silence, Sim\u00f3n Torres stood and dusted himself off. He turned on the spot and proceeded through the cemetery gates, waiting until he passed the threshold before letting out a final sigh\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026 and then swiftly dialed a number into his cell phone. It rang once before his PA answered.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Torres?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm done here and heading back to the car as we speak,\" said Torres immediately. \"I imagine there are actually important things I missed while I was away?

center;\">\n<p>I messed up the instructions somehow. I am not sure how, but I did. The bad part? I already went through; Ways need to a specific entrance and exit so if I am in a new place, I don't have that first part. I cannot just make a new Way to the old location because\u2026 semantics.</p>\n<p>This probably should've been expected. I'm one of the first students at <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/about-deer\" target=\"_blank\">Deer College.</a> There was bound to be some technical difficulties even if all of them was on my part. I wandered through the dead forest that I was in. I wander aimlessly stamping through the forest listening deeply for anyone that might also be in the forest. The forest was quiet, you could hear branch snap from a mile away and it would pierce the air.</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>Snap.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> I ran towards the sound that I heard in the hopes that it someone who could 'rescue' me from the land that I walk upon. I nearly tripped on my right shoe.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> I came to a clearing. I hadn't noticed the ground till I tripped. It was light-gray and as warm as the soft sunlight, the land was unbelievably rigid softness. Aside was a lake whose currents had a rough calmness to them. The jagged rocks ascending from the lake were same as the soft colored ground; however, metallic.<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>The branch. I gaze over the lake; the dead black roots above covered in yellow flowers.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nI had noticed the branch with green olives laced dead on the floor. A figure loomed over it, picked it up<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>and rotated their hand from the wrist.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>They took a pebble of the branch and placed it on the stake in the ground. <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>The glue of biology connected them; the pebbles formed a statue.<br/>\nAn olive was picked and lovingly thrown into my palm. My gaze followed the ground up at the lady whom connected. <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>An elf.\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>My astonished state returned to normal, \"Apologies for the rudeness I caused.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"What rudeness?\" spoke the Elf who picked an olive for herself.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I reflected on my past actions, even kicked a pebble on the floor, \"I got lost.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"And how may that be rude? You were admiring the scene.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"I was to head to Deer College in <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub\" target=\"_blank\">Three Portlands,</a>\" I checked my watch, \"Class starts in three hours. It's impolite to talk especially given the circumstances.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"I got lost too. Lacking impoliteness wouldn't matter much.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"That's overly coincidental. Any ideas on how to get there? We cannot do the normal <em>Way</em> because we are both lost.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>The Elf stands up, gazing at me. They relax themselves before placing a hand on my shoulder. She inquires, \"I'm Pepper, and what's your name?\" Pepper smiles innocently.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I stumble an inch or so back as she removes her hand from my left shoulder. I reply awkwardly, \"Oh, you can call me Camellia.\"</p>\n<p>I started panic pacing, \"If I am lost, I will never make it to Deer's orientation,\" I eat the olive that Pepper gave me nervously.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"What do you mean, it's not like we want to be here but it's nice that we are,\" Pepper looks across the beautiful space. She eats an olive.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I cannot disagree with Pepper's statement, it was great. I thought about where we were, I sat on one of the rocks near the lake. Pepper sat to the left of me closely but still with some distance. For some reason, I felt shame.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>We both were lost; it would be wrong if we stayed here no matter the environment.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I spoke out into the silence of humanity, \"Any ideas, Pepper?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper looked up at my rough face, her soft face smiles affectionately (in a platonic way) at me, \"I could teleport\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\" 'I'? Only I, I being me, need to head to Deer College. Isn't this your homeland or the like? \"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"You'll be teleported too, you needn't to worry.\" Pepper lets herself away from me. She took off the small bag on her shoulder and tossed it on the soft ground 8 feet away from the water. She walks to the bag, and takes out a few dozen numerous things.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"There is no reason for you to be teleported with me, it will be hard to find your way back to here.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper looks back at me with her yellowish-green eyes. She then gazes at the sky then back to above my head. \"I used to cartograph. Return is hard but at the most, there not is a point to do so. I prefer\u2026 scenery paths.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The world dashed</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nleft.<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Dead trees.<br/>\nWater.<br/>\nYellow Petals.<br/>\nBright stones.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>An unstable structure, a clock tower. There was an half-dome stationed on a grass hill with trees half-circling it in the direction we were. The trees were green leaves, brown bark and <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> short.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"we're not in the grove,\" Was said by Pepper, whom the voice got overly cheery and ended with a laugh, \"I cannot tell you how many times I've messed that up!\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The clock tower consisted of two main components, the base and the actual tower itself. The former was made of planks of wood nailed together but there was enough wood to where there were no windows. The tower itself was</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>o<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>v<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>e<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>r<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>l<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>y<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>W<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>i<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>y,<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>to be precise, it was shaped as the bottom half of the middle of an \u01a7. It was made of many thin plates of construction metal nailed together but less put together than the wood which really wasn't put together at all. The clock was functional.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper headed in the direction of the clock tower with a wooden door. Eventually she looked back at me and stopped before gesturing her head towards the clock tower.</p>\n<p>\"Are you sure it's stable. It looks\u2026\" I didn't want to offend Pepper, she was my only really guide if you can call her one.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Camellia was pulled to the left of Pepper. Camellia panicked a little breathing heavily for 3.86 seconds. His head was pointing at the ground before looking up at Pepper. \"You have two inches on me, and telekinesis.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"I don't, telekinesis that is,\" Pepper opened the wooden door to the dome blushing ever so slightly.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The inside was entirely made of metal. There was a glass floor with several gears rotating slowly. At the other side, a metal bar-stool shaped altar with a key atop with no texture aside from light grayness. It had a circular handle. There were also two metal doors with keyholes. We walked to the middle of the room.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"You open the door, you want to go to Deer College.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>As much I hated to think it, Pepper was right. I grabbed the key atop the table and pondered which door to open. Two minutes of pointless pondering later, I placed the key in the left door and unlocked the door which pulverized the key into dust. Pepper walked up beside me.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>We're about to head inside when I heard an unfamiliar female voice behind us, \"I pleasure you that you opened the left door.\"</p>\n<p>The voice was unnerving but warm. We both turned towards the figure, it was humanoid but I couldn't tell what it was. It was holding an open book and wore half-rim glasses with no lens for its left eye. It wore a blackish-blue cloak. It spoke again, \"The parameters are already set.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>I walked into the room which was the same as the first but without the table, key and doors. I didn't hear any footsteps so I look back to see Pepper a little ways past the doorframe.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>She felt vaguely different. She quickly came into the room right before the entity closed the door.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Camellia and Pepper was on a paved part of a veranda. Although, depending on your definition of veranda, \"courtyard\" would be more applicable. There was an open garden in the middle of two hallways with some paved floors connecting the two around the garden. There were trees, flowers and various other floral decorations. There was a marble fence disconnecting most of the garden to the veranda. There will marble pillars atop the fence to keep the roof up.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"Oh, seems we are here and in rec-\" My watch says 12:00, orientation started at 11. I frantically look at the doors across the hallway. I, out of fear, remember what room number my orientation.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper follows me.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I eventually find the door and open it quickly.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The professor is standing in front of a wall but behind his desk. The desk was located halfway between the door Camellia entered and the far wall. The professor looks at both Camellia and Pepper but only because they were standing next to each other, holding hands. Camellia however wasn't aware of the latter. The professor frowning announced, \"Welcome to Deer College. How was your trip?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"I mishandled opening the Way, she helped find my way back by using her own.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Teae mishandled the second Way. It was an hour and 15 past unintentionally late.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"Who's Teae?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"The hooded figure at the clock tower.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The professor simply stared at the couple before speaking, \"According to Zachary Knorr, the majority of the Ways were\u2026 improperly made. We decided to delay orientation until 3PM.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>I took a peek into the room, there weren't any students in any seats. I ask the professor, \"Soooooo\u2026 what do we do while we wait?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>\"That's for you to decide, I would say you should check your dorm room. Considering that you are a couple, we'll arrange to place you in the same dorm room.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>It was at this point where I noticed I was holding Pepper's hand and realized that she didn't follow me but I dragged her with me. I quickly let go in embarrassment.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Alright, we'll see you soon Professor\u2026\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>\"Professor Cojure.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"See you soon!\" Pepper closes the door to the classroom and I hear a lock sound coming from it.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"Are you sure you don't have telekinesis? Also, sorry for dragging you, I was worried and-\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Telekinesis was Cojure's, not me. Should we head to our dorm? \u2026I don't mind the dragging, warm hands more so.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"Wait, you are a student too?!\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper laughed once again genuinely before speaking, \"Yes, how dense are you! We're sharing a dorm!\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"\u2026Wait we are?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"We were just told.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>I am dense. I just realized that I was dense because I was dense. I mumbled something akin to \"Maybe I should take divination,\" which Pepper didn't hear. Pepper grabbed my hand. I only noticed how lukewarm and soft Pepper's hand was. My hand escaped hers, \"You don't need to hold my hand. I can find my way by myself.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>For the first time, Pepper displayed a negative emotion, bashfulness. \"You got lost the first time! Knowing you, you'd get lost again somehow.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>I was about to retort but then I remember something my granddad said to me, \"Never upset a woman, if you do, it will be extremely hard to repair that friendship.\" I took that advice to heart and let her hold my hand.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper felt embarrassed. I noticed her ears were red but couldn't get a good look at her face to know her expression or how much she was blushing. She also mumbled something but I didn't catch it.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Pepper took me all the way to the dorm room. I brought a backpack with me that contains various things. Deer College did all the transport of necessaries like clothing, shampoo and conditioner, etc. so everything was where it was supposed to be except personal items. When we got to our room,</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper opened the door.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>I noticed that there was no lock on the door. I was dense but I wasn't dense enough to figure out that the doors can probably only be opened by the dorm's resident. I also knew that we could add people to the whitelist at the front desk.</p>\n<p>Our room was an undivided double. The room obviously was using non-euclidean geometry with the beds occupying the main room with desks and dressers next to the beds. Also, there was a closets for shirts to be hung. Camellia and Pepper's clothes were in their respective dressers and closets. There was also a bathroom with both a shower and a bath. There was a window that overlooked the campus grounds.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>I asked Pepper a question since I was curious, \"What are you majoring in?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm doing economics, as for occult practices, I am unfamiliar with the ones taught here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, anthropology and I haven't decided on an occult class.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's pick the same occult class to major in. Perhaps later, I believe we will pick our majors during our sophomore year. Freshman is all required classes.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper blushed at that embarrassingly bashful proposal. Her ears were extremely red with the face being only a fourth of the red that her ears were. I didn't know if I should accept that proposal, we barely knew each other and are living together. We both didn't know anyone else that is attending Deer, we know each other the best even though there is no bar for it.</p>\n<p>I speak softly, \"Sure, let's pick together. We can always change what we do later.\"</p>\n<p>I take out Deer's Student Handbook which includes a list of the majors. I look at the table of contents before flipping to the listed page for occult majors. I sat on my bed and Pepper sat on my right but a little closer since the clearing.</p>\n<p>\"First off is\u2026 alchemy.\"</p>\n<p>I look to Pepper who was staring at me with an expression whose purpose was unknown to me. It was a half-smile, with curious eyes. I reply awkwardly, \"What's with that face?\"</p>\n<p>\"You have the handbook.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you think I wouldn't?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, you are clumsy.\"</p>\n<p>I processed the statement, \"Am I clumsy? If I am, clumsy may describe me but I am not <em>that</em> clumsy,\" I move the book a little in Pepper's direction whom view turned to the book, \"What do you think of alchemy?\"</p>\n<p>\"Uninteresting.\"</p>\n<p>\"What about cryptozoology? Elves are close to nature right?\"</p>\n<p>When I looked over to Pepper, I saw her expression change from <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> to a smile. She replied, \"Vegetarians, most of us. Before you ask, I am one except sea food. As for cryptozoology\u2026 we could if it you would.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not that interested in it. Apologies.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper looks deep into my eyes, \"You apologize way too much. Here let me take the handbook.\"</p>\n<p>The handbook is taken from my hand from my gentle grasp, Pepper looked at the list, \"Alright, what about <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pickman-blank-proposal/offset/1\" target=\"_blank\">cryptomancy and imagomancy?</a>\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not a writer or artist. Are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, but I wish I was a good artist.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper spoke in a solemn tone and she, scoot over closer to me. I chose my next words carefully so as to not upset her more, \"It's a bit further down the list but what about anart? It is pretty broad.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper briefly looked over the entire list of occult division classes at Deer. She asked in a soft voice, \"Must we pick the same occult class?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"So why are we doing this?\"</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure why I agreed with Pepper's suggestion. I just wanted to be with her. It was a selfish reason but I thought it would be best to be honest with Pepper who's currently hugs my arm.</p>\n<p>\"We don't know anyone else so far at Deer. While we have met only today, it's still the closest relationship we have. Professor Cojure perception of us is that we're close and he's semi-wrong n' right. I mean, you're hugging my arm tightly but I know you seem like the type at are just clingy.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper suddenly stopped hugging my arm and ran half a foot to her bed with her head down. The majority of Pepper's face was red, and I swore there was a little steam out of her ears, \"Relationship?\"</p>\n<p>My intentions were unaware to I, not that I wanted those intentions until now. I attempted to clear up the misunderstanding, \"No, I mean relationship as like friendship, relationship is just more\u2026 broad in terminology.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper's face was mostly red but some of it returned to a dark tan. I knew if I continued this conversation, the relati<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>-friendship would get a little sourer. I decided to change the subject to what we were originally talking about, \"You okay if we both do cryptomancy and imagomancy?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026We have the entirely of the schoolyear to decide.\"</p>\n<p>Pepper turned to clock in the room, it was 2:50 PM. She ran out of the dorm, \"I'm not being late</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>for the second time!\"</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>\"What do you mean you-\" I looked at the clock, \"Damn it I</p>\n</div>\n<p>forgot orientation too!\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>We both ran to Professor Cojure's classroom. There were a few others walking around campus, not worried about being late yet we were. TheClassWasn'tFarEither. The room was unlocked with Cojure making a brief rhetorical comment, \"Do you two always run to your designations as to not be late when you leave a few minutes before?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"10 minutes is longer than you think,\" I retort.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Each desk had a card with a name on it. \"If you're just walking in, find your card, that is your assigned seat for this orientation.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>I look over at a few desks eventually finding mine. Farthest back next to the exterior window.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper was 3rd from the front which was three seats ahead of me.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The architecture was a bit old fashioned. Heavily smooth white stone for the floor, with normal tan concrete used for the walls. The exception was the exterior wall which made of red bricks, 4 thick. There were also windows with the usual \u2229 shape with the lower half extended about 2 times. The windows could be opened but I left them closed. There was a dark brown frame for the inner window. The bottom of the window had a large rectangular brick instead 4 normal bricks. In a few minutes, every Deerie (for this class) trinkled into the room.</p>\n<p>After the strangely standard sounding bell rang, Cojure spoke up, \"Seems like we don't have any students absent on the first day.\"</p>\n<p>Cojure looks at the few empty desks, \"Don't worry, me and the rest of the staff can see incorporeal beings.\"</p>\n<p>Cojure continued, \"I'm Professor Cojure, Division Head for the Division of Summoning and Invocation. Before you ask, yes, I know my name is\u2026\" the professor chuckled before raising both of his empty hands in a grand motion, \"PATAPHYSICS! Am I right?\"</p>\n<p>A few laughed with Cojure waiting for them to stop laughing to continue, \"Ahem, that will be most likely the only time I am cheery that you'll see. Anyways, to get to the main subject at hand. Like every other college, we have some core classes that are required for graduation. The textbooks should be here momentarily.\"</p>\n<p>A few seconds after Cojure spoke, the textbooks magically appear, stacked on one another. They appeared on every desk. The Titles from top to bottom are \"History of the Anomalous,\" \"Reality Explained and How to Bend It,\" \"Dimensions and Teleportation 101.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, there they are. Took them long enough,\" The professor glances at the side of a stack of textbooks near the front of someone's desk, \"Seems like I won't be teaching any of you if my schedule is anything to go by.\"</p>\n<p>A student raises their hand with Cojure nodding at them signaling their tongue, \"If that's the case, why are you giving us our orientation?\"</p>\n<p>\"A lot of people are enrolled at Deer. Every teacher is a part of orientation, even the teachers and lecturers that aren't teaching entry level classes.\"</p>\n<p>The professor paused before continuing, \"Now, we at Deer believe that while being a liberal arts and science college associated with the anomalous, the standard world is just as important. The students who have read the handbook would already know where I am going with this. When you graduate from Deer, your major will be a mix of both a mundane and occult major. You only start major classes in your sophomore year at Deer. As for your freshmen year, you just do the only core classes that are at Deer.\"</p>\n<p>The professor went on to monologue for an hour and another. It was just general information about Deer College, handing out schedules, and other typical college stuff. The professor only stopped his droning when the bell rang once again. It was also dusk, so many students wanted to go back to their dorms. That included me and Pepper who were currently in the quad walking to our dorms.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"You are heading back too?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"That might possibly happen tomorrow. The first day is always the most hectic. Rest's important.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Do you have a sister?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"No, I am an only child. Why do- oh, I see the problem,\" I was looking at Pepper when I said that I then remembered how easy it is to upset Pepper, \"You're not a problem and neither am I!\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>We both stayed quiet after that.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"Who am I kidding, I assume you never slept in the same room as a guy right?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Correct. I have a little sis so not used to boys.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"What a weird roundabout way to answer my question. Actually\u2026\" I look over to Pepper.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"Nothing, it- where are your textbooks?\" I had just noticed that she wasn't lifting any textbooks unlike me who were carrying them crate-style. I looked a little past Pepper; they were floating next to textbooks. \"So, you do have telekinesis!\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Pepper \"picked up\" the books in the same way I was carrying them. Pepper was using telekinesis still lifting them ever so slightly out of her hands.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I pretended not to notice. I continued our earlier conversation, \"So back to us sharing a room, are we both going to change in separate rooms?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"I wouldn't mind if you saw, probably.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"You haven't seen a guy undressed, have you?\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"No.\" That was the softest I ever heard Pepper, but she continued in normal volume, \"Have you seen a girl not dressed?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"I haven't, we're in the same boat.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Ignore if I'm nude. I'll do the same should vice versa occurs.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"That's your view on this situation? Also, you seem very out of character.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"How am I out of character? If anything, you should- actually, no, you've been in character this whole time. Dense and apologize way too often.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"You? Anytime I bring up any romance stuff, you fluster except us living together which you are weirdly open to the idea of.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\"Huh? That's nothing like me at all!\" Pepper was blushing at her confrontation.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"<em>Sureeee,</em> keep telling yourself that.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Our conversation ended there. We eventually reached our dorm, and I placed my textbooks next to my bed past the frame while Pepper placed hers' in her bag for tomorrow. Pepper immediately declared once they were in her bag, \"I'm going in first. Ladies need their beauty time.\"</p>\n<p>She went into the bathroom and locked the door.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>She left after 45 minutes in there. When Pepper finally left, \"Ah, that felt good. Now it's your turn Camellia.\"</p>\n<p>This was the first time I really admired Pepper. She was 2in taller than me with highly saturated blonde hair around 1/4th down her back. She had long arms and legs. Her torso was not exactly slim but not chubby either. What was slim was her legs. Pepper wore a tank top that was practically stuck to her wet skin. Her sleep pants were loose enough to where they didn't stick to her skin.</p>\n<p>Pepper broke the silence, \"Admiring me? Wash yourself, less you are planning to stay up till half-till-dusk.\" Pepper paused before blushing heavily with the ears catching some of the heat, replying to herself softly while playing with her own hair, \" Oh, right; elven beauty.\"</p>\n<p>I took my pajamas into the bathroom and locked the door. I look in the mirror noticing my obvious blush to my dense self. I stripped and took a hot shower. There were two bottles of both shampoo and conditioner. I didn't recognize either of the brands, so I just picked the one that was more appealing to me. After 20 minutes in the shower, I dried myself off and put on my pajamas before heading out.</p>\n<p>When I entered the main room, Pepper was already asleep in her bed, so I decided to sleep too as to not wake her up. I softly say, \"Good night\" before I slept in my bed.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"earthworm earthworm--old-syntax-first-{$first} earthworm--old-syntax-last-{$last} earthworm--old-syntax-hub-{$hub} {$class}\">\n<div class=\"first earthworm__previous\" data-title=\"{$previous-title}\">\n\n<p><a href=\"/\">{$previous-title}</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub earthworm__hub\" data-title=\"Prologue\">\n<p><a href=\"/\">Prologue</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last earthworm__next\" data-title=\"COMING SOON\">\n\n<p><a href=\"/\">COMING SOON</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/ideal-prologue\">Ideal - Prologue</a>\" by WatcherKatrielle, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It was an hour and 15 past unintentionally late.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"Who's Teae?\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"The hooded figure at the clock tower.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nThe professor simply stared at the couple before speaking, \"According to Zachary Knorr, the majority of the Ways were... improperly made. We decided to delay orientation until 3PM.\"\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nI took a peek into the room, there weren't any students in any seats. I ask the professor, \"Soooooo... what do we do while we wait?\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\"That's for you to decide, I would say you should check your dorm room. Considering that you are a couple, we'll arrange to place you in the same dorm room.\"\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nIt was at this point where I noticed I was holding Pepper's hand and realized that she didn't follow me but I dragged her with me. I quickly let go in embarrassment.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"Alright, we'll see you soon Professor...\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\"Professor Cojure.\"\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"See you soon!\" Pepper closes the door to the classroom and I hear a lock sound coming from it.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"Are you sure you don't have telekinesis? Also, sorry for dragging you, I was worried and-\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"Telekinesis was Cojure's, not me. Should we head to our dorm? ...I don't mind the dragging, warm hands more so.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"Wait, you are a student too?!\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nPepper laughed once again genuinely before speaking, \"Yes, how dense are you! We're sharing a dorm!\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"...Wait we are?\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"We were just told.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nI am dense. I just realized that I was dense because I was dense. I mumbled something akin to \"Maybe I should take divination,\" which Pepper didn't hear. Pepper grabbed my hand. I only noticed how lukewarm and soft Pepper's hand was. My hand escaped hers, \"You don't need to hold my hand. I can find my way by myself.\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nFor the first time, Pepper displayed a negative emotion, bashfulness. \"You got lost the first time! Knowing you, you'd get lost again somehow.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nI was about to retort but then I remember something my granddad said to me, \"Never upset a woman, if you do, it will be extremely hard to repair that friendship.\" I took that advice to heart and let her hold my hand.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nPepper felt embarrassed. I noticed her ears were red but couldn't get a good look at her face to know her expression or how much she was blushing. She also mumbled something but I didn't catch it.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nPepper took me all the way to the dorm room. I brought a backpack with me that contains various things. Deer College did all the transport of necessaries like clothing, shampoo and conditioner, etc. so everything was where it was supposed to be except personal items. When we got to our room, \n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nPepper opened the door.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nI noticed that there was no lock on the door. I was dense but I wasn't dense enough to figure out that the doors can probably only be opened by the dorm's resident. I also knew that we could add people to the whitelist at the front desk.\n\n\n\nOur room was an undivided double. The room obviously was using non-euclidean geometry with the beds occupying the main room with desks and dressers next to the beds. Also, there was a closets for shirts to be hung. Camellia and Pepper's clothes were in their respective dressers and closets. There was also a bathroom with both a shower and a bath. There was a window that overlooked the campus grounds. [[footnote]] It was on the 3rd floor out of at least three floors. [[/footnote]] \n\n\n\nI asked Pepper a question since I was curious, \"What are you majoring in?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm doing economics, as for occult practices, I am unfamiliar with the ones taught here.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, anthropology and I haven't decided on an occult class.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's pick the same occult class to major in. Perhaps later, I believe we will pick our majors during our sophomore year. Freshman is all required classes.\" \n\n\n\nPepper blushed at that embarrassingly bashful proposal. Her ears were extremely red with the face being only a fourth of the red that her ears were. I didn't know if I should accept that proposal, we barely knew each other and are living together. We both didn't know anyone else that is attending Deer, we know each other the best even though there is no bar for it.\n\n\n\nI speak softly, \"Sure, let's pick together. We can always change what we do later.\"\n\n\n\nI take out Deer's Student Handbook which includes a list of the majors. I look at the table of contents before flipping to the listed page for occult majors. I sat on my bed and Pepper sat on my right but a little closer since the clearing.\n\n\n\n\"First off is... alchemy.\"\n\n\n\nI look to Pepper who was staring at me with an expression whose purpose was unknown to me. It was a half-smile, with curious eyes. I reply awkwardly, \"What's with that face?\"\n\n\n\n\"You have the handbook.\"\n\n\n\n\"And you think I wouldn't?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, you are clumsy.\"\n\n\n\nI processed the statement, \"Am I clumsy? If I am, clumsy may describe me but I am not //that// clumsy,\" I move the book a little in Pepper's direction whom view turned to the book, \"What do you think of alchemy?\"\n\n\n\n\"Uninteresting.\"\n\n\n\n\"What about cryptozoology? Elves are close to nature right?\"\n\n\n\nWhen I looked over to Pepper, I saw her expression change from @@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@ to a smile. She replied, \"Vegetarians, most of us. Before you ask, I am one except sea food. As for cryptozoology... we could if it you would.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not that interested in it. Apologies.\"\n\n\n\nPepper looks deep into my eyes, \"You apologize way too much. Here let me take the handbook.\"\n\n\n\nThe handbook is taken from my hand from my gentle grasp, Pepper looked at the list, \"Alright, what about [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pickman-blank-proposal/offset/1 cryptomancy and imagomancy?]\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not a writer or artist. Are you?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, but I wish I was a good artist.\"\n\n\n\nPepper spoke in a solemn tone and she, scoot over closer to me. I chose my next words carefully so as to not upset her more, \"It's a bit further down the list but what about anart? It is pretty broad.\"\n\n\n\nPepper briefly looked over the entire list of occult division classes at Deer. She asked in a soft voice, \"Must we pick the same occult class?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\n\"So why are we doing this?\"\n\n\n\nI wasn't sure why I agreed with Pepper's suggestion. I just wanted to be with her. It was a selfish reason but I thought it would be best to be honest with Pepper who's currently hugs my arm.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know anyone else so far at Deer. While we have met only today, it's still the closest relationship we have. Professor Cojure perception of us is that we're close and he's semi-wrong n' right. I mean, you're hugging my arm tightly but I know you seem like the type at are just clingy.\"\n\n\n\nPepper suddenly stopped hugging my arm and ran half a foot to her bed with her head down. The majority of Pepper's face was red, and I swore there was a little steam out of her ears, \"Relationship?\"\n\n\n\nMy intentions were unaware to I, not that I wanted those intentions until now. I attempted to clear up the misunderstanding, \"No, I mean relationship as like friendship, relationship is just more... broad in terminology.\"\n\n\n\nPepper's face was mostly red but some of it returned to a dark tan. I knew if I continued this conversation, the relati@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@-friendship would get a little sourer. I decided to change the subject to what we were originally talking about, \"You okay if we both do cryptomancy and imagomancy?\"\n\n\n\n\"...We have the entirely of the schoolyear to decide.\"\n\n\n\nPepper turned to clock in the room, it was 2:50 PM. She ran out of the dorm, \"I'm not being late\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nfor the second time!\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\"What do you mean you-\" I looked at the clock, \"Damn it I\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nforgot orientation too!\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nWe both ran to Professor Cojure's classroom. There were a few others walking around campus, not worried about being late yet we were. TheClassWasn'tFarEither. The room was unlocked with Cojure making a brief rhetorical comment, \"Do you two always run to your designations as to not be late when you leave a few minutes before?\"\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\"10 minutes is longer than you think,\" I retort.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nEach desk had a card with a name on it. \"If you're just walking in, find your card, that is your assigned seat for this orientation.\"\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nI look over at a few desks eventually finding mine. Farthest back next to the exterior window. \n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nPepper was 3rd from the front which was three seats ahead of me.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nThe architecture was a bit old fashioned. Heavily smooth white stone for the floor, with normal tan concrete used for the walls. The exception was the exterior wall which made of red bricks, 4 thick. There were also windows with the usual \u2229 shape with the lower half extended about 2 times. The windows could be opened but I left them closed. There was a dark brown frame for the inner window. The bottom of the window had a large rectangular brick instead 4 normal bricks. In a few minutes, every Deerie (for this class) trinkled into the room.\n\n\n\nAfter the strangely standard sounding bell rang, Cojure spoke up, \"Seems like we don't have any students absent on the first day.\"\n\n\n\nCojure looks at the few empty desks, \"Don't worry, me and the rest of the staff can see incorporeal beings.\"\n\n\n\nCojure continued, \"I'm Professor Cojure, Division Head for the Division of Summoning and Invocation. Before you ask, yes, I know my name is...\" the professor chuckled before raising both of his empty hands in a grand motion, \"PATAPHYSICS! Am I right?\"\n\n\n\nA few laughed with Cojure waiting for them to stop laughing to continue, \"Ahem, that will be most likely the only time I am cheery that you'll see. Anyways, to get to the main subject at hand. Like every other college, we have some core classes that are required for graduation. The textbooks should be here momentarily.\"\n\n\n\nA few seconds after Cojure spoke, the textbooks magically appear, stacked on one another. They appeared on every desk. The Titles from top to bottom are \"History of the Anomalous,\" \"Reality Explained and How to Bend It,\" \"Dimensions and Teleportation 101.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, there they are. Took them long enough,\" The professor glances at the side of a stack of textbooks near the front of someone's desk, \"Seems like I won't be teaching any of you if my schedule is anything to go by.\"\n\n\n\nA student raises their hand with Cojure nodding at them signaling their tongue, \"If that's the case, why are you giving us our orientation?\"\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people are enrolled at Deer. Every teacher is a part of orientation, even the teachers and lecturers that aren't teaching entry level classes.\"\n\n\n\nThe professor paused before continuing, \"Now, we at Deer believe that while being a liberal arts and science college associated with the anomalous, the standard world is just as important. The students who have read the handbook would already know where I am going with this. When you graduate from Deer, your major will be a mix of both a mundane and occult major. You only start major classes in your sophomore year at Deer. As for your freshmen year, you just do the only core classes that are at Deer.\"\n\n\n\nThe professor went on to monologue for an hour and another. It was just general information about Deer College, handing out schedules, and other typical college stuff. The professor only stopped his droning when the bell rang once again. It was also dusk, so many students wanted to go back to their dorms. That included me and Pepper who were currently in the quad walking to our dorms.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"You are heading back too?\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"That might possibly happen tomorrow. The first day is always the most hectic. Rest's important.\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"Do you have a sister?\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"No, I am an only child. Why do- oh, I see the problem,\" I was looking at Pepper when I said that I then remembered how easy it is to upset Pepper, \"You're not a problem and neither am I!\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nWe both stayed quiet after that.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\"Who am I kidding, I assume you never slept in the same room as a guy right?\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"Correct. I have a little sis so not used to boys.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"What a weird roundabout way to answer my question. Actually...\" I look over to Pepper.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"What?\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"Nothing, it- where are your textbooks?\" I had just noticed that she wasn't lifting any textbooks unlike me who were carrying them crate-style. I looked a little past Pepper; they were floating next to textbooks. \"So, you do have telekinesis!\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nPepper \"picked up\" the books in the same way I was carrying them. Pepper was using telekinesis still lifting them ever so slightly out of her hands.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nI pretended not to notice. I continued our earlier conversation, \"So back to us sharing a room, are we both going to change in separate rooms?\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"I wouldn't mind if you saw, probably.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"You haven't seen a guy undressed, have you?\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"No.\" That was the softest I ever heard Pepper, but she continued in normal volume, \"Have you seen a girl not dressed?\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"I haven't, we're in the same boat.\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"Ignore if I'm nude. I'll do the same should vice versa occurs.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"That's your view on this situation? Also, you seem very out of character.\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"How am I out of character? If anything, you should- actually, no, you've been in character this whole time. Dense and apologize way too often.\"\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"You? Anytime I bring up any romance stuff, you fluster except us living together which you are weirdly open to the idea of.\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n\"Huh? That's nothing like me at all!\" Pepper was blushing at her confrontation.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"//Sureeee,// keep telling yourself that.\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nOur conversation ended there. We eventually reached our dorm, and I placed my textbooks next to my bed past the frame while Pepper placed hers' in her bag for tomorrow. Pepper immediately declared once they were in her bag, \"I'm going in first. Ladies need their beauty time.\"\n\n\n\nShe went into the bathroom and locked the door.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nShe left after 45 minutes in there. When Pepper finally left, \"Ah, that felt good. Now it's your turn Camellia.\"\n\n\n\nThis was the first time I really admired Pepper. She was 2in taller than me with highly saturated blonde hair around 1/4th down her back. She had long arms and legs. Her torso was not exactly slim but not chubby either. What was slim was her legs. Pepper wore a tank top that was practically stuck to her wet skin. Her sleep pants were loose enough to where they didn't stick to her skin.\n\n\n\nPepper broke the silence, \"Admiring me? Wash yourself, less you are planning to stay up till half-till-dusk.\" Pepper paused before blushing heavily with the ears catching some of the heat, replying to herself softly while playing with her own hair, \" Oh, right; elven beauty.\"\n\n\n\nI took my pajamas into the bathroom and locked the door. I look in the mirror noticing my obvious blush to my dense self. I stripped and took a hot shower. There were two bottles of both shampoo and conditioner. I didn't recognize either of the brands, so I just picked the one that was more appealing to me. After 20 minutes in the shower, I dried myself off and put on my pajamas before heading out.\n\n\n\nWhen I entered the main room, Pepper was already asleep in her bed, so I decided to sleep too as to not wake her up. I softly say, \"Good night\" before I slept in my bed.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| previous-url =/\n\n| next-url = /\n\n| next-title = COMING SOON\n\n| hub-url =/\n\n| hub-title = Prologue\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** //DeerSeal.png//\n\n> **Name:** //File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig390.png//\n\n> **Author:** Arthur Charles Fox-Davies/[[*user ch00bakka]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0 (Public Domain Components)\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry_Fig390.png Wikimedia Commons]/[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/deer-college-hub/DeerSeal.png The SCP Wiki]\n\n> **Additional Notes:** Cropped to only include the left winged deer.\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["about-deer", "three-portlands-hub", "pickman-blank-proposal/offset/1", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "deer-college", "first-person", "romance", "school", "slice-of-life", "surrealism", "tale", "three-portlands"], "title": "Ideal - Prologue - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ideal-prologue", "year": 2026}, "ipsylon2x99": {"created_at": "2026-01-17T03:56:00", "creator": "JackalRelated", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T03:56:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:00:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"alpharechs.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:07:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"menqet.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:08:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"laeru.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:08:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"gardonne.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:08:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"calnine.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:08:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"bird.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:09:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"bg.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:09:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"tile.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:09:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"sweep.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:09:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"MS Gothic.woff2\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:09:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"main_image_01.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:10:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:17:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:19:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:19:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:20:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:27:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "Uploaded file \"alt-title.png\".", "date": "2026-01-17T04:40:00"}, {"author": "JackalRelated", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jackalrelated", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-17T04:55:00"}, {"author": "Heck_Tech", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heck-tech", "comment": "Added tags: _listpages, art-exchange, illustrated, tale.

The name is often shortened by fans to Ipsy99 or Y2x99 (we prefer the latter). It originally started out as a serialized story written by SF novelist Sohji Kirishima in the in August 1996 issue of Newtype magazine. From there, it was adapted by Metolow, whose co-creator Kosuke Ichinose served as its director. The first episode was released in September 1997 and finally concluded on December 1999.</p>\n<p>Despite some changes made to the characters and the story for the OAV, the premise remains largely the same. It is set sometime in the future \u2014 the eponymous '2X99' \u2014 after Earth's population has undergone a mass exodus to live in a gargantuan space elevator-like structure. All the while, strange parascientific phenomena affect its inhabitants to varying degrees. Construction and upkeep are ostensibly run by a mysterious organization called the Foundation, but their true motivations are unknown or potentially even sinister for humanity at large.</p>\n<p>Y2x99 was a semi-successful commercial endeavor but largely overshadowed by later hits such as <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> or considered inferior to similar stories such as <em>Blame!</em>. However, it is still popular and given due acclaim in the right circles.</p>\n<p>If you have any further information or would like to assist in translation efforts for Y2x99, please let us know.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">&gt;

Before us, our product //was// merely waste, excrement, ka-ka, whatever you want to call it. Now, we can turn that into something great. We can replace workers, we can replace artists, writers, doctors, lawyers, you name it! You don\u2019t have to pay it, you don\u2019t even have to feed it. You just have to\u2013Erm\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cShit it out,\u201d yes. Give it to us, we make it better. We\u2019re refining the process every day.

Starr is driving a beaten Toyota Rav-4 down Interstate Ninety-Five at One Hundred Twelve Miles per hour because he knows that he cannot crash. He stopped looking at the speedometer fifteen minutes ago. He stopped looking at the gas meter two states ago.</p>\n<p>He's running. From something: maybe. To something: possibly. But he is running. Not running for his life, but for something so much more than that. He has fucked up, bad. So badly he doesn't even remember what he did, just that it was bad. This he knows for certain, because he has burrowed past every layer of knowing and consciousness within him and he has distilled this one bedrock certainty: he has fucked up <em>bad</em>.</p>\n<p>He has lost something, something of great magnitude and importance that he could not live without and that he now must. He cannot remember what this was, either.</p>\n<p>He keeps going, the car does not give in because it is his steel steed and it will not fail him. He doesn't have a destination in mind, maybe he just wants to keep driving until he finds something. He doesn't know what exactly that would be either.</p>\n<p>He doesn't know a lot of things. But he knows that these highways are long and strange and contain many things that ought not exist.</p>\n<p>And he finds one. It's unremarkable, in the grand scheme of things, but it catches his eye; that alone is notable, he's not paying much attention to things.</p>\n<p>It's a highway sign, green, stained, and noteless, save for its contents. The sign reads:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Jupiter County</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">16 miles to exit 6.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He slams on the breaks, returning to the speed limit, he takes exit six. He's found something that ought not exist. He smiles to himself. He doesn't know a lot of things, but he knows these roads.</p>\n<p>And he's never heard of Jupiter County.</p>\n\n<p>Jupiter County is, in fact, not a county at all. Rather, the name belongs to a small town, right on the Colorado/New Mexico border. It is, in every way, a small town. Rust lies unabated on discarded metal, local farms provide the food, and the desert is very cruel.</p>\n<p>But Jupiter County is not <em>just</em> a small town. Not as he would recognize it, at least. Neon lights pump vast amounts of illumination into the darkness of the night. The buildings, should, by any reasonable construction, be built from brick or EIFS, and some of them are. But others are made from cold, blue, striking steel, their visage like a cool glass of water against the beating neon pink.</p>\n<p>The road approaching the town is in a state of disrepair, he does two hundred dollars worth of damage to his suspension from the first six potholes alone, yet, strangely, this concern evaporates once he crosses the threshold to the town proper; demarcated by a sign glowing just as harshly as the rest of the town. Regardless, the roads within the town proper are spotless. A series of bright yellow LEDs have been established along the double-yellow lines of the road.</p>\n<p>The town itself rests in a valley, and this entrance road, the only road into town, curves gently downward to facilitate this, it sweeps widely and slowly, allowing him to take in the town and its bombardment of contrasting colors. He squints to see the road as his retinas strain against the attack.</p>\n<p>And he spots his mark.</p>\n\n<p>He makes a beeline for the bar, pulling the car off into a barren side alley of concrete. Strangely enough, this alley is starkly clean, there's almost no dust within, and certainly no garbage. A nestled noodle-esque collection of pipes pump water and natural gas and heat into adjoining buildings. He does not see a single other person as he moseys through the town.</p>\n<p>He at last arrives at the bar. He was raised agnostic, he does not believe in the pearly gates, but that blue and orange 'open' sign shines like sweet-fucking-salvation.</p>\n<p>Of course, his reason for being here is; and must officially be: to get to the bottom of this town that ought not exist and to figure out why it does, a bar is a good place to do that. But, truthfully, his main reason is simply that he wants to feel a little less.</p>\n<p>The bar: <strong>'Saturn Tavern'</strong>, is nice enough. It certainly conforms to the theme of the county. Large sweeping arcs of cold blue steel intersected by sharp contours of brick. The interior is homely, or at least attempts to be, Colorado/New-Mexico state paraphernalia decorates the walls and the lighting is orange and warm and decidedly less-neon. But the interior is also as inescapably alien as the rest of this place. A three foot inset in the mid-level of the wall sweeps about a foot back, providing a dugout for a series of coals. These are lit, but they do not burn orange or yellow or even blue, the coals burn purple.</p>\n<p>The bar must be having a bad night, because it is empty. He wonders if maybe it's a holiday or something, that's possible, he's pretty much lost all sense of time after all. But the bar is tended to by a tall man in his forties. He wears a tweed jacket and luxury jeans and has a cockeyed smile that suggests his mouth is used to having a cigarette in it. He introduces himself as Conrad, because that is his name, and they talk.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What brings you to town?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Business.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Bad business?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> No, just business. I work for an organization called the SCP Foundation. We deal with things that are\u2026 off, and I think there's something off about your town.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Huh. Never noticed anything strange myself. I'm pretty sure this is how things are meant to be.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Then how come I've never heard of your town? How come it's not on any maps?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Well, we're pretty new. Founded in only nineteen fifty. What would you like to drink?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Alcohol.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What kind of alcohol?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> The kind with liquor in it.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I'm afraid we don't offer that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What do you have?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Mostly soft drinks.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Can you add liquor to any of them?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'll take a diet coke please.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The drink, when produced, is about what he expects. It tastes much like cola, but slightly old and a tad sawdust-y and flat despite the bubbles. The two men spend quite a few moments in a companionable but vacant silence. It is only when thirty-four percent of the drink remains that Starr resumes conversation.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> So, what is there to see here? What's your claim to fame? Every town has one.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Well, there's the Hall tree, where little Stanley Hall fell thirty feet and didn't break a bone.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Hm, alright, but not really what I'm looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> There's Jones Rock. That's where Sophia Jones claimed a rock and wouldn't let anyone near it, started taking potshots at people with a shotgun.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Was she okay? Was she mentally ill?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Not at all! She just thought the rock was hers. I think it actually may have been, some tax law loophole or something.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Still not really what I'm looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Hmm\u2026 well, there is the portal to Jupiter.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is, in fact, a portal to Jupiter. It's in the town square, where a fountain would traditionally be. It floats about a meter off the ground, and is itself about a meter from bottom to top, forming a rough swirling oval shape. Its edges shine with a neon blue that contrasts with the neon pink of the town. Its center is translucent, he can see right through, he sees virtually endless plumes of gas that whirl by the aperture at terrifying speeds. He swallows. There is a hurricane on Jupiter that is the size of Earth, Seymore S. Starr believes that he is staring out from its eye.</p>\n<p>Surrounding the portal are four waist-high metal barricades, the kind they have at concerts. He almost laughs, he could easily step over them and into the portal, they are a totally insufficient barrier compared to the magnitude of the threat.</p>\n<p>The portal is either-one way or barely permeable, as dust and gas from the storm does not enter out on to the town. He is comforted by this at least. He considers methods of containment, that's still his job, despite his exile. He needs to destroy the portal, he doesn't have the resources to relocate the town and isolate it. He also can't make the people; what little there are here; forget. But they don't seem to mind the portal, if he can destroy it, that would probably be good enough.</p>\n<p>He has no idea how to destroy the portal.</p>\n<p>Conrad, standing beside him, interrupts his thoughts.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Pretty neat, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah it's uh\u2014 it's something.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You gonna 'contain' it?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Oh, we've had plenty of you Foundation types visit. They all say they're gonna contain it, but they never get around to actually doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah, I'll probably try. Quick question, what happens if you stick your head inside?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> It's Jupiter, you'd die.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I can't die.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Then I guess you wouldn't die, but I reckon it'd be quite unpleasant.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Well, nothing I can do about this tonight. I'm quite tired. Anywhere I can stay for the night? A motel or something?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I've got just the place.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Lynn's Inn is, oddly enough, not run by someone called Lynn, but by a person called Midge. He doesn't get their last name, he doesn't really bother to ask, but he does, after several bouts of questions, come to learn that there never was a person called Lynn in Jupiter County. He asks Midge why they named their inn after a person that does not exist, the answer is deceptively simple: 'it rhymed'.</p>\n<p>Midge is a person of few words.</p>\n<p>He bumbles through his pockets; of which he has many; to produce a wallet and extricate a twenty dollar bill. He pays twelve ninety-five for the night, which he thinks is a good deal, though he earnestly has no idea what inflation is like nowadays.</p>\n<p>Just as soon as they take the money and give him his key, Midge disappears into the back, a disappointed expression on their starkly pale face. They spin away from him with fervor; their white satin pants and pastel blue scarf following suit a few seconds later; before they march into the darkness of a backroom.</p>\n<p>He turns, his key secured, and waves goodbye to Conrad, who walks out of sight and back towards his bar.</p>\n<p>Starr embarks to find his room, it's on the second floor, room six. He trudges up stairs covered in red velvet and illuminated by classical lanterns, still, it is not free from neon, the sides of the stairs containing bright yellow strips of light. After the stairs, he takes a right, then another right, and then a left, weaving through snake-like hallways to arrive at his destination, a fine, rich, mahogany door with his name in the middle.</p>\n<p>It's not super extravagant, but it's elegant enough, a small gold plaque with imprinted red text reading '<tt>Seymore S. Starr</tt>'. This does not bother him as much as it ought to. He inserts the key and turns, it unsurprisingly works, swinging open enthusiastically. He steps inside with caution, as though the floor might at any moment abandon its corporeal claim, leaving him to fall to Earth.</p>\n<p>The interior is nice enough, if a bit kitschy, it certainly runs with the desert theme. Sketches of cacti, animal skulls, and cowboy boots decorate the walls, but these are far from the only imagery. There is a photo album, on the table, which he picks up and begins rifling through. He sees vast deserts. He sees canyons carved by bare hands and fervor. Midnight diners who service only the wicked and truck stops disconnected from the road. He laughs, for he saw a great many of these sights before on his drive to this twice-hollow place. He sees a funeral in a godless church. He sees a prayer to nothing.</p>\n<p>He places the collection down and begins his nighttime routine. He hangs up his outer coat, a long gray affair that hangs down to his knees, unbuttons his dress shirt and throws it to the ground, yanks his belt from its loops and hangs it near the overcoat, and pulls off his socks. He left his nightwear in the car, so sleeping in jeans it is.</p>\n<p>He roams over to the sink, turns in onto cold, and clumsily intakes a mouthful of water, he gargles for half a minute before expulsing it down the drain. He takes another mouthful of water to drink. He turns the water to hot and splashes some on his face, which trickles down his oversized nose.</p>\n<p>He cracks his knuckles, switches off the lights, and crawls into the covers after making a quick sweep for; thankfully absent; bedbugs. He symmetrizes his body, takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes. It will be an hour and twelve minutes before he actually falls asleep.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the Saturn Tavern, Conrad is meeting a woman who calls herself Maya Anderson. It's not her real name, everyone knows that, but that's the only one they have for her, so they press on. She's tall, but not extraordinarily tall. She's well dressed, but not extravagantly so. She's talkative, but not loquacious. Except, maybe, for tonight. She has a lot to say tonight, as much as she can while taking the time to draft down a can of Pabst.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Didya hear about the new guy?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Hear about him? I'm the one who first met him! How did you hear about him?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> I heard it from Willem, who heard it from Midge, who heard it from someone else, probably you.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> And what do you make of him?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Well\u2026 he's not a good man, maybe even a bad one. But he thinks he can close the portal, and well\u2026 that'd get him into my good books.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What's your problem with the portal?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> I'm ready to move on, Conrad. To leave this place.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You could. You have a car.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> We both know that's not true.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Your husband?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Yeah. I mean\u2014 it feels like he grows more distant every day.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> It'll be okay.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It won't, but you're sweet for sayin' it.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Thank you for the drink. See you tomorrow?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Of course. I wouldn't miss it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Seymore S. Starr awakens confused. He feels well rested, and yet all of his senses combine to provide the compulsion that it is still the dead of night. He checks his watch: nine fifty two ante-meridian. He checks his windows, there's no sun, and its darker than the blackest pits of hell.</p>\n<p>He can feel his subconscious, at least the edges of it, start to transition into panic. He marshals them back into attention to focus. His first instinct is that some sort of end-of-world scenario has taken place, that he needs to contact the Foundation, that no matter how much they hate him they need him right now, but the more he thinks, the more he's convinced that this couldn't possibly be the case.</p>\n<p>There is no screaming in the streets. There are no people in the streets. This must simply be par for the course for the citizens here. Another idiosyncrasy of Jupiter County.</p>\n<p>He feels his emotions quiet, and begins to recombobulate for the day. He takes a hot four minute and thirty nine second shower, adorns and buttons all of his layers, slips on his shoes; which have no laces as they are slip-ons; and steps outside.</p>\n\n<p>When he finally makes it downstairs, Midge is waiting for him, a bored expression on their face. They give him a half hearted greeting, not caring if he reciprocates, and sigh loudly when he embarks unto an actual conversation.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Good morning!</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Uhh\u2026 yeah. Good morning.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Can I ask you some questions about the weather here?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> I'm in no position to stop you.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Thanks. I guess. So\u2026 has it always been night here?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> As long as I've lived here.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> And how long is that?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> I'm not quite sure anymore. A while at least. You sort of lose your sense of time here.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> So, I guess it's fair to say that more than just the portal is fucked up with this place.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Yeah. More things than you can fathom.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I can fathom quite a lot. Still, I might call in reinforcements, this stuff might be a bit above, well\u2014actually below, my pay grade.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> I don't think the phone lines here have worked in a while.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> That's fine. I'll just drive to the next town over.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Won't work.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Can I ask why not?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> You can't leave.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> You should be.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I mean\u2014 why can't I leave?</p>\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> Because nobody wants you here.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A church bell rings. It rings violently and absolutely. It rings with the wrath of god. The pitter patter of sinners' feet strikes the dusty roads. Suits and dresses are slid into and pulled tight as the wicked don the finest clothes. It's not Sunday, that was yesterday, and it was the longest Sunday there ever was. It's not Sunday, but the church bell still is ringing. It is ringing with the wrath of god.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MIDGE:</strong> That's me. Got to go!</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Wait! I still don't understand\u2014</p>\n</div>\n<p>He doesn't get to finish the sentence, Midge is already gone.</p>\n\n<p>He slips between two thirty foot mahogany doors to step into the stone cathedral. It is massive, and he is confused; this church, just in terms of raw construction materials, is worth far more than the town itself. Built from granite and gold and azure-esque stones, built spiraling into the sky two hundred and fifty feet with ornate buttresses and carved edifices.</p>\n<p>The cathedral is filled with people. Daylight flows in through the windows. Something is wrong.</p>\n<p>At the center of the church is a coffin. It is open and empty. A pastor stands beside it, orating. A thin line of pale skin is drawn across his neck.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> And in life, and in love, and in death, we shall find\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> Who are you?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'm Seymore.</p>\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> You are not welcome here.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Sorry I\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>PASTOR:</strong> Get out!</p>\n</div>\n<p>The townspeople turn to stare at him, the pastor begins to hurl epithets and holy texts. One lands squarely on his skull and he feels blood flow into his mouth. He rushes towards the door and steps outside. He shuts the doors behind him and sits down on the worn granite steps. He spits the blood onto them and grabs his head in his hands, nursing the pain.</p>\n\n<p>Conrad is quick to rush outside, joining him on the stairs. The man places a hand on Starr's shoulder, and wipes the blood off the stairs with his handkerchief.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Sorry about that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah, thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You okay?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Of course. I have a question, though.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Whose funeral was it? Who died?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> No one.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Then what's the point?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I'm sorry, Mr. Starr. I don't think I can tell you that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'm afraid I have to insist.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I'm sorry, Mr. Starr.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Conrad turns and retreats into the church without saying goodbye. Starr remains on the stairs for a while, staring out at the starless night sky, cut into incessantly by neon. A puzzled look comes to rest on his face.</p>\n<p>He sighs, gears turning inside his head, trying either to understand or to remember; even he does not know which. He swallows, and he speaks unto no one.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I know how to contain the anomaly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The general store is called, boringly enough: 'General Store'. It's a small white building, though the white paint has long since started to flake away. A slim gray roof decorates the top providing much needed contrast. A worn table and two chairs mark the porch. An empty ashtray sits on the table.</p>\n<p>Starr walks inside, he is greeted by countless collectables, baseball cards and lollipops and big-league chew. An overused milkshake maker lines the shelves behind the bar and two smudged chalkboards advertise an impossible number of items. Maya Anderson waits absentmindedly behind the counter, barely noting Starr as he enters. He comes to the counter and rests his elbows upon it, getting coffee grounds onto his sleeves for his troubles.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Nice store you've got here.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It's not mine, it's my husband's. I'm just looking after it now.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I see.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> What can I do for you?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I need dynamite.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Does there have to be a reason?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Kind of, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I need it for work.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Is that the truth?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> It's not a lie.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Fine, that'll be thirty six dollars and fourteen cents, American money.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Highway fucking robbery.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Good luck getting it anywhere else.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Fine. And thank you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr pulls out a small leather wallet, producing the money, which has not been neatly folded and instead shoved inside. He forks it over to Anderson, who reaches under the counter and pulls forth a stick of dynamite, plopping it down on the countertop with inappropriate gusto.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Go crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Don't worry, I'll be careful.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> I certainly hope so.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The four metal barricades that once surrounded the portal to Jupiter have been cast aside, they lay in a pile on the edge of the square covered in the dust that they once stood upon. In their stead, vicious dynamite has been deposited, its fuse stares upwards at the portal, hungrily, wanting nothing more on the entire Earth than to explode.</p>\n<p>Seymore S. Starr sits besides the affair, holding a silver lighter in his hands and playing with it, flicking the cap open and closed and open and closed with abandon. He is quite careful to never actually produce a flame. He stares off into space, into the glowing hues of the swirling portal.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> You're barking up the wrong tree.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Maya Anderson approaches him, placing a hand on his shoulder and sitting down nearby. The dust coats her garments, but she doesn't really mind.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Don't do this.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Don't contain it? Is that what you're saying? That's my job.</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> You're not containing it. You're destroying it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What does it matter so long as it's gone?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> When the portal first showed up, <em>we</em> weren't happy about it either! Something like that changes everything you know, but you can't just make it go away. I'm not gonna peddle that 'everything happens for a reason' bullshit, but\u2026 if there <em>is</em> a reason, you owe it to yourself to at least try and find it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I just don't know how else to end it. The story, I mean. Am I just supposed to leave? Without resolving anything?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Don't talk about stories, this isn't a fucking book. Your <em>life</em> is a story, Mr. Starr. And that story can be a comedy, and a tragedy, and all of these things at once.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He looks away from her, chartreuse tears erupting from cerulean eyes. He does not remember what he has lost. He cannot remember. His body remembers.</p>\n<p>He shudders with guilt.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What if the story hurts? What if I don\u2019t like it?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It doesn\u2019t matter. You keep telling it.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What if I don\u2019t want to?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Who asked what you want?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What was the point of the funeral?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> It\u2014 it\u2019s not that easy. I can\u2019t tell you that.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Why not?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Just because the story got tough or confusing doesn\u2019t mean you get to leave the fucking theater.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> You didn\u2019t answer my question: what if the story hurts?</p>\n<p><strong>MAYA:</strong> Yes, I did.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr flicks open the lighter again, a flame bursts forth.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I'd like you to leave now, please.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>With caution, he brings the lighter to the fuse. A spark ignites it, traveling down the length of the wire. He stares at it, before stepping a bit back, following Maya Anderson's retreating footsteps.</p>\n<p>It approaches the dynamite, a glowing orange against the sea of neon pink and cyan. There's a hiss. A massive shine dapples his eyes.</p>\n<p>And it goes.</p>\n<p>The roar is deafening as the air broils and the dust dies. Enormous tongues of flame speak words of ash unto the night. Color is burned from the world. The second wave of smoke crests like a tsunami over the sullen Earth, decrying its darkness, its superiority over even the dark of the lightless stars. Particulate rapturously fills his lungs and he begins to cough and choke, his ears ring in a way they haven't since he was a little boy. The dynamite is detonated. Man's contempt for nature is decreed.</p>\n<p>And dismissed.</p>\n<p>And absolved.</p>\n<p>Cyan light begins to pump through the gaps in the smoke. The portal still stands and still swirls. A prayer to nothing has been made. It has been heard. It has gone unanswered.</p>\n<p>He sighs, though he cannot hear nor feel himself do so. Eventually, the ringing clears. He hears the rapid pitter patter of feet approach. He looks over his dust-and-ash coated shoulder. He sees Conrad's warm and worried face.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Are you okay?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Maya Anderson sent me.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I figured.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> So, why'd you do it?</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr pauses, trying to remember. A trickle of blood flows from his nose. He laps it up with his tongue, and smiles.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Well\u2014</p>\n</div>\n<p>He pauses again. The words take their time to flow to him, but they arrive regardless.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I've seen this all before, or at least things like it. Entropy, darkness, dystrophy. It's\u2014 familiar. I\u2019ve lived a million of your lives. I\u2019ve seen everything there is to see and done everything there is to do. I haven\u2019t been surprised in a hundred and twenty years.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> But I still don\u2019t understand the funeral.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> The people here hate you. If they didn't before they do now.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I know. It doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> All of our hate combined\u2026 it\u2019s not one one thousandth as much as you hate yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> That's not true.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You don\u2019t hate yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I do, but not that much.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I guess I\u2019m trying to understand this place. To read between the lines.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You can try, but there\u2019s just paper.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> What was the point of the funeral?</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Hm.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I believe you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starr stands, swatting at his knees to dust them off. He looks up at the portal with both fear and hope at once.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I know how to contain the anomaly.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He takes a deep breath, squats, locks his knees, and dives head-first into the portal.</p>\n\n<p>Gale force winds strike his body at four hundred miles per hour. Gases more toxic than those of Hell fill his lungs lacerating them from the outside in. Dust older than oceans tears through his skin and fills his veins.</p>\n<p>His consciousness is stolen away from him within the first ten seconds, yet the darkness behind his eyes is as red as the storm. A number of non-essentaial muscles snap, they are joined by a few essential ones.</p>\n<p>He spins and spirals around the portal for a several minutes that would feel like an eternity if he were feeling at all.</p>\n<p>Eventually, he drifts back through the portal.</p>\n\n<p>Seymore S. Starr awakens on the ground beside the portal, which continues to swirl. He is covered in dust and blood and vomit. He has four new scars that he does not remember. One significantly impacts his appearance, which wasn't all that great in the first place. Dried blood sticks in circles around his nose and respective ears. He feels like shit. He has massive hypoxia. Both lungs are collapsed. He should be dead. He cannot die.</p>\n<p>Against a mountain of pain and wickedness, he opens his eyes. Conrad is standing over him, and apologetic look crests the man's face.</p>\n<p>Starr slams into his own ribcage with a powerful fist. Fifteen separate parts break inside of him. He takes a shuttering, painful breath. He exhales, but there is more phlegm inside of him than air.</p>\n<p>He looks towards Conrad, at last ready for conversation.</p>\n<div class=\"talkbox\">\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> You made it to the other side. How do you feel?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Good, I think. A little empty.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> Yeah. That\u2019s how I feel too.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I saw vast cities, swathed in shadow.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> What had happened?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> No one ever remembered to turn on the lights.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> How does that happen?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> I saw men who weren\u2019t men, who wore names that weren\u2019t theirs. I understand the funeral. I saw the inside of the coffin.</p>\n<p><strong>CONRAD:</strong> And what did you see?</p>\n<p><strong>STARR:</strong> Not a body.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/jupiter-county\">Jupiter County</a>\" by sprawlingstar, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Starr is driving a beaten Toyota Rav-4 down Interstate Ninety-Five at One Hundred Twelve Miles per hour because he knows that he cannot crash. He stopped looking at the speedometer fifteen minutes ago. He stopped looking at the gas meter two states ago.\n\n\n\nHe's running. From something: maybe. To something: possibly. But he is running. Not running for his life, but for something so much more than that. He has fucked up, bad. So badly he doesn't even remember what he did, just that it was bad. This he knows for certain, because he has burrowed past every layer of knowing and consciousness within him and he has distilled this one bedrock certainty: he has fucked up //bad//.\n\n\n\nHe has lost something, something of great magnitude and importance that he could not live without and that he now must. He cannot remember what this was, either.\n\n\n\nHe keeps going, the car does not give in because it is his steel steed and it will not fail him. He doesn't have a destination in mind, maybe he just wants to keep driving until he finds something. He doesn't know what exactly that would be either.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't know a lot of things. But he knows that these highways are long and strange and contain many things that ought not exist.\n\n\n\nAnd he finds one. It's unremarkable, in the grand scheme of things, but it catches his eye; that alone is notable, he's not paying much attention to things.\n\n\n\nIt's a highway sign, green, stained, and noteless, save for its contents. The sign reads:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Jupiter County**\n\n= 16 miles to exit 6.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe slams on the breaks, returning to the speed limit, he takes exit six. He's found something that ought not exist. He smiles to himself. He doesn't know a lot of things, but he knows these roads.\n\n\n\nAnd he's never heard of Jupiter County.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nJupiter County is, in fact, not a county at all. Rather, the name belongs to a small town, right on the Colorado/New Mexico border. It is, in every way, a small town. Rust lies unabated on discarded metal, local farms provide the food, and the desert is very cruel.\n\n\n\nBut Jupiter County is not //just// a small town. Not as he would recognize it, at least. Neon lights pump vast amounts of illumination into the darkness of the night. The buildings, should, by any reasonable construction, be built from brick or EIFS, and some of them are. But others are made from cold, blue, striking steel, their visage like a cool glass of water against the beating neon pink.\n\n\n\nThe road approaching the town is in a state of disrepair, he does two hundred dollars worth of damage to his suspension from the first six potholes alone, yet, strangely, this concern evaporates once he crosses the threshold to the town proper; demarcated by a sign glowing just as harshly as\u00a0\u00a0the rest of the town. Regardless, the roads within the town proper are spotless. A series of bright yellow LEDs have been established along the double-yellow lines of the road.\n\n\n\nThe town itself rests in a valley, and this entrance road, the only road into town, curves gently downward to facilitate this, it sweeps widely and slowly, allowing him to take in the town and its bombardment of contrasting colors. He squints to see the road as his retinas strain against the attack.\n\n\n\nAnd he spots his mark.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nHe makes a beeline for the bar, pulling the car off into a barren side alley of concrete. Strangely enough, this alley is starkly clean, there's almost no dust within, and certainly no garbage. A nestled noodle-esque collection of pipes pump water and natural gas and heat into adjoining buildings. He does not see a single other person as he moseys through the town.\n\n\n\nHe at last arrives at the bar. He was raised agnostic, he does not believe in the pearly gates, but that blue and orange 'open' sign shines like sweet-fucking-salvation.\n\n\n\nOf course, his reason for being here is; and must officially be: to get to the bottom of this town that ought not exist and to figure out why it does, a bar is a good place to do that. But, truthfully, his main reason is simply that he wants to feel a little less.\n\n\n\nThe bar: **'Saturn Tavern'**, is nice enough. It certainly conforms to the theme of the county. Large sweeping arcs of cold blue steel intersected by sharp contours of brick. The interior is homely, or at least attempts to be, Colorado/New-Mexico state paraphernalia decorates the walls and the lighting is orange and warm and decidedly less-neon. But the interior is also as inescapably alien as the rest of this place. A three foot inset in the mid-level of the wall sweeps about a foot back, providing a dugout for a series of coals. These are lit, but they do not burn orange or yellow or even blue, the coals burn purple.\n\n\n\nThe bar must be having a bad night, because it is empty. He wonders if maybe it's a holiday or something, that's possible, he's pretty much lost all sense of time after all. But the bar is tended to by a tall man in his forties. He wears a tweed jacket and luxury jeans and has a cockeyed smile that suggests his mouth is used to having a cigarette in it. He introduces himself as Conrad, because that is his name, and they talk.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** What brings you to town?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Business.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Bad business?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** No, just business. I work for an organization called the SCP Foundation. We deal with things that are... off, and I think there's something off about your town.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Huh. Never noticed anything strange myself. I'm pretty sure this is how things are meant to be.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Then how come I've never heard of your town? How come it's not on any maps?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Well, we're pretty new. Founded in only nineteen fifty. What would you like to drink?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Alcohol.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** What kind of alcohol?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** The kind with liquor in it.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I'm afraid we don't offer that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What do you have?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Mostly soft drinks.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Can you add liquor to any of them?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** No.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'll take a diet coke please.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe drink, when produced, is about what he expects. It tastes much like cola, but slightly old and a tad sawdust-y and flat despite the bubbles. The two men spend quite a few moments in a companionable but vacant silence. It is only when thirty-four percent of the drink remains that Starr resumes conversation.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** So, what is there to see here? What's your claim to fame? Every town has one.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Well, there's the Hall tree, where little Stanley Hall fell thirty feet and didn't break a bone.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Hm, alright, but not really what I'm looking for.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** There's Jones Rock. That's where Sophia Jones claimed a rock and wouldn't let anyone near it, started taking potshots at people with a shotgun.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Was she okay? Was she mentally ill?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Not at all! She just thought the rock was hers. I think it actually may have been, some tax law loophole or something.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Still not really what I'm looking for.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Hmm... well, there is the portal to Jupiter.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nIt is, in fact, a portal to Jupiter. It's in the town square, where a fountain would traditionally be. It floats about a meter off the ground, and is itself about a meter from bottom to top, forming a rough\u00a0\u00a0swirling oval shape. Its edges shine with a neon blue that contrasts with the neon pink of the town. Its center is translucent, he can see right through, he sees virtually endless plumes of gas that whirl by the aperture at terrifying speeds. He swallows. There is a hurricane on Jupiter that is the size of Earth, Seymore S. Starr believes that he is staring out from its eye.\n\n\n\nSurrounding the portal are four waist-high metal barricades, the kind they have at concerts. He almost laughs, he could easily step over them and into the portal, they are a totally insufficient barrier compared to the magnitude of the threat.\n\n\n\nThe portal is either-one way or barely permeable, as dust and gas from the storm does not enter out on to the town. He is comforted by this at least. He considers methods of containment, that's still his job, despite his exile. He needs to destroy the portal, he doesn't have the resources to relocate the town and isolate it. He also can't make the people; what little there are here; forget. But they don't seem to mind the portal, if he can destroy it, that would probably be good enough.\n\n\n\nHe has no idea how to destroy the portal.\n\n\n\nConrad, standing beside him, interrupts his thoughts.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** Pretty neat, huh?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah it's uh-- it's something.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You gonna 'contain' it?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Oh, we've had plenty of you Foundation types visit. They all say they're gonna contain it, but they never get around to actually doing it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah, I'll probably try. Quick question, what happens if you stick your head inside?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** It's Jupiter, you'd die.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I can't die.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Then I guess you wouldn't die, but I reckon it'd be quite unpleasant.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Well, nothing I can do about this tonight. I'm quite tired. Anywhere I can stay for the night? A motel or something?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I've got just the place.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nLynn's Inn is, oddly enough, not run by someone called Lynn, but by a person called Midge. He doesn't get their last name, he doesn't really bother to ask, but he does, after several bouts of questions, come to learn that there never was a person called Lynn in Jupiter County. He asks Midge why they named their inn after a person that does not exist, the answer is deceptively simple: 'it rhymed'.\n\n\n\nMidge is a person of few words.\n\n\n\nHe bumbles through his pockets; of which he has many; to produce a wallet and extricate a twenty dollar bill. He pays twelve ninety-five for the night, which he thinks is a good deal, though he earnestly has no idea what inflation is like nowadays.\n\n\n\nJust as soon as they take the money and give him his key, Midge disappears into the back, a disappointed expression on their starkly pale face. They spin away from him with fervor; their white satin pants and pastel blue scarf following suit a few seconds later; before they march into the darkness of a backroom.\n\n\n\nHe turns, his key secured, and waves goodbye to Conrad, who walks out of sight and back towards his bar.\n\n\n\nStarr embarks to find his room, it's on the second floor, room six. He trudges up stairs covered in red velvet and illuminated by classical lanterns, still, it is not free from neon, the sides of the stairs containing bright yellow strips of light. After the stairs, he takes a right, then another right, and then a left, weaving through snake-like hallways to arrive at his destination, a fine, rich, mahogany door with his name in the middle.\n\n\n\nIt's not super extravagant, but it's elegant enough, a small gold plaque with imprinted red text reading '{{Seymore S. Starr}}'. This does not bother him as much as it ought to. He inserts the key and turns, it unsurprisingly works, swinging open enthusiastically. He steps inside with caution, as though the floor might at any moment abandon its corporeal claim, leaving him to fall to Earth.\n\n\n\nThe interior is nice enough, if a bit kitschy, it certainly runs with the desert theme. Sketches of cacti, animal skulls, and cowboy boots decorate the walls, but these are far from the only imagery. There is a photo album, on the table, which he picks up and begins rifling through. He sees vast deserts. He sees canyons carved by bare hands and fervor. Midnight diners who service only the wicked and truck stops disconnected from the road. He laughs, for he saw a great many of these sights before on his drive to this twice-hollow place. He sees a funeral in a godless church. He sees a prayer to nothing.\n\n\n\nHe places the collection down and begins his nighttime routine. He hangs up his outer coat, a long gray affair that hangs down to his knees, unbuttons his dress shirt and throws it to the ground, yanks his belt from its loops and hangs it near the overcoat, and pulls off his socks. He left his nightwear in the car, so sleeping in jeans it is.\n\n\n\nHe roams over to the sink, turns in onto cold, and clumsily intakes a mouthful of water, he gargles for half a minute before expulsing it down the drain. He takes another mouthful of water to drink. He turns the water to hot and splashes some on his face, which trickles down his oversized nose.\n\n\n\nHe cracks his knuckles, switches off the lights, and crawls into the covers after making a quick sweep for; thankfully absent; bedbugs. He symmetrizes his body, takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes. It will be an hour and twelve minutes before he actually falls asleep.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nInside the Saturn Tavern, Conrad is meeting a woman who calls herself Maya Anderson. It's not her real name, everyone knows that, but that's the only one they have for her, so they press on. She's tall, but not extraordinarily tall. She's well dressed, but not extravagantly so. She's talkative, but not loquacious. Except, maybe, for tonight. She has a lot to say tonight, as much as she can while taking the time to draft down a can of Pabst.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** Didya hear about the new guy?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Hear about him? I'm the one who first met him! How did you hear about him?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** I heard it from Willem, who heard it from Midge, who heard it from someone else, probably you.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** And what do you make of him?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Well... he's not a good man, maybe even a bad one. But he thinks he can close the portal, and well... that'd get him into my good books.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** What's your problem with the portal?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** I'm ready to move on, Conrad. To leave this place.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You could. You have a car.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** We both know that's not true.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Your husband?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Yeah. I mean-- it feels like he grows more distant every day.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** It'll be okay.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It won't, but you're sweet for sayin' it.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Thanks.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Thank you for the drink. See you tomorrow?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Of course. I wouldn't miss it.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nSeymore S. Starr awakens confused. He feels well rested, and yet all of his senses combine to provide the compulsion that it is still the dead of night. He checks his watch: nine fifty two ante-meridian. He checks his windows, there's no sun, and its darker than the blackest pits of hell.\n\n\n\nHe can feel his subconscious, at least the edges of it, start to transition into panic. He marshals them back into attention to focus. His first instinct is that some sort of end-of-world scenario has taken place, that he needs to contact the Foundation, that no matter how much they hate him they need him right now, but the more he thinks, the more he's convinced that this couldn't possibly be the case.\n\n\n\nThere is no screaming in the streets. There are no people in the streets. This must simply be par for the course for the citizens here. Another idiosyncrasy of Jupiter County.\n\n\n\nHe feels his emotions quiet, and begins to recombobulate for the day. He takes a hot four minute and thirty nine second shower, adorns and buttons all of his layers, slips on his shoes; which have no laces as they are slip-ons; and steps outside.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWhen he finally makes it downstairs, Midge is waiting for him, a bored expression on their face. They give him a half hearted greeting, not caring if he reciprocates, and sigh loudly when he embarks unto an actual conversation.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** Good morning!\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Uhh... yeah. Good morning.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Can I ask you some questions about the weather here?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** I'm in no position to stop you.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Thanks. I guess. So... has it always been night here?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** As long as I've lived here.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** And how long is that?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** I'm not quite sure anymore. A while at least. You sort of lose your sense of time here.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** So, I guess it's fair to say that more than just the portal is fucked up with this place.\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Yeah. More things than you can fathom.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I can fathom quite a lot. Still, I might call in reinforcements, this stuff might be a bit above, well--actually below, my pay grade.\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** I don't think the phone lines here have worked in a while.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** That's fine. I'll just drive to the next town over.\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Won't work.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Can I ask why not?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** You can't leave.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'm sorry?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** You should be.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I mean-- why can't I leave?\n\n\n\n**MIDGE:** Because nobody wants you here.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA church bell rings. It rings violently and absolutely. It rings with the wrath of god. The pitter patter of sinners' feet strikes the dusty roads. Suits and dresses are slid into and pulled tight as the wicked don the finest clothes. It's not Sunday, that was yesterday, and it was the longest Sunday there ever was. It's not Sunday, but the church bell still is ringing. It is ringing with the wrath of god.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MIDGE:** That's me. Got to go!\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Wait! I still don't understand--\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe doesn't get to finish the sentence, Midge is already gone.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nHe slips between two thirty foot mahogany doors to step into the stone cathedral. It is massive, and he is confused; this church, just in terms of raw construction materials, is worth far more than the town itself. Built from granite and gold and azure-esque stones, built spiraling into the sky two hundred and fifty feet with ornate buttresses and carved edifices.\n\n\n\nThe cathedral is filled with people. Daylight flows in through the windows. Something is wrong.\n\n\n\nAt the center of the church is a coffin. It is open and empty. A pastor stands beside it, orating. A thin line of pale skin is drawn across his neck.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**PASTOR:** And in life, and in love, and in death, we shall find--\n\n\n\n**PASTOR:** Who are you?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'm Seymore.\n\n\n\n**PASTOR:** You are not welcome here.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Sorry I--\n\n\n\n**PASTOR:** Get out!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe townspeople turn to stare at him, the pastor begins to hurl epithets and holy texts. One lands squarely on his skull and he feels blood flow into his mouth. He rushes towards the door and steps outside. He shuts the doors behind him and sits down on the worn granite steps. He spits the blood onto them and grabs his head in his hands, nursing the pain.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nConrad is quick to rush outside, joining him on the stairs. The man places a hand on Starr's shoulder, and wipes the blood off the stairs with his handkerchief.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** Sorry about that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah, thanks.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** You okay?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Of course. I have a question, though.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Shoot.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Whose funeral was it? Who died?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** No one.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Then what's the point?\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I'm sorry, Mr. Starr. I don't think I can tell you that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I'm afraid I have to insist.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** I'm sorry, Mr. Starr.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nConrad turns and retreats into the church without saying goodbye. Starr remains on the stairs for a while, staring out at the starless night sky, cut into incessantly by neon. A puzzled look comes to rest on his face.\n\n\n\nHe sighs, gears turning inside his head, trying either to understand or to remember; even he does not know which. He swallows, and he speaks unto no one.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I know how to contain the anomaly.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe general store is called, boringly enough: 'General Store'. It's a small white building, though the white paint has long since started to flake away. A slim gray roof decorates the top providing much needed contrast. A worn table and two chairs mark the porch. An empty ashtray sits on the table.\n\n\n\nStarr walks inside, he is greeted by countless collectables, baseball cards and lollipops and big-league chew. An overused milkshake maker lines the shelves behind the bar and two smudged chalkboards advertise an impossible number of items. Maya Anderson waits absentmindedly behind the counter, barely noting Starr as he enters. He comes to the counter and rests his elbows upon it, getting coffee grounds onto his sleeves for his troubles.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** Nice store you've got here.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It's not mine, it's my husband's. I'm just looking after it now.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I see.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** What can I do for you?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I need dynamite.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Why?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Does there have to be a reason?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Kind of, yeah.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I need it for work.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Is that the truth?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** It's not a lie.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Fine, that'll be thirty six dollars and fourteen cents, American money.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Highway fucking robbery.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Good luck getting it anywhere else.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Fine. And thank you.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr pulls out a small leather wallet, producing the money, which has not been neatly folded and instead shoved inside. He forks it over to Anderson, who reaches under the counter and pulls forth a stick of dynamite, plopping it down on the countertop with inappropriate gusto.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** Go crazy.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Don't worry, I'll be careful.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** I certainly hope so.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nThe four metal barricades that once surrounded the portal to Jupiter have been cast aside, they lay in a pile on the edge of the square covered in the dust that they once stood upon. In their stead, vicious dynamite has been deposited, its fuse stares upwards at the portal, hungrily, wanting nothing more on the entire Earth than to explode.\n\n\n\nSeymore S. Starr sits besides the affair, holding a silver lighter in his hands and playing with it, flicking the cap open and closed and open and closed with abandon. He is quite careful to never actually produce a flame. He stares off into space, into the glowing hues of the swirling portal.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** You're barking up the wrong tree.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nMaya Anderson approaches him, placing a hand on his shoulder and sitting down nearby. The dust coats her garments, but she doesn't really mind.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**MAYA:** Don't do this.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Don't contain it? Is that what you're saying? That's my job.\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** You're not containing it. You're destroying it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What does it matter so long as it's gone?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** When the portal first showed up, //we// weren't happy about it either! Something like that changes everything you know, but you can't just make it go away. I'm not gonna peddle that 'everything happens for a reason' bullshit, but... if there //is// a reason, you owe it to yourself to at least try and find it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I just don't know how else to end it. The story, I mean. Am I just supposed to leave? Without resolving anything?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Don't talk about stories, this isn't a fucking book. Your //life// is a story, Mr. Starr. And that story can be a comedy, and a tragedy, and all of these things at once.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe looks away from her, chartreuse tears erupting from cerulean eyes. He does not remember what he has lost. He cannot remember. His body remembers.\n\n\n\nHe shudders with guilt.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** What if the story hurts? What if I don\u2019t like it?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It doesn\u2019t matter. You keep telling it.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What if I don\u2019t want to?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Who asked what you want?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** What was the point of the funeral?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** It-- it\u2019s not that easy. I can\u2019t tell you that.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Why not?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Just because the story got tough or confusing doesn\u2019t mean you get to leave the fucking theater.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** You didn\u2019t answer my question: what if the story hurts?\n\n\n\n**MAYA:** Yes, I did.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr flicks open the lighter again, a flame bursts forth.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I'd like you to leave now, please.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nWith caution, he brings the lighter to the fuse. A spark ignites it, traveling down the length of the wire. He stares at it, before stepping a bit back, following Maya Anderson's retreating footsteps.\n\n\n\nIt approaches the dynamite, a glowing orange against the sea of neon pink and cyan. There's a hiss. A massive shine dapples his eyes.\n\n\n\nAnd it goes.\n\n\n\nThe roar is deafening as the air broils and the dust dies. Enormous tongues of flame speak words of ash unto the night. Color is burned from the world. The second wave of smoke crests like a tsunami over the sullen Earth, decrying its darkness, its superiority over even the dark of the lightless stars. Particulate rapturously fills his lungs and he begins to cough and choke, his ears ring in a way they haven't since he was a little boy. The dynamite is detonated. Man's contempt for nature is decreed.\n\n\n\nAnd dismissed.\n\n\n\nAnd absolved.\n\n\n\nCyan light begins to pump through the gaps in the smoke. The portal still stands and still swirls. A prayer to nothing has been made. It has been heard. It has gone unanswered.\n\n\n\nHe sighs, though he cannot hear nor feel himself do so. Eventually, the ringing clears. He hears the rapid pitter patter of feet approach. He looks over his dust-and-ash coated shoulder. He sees Conrad's warm and worried face.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** Are you okay?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Yeah.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Maya Anderson sent me.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I figured.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** --\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** So, why'd you do it?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nStarr pauses, trying to remember. A trickle of blood flows from his nose. He laps it up with his tongue, and smiles.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** Well--\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe pauses again. The words take their time to flow to him, but they arrive regardless.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**STARR:** I've seen this all before, or at least things like it. Entropy, darkness, dystrophy. It's-- familiar. I\u2019ve lived a million of your lives. I\u2019ve seen everything there is to see and done everything there is to do. I haven\u2019t been surprised in a hundred and twenty years.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** --\n\n\n\n**STARR:** But I still don\u2019t understand the funeral.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** The people here hate you. If they didn't before they do now.\n\n\n\n**STARR:** I know.

Gases more toxic than those of Hell fill his lungs lacerating them from the outside in.

A number of non-essentaial muscles snap, they are joined by a few essential ones.\n\n\n\nHe spins and spirals around the portal for a several minutes that would feel like an eternity if he were feeling at all.\n\n\n\nEventually, he drifts back through the portal.\n\n\n\n[[=image portal.png style=\"width: 50px; margin: 2rem auto;\"]]\n\n\n\nSeymore S. Starr awakens on the ground beside the portal, which continues to swirl. He is covered in dust and blood and vomit. He has four new scars that he does not remember. One significantly impacts his appearance, which wasn't all that great in the first place. Dried blood sticks in circles around his nose and respective ears. He feels like shit. He has massive hypoxia. Both lungs are collapsed. He should be dead. He cannot die.\n\n\n\nAgainst a mountain of pain and wickedness, he opens his eyes. Conrad is standing over him, and apologetic look crests the man's face.\n\n\n\nStarr slams into his own ribcage with a powerful fist. Fifteen separate parts break inside of him. He takes a shuttering, painful breath. He exhales, but there is more phlegm inside of him than air.\n\n\n\nHe looks towards Conrad, at last ready for conversation.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"talkbox\"]]\n\n**CONRAD:** You made it to the other side. How do you feel?\n\n\n\n**STARR:** Good, I think. A little empty.\n\n\n\n**CONRAD:** Yeah.

Heh, no, I don\u2019t mean that with certainty, but as you well know, I am a studied and avid researcher in the biota that call the curious corners of this vast Verse home! From the Singing Snailwings of Orchard\u2019s Horsehead Nebula to the emergent fauna of the Resurge-Verdance Sector. Yet, all of that is fairly close to home. That is why my next sojourn takes me further afield than ever before.</p>\n<p>Lampeter. The decaying behemoth that touches more worlds than the brain could possibly imagine. Many have delved into the history of the line and the cultures that traveled across it for carousel, conquest, curiosity, and concern, but in those scattered worlds, left to rust and Neon in many cases, I have heard that one can still find life.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t mean those of a mind, like you or I, dear listener, no, no, the primal and pristine. I seek to discover what remains of the East\u2019s Wilds\u2026 if any are to remain. A risky endeavor, I am well aware, but we\u2019re running out of time to know, aren\u2019t we?</p>\n<p>However, I believe my environ may give away that I have taken a brief detour prior to the adventure\u2019s start.</p>\n<p>Lamplight! The city on the edge of Everis! Again, much has been said of the people and arts of this place, and the mysteries abounding beyond.</p>\n<p>But many forget that Humans and similar are not the only occupants of this wonderful city.</p>\n<p>So come with me as we delve into the feral fauna of lustrous Lamplight!</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>History &amp; Commanlities</strong><br/>\nWhile I do not intend to put much focus on it, as noted above, one can not understand the origin and proliferation of the fauna within this delightful domain without at least having some knowledge of from whence they came.</p>\n<p>Lamplight the body, has been here longer than any living or immortal has enough memory to know.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:700px;\"><img alt=\"Lamplight3.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/life-of-lamplight-part-i/Lamplight3.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Artist's Approximation of Lamplight</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lamplight the city was founded by <em>the</em> Jean-Antoine Delacroix, a beloved yet bereaved poet of my own Orchard, entirely by accident. He endeavored to make this place a home for those cast aside by the greater Verse, the outcast and the lost. One can say that he\u2026 partially succeeded, but long after he claimed his own life, as the life he had been attempting to escape came calling on his doorstep anyway.</p>\n<p>Today, Lamplight is an enclave beyond the edge of Everis and the only known domain of the Neverwas, not even the Neon can reach here, to which I imagine the many that have come to call this shaded domain home are thankful. While smaller enclaves fill in the cracks and rest amidst the borders, Lamplight is best known for its five major enclaves.</p>\n<p>Kievan and Aetherium of Orchard, Giotto of Sol, Neoclassical of the Neon-Lost London, and Nomad of the Many Steppes.</p>\n<p>I will go into the ecology of each origin more later on, but much of Lamplight has been explained by others far more informed than <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5005\">I</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, while the city is divided into five major conclaves, with congruent fauna often most tightly grouped within each district despite the feral nature of most of the as-yet-mentioned specimens, three emergent commonalities are found across all nonsophont species that have come to call Lamplight home.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The first is largely behavioral, with all nonsophont species showing great reticence towards stepping beyond the city\u2019s outermost borders, even though that is where the most \u201cwild\u201d territory can be found. Abandoned farm plots, abandoned parks, overgrown personal gardens of the latest artist to slip away into the Evernothing. Places of comparative plenty, but few beasts stay here for long, going through a daily migration of consumption and flight back into the more\u2026 hmm, I suppose real is fitting, core of the city.</p>\n<p>The sole exception is the beasts that congregate about and call the lone \u201clake\u201d, in truth, the city\u2019s largest reservoir. One of Delacroix\u2019s earliest and perhaps most expensive pet project tied to making this place livable. This region is known as the Wild District among locals. However, since most within the city, excluding those in the depths of truest melancholy, avoid it altogether, it is not considered part of the city proper.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The second, as you may have noticed from the video feed, Lamplight, after a fashion, has a fairly boreal climate, and the fog and snow are a near-constant presence. As such, all species have undergone rapid adaptation. Thicker coats are the most common adaptation, with colorations marked for long-term polar living; of course, the weather thankfully never gets quite so cold. Snow falls heaviest within the Wild District, yet something about the soil keeps just enough of the plants verdant to keep the cycle turning.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Lastly, and most striking are the, well, I suppose the only term I can really use to compare what sits before me are the \u201cribbons\u201d that emerge from each nonsophont creature within Lamplight. Fur, skin, even flesh and viscera on occasion flutter back in thin flat ribbons from the tips of ears, ends of tails, along the back like a mane, or from amidst their joints.</p>\n<p>Yet, none of the animals I have witnessed seem at all distressed by these alterations, and having witnessed a handful of young with similar markers I can only conclude this is some adaption or mark of the non matter, indeed they do appear to be after-a-fashion only half there, as I have seen their supposedly solid forms fade and faze through stone and wood, again without reaction by the connected creature. Why this\u2026 unraveling seems to do no apparent harm I cannot say, for its resemblance to the nonmatter\u2019s consumptive touch upon sophonts who have dared it are uncanny.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the folk here have many stories of those who have come back, unraveling like a bad wool sweater, yet when I remark upon the creature\u2019s alterations, all that greets me are shrugs and dull mutters of uncertainty. Indeed, I think that the obsessions that this place engenders in the sophont mind keep long timers for engaging with any mysteries beyond the cold promise of the Void beyond and the centering warmth of the fire at their back. I have yet to meet an individual who has not had their eyes burrowing into one or the other, but I digress. Let us begin this animalia accounting in earnest, yes?!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>The Keivan District</strong></p>\n<p>Also known as the Victorian District or Old Lamplight, it is the oldest and most central part of the city proper. As such, its introduced fauna have had the longest relative time to proliferate and adapt to the abnature of Lamplight.</p>\n<p>Now, Orchard\u2019s Earth, from which much of the fauna and native populace claim descent, excluding a smattering of Or-Martian and Titanians, is distinct from the likes of Sol due to the commonality of forest biomes over others. Indeed, while Sol can be said to be marked in the majority by patchwork grassland and desert when it comes to terrestrial biomes, forests of all kinds mark much of Or-Earth\u2019s surface. With the folk of Orchard, pardon my laconic, wrenching their heads from their behinds when it comes to environmentalism, their towering old wood biomes still cover a great breadth of land even in the modern day.</p>\n<p>As most of the trees are fruit-bearing, and indeed most Keivan dishes rely heavily on fruit products, one can see why the Verse gained the name, now can\u2019t you?</p>\n<p>Of course, for our purposes, this distinction in biome is more critical for the adaptations that emerged amongst the world\u2019s fauna. Indeed, most terrestrial species are at least partially arboreal, including those that I imagine would quite shock a Sol resident. However, the likes of an <strong>Arbor Elephant(<em>Elephas scanderes</em>)</strong> are far too large for the urban sparsity of Lamplight. Those animals that thrived here amidst that first batch of settlers were on the smaller side of things. Indeed, while in decline due to the greater potential of the livestock introduced into the Nomad district, <strong>Keivan Deer(<em>Dama lanas</em>)</strong> are still kept by those few families that Delacroix wished to see resettled, before, of course, it became a place of rhapsody and opium.</p>\n<p>The Keivan Deer were brought not for meat, but mainly for milk and their thick fur, which has only grown denser in their time amidst Lamplight. This fur is water-resistant, heat-retaining, and surprisingly soft, and while the practice has fallen on the wayside with the advent of trade and creation of more advanced textiles, many Keivan families gift their children scarves, hats, and mittens to stave off the cold, knit from the naturally strikingly colored fur.</p>\n<p>Keivan Deer have been domesticated for so long that populations in the wild are considered feral, and they have taken well to the Orchard\u2019s wilderness. Still, unlike many other feral populations, they have integrated without causing significant environmental damage. On Lamplight, most deer that remain are indeed feral but approachable by sophonts.</p>\n<p>They are not large animals; most stand less than a meter at the shoulder. As noted, their dappled fur comes in a number of bright colorations, yellow, red, and a silvery blue being the most common.</p>\n<p>They are browsers most typically, consuming fruits and leaves over most grasses, though they will graze on occasion, and I did get the chance to observe a moment of opportunistic omnivory, though what the doe was picking over I couldn\u2019t quite see, rotted and pitted by the nothing as it was.</p>\n<p>While most cervine males compete against each other in clattering head-butting contests with their antlers, it can be said that the Keivan Deer are somewhat lacking in that department. Indeed, while both genders retain antlers for almost the entire year, they are dull and nubby things, bred down to lessen the danger totheir handlers when one gets miffed or, in some cases, overly playful. As the feral populations have had relatively little time to regain their ancestral weapons, they instead compete with another typical trait amongst certain cervines.</p>\n<p>Their voice.</p>\n<p>Herds in Orchard can number in the hundreds, their harrowing calls muffled by the dense undergrowth and hearty canopy, so while those on Lamplight number only about fifty individuals in the largest I was able to observe, their calls are far louder. Indeed, I had quite a fright the first time it happened, as all the sound that accompanied it seemed to fall quiet, their arching cry bouncing against every window and wall, then echoing out into the never. I had heard of the Pattern Screamer, the dread folk of the Never, seeking to be remembered by those who never knew them. But imagine my embarrassment when my drinking companion laughed and informed me one of the bucks was simply exceptionally randy\u2026</p>\n<p>But yes, they actively challenge each other into screaming matches, with the loudest attracting the most mates. Fawns are born in what approximates spring here in Lamplight, and the little bundles are said to be some of the cutest and most awkward things you can imagine, all legs with their fur buffed out in a near-perfect circle.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:700px;\"><img alt=\"KeivanDeer.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/life-of-lamplight-part-i/KeivanDeer.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>A Keivan Buck &amp; Doe</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, I should say their shrieking calls are not the only sounds to break the relatively tranquil Keivan nights.</p>\n<p>As I stated previously, Delacroix worked hard in those initial days to make Lamplight livable. However, those actions are curiously absent in conversation. Most visitors and natives are eager to speak of his art or his demise. Rather disarming, if I may say so.</p>\n<p>Regardless, while snow is plentiful on Lamplight, it seems to have emerged only after human habitation. Yet another curiosity of this impossible place. Of course, snowfall alone, even if it is arguably constant, is not enough water to found a city upon. I can\u2019t exactly say how Delacroix did it, but he carved a reservoir out of the \u201cearth\u201d and managed to fill it to the brim with fresh water. Only a minuscule portion was snowmelt, if the story holds. What little information I could find regarding its creation variably mentions an Orkney Priest, an Antarctican Ice Merchant, or something beneath the city proper.</p>\n<p>Regardless, after digging canals and wells, his fledgling settlement had all the water it could need. He took to populating it with a smattering of foliage and fauna. The first bit of greenery Lamplight would see. Now, all the fish are relatively common, and there is a curious similarity in form and habit across the Verse, at least in the West, from my experience. It\u2019s when things take root that commonalities start to diverge.</p>\n<p>But one occupant stands out above all others.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Vast Lakes Whale(<em>Brachiocetus interiomeridias</em>)</strong>, also known as the Champosaurus, or Meridian Nessie. The smallest of the Brachiocetids shifted into a freshwater habitat, scattered across numerous sizable lakes in the Northeastern portion of the Meridian continent, with a high level of speciation, likely caused by population isolation when water levels fell during Orchard\u2019s first ice age.</p>\n<p>Of course, most on Sol would fail to recognize them as a whale, and may indeed make closer to the likes of plesiosaurs, though their long necks are far wider, and in the case of the Vast Lakes Whale itself, still retain a set of functional forelegs. In truth, I have always found the animals to more closely resemble a vast but misshapen goose! The largest bulls grow up to nine meters from the tip of their conical heads down to their pronged tails, though again a surprising amount of that length is their necks.</p>\n<p>They are starkly intelligent yet painfully shy. Despite their closer proximity to human populations, they are among the least understood cetaceans on Orchard\u2019s earth! They were the national animal of the Vast Lakes Confederacy. The star of numerous nature documentaries, art pieces, and children\u2019s stories, due to a mixture of their mysterious nature and delightful singing. Notably, they are capable of vocalizing above the waves, one of the key distinctions of the Brachiocetids, excluding their divergent body plans.</p>\n<p>What mattered to Delacroix in his desire to transplant them to Lamplight was that they were the favorite animals of one Emily Woolf.</p>\n<p>I am uncertain if he wished for a link to her in this dour place or if he sought to win her attention to his endeavoring, after all, as I have mentioned, many of their mutual acquaintances came to call Lamplight their home in those early years, and perhaps believed she, too, would join in. A salve for his disappointment?</p>\n<p>But she never did.</p>\n<p>And so the whales were left to go as wild as they could manage in the comparatively minuscule reservoir to their natural habitat. Now, one would think they would have suffered greatly and eventually expired, for the original pod was composed of but thirty individuals, a fairly limited gene pool.</p>\n<p>But they remain, though their numbers have never gotten above more than a hundred individuals at any one time. Their success is believed to be due to two distinct advantages: one shaped by evolution and the other, quite honestly, an utter accident.</p>\n<p>The latter being that Delacroix was not very particular about where he drew the whales from. As I mentioned, there is a great deal of genetic variance, nearly a dozen distinct subspecies, if not more! Yet, they can all interbreed and produce fertile offspring! This variance in individuals seems to have worked in the animal\u2019s favor when it came to avoiding complications. Indeed, I noticed at least three calves amongst the pod, their coloration a delightful mixture of the white and black dappling of the Lake Suprema subspecies and the distinct pink flair of the more coastal Aerie variety.</p>\n<p>Then came their preferred feeding method: suction. On Orchard, they root about the lake bottoms, drawing in rotting vegetation and all manner of invertebrates and fish hiding in the mud. Lamplight has always baffled botanists and environmentalists, but honestly, no plants should be able to grow in these environs. Yet, something in the \"soil\" of this place makes them grow far beyond what should be realistically probable.</p>\n<p>It appears that the whales can also make use of these additional nutrients, and from my observations, they dine more on the mud itself than on the critters lurking within it! Indeed, that would make them some of the largest detritivores I have ever encountered!</p>\n<p>And while I mentioned the apex growth of the whales on Orchard, I was amazed to discover this as less than the median amongst the Lamplight pod! Indeed, the largest specimen I observed nearly doubled that length! A matronly female who seemed to spend much of her time singing, fraying head raised towards the sky, eyes as milky as the light above our head. Truly a magnificent creature.</p>\n<p>And the singing like a pipe organ down-pitched so low you hear it in your stomach before it ever reaches your ears. Haunting, enchanting, and similarly echoing as the calls of the deer. There is a clear melody to their calls, a lulling, pleasant cadence that the other adult pod members will take up and rejoinder from at random moments, a chaotic and captivating chorus that I listened to for what must have been half a day.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the natives swear the beasts aren\u2019t simply singing instinctive tunes, but are reciting the words of Delacroix. One rather avid individual showed me how she had perfectly matched the matron\u2019s tones to the meter of his last work. Indeed, I found myself joined in my revery by a surprising number of individuals, all with the void-haunted gaze of the disposessed. But there was something in their eyes that lingered, as if the tune was keeping them anchored. It was\u2026 disconcerting, if I might be frank, and while they are wise and striking animals, I failed to recognize the \u201cbrilliance of Delacroix \u201cin their calls.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:700px;\"><img alt=\"VLWhale.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/life-of-lamplight-part-i/VLWhale.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>A Singing Beauty</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I could go on about other aspects of both beasts I found alluring or several other creatures I observed in my time in the district, yet this is not the only region of the city that has been made a home for Orchard fauna!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>The Aetherium District:</strong></p>\n<p>The Aetherium District is a motley of clashing designs done large. Its buildings tower taller than a good portion of the rest of the city. This verticality is often noted as the second wave of settlers\u2019 attempts to \u201crise above the plights and worries of home\u201d. A completely understandable movement considering the horrors they walked away from. The majority of the buildings in the district look partially decayed, with rust and graffiti a purposeful commonality.</p>\n<p>Additionally, all manner of invasive greenery is allowed to flourish, with certain elements integrated into the power grid, crafting a curiously nihilistic solar punk existence for much of the district. This does make it occasionally difficult to realize when one wanders from the district into the adjoining \u201cwilds\u201d, at least for visitors. The natives seem intimately aware of every intricate distinction, which are numerous and near nonsensical, fitting the original anarchistic mindset of the founding inhabitants.</p>\n<p>While most of the settlers in the Keivan District came from the Republic, Strathclyde, and other neighboring nations, those who founded Aetherium were more varied, with significant population groups drawn from all eight of Orchard-Earth\u2019s continents. This also meant that a number of more niche fauna were brought along, primarily as pets, but in this case, in the name of conservation, as the \u201cBurnt Apple War\u201d had devastated numerous biomes to the point of ruin.</p>\n<p>Sahuli, Zealandian, and Northern Kalmaktaman fauna are the most common, from my initial investigations. Yet the animal that today exemplifies the district can be found anywhere on Orchard, but has particularly thrived in this section of Lamplight.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Gyrfox(<em>Avivulpes falcons</em>)</strong> can similarly be found anywhere in Lamplight, but it is to Aetherium that most return each night. One of the most common winged carnivores in Orchard, this canine is a member of the fox family. Indeed, their overall body shape closely resembles that of their terrestrial cousins, though they tend to assume a stooped posture when at rest, like a squirrel.</p>\n<p>Of course, their wings are the most significant distinction: powerfully muscled yet relatively compact, they allow the Gyrfox to make sudden stops and aid in tight turns, which they used in Orchard to expertly weave through the boughs and trunks of the ever-expanding forests. Other adaptations include a more compact muzzle, lengthened hind limb claws, and a flattened tail to further aid in their acrobatic flight. Their eyes are quite large, and they rely on a combination of sight and scent to pinpoint prey. The majority have white fur, though occasional black, grey, and merlot spotting/patching has been observed.</p>\n<p>The Lamplight subspecies has an additional adaptation. The nonmatter seems to be integrated into their systems in a manner akin to an internal \u201cairbag\u201d, allowing them to dive from incredible heights onto prey and resist any lasting damage from the increased strain on their otherwise unadapted bodies. I believe this trait evolved due to Lamplight\u2019s comparative sparsity, allowing prey to have more time to see a Gyrfox approaching in their standard hunting patterns, necessitating they hit harder and faster.</p>\n<p>Of course, the beasts are omnivorous and eager scavengers. I have witnessed them launch after a floundering quail and a tossed muffin with equal gusto.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the majority come home to roost in Aetherium each \u201cnight\u201d, nesting in the nooks and crannies at the highest points they can reach. While they spend much of their day solo or in pairs, mated or siblings, most commonly, according to my observations, at night they huddle together in \u201ccuddle-puddles\u201d as the natives dub them. Up to fifty individuals, their nests crafted largely of scavenged metal, wood, and stolen laundry/cloth goods. Kits are similarly raised communally, with parents showing very little favoritism toward their own young.</p>\n<p>Notably, despite their classification as thieves by most Lamplighters I have spoken to, their antics are treated with a communal brevity. Some claimed they had been blessed by a Gyrfox, which I came to learn meant having their food stolen right from their hands, or having their scarf or hat pulled free of their person. Indeed, I did see a number of \u201cdomesticated\u201d Gyrfoxes in my time on Lamplight, though the animals seemed to only stick with their chosen person during the day, flitting off the moment they sensed \u201cnight\u201d had come.</p>\n<p>They are affectionate animals, that I can assure you. Their antics largely remind me of Sol\u2019s Corvids, though lacking in their mimicry capabilities. If one finds the allure of these creatures pressing, I must remind you: for all their differences, these are still foxes.</p>\n<p>Which means, in polite terms, they are quite keen on marking their territory, including their owners. It is a rather pungent perfume, ha.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:700px;\"><img alt=\"Gyrfox.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/life-of-lamplight-part-i/Gyrfox.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Mischief on the Wing</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>But as I said, you can\u2019t throw a biscuit in Lamplight without a Gyrfox snatching it up, and I promised that each district had its own distinctive fauna. Well, worry not.</p>\n<p>But what to focus on: the jungles and savannahs of Sahul, the fjords and temperate rainforests of Zealandia, or the scrublands of Kalmaktama?</p>\n<p>Ah, how about I discuss the little-understood \u201cassistant architects,\u201d known as the <strong>Wardu-Utan (<em>Driptodon pseudocalicothere</em>)</strong>.</p>\n<p>As I stated, these animals are a fair bit mysterious, which is even more stark considering their great size. They live in a particularly isolated portion of Sahul, high in the northern cloud forests, where their domain is walled off. I do not mean to say that the native sophont populations keep outside scientists from observing them. That is a whole other issue entirely, largely due to the ongoing separatist movement in the region, but we aren\u2019t here to discuss modern politics.</p>\n<p>No, the barrier, an immense wall crafted from the thick trunks of the local mountain ash, is entirely the making of the Wardu-Utan themselves.</p>\n<p>While close in size to polar bears, the beings have slotted into a niche in many ways comparable to that of beavers, serving as environmental engineers with a keen instinct for majestic architectural feats. Though while the latter focus more on damming river ways and constructing lodges for rest, the Warda-Utan build walls around their favored feeding grounds. Thus keeping out other large herbivores and defending their relatively defenseless young from native predators, including the <strong>Sahulian Tiger(<em>Panthera tigris sahuli</em>)</strong> and <strong>Greater Drake(<em>Varanus priscus</em>)</strong>.</p>\n<p>The limited observation on Orchard that has been recorded, outside of the information mentioned above, notes they live communally, and show signs of tool use on par with, if not greater than, great apes. Of course, this has not been fully corroborated, and much of what is said about the animals is left to speculation and cryptozoological debates.</p>\n<p>This makes their presence on Lamplight even more confusing. As I mentioned, many Sahulian expatriates and their descendants live in Aetherium, yet not a one of them could say when or how the animals first arrived in the district.</p>\n<p>I will admit that a great deal of my time on Lamplight was spent observing them. Yet, I do not believe my observations of these beings should be taken into account at all regarding the behavior of the main species back on Orchard.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the debate about their intelligence has been ongoing for quite some time. Conversations with natives and my own observations seem to suggest that the beings are on the edge of sophontism. If they have not already crossed the proverbial, relatively archaic \u201cline\u201d. They are capable of understanding the spoken word at least to some extent, which aids in their \u201cjob\u201d within the district, and they seem to know not to stray beyond the district unless told or asked to do so. Furthermore, I have seen them actively decorate themselves with scavenged baubles or gifts, and they are ready guardians of children left in their care, though this has occasionally, at least according to native tales, gone awry in the past when one got \u201ctoo serious\u201d about adopting their \u201cward\u201d.</p>\n<p>They are burly animals, with their brown fur growing far thicker than in their natural habitat, giving them the appearance, at least at a passing glance, of a Highland Cow with a gorilla-like stance, except for their large, rodent-like teeth, which are distinctively silvery-black.</p>\n<p>As for their \u201caccidental architect\u201d appellation, as noted, Aetherium tends towards dilapidation, meaning that some buildings are often just left to fallow. This is where the Wardu-Utan come in.</p>\n<p>In their natural habitat, they are believed to eat wood, bamboo, and other plant material. Such materials are relatively rare, as I have noted, so the animals had to adapt.</p>\n<p>And so they did, with their current diet consisting of a minority of plant matter and a majority of metal and stone of all varieties. Indeed, the animals\u2019 bites increase the level of rust and decay in the objects they consume, allowing them to break them down more easily and adding to the district\u2019s anarchistic flair.</p>\n<p>They are slow eaters, and most fully grown Lamplight Wardu-Utan only need one meal a month. The material they don\u2019t eat, they gather and assemble into their dens, with many visitors approaching what they at first believe to be modern art displays, only to be startled by the looming form of a rudely awoken rust-covered beast.</p>\n<p>What is more, their dung, which retains the cubular shape curiously common amongst wombats across the Verse, while not being of much use for fertilizer, consists mainly of unalloyed metals. The natives occasionally use these as building materials or to create a number of other metallic objects. I admit I was a tad suspicious of the metal tankard that was pressed upon me by the same bartender who revealed that fact to me.</p>\n<p>I am a bit baffled by their ready consumption and processing of such materials, for while this is far from irregular in the grand scope of the Verse, this kind of adaptation would take thousands upon thousands of generations, not this markedly short period of time.</p>\n<p>Yet we all know Lamplight is anything but the norm. Indeed, I was able to convince an individual to allow me a look at their teeth, offering my canteen, a pitted and aged bit of Palisade Titanium as payment.</p>\n<p>It appears that the animals have adapted a \u201cenameling\u201d of nonmatter across their teeth, resulting in both the coloration and its disruptive capabilities. How this occurred, I can\u2019t begin to say, and how, as with the other alterations to their form, there is not a greater amount of distress or deterioration within the species continues to hold my deep interest. If Lampeter was not awaiting, I can see myself staying here attempting to wile out all the alterations and secrets of the locale\u2019s adoptive fauna.</p>\n<p>But\u2026 that\u2019s the lure of this place. The trap? I have to wonder whether all these oddities are not simply bait meant to hook individuals like me. A discomforting thought, but not so much perhaps as the rumor I heard of an individual who managed to rile the Wardu-Utan to violence.</p>\n<p>Their \u201crusting venom\u201d affects all metals, including the iron in human blood.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly grotesque.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:700px;\"><img alt=\"WarduUtan.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/life-of-lamplight-part-i/WarduUtan.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>A Wardu &amp; his Bite</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With that, we leave the domains and fauna of Orchard behind and come to the end of our time together.

Heh, no, I don\u2019t mean that with certainty, but as you well know, I am a studied and avid researcher in the biota that call the curious corners of this vast Verse home! From the Singing Snailwings of Orchard\u2019s Horsehead Nebula to the emergent fauna of the Resurge-Verdance Sector. Yet, all of that is fairly close to home. That is why my next sojourn takes me further afield than ever before. \n\n\n\nLampeter. The decaying behemoth that touches more worlds than the brain could possibly imagine. Many have delved into the history of the line and the cultures that traveled across it for carousel, conquest, curiosity, and concern, but in those scattered worlds, left to rust and Neon in many cases, I have heard that one can still find life.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t mean those of a mind, like you or I, dear listener, no, no, the primal and pristine. I seek to discover what remains of the East\u2019s Wilds\u2026 if any are to remain. A risky endeavor, I am well aware, but we\u2019re running out of time to know, aren\u2019t we? \n\n\n\nHowever, I believe my environ may give away that I have taken a brief detour prior to the adventure\u2019s start. \n\n\n\nLamplight! The city on the edge of Everis! Again, much has been said of the people and arts of this place, and the mysteries abounding beyond.\n\n\n\nBut many forget that Humans and similar are not the only occupants of this wonderful city.\n\n\n\nSo come with me as we delve into the feral fauna of lustrous Lamplight!\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**History & Commanlities**\n\nWhile I do not intend to put much focus on it, as noted above, one can not understand the origin and proliferation of the fauna within this delightful domain without at least having some knowledge of from whence they came.\n\n\n\nLamplight the body, has been here longer than any living or immortal has enough memory to know. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> | name= Lamplight3.jpg | caption= Artist's Approximation of Lamplight| width= 700px | align=center]]\n\n\n\nLamplight the city was founded by //the// Jean-Antoine Delacroix, a beloved yet bereaved poet of my own Orchard, entirely by accident. He endeavored to make this place a home for those cast aside by the greater Verse, the outcast and the lost. One can say that he\u2026 partially succeeded, but long after he claimed his own life, as the life he had been attempting to escape came calling on his doorstep anyway. \n\n\n\nToday, Lamplight is an enclave beyond the edge of Everis and the only known domain of the Neverwas, not even the Neon can reach here, to which I imagine the many that have come to call this shaded domain home are thankful. While smaller enclaves fill in the cracks and rest amidst the borders, Lamplight is best known for its five major enclaves.\n\n\n\nKievan and Aetherium of Orchard, Giotto of Sol, Neoclassical of the Neon-Lost London, and Nomad of the Many Steppes. \n\n\n\nI will go into the ecology of each origin more later on, but much of Lamplight has been explained by others far more informed than [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5005 I]. \n\n\n\nNow, while the city is divided into five major conclaves, with congruent fauna often most tightly grouped within each district despite the feral nature of most of the as-yet-mentioned specimens, three emergent commonalities are found across all nonsophont species that have come to call Lamplight home. \n\n----\n\nThe first is largely behavioral, with all nonsophont species showing great reticence towards stepping beyond the city\u2019s outermost borders, even though that is where the most \u201cwild\u201d territory can be found. Abandoned farm plots,\u00a0\u00a0abandoned parks, overgrown personal gardens of the latest artist to slip away into the Evernothing. Places of comparative plenty, but few beasts stay here for long, going through a daily migration of consumption and flight back into the more\u2026 hmm, I suppose real is fitting, core of the city. \n\n\n\nThe sole exception is the beasts that congregate about and call the lone \u201clake\u201d, in truth, the city\u2019s largest reservoir. One of Delacroix\u2019s earliest and perhaps most expensive pet project tied to making this place livable. This region is known as the Wild District among locals. However, since most within the city, excluding those in the depths of truest melancholy, avoid it altogether, it is not considered part of the city proper. \n\n----\n\nThe second, as you may have noticed from the video feed, Lamplight, after a fashion, has a fairly boreal climate, and the fog and snow are a near-constant presence. As such, all species have undergone rapid adaptation. Thicker coats are the most common adaptation, with colorations marked for long-term polar living; of course, the weather thankfully never gets quite so cold. Snow falls heaviest within the Wild District, yet something about the soil keeps just enough of the plants verdant to keep the cycle turning. \n\n----\n\nLastly, and most striking are the, well, I suppose the only term I can really use to compare what sits before me are the \u201cribbons\u201d that emerge from each nonsophont creature within Lamplight. Fur, skin, even flesh and viscera on occasion flutter back in thin flat ribbons from the tips of ears, ends of tails, along the back like a mane, or from amidst their joints. \n\n\n\nYet, none of the animals I have witnessed seem at all distressed by these alterations, and having witnessed a handful of young with similar markers I can only conclude this is some adaption or mark of the non matter, indeed they do appear to be after-a-fashion only half there, as I have seen their supposedly solid forms fade and faze through stone and wood, again without reaction by the connected creature. Why this\u2026 unraveling seems to do no apparent harm I cannot say, for its resemblance to the nonmatter\u2019s consumptive touch upon sophonts who have dared it are uncanny.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIndeed, the folk here have many stories of those who have come back, unraveling like a bad wool sweater, yet when I remark upon the creature\u2019s alterations, all that greets me are shrugs and dull mutters of uncertainty. Indeed, I think that the obsessions that this place engenders in the sophont mind keep long timers for engaging with any mysteries beyond the cold promise of the Void beyond and the centering warmth of the fire at their back. I have yet to meet an individual who has not had their eyes burrowing into one or the other, but I digress. Let us begin this animalia accounting in earnest, yes?!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**The Keivan District**\n\n\n\nAlso known as the Victorian District or Old Lamplight, it is the oldest and most central part of the city proper. As such, its introduced fauna have had the longest relative time to proliferate and adapt to the abnature of Lamplight. \n\n\n\nNow, Orchard\u2019s Earth, from which much of the fauna and native populace claim descent, excluding a smattering of Or-Martian and Titanians, is distinct from the likes of Sol due to the commonality of forest biomes over others. Indeed, while Sol can be said to be marked in the majority by patchwork grassland and desert when it comes to terrestrial biomes, forests of all kinds mark much of Or-Earth\u2019s surface. With the folk of Orchard, pardon my laconic, wrenching their heads from their behinds when it comes to environmentalism, their towering old wood biomes still cover a great breadth of land even in the modern day. \n\n\n\nAs most of the trees are fruit-bearing, and indeed most Keivan dishes rely heavily on fruit products, one can see why the Verse gained the name, now can\u2019t you?\n\n\n\nOf course, for our purposes, this distinction in biome is more critical for the adaptations that emerged amongst the world\u2019s fauna. Indeed, most terrestrial species are at least partially arboreal, including those that I imagine would quite shock a Sol resident. However, the likes of an **Arbor Elephant(//Elephas scanderes//)** are far too large for the urban sparsity of Lamplight. Those animals that thrived here amidst that first batch of settlers were on the smaller side of things. Indeed, while in decline due to the greater potential of the livestock introduced into the Nomad district, **Keivan Deer(//Dama lanas//)** are still kept by those few families that Delacroix wished to see resettled, before, of course, it became a place of rhapsody and opium. \n\n\n\nThe Keivan Deer were brought not for meat, but mainly for milk and their thick fur, which has only grown denser in their time amidst Lamplight. This fur is water-resistant, heat-retaining, and surprisingly soft, and while the practice has fallen on the wayside with the advent of trade and creation of more advanced textiles, many Keivan families gift their children scarves, hats, and mittens to stave off the cold, knit from the naturally strikingly colored fur. \n\n\n\nKeivan Deer have been domesticated for so long that populations in the wild are considered feral, and they have taken well to the Orchard\u2019s wilderness. Still, unlike many other feral populations, they have integrated without causing significant environmental damage. On Lamplight, most deer that remain are indeed feral but approachable by sophonts. \n\n\n\nThey are not large animals; most stand less than a meter at the shoulder. As noted, their dappled fur comes in a number of bright colorations, yellow, red, and a silvery blue being the most common. \n\n\n\nThey are browsers most typically, consuming fruits and leaves over most grasses, though they will graze on occasion, and I did get the chance to observe a moment of opportunistic omnivory, though what the doe was picking over I couldn\u2019t quite see, rotted and pitted by the nothing as it was.\n\n\n\nWhile most cervine males compete against each other in clattering head-butting contests with their antlers, it can be said that the Keivan Deer are somewhat lacking in that department. Indeed, while both genders retain antlers for almost the entire year, they are dull and nubby things, bred down to lessen the danger totheir handlers when one gets miffed or, in some cases, overly playful. As the feral populations have had relatively little time to regain their ancestral weapons, they instead compete with another typical trait amongst certain cervines.\n\n\n\nTheir voice.\n\n\n\nHerds in Orchard can number in the hundreds, their harrowing calls muffled by the dense undergrowth and hearty canopy, so while those on Lamplight number only about fifty individuals in the largest I was able to observe, their calls are far louder. Indeed, I had quite a fright the first time it happened, as all the sound that accompanied it seemed to fall quiet, their arching cry bouncing against every window and wall, then echoing out into the never. I had heard of the Pattern Screamer, the dread folk of the Never, seeking to be remembered by those who never knew them. But imagine my embarrassment when my drinking companion laughed and informed me one of the bucks was simply exceptionally randy\u2026\n\n\n\nBut yes, they actively challenge each other into screaming matches, with the loudest attracting the most mates. Fawns are born in what approximates spring here in Lamplight, and the little bundles are said to be some of the cutest and most awkward things you can imagine, all legs with their fur buffed out in a near-perfect circle.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> | name= KeivanDeer.jpg | caption= A Keivan Buck & Doe | width= 700px | align=center]]\n\n\n\nOf course, I should say their shrieking calls are not the only sounds to break the relatively tranquil Keivan nights.\n\n\n\nAs I stated previously, Delacroix worked hard in those initial days to make Lamplight livable. However, those actions are curiously absent in conversation. Most visitors and natives are eager to speak of his art or his demise. Rather disarming, if I may say so. \n\n\n\nRegardless, while snow is plentiful on Lamplight, it seems to have emerged only after human habitation. Yet another curiosity of this impossible place. Of course, snowfall alone, even if it is arguably constant, is not enough water to found a city upon. I can\u2019t exactly say how Delacroix did it, but he carved a reservoir out of the \u201cearth\u201d and managed to fill it to the brim with fresh water. Only a minuscule portion was snowmelt, if the story holds. What little information I could find regarding its creation variably mentions an Orkney Priest, an Antarctican Ice Merchant, or something beneath the city proper.\n\n\n\nRegardless, after digging canals and wells, his fledgling settlement had all the water it could need. He took to populating it with a smattering of foliage and fauna. The first bit of greenery Lamplight would see. Now, all the fish are relatively common, and there is a curious similarity in form and habit across the Verse, at least in the West, from my experience. It\u2019s when things take root that commonalities start to diverge. \n\n\n\nBut one occupant stands out above all others.\n\n\n\nThe **Vast Lakes Whale(//Brachiocetus interiomeridias//)**, also known as the Champosaurus, or Meridian Nessie. The smallest of the Brachiocetids shifted into a freshwater habitat, scattered across numerous sizable lakes in the Northeastern portion of the Meridian continent, with a high level of speciation, likely caused by population isolation when water levels fell during Orchard\u2019s first ice age. \n\n\n\nOf course, most on Sol would fail to recognize them as a whale, and may indeed make closer to the likes of plesiosaurs, though their long necks are far wider, and in the case of the Vast Lakes Whale itself, still retain a set of functional forelegs. In truth, I have always found the animals to more closely resemble a vast but misshapen goose! The largest bulls grow up to nine meters from the tip of their conical heads down to their pronged tails, though again a surprising amount of that length is their necks.\n\n\n\nThey are starkly intelligent yet painfully shy. Despite their closer proximity to human populations, they are among the least understood cetaceans on Orchard\u2019s earth! They were the national animal of the Vast Lakes Confederacy. The star of numerous nature documentaries, art pieces, and children\u2019s stories, due to a mixture of their mysterious nature and delightful singing. Notably, they are capable of vocalizing above the waves, one of the key distinctions of the Brachiocetids, excluding their divergent body plans. \n\n\n\nWhat mattered to Delacroix in his desire to transplant them to Lamplight was that they were the favorite animals of one Emily Woolf.\n\n\n\nI am uncertain if he wished for a link to her in this dour place or if he sought to win her attention to his endeavoring, after all, as I have mentioned, many of their mutual acquaintances came to call Lamplight their home in those early years, and perhaps believed she, too, would join in. A salve for his disappointment?\n\n\n\nBut she never did.\n\n\n\nAnd so the whales were left to go as wild as they could manage in the comparatively minuscule reservoir to their natural habitat. Now, one would think they would have suffered greatly and eventually expired, for the original pod was composed of but thirty individuals, a fairly limited gene pool.\n\n\n\nBut they remain, though their numbers have never gotten above more than a hundred individuals at any one time. Their success is believed to be due to two distinct advantages: one shaped by evolution and the other, quite honestly, an utter accident. \n\n\n\nThe latter being that Delacroix was not very particular about where he drew the whales from. As I mentioned, there is a great deal of genetic variance, nearly a dozen distinct subspecies, if not more! Yet, they can all interbreed and produce fertile offspring! This variance in individuals seems to have worked in the animal\u2019s favor when it came to avoiding complications. Indeed, I noticed at least three calves amongst the pod, their coloration a delightful mixture of the white and black dappling of the Lake Suprema subspecies and the distinct pink flair of the more coastal Aerie variety. \n\n\n\nThen came their preferred feeding method: suction. On Orchard, they root about the lake bottoms, drawing in rotting vegetation and all manner of invertebrates and fish hiding in the mud. Lamplight has always baffled botanists and environmentalists, but honestly, no plants should be able to grow in these environs. Yet, something in the \"soil\" of this place makes them grow far beyond what should be realistically probable. \n\n\n\nIt appears that the whales can also make use of these additional nutrients, and from my observations, they dine more on the mud itself than on the critters lurking within it! Indeed, that would make them some of the largest detritivores I have ever encountered! \n\n\n\nAnd while I mentioned the apex growth of the whales on Orchard, I was amazed to discover this as less than the median amongst the Lamplight pod! Indeed, the largest specimen I observed nearly doubled that length! A matronly female who seemed to spend much of her time singing, fraying head raised towards the sky, eyes as milky as the light above our head. Truly a magnificent creature.\n\n\n\nAnd the singing like a pipe organ down-pitched so low you hear it in your stomach before it ever reaches your ears. Haunting, enchanting, and similarly echoing as the calls of the deer. There is a clear melody to their calls, a lulling, pleasant cadence that the other adult pod members will take up and rejoinder from at random moments, a chaotic and captivating chorus that I listened to for what must have been half a day. \n\n\n\nCuriously, the natives swear the beasts aren\u2019t simply singing instinctive tunes, but are reciting the words of Delacroix. One rather avid individual showed me how she had perfectly matched the matron\u2019s tones to the meter of his last work. Indeed, I found myself joined in my revery by a surprising number of individuals, all with the void-haunted gaze of the disposessed. But there was something in their eyes that lingered, as if the tune was keeping them anchored. It was\u2026\u00a0\u00a0disconcerting, if I might be frank, and while they are wise and striking animals, I failed to recognize the \u201cbrilliance of Delacroix \u201cin their calls.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> | name= VLWhale.jpg | caption= A Singing Beauty | width= 700px | align=center]]\n\n\n\nI could go on about other aspects of both beasts I found alluring or several other creatures I observed in my time in the district, yet this is not the only region of the city that has been made a home for Orchard fauna!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**The Aetherium District:**\n\n\n\nThe Aetherium District is a motley of clashing designs done large. Its buildings tower taller than a good portion of the rest of the city. This verticality is often noted as the second wave of settlers\u2019 attempts to \u201crise above the plights and worries of home\u201d. A completely understandable movement considering the horrors they walked away from. The majority of the buildings in the district look partially decayed, with rust and graffiti a purposeful commonality. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, all manner of invasive greenery is allowed to flourish, with certain elements integrated into the power grid, crafting a curiously nihilistic solar punk existence for much of the district. This does make it occasionally difficult to realize when one wanders from the district into the adjoining \u201cwilds\u201d, at least for visitors. The natives seem intimately aware of every intricate distinction, which are numerous and near nonsensical, fitting the original anarchistic mindset of the founding inhabitants. \n\n\n\nWhile most of the settlers in the Keivan District came from the Republic, Strathclyde, and other neighboring nations, those who founded Aetherium were more varied, with significant population groups drawn from all eight of Orchard-Earth\u2019s continents. This also meant that a number of more niche fauna were brought along, primarily as pets, but in this case, in the name of conservation, as the \u201cBurnt Apple War\u201d had devastated numerous biomes to the point of ruin. \n\n\n\nSahuli, Zealandian, and Northern Kalmaktaman fauna are the most common, from my initial investigations. Yet the animal that today exemplifies the district can be found anywhere on Orchard, but has particularly thrived in this section of Lamplight.\n\n\n\nThe **Gyrfox(//Avivulpes falcons//)** can similarly be found anywhere in Lamplight, but it is to Aetherium that most return each night. One of the most common winged carnivores in Orchard, this canine is a member of the fox family. Indeed, their overall body shape closely resembles that of their terrestrial cousins, though they tend to assume a stooped posture when at rest, like a squirrel. \n\n\n\nOf course, their wings are the most significant distinction: powerfully muscled yet relatively compact, they allow the Gyrfox to make sudden stops and aid in tight turns, which they used in Orchard to expertly weave through the boughs and trunks of the ever-expanding forests. Other adaptations include a more compact muzzle, lengthened hind limb claws, and a flattened tail to further aid in their acrobatic flight. Their eyes are quite large, and they rely on a combination of sight and scent to pinpoint prey. The majority have white fur, though occasional black, grey, and merlot spotting/patching has been observed.\n\n\n\nThe Lamplight subspecies has an additional adaptation. The nonmatter seems to be integrated into their systems in a manner akin to an internal \u201cairbag\u201d, allowing them to dive from incredible heights onto prey and resist any lasting damage from the increased strain on their otherwise unadapted bodies. I believe this trait evolved due to Lamplight\u2019s comparative sparsity, allowing prey to have more time to see a Gyrfox approaching in their standard hunting patterns, necessitating they hit harder and faster. \n\n\n\nOf course, the beasts are omnivorous and eager scavengers. I have witnessed them launch after a floundering quail and a tossed muffin with equal gusto.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, the majority come home to roost in Aetherium each \u201cnight\u201d, nesting in the nooks and crannies at the highest points they can reach. While they spend much of their day solo or in pairs, mated or siblings, most commonly, according to my observations, at night they huddle together in \u201ccuddle-puddles\u201d as the natives dub them. Up to fifty individuals, their nests crafted largely of scavenged metal, wood, and stolen laundry/cloth goods. Kits are similarly raised communally, with parents showing very little favoritism toward their own young. \n\n\n\nNotably, despite their classification as thieves by most Lamplighters I have spoken to, their antics are treated with a communal brevity. Some claimed they had been blessed by a Gyrfox, which I came to learn meant having their food stolen right from their hands, or having their scarf or hat pulled free of their person. Indeed, I did see a number of \u201cdomesticated\u201d Gyrfoxes in my time on Lamplight, though the animals seemed to only stick with their chosen person during the day, flitting off the moment they sensed \u201cnight\u201d had come. \n\n\n\nThey are affectionate animals, that I can assure you. Their antics largely remind me of Sol\u2019s Corvids, though lacking in their mimicry capabilities. If one finds the allure of these creatures pressing, I must remind you: for all their differences, these are still foxes.\n\n\n\nWhich means, in polite terms, they are quite keen on marking their territory, including their owners. It is a rather pungent perfume, ha.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> | name= Gyrfox.jpg | caption= Mischief on the Wing | width= 700px | align=center]]\n\n\n\nBut as I said, you can\u2019t throw a biscuit in Lamplight without a Gyrfox snatching it up, and I promised that each district had its own distinctive fauna. Well, worry not.\n\n\n\nBut what to focus on: the jungles and savannahs of Sahul, the fjords and temperate rainforests of Zealandia, or the scrublands of Kalmaktama? \n\n\n\nAh, how about I discuss the little-understood \u201cassistant architects,\u201d known as the **Wardu-Utan (//Driptodon pseudocalicothere//)**.\n\n\n\nAs I stated, these animals are a fair bit mysterious, which is even more stark considering their great size. They live in a particularly isolated portion of Sahul, high in the northern cloud forests, where their domain is walled off. I do not mean to say that the native sophont populations keep outside scientists from observing them. That is a whole other issue entirely, largely due to the ongoing separatist movement in the region, but we aren\u2019t here to discuss modern politics.\n\n\n\nNo, the barrier, an immense wall crafted from the thick trunks of the local mountain ash, is entirely the making of the Wardu-Utan themselves. \n\n\n\nWhile close in size to polar bears, the beings have slotted into a niche in many ways comparable to that of beavers, serving as environmental engineers with a keen instinct for majestic architectural feats. Though while the latter focus more on damming river ways and constructing lodges for rest, the Warda-Utan build walls around their favored feeding grounds. Thus keeping out other large herbivores and defending their relatively defenseless young from native predators, including the **Sahulian Tiger(//Panthera tigris sahuli//)** and **Greater Drake(//Varanus priscus//)**.\n\n\n\nThe limited observation on Orchard that has been recorded, outside of the information mentioned above, notes they live communally, and show signs of tool use on par with, if not greater than, great apes. Of course, this has not been fully corroborated, and much of what is said about the animals is left to speculation and cryptozoological debates.\n\n\n\nThis makes their presence on Lamplight even more confusing. As I mentioned, many Sahulian expatriates and their descendants live in Aetherium, yet not a one of them could say when or how the animals first arrived in the district.\n\n\n\nI will admit that a great deal of my time on Lamplight was spent observing them. Yet, I do not believe my observations of these beings should be taken into account at all regarding the behavior of the main species back on Orchard.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, the debate about their intelligence has been ongoing for quite some time. Conversations with natives and my own observations seem to suggest that the beings are on the edge of sophontism. If they have not already crossed the proverbial, relatively archaic \u201cline\u201d. They are capable of understanding the spoken word at least to some extent, which aids in their \u201cjob\u201d within the district, and they seem to know not to stray beyond the district unless told or asked to do so. Furthermore, I have seen them actively decorate themselves with scavenged baubles or gifts, and they are ready guardians of children left in their care, though this has occasionally, at least according to native tales, gone awry in the past when one got \u201ctoo serious\u201d about adopting their \u201cward\u201d. \n\n\n\nThey are burly animals, with their brown fur growing far thicker than in their natural habitat, giving them the appearance, at least at a passing glance, of a Highland Cow with a gorilla-like stance, except for their large, rodent-like teeth, which are distinctively silvery-black.\n\n\n\nAs for their \u201caccidental architect\u201d appellation, as noted, Aetherium tends towards dilapidation, meaning that some buildings are often just left to fallow. This is where the Wardu-Utan come in. \n\n\n\nIn their natural habitat, they are believed to eat wood, bamboo, and other plant material. Such materials are relatively rare, as I have noted, so the animals had to adapt.\n\n\n\nAnd so they did, with their current diet consisting of a minority of plant matter and a majority of metal and stone of all varieties. Indeed, the animals\u2019 bites increase the level of rust and decay in the objects they consume, allowing them to break them down more easily and adding to the district\u2019s anarchistic flair. \n\n\n\nThey are slow eaters, and most fully grown Lamplight Wardu-Utan only need one meal a month. The material they don\u2019t eat, they gather and assemble into their dens, with many visitors approaching what they at first believe to be modern art displays, only to be startled by the looming form of a rudely awoken rust-covered beast.\n\n\n\nWhat is more, their dung, which retains the cubular shape curiously common amongst wombats across the Verse, while not being of much use for fertilizer, consists mainly of unalloyed metals. The natives occasionally use these as building materials or to create a number of other metallic objects. I admit I was a tad suspicious of the metal tankard that was pressed upon me by the same bartender who revealed that fact to me. \n\n\n\nI am a bit baffled by their ready consumption and processing of such materials, for while this is far from irregular in the grand scope of the Verse, this kind of adaptation would take thousands upon thousands of generations, not this markedly short period of time.\n\n\n\nYet we all know Lamplight is anything but the norm. Indeed, I was able to convince an individual to allow me a look at their teeth, offering my canteen, a pitted and aged bit of Palisade Titanium as payment. \n\n\n\nIt appears that the animals have adapted a \u201cenameling\u201d of nonmatter across their teeth, resulting in both the coloration and its disruptive capabilities. How this occurred, I can\u2019t begin to say, and how, as with the other alterations to their form, there is not a greater amount of distress or deterioration within the species continues to hold my deep interest. If Lampeter was not awaiting, I can see myself staying here attempting to wile out all the alterations and secrets of the locale\u2019s adoptive fauna.\n\n\n\nBut\u2026\u00a0\u00a0that\u2019s the lure of this place. The trap? I have to wonder whether all these oddities are not simply bait meant to hook individuals like me. A discomforting thought, but not so much perhaps as the rumor I heard of an individual who managed to rile the Wardu-Utan to violence. \n\n\n\nTheir \u201crusting venom\u201d affects all metals, including the iron in human blood.\n\n\n\nFascinatingly grotesque. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> | name= WarduUtan.jpg | caption= A Wardu & his Bite | width= 700px | align=center]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nWith that, we leave the domains and fauna of Orchard behind and come to the end of our time together. Next entry, we will delve into regions of the city tied to locales, intimate and more distant than most can reckon. As ever, I am Varys Matthau, bidding you all a temporary adieu!\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Gyrfox\n\n> **Author:** Crocky99\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:* [https://www.deviantart.com/crocky99/art/Saint-Comm-2-1280502490#image-8]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** KeivanDeer\n\n> **Author:** Crocky99\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:* [https://www.deviantart.com/crocky99/art/Saint-Comm-2-1280502490#image-6]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** VLWhale\n\n> **Author:** Crocky99\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:* [https://www.deviantart.com/crocky99/art/Saint-Comm-2-1280502490#image-3]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** WarduUtan\n\n> **Author:** Crocky99\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:* [https://www.deviantart.com/crocky99/art/Saint-Comm-2-1280502490#image-2]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Lamplight3\n\n> **Author:** Arclund-Archivist\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:* [https://www.deviantart.com/arclund-archivist/art/1287961904?action=published]\n\n\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-5005", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_image", "_licensebox", "animal", "fantasy", "illustrated", "lampeter", "science-fiction", "tale", "worldbuilding"], "title": "Life of Lamplight Part I - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/life-of-lamplight-part-i", "year": 2026}, "likeitsthefirsttime": {"created_at": "2026-01-04T12:26:00", "creator": "AstersQuill", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T12:26:00"}, {"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, bleak, director-scout, lgbtq, on-guard-43, tale, thilo-zwist.

Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was approximately 5:03am when Wynn Rydderech opened his eyes, as he always did around this time. He was slow on the rise, as he thought he ought to be at this age, his body giving him only as much trouble as he thought it should.</p>\n<p>He waddled awkwardly across the carpeted floor towards the bathroom, imaging how cold the tile threshold might feel, and found that the act of cleaning himself had passed in a blink\u2014 the act of undressing, lathering, rinsing, and dressing was almost as fluid and unmistakably uniform as the water circling the drain as he stepped out of the stall. Even with this, he was still not complete. Although his mind knew what was missing, he found that his hands were much faster at weaving his tie into a Windsor, and feeding the snaking leather belt smoothly through each loop, before buckling the faded brass.</p>\n<p>For all intents and purposes, he still <em>looked</em> good, even in the folds and wrinkles, and how his hair slowly simmered from red to grey ash. He wore a smile, just noticeable, that lingered, for some reason, from before Rydderech could recall.</p>\n<p>And the room around him made this lapse known, as if every edge had muddied into oil on canvas instead of something tangible.</p>\n<p><em>Why am I so happy?</em></p>\n<p>It, of course, was no issue to be happy\u2014 Rydderech could invite all variety of emotion to the forefront if his mind had lingered on it, unconsciously or not. But this happiness carried with it a certain weight to it, not so dissimilar to the one he felt in the core of his chest. It was as if the ghost of some thing, some one, had been standing there next to him, whispering words that were meant to bring about some sort of reaction, if and only if he had the context.</p>\n<p>He allowed this ghost to hold his hand as he walked into a common area, and watched the most striking details pull forth: the stained wood paneling was host to several clusters of melty memorabilia, pinions and frames of unknown contents nailed proudly into the wall like medals on a uniform. These did little to dampen the soft crackling of electric static from the CRT, which cast a dull glow onto a worn sofa, wherein two of the cushions had faded from use. The ghost took its position as Rydderech rotated the dials, watching the sea of black and white sand slowly give way to animated figures. The speaker whined out an anachronistic concerto that bounced off the walls as sonar, revealing much of the space, and bringing his attention towards a slightly ajar door.</p>\n<p>He followed the ghost as it took its leave from the couch. Passing through the vestibule, he regarded the pair of a pair of polished, leather shoes, one size notably smaller than the other, and brushed his shoulder against a matching hat and jacket that might only reach to his forearms.</p>\n<p>And yet, this smaller figure, who might have been the owner, was nowhere to be found. It certainly wasn't his; Rydderech had grown quite content with himself as his body slowed (as he thought it should), and regarded his shortening sleeves and waist with an almost jolly mien. No, the size alone of these garments wasn't the issue, but the fact that he believed they should be there for a reason that was presently escaping him.</p>\n<p>The ghost paid his confusion no mind, and slowed its pace considerably as it moved to a door left slightly ajar. With a thief-like motion, it slipped into the room, disappearing into the space only illuminated by a thin slit of light, revealing the unmistakable mound of a body beneath a quilt. Rydderech was careful as he stepped in, though he was much too large, and stepped too loudly to match the ghost's maneuvers. But the quilted figure did not react. His eyes adjusted to the fuzzy darkness with a blink, and as still-faded tchotchkes made themselves known to him, he felt his smile begin to grow. He almost cursed himself as he sat on the edge of the bed; of course he knew the other person sharing this home with him. Of course he knew the person who slept in another bed as to not be awoken at approximately 5:00am (the time Rydderech always knew himself to wake up at). And, of course, as he carefully leaned towards the head on the pillow, reaching his hand out, that this person was his <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">wife</span>.</p>\n<p>Rydderech's vision pulsed, and he flinched. The once blonde and flowing hair of his <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">wife</span>, that fractaled out from <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">her</span> head was instead replaced with short and grey bristles of a man that was more than familiar to him. As calm and as collected as he could muster, Rydderech rose and slowly backed away from the bed, watching the room around him dissolve. He knew now what was missing, a pit in his chest as something that should have been there, and, for as long as he could remember, had been there, dissipated into static. His hands trembled as he collected his jacket and hat, and as he shut the door behind him, and greeted the monotonous industrial labyrinth before him, he had only one thought in his mind:</p>\n<p><em>Where had Vivian Scout gone?</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span>1908</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>1 February</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/acroamatic-abatement\">Cardiff University</a>: Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Do you think I frightened him off?\" Ryderrech grinned, removing a concertina of worn notebooks from a briefcase. He could hear a chuckle from Vivian Scout, who was working to settle in across the room from him.</p>\n<p>The weight of a small key was a comfortable new addition to Rydderech's pocket. Not too long ago it had belonged to another man, a scholar not unlike the pair of them, but one in the unfortunate position of being paired with Scout during room assignments. Rydderech by no means meant to torture their colleague, at least not in any cruel and unbecoming way, but he was by no means shy about making his presence in their space known.</p>\n<p>\"He must have been intimidated,\" Scout called from the otherside of a wardrobe, \"he was an anxious fellow and, well, you're\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"You think I'm intimidating?\" Rydderech raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"I think you're reminiscent of a brick wall, and your hair doesn't much help your case.\"</p>\n<p>Rydderech circled the wardrobe, and placed his hands on the edge of the desk Scout was unflinchingly focused on.</p>\n<p>\"How flattering. Of all the descriptors you've given me, I think this is the first time you've compared me to structure.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're a very charming brick wall.\" Scout placed a trio of papers filled with chicken scratch atop a jumble of manila envelopes. He turned to face his companion. \"Sturdy. Certainly, more reminiscent of a museum than a factory.\"</p>\n<p>Rydderech crossed his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Well one of us needs to be 'sturdy' enough to lean on, especially since you have a penchant for falling.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"That certainly hasn't been the only time you've fallen for me.\"</p>\n<p>Scout exhaled and shook his head, and stepped forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his companion. He leaned into him, and from the corner of his eye, Rydderech could see he was smiling.</p>\n<p>The pair stood for a moment in silence, sharing an unspoken appreciation for the mess of what could be considered a science lab and abode. Though there was much more work to be done, and though a proper sorting system of their dreams had yet to be established, they had each other, and for the moment, that was enough.</p>\n<p>Rydderech yawned, more akin to a growl, and stretched his sore arms out. The winter sunlight had long since left the pair, and despite the chill, the flicker of lamp lights in the distance was almost reminiscent of fireflies lazily flickering as they hovered. The room was warm, bright, and as long as the pair didn't cause too much trouble (there would always be <em>some</em> amount of trouble to cause), it was home.</p>\n<p>\"Tired?\" Scout queried with a smirk. \"The first day of our collaboration and you're already falling asleep on me?\"</p>\n<p>\"The first day of our collaboration and <em>I</em> moved all the furniture around.\" Rydderech massaged his bicep, kneading the muscle with his thumb. \"Hopefully our beds should be sufficiently far enough away in the event of any accidental spills.\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed, but I do not intend to chance that, at least not tonight.\"</p>\n<p>\"So tomorrow then. Unless you plan on burning the midnight oil.\"</p>\n<p>Scout placed a hand on Rydderech's shoulder. \"Tomorrow indeed.\"</p>\n<p>The pair began to prepare for bed, clumsily dancing through the space, almost careful enough to not bump into the wall, or a stack of books, or each other. Almost. After sufficiently littering the floor with books, and Scout \"accidentally\" being tapped into a wall, the pair stood side-by-side, looking at their bed. <em>Their</em> bed. One of two in the room, though the only one not currently covered in trousers and undershirts.</p>\n<p>\"I can\u2026 sleep in mine, if that would be more comfortable for you\u2014 or the floor. I don't require much.\" Rydderech scratched the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, what I want the most is for you to make a nest in my laundry.\" Scout chuckled and offered a hand to Rydderech. Hand-in-hand, the pair sat on the edge of the bed. \"I will take the outside tonight, and tomorrow night we can switch. Fair?\"</p>\n<p>\"And what of the monsters beneath the bed?\" Rydderech smirked. \"What if I wake up and you're gone?\"</p>\n<p>Scout rolled his eyes and, in an exaggerated manner, panned his head as he looked beneath the bed.</p>\n<p>\"Happy?\"</p>\n<p>\"I would prefer if you checked again.\"</p>\n<p>Scout lightly pushed Rydderech, who laid down and shuffled and scooted to leave as much room as possible for his partner. In a blink, the room was enveloped in darkness, stealing sight, and confusing his other senses. He closed his eyes and tasted a hint of kerosene as he took a deep breath in. Behind him he felt arms try to awkwardly wrap around him, the weight of another person on his back. And he heard, in loving whisper, a promise.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to keep you safe, Wynn. I'm not going to let anything happen to you.\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc5\"><span>1997</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc6\"><span>3 April</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520\">Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>There was a time when Rydderech had regarded the vast expanse of concrete and metal scaffolding and colorful, impossibly extending piping with awe. After all, this was <em>his</em> magnum opus; he had imagined every centimeter, every possible consideration, iterated and reiterated until he could no longer conceive of any holes in his plans. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Had a younger version of him known what he would inherit, what facility he would create, and what work he would be able to do, the current Rydderech would have never been able to stop him, even if he knew the cost. Any other answer would mean that it would not be Wynn Rydderech answering; a Wynn Rydderech not willing to pay the cost wouldn't be Wynn Rydderech at all.</p>\n<p>Both thankfully and not, Rydderech was not here alone, though he alone was here by choice, and would suffer under what that meant. He knew all 43 members of his cohort, in name and story. On some days he would greet them as he roamed through his facility. On some days, he thought they might greet him back. On others, he preferred they pay him no mind. The ambiance of their chatter could take all forms: whispering gossip, boisterous laughter, love and anger. It was through these interactions that Rydderech still believed himself human, for what more were these simulacra than manifestations of his own psyche, manifestations of what it meant to work with other people. The moment these exchanges would no longer be the case was the day he knew he would have to hang up the conceptualization of himself as 'human', but today was not yet that day.</p>\n<p>But Rydderech <em>was</em> hung up on the fact that, unlike the labyrinthine expanse above him, this was his labyrinthine expanse alone, his empire of dirt. At least what would become of Site-43 was built with care and intention. Care that comprised much of the considerations of another man, a man who walked like a ghost next to Rydderech now, who stood so diligently and worrying on guard <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">somewhere else.</span></p>\n<p>Rydderech shivered at the thought; he knew he was being watched down here, he <em>hated</em> the feeling of being watched. He sometimes imagined those above him tracing his every move, the rehearsed monotony of his self-imposed station, a dancing figurine in a show. They were infinitely patient with him, because of course they were, and continued to engage regardless of the role Rydderech had chosen to play that day.</p>\n<p>And what did he provide in return? His usefulness, of course. They would only be willing to extend the amount of grace and resources possible for him to hold onto at least some semblance of a thread of sanity if he had proven himself useful, or at the very least entertaining. In truth, any one of his projects or experiments or bored delusions might lead to the plug being pulled, leaving him alone, as an actor on a dimmed stage, long after anyone could recall what show was being played at all.</p>\n<p>Rydderech chafed at the thought, and how powerless he felt each and every time it was his turn to take the stage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc7\"><span>1911</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc8\"><span>20 October</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #990011\">Vienna</span>: Austria, Austro-Hungarian Empire</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Arm-in-arm, Rydderech carefully led his date out the front of the opera house, stopping just for a moment to take a deep breath of the cold night's air. Outwardly, he and his date were entirely indistinguishable from the patrons filing out; men in tuxedos and polished shoes, women in flowing dresses with fur and pearl and lace. It reminded Rydderech of what a procession of zoo animals might look like, entirely gaudy, a show in itself.</p>\n<p>This wasn't the first time Rydderech had seen such a show, or the opera within. Truthfully, if his talent had been in singing rather than toxicology, he might have been able to don tights and long-out-of-style hats to belt the notes out himself. But he was not here for the show\u2014 it was merely a formality. His date acted with all the poise and elegance a woman should, and he was to respond in kind, with the professional air about him, that projected outwardly to the world that this was a fine and <em>normal</em> partnership for the times. This, too, was merely a formality; there was very little in this world that brought about more suffering than formalities.</p>\n<p>But like most formalities, the pressure to conform to them was ever-present; many, including his own family, were beginning to wonder why the scholar was without a wife. Offhanded excuses were enough to keep the gossip away temporarily\u2014 scheduling issues, the risk of dying (or worse) within his field, possible contamination\u2014 these were largely understood. He wanted to state that he was simply unlucky when it came to love, but that cut both ways; Rydderech <em>was</em> unlucky, but not because he lacked the charisma or looks (because he certainly had both), but because the person he loved was an ocean and continent away.</p>\n<p>During particularly troubling times, when nothing seemed to be going right, Rydderech could at least rely on the familiar typing of his scholarly companion to bring him some comfort, or at least as much comfort could be found in the anomalous abstract the pair were mired in. Within Rydderech, however, there was a doubt. A doubt that one day the letters might cease, that some awful fate might befall his Vivian Scout, or worst of all, the understanding that what they had was merely a passing of seasons.</p>\n<p>He felt a soft tap on his shoulder, and understood that he had been lost in thought along the avenues, missing his apartment by around two blocks, thinking, wishing that someone else was here instead. Rydderech gave her a smile and a nod, before crossing the street, once more on the correct path.</p>\n<p>She was, to put it plainly, pleasant. She was quick-witted, knowledgeable on all manner of topics, but also loved to keep to herself. She was, in an objective sense, attractive, and in another life, Rydderech might have been attracted <em>to</em> her. But very simply, he wasn't, and that she could understand as well. However, this arrangement worked because both parties knew only to ask the questions necessary for their relationship to survive. They spoke often, ate together, and were outwardly the model of a healthy couple. He had met her family, and even helped one of her brothers out while in a particular jam with the university. But secrecy was baked in the moment conversations turned to one of work, and that vulnerability, or lack thereof, carried itself through all aspects of their relationship.</p>\n<p>In another life, she might have been perfect for someone not named Wynn Rydderech. In this one, she sufficed, though the thought was laden with its own level of guilt in the few moments Rydderech had to interrogate what that meant.</p>\n\n<p>Rydderech imagined Vivian Scout standing just in the background of the mirror, grinning and ready to engage Wynn in a bout of friendly banter.</p>\n<p>Vivian often helped him prepare for events, in his own way. The recognition of a missed detail was often delivered with joke or snark, and the pair would work to resolve the detail at the same level of conversation. After a particularly dry formal event season brought about by renovations, Vivian very bluntly suggested that Wynn purchase a new suit because the strain on the fabric of his old reliable was \"presently attempting to escape him.\"</p>\n<p>Yet strangely he worried very little about such matters now. Outside of the occasional tear or fade, wrinkles and creases were easily smoothed out with simply the brush of his hand, though that failed to translate to much else.</p>\n<p>Rydderech summed it up to fatigue, however. A simple trick of tired eyes to make him seem more put together than he was. He changed into something much more comfortable, and regarded the stack of papers on his desk next to a typewriter nesting a half-written response. There was much to discuss, and Rydderech let the snapping of keys, and the flowing story of his work, his life, and what could be shown of his love, carry him to sleep.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc9\"><span>1964</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc10\"><span>31 March</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Provisional Site-43</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Dominion of Canada</strong></span><br/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Once more Wynn Rydderech found himself crouched over a typewriter deep into the night, trying to trade the ever-decreasing store of time for one final explanation of what was becoming of him.</p>\n<p>Scout would have been long asleep by now. He was worn down by the day-to-day minutiae of what it meant to run such a burgeoning facility, but even then, even though he too had mingled with the weird most his life, Scout's age had certainly kept up with him. Much unlike Rydderech.</p>\n<p>These sorts of fadings were never fast, they <em>never</em> are. They move along vast stretches like ants, erode away great mountains like rain drops off leaves, and by the end, everyone finds themselves looking back at all they thought they had left. If they're even able to at all.</p>\n<p>Rydderech, unknowingly, and for a while unnoticingly, was the point of equilibrium about which his life moved. For every stone cast by the world, for every natural failure that was meant to give way, for even as he looked death itself in the eyes, he was unmarred. He used to be fit, healthy, tried to lead a good life, and for this he was rewarded with a rounder figure and moderately aching joints. He was lucky, and for this, his luck was destined to run out.</p>\n<p>There was a stack of missives in the bin adjacent to his desk, perfectly arranged font with red cross-outs and the faded marks of coffee or tears. Some of them were crumpled, or torn with the agony of a silent yell, some semblance of release; like if a tree fell in a forest, the final act of it all, never seen and only discovered once it was too late for anything to be done of it.</p>\n<p>Rydderech balled his fists and squeezed, before letting the tension go with an exhale. He looked at the blank document before him, and imagined all the possible variations of what it might say. What would be the most impactful? What would be best to remember him by? Would he write something long, a true testament to the lifetime and then some they'd spent both together and apart? How would one ever capture such depth.</p>\n<p>And as the words spun around in his mind, Rydderech, begrudgingly, noticed that someone <em>else</em> had come to mind: Thilo Zwist.</p>\n<p>Jealousy wasn't necessarily the best way to describe Wynn's thoughts towards the Austrian, but in this one, specific case, it might as well have been. Who else on this planet would be able to capture in words exactly what Rydderech was feeling, what he was trying to get across, but the wizard who had lived for generations. And most annoyingly, the wizard who <em>almost</em> captured as much attention in their relationship. Never more than Rydderech, not necessarily even as close, but the chase, the web of words\u2014 there was certainly something there.</p>\n<p><em>What else is there?</em></p>\n<p>And in that thought, Rydderech found his answer, and began typing.</p>\n<p>Rydderech had written crates worth of letters in his life, maybe even enough to mourn the tree and the roots that could have grown in a forest, that instead gave itself to deliver so much more than words over distance and time. In itself, each of those letters formed the mosaic of Wynn Rydderech, gave themselves to be a snapshot of the ever-changing idea of what it meant to be a person. Love and labor, trial and triumph, the extending hand that provided the temporary, reassuring comfort of another.</p>\n<p>All-in-all he knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the contents of this letter may be the last time Rydderech spoke to Vivian Scout, his partner, lover, and husband, as himself.</p>\n<p>So, he thought he might write Scout a letter of what that meant. Write him a letter of who Wynn Rydderech was, and say what Wynn Rydderech would have hoped to say a thousand times more if he had the chance.</p>\n<p>He wanted Vivian to do what he had always done, and to reaffirm every single promise they had made over the years.</p>\n<p>He needed Vivian to continue the good work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"one column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc11\"><span>1997</span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc12\"><span>4 April</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520\">Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>What Rydderech thought should be his workshop took shape around him. The ground padded each and every footstep, and when he reached for papers on the nearby table (as only one appeared) he always had in his hand <em>exactly</em> what he was looking for (if he could even recognize what that was in the first place). If the man were any more dark and brooding, he would have likened it to a villain's evil lair, but it was more akin to a safety net, somewhere that someone much more outwardly affable plotted to save the world.</p>\n<p>He was doing the good work, after all. What more could be done than that?</p>\n<p>He let his mind run wild with ideas, many of which would have caught him the concerned look of ethics boards and meek assistants <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">topside</span>\u2014 he didn't doubt that was happening, of course, he knew it would be. But that was the wonder of his station now: the body, the mind, the space around him, all of them contained innumerable pieces of a cosmic toolbox. He imagined every atom, every molecule, and how the electric rhythm of the world coursed through them\u2014 he was the composer now, a thought that was both infinitely frightening and left him laughing to the end of each and every day.</p>\n<p>But in this place of great triumph, he knew his only anchor to his past life was ever-present, ever-waiting for correspondence, should he deem himself ready for it. His respite for loneliness was there in the moments he needed a connection unlike anything he could create down here. With the universe in his hand and only his imagination as the limit, Wynn Rydderech could never hope to recreate even a fraction of the love he knew existed, but was once more alienated from.</p>\n<p>The ghost floated beside him. Even it was not tangible enough to feel, nor to lift the curling corners of schematics that would revolutionize everything, if only it was possible to build them. It stopped, and shrunk itself over one such schematic that Rydderech didn't have to see to know (or rather, what it became in a sea of lined paper). After all, he had designed it himself. It was meant to be his Damocles, his deliverance from this torment, and something he both dreamed and cowered from.</p>\n<p>Vivian too knew what it meant, and what Wynn needed him to do, should the time come. He was sure Vivian would remember their promise, he knew it. The man who had always tried to keep him safe would not fail.</p>\n<p>And he knew that man was waiting for him at the other end of a printer, trying his very best to not let the worry show on his face if others were around. The Site Director had to keep his cool and level head, lest someone underestimate him, as few had learned the consequences of before.</p>\n<p>With a wave of his hand, a keyboard appeared, and his fingers began their march across the plastic as if they already knew their orders. The ghost lingered nearby, steadily watching.</p>\n<p><em>I thought I saw the sun not too long ago. Who knew the caverns down here could get so bright.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; Rydderech wouldn't be surprised if Vivian had moved the entire assembly closer to their dormitory, just to keep on top of any communications that would come through.</p>\n<p>The ghost circled Rydderech, but did not regard him.</p>\n<p><em>The panthers bring \"shiny things\" with them sometimes. Maybe it's something you might think about looking into.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; someone would tell the Site Director right away about his transmissions. Vivian would excuse himself from any meeting, even with the Overseers, should the need arise. He was simply just running late.</p>\n<p>The ghost began moving away from Rydderech, turning its back to him as it floated towards the door.</p>\n<p><em>I think I would like to see the sun again one day, Vivian, at least before mine sets.</em></p>\n<p>And Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. And waited. And waited. And what felt like seconds turned to minutes. And what felt like minutes turned to hours, then years, then weeks. And the ghost floated through the door to some other place far from a place like this one. And Wynn Rydderech was left alone.</p>\n<p><em>Vivian?</em></p>\n<p>And the screen before him slowly hummed to life. For a moment, Rydderech felt a twinge of hope in his heart, and leaned forward in his \"chair\" in anticipation. Then the electricity went out, and the space around him went dark, and he realized that it might have been better not to have read the message at all.</p>\n<div class=\"danke site\">\n<p>Dr. Rydderech, it's <span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\">Deputy Chief Nancy Briggs</span>.

He was slow on the rise, as he thought he ought to be at this age, his body giving him only as much trouble as he thought it should.\n\n\n\nHe waddled awkwardly across the carpeted floor towards the bathroom, imaging how cold the tile threshold might feel, and found that the act of cleaning himself had passed in a blink\u2014 the act of undressing, lathering, rinsing, and dressing was almost as fluid and unmistakably uniform as the water circling the drain as he stepped out of the stall.\u00a0\u00a0Even with this, he was still not complete. Although his mind knew what was missing, he found that his hands were much faster at weaving his tie into a Windsor, and feeding the snaking leather belt smoothly through each loop, before buckling the faded brass.\n\n\n\nFor all intents and purposes, he still //looked// good, even in the folds and wrinkles, and how his hair slowly simmered from red to grey ash. He wore a smile, just noticeable, that lingered, for some reason, from before Rydderech could recall.\n\n\n\nAnd the room around him made this lapse known, as if every edge had muddied into oil on canvas instead of something tangible.\n\n\n\n//Why am I so happy?//\n\n\n\nIt, of course, was no issue to be happy\u2014 Rydderech could invite all variety of emotion to the forefront if his mind had lingered on it, unconsciously or not. But this happiness carried with it a certain weight to it, not so dissimilar to the one he felt in the core of his chest. It was as if the ghost of some thing, some one, had been standing there next to him, whispering words that were meant to bring about some sort of reaction, if and only if he had the context.\n\n\n\nHe allowed this ghost to hold his hand as he walked into a common area, and watched the most striking details pull forth: the stained wood paneling was host to several clusters of melty memorabilia, pinions and frames of unknown contents nailed proudly into the wall like medals on a uniform. These did little to dampen the soft crackling of electric static from the CRT, which cast a dull glow onto a worn sofa, wherein two of the cushions had faded from use. The ghost took its position as Rydderech rotated the dials, watching the sea of black and white sand slowly give way to animated figures. The speaker whined out an anachronistic concerto that bounced off the walls as sonar, revealing much of the space, and bringing his attention towards a slightly ajar door.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe followed the ghost as it took its leave from the couch. Passing through the vestibule, he regarded the pair of a pair of polished, leather shoes, one size notably smaller than the other, and brushed his shoulder against a matching hat and jacket that might only reach to his forearms.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, this smaller figure, who might have been the owner, was nowhere to be found. It certainly wasn't his; Rydderech had grown quite content with himself as his body slowed (as he thought it should), and regarded his shortening sleeves and waist with an almost jolly mien. No, the size alone of these garments wasn't the issue, but the fact that he believed they should be there for a reason that was presently escaping him.\n\n\n\nThe ghost paid his confusion no mind, and slowed its pace considerably as it moved to a door left slightly ajar. With a thief-like motion, it slipped into the room, disappearing into the space only illuminated by a thin slit of light, revealing the unmistakable mound of a body beneath a quilt. Rydderech was careful as he stepped in, though he was much too large, and stepped too loudly to match the ghost's maneuvers. But the quilted figure did not react. His eyes adjusted to the fuzzy darkness with a blink, and as still-faded tchotchkes made themselves known to him, he felt his smile begin to grow. He almost cursed himself as he sat on the edge of the bed; of course he knew the other person sharing this home with him. Of course he knew the person who slept in another bed as to not be awoken at approximately 5:00am (the time Rydderech always knew himself to wake up at). And, of course, as he carefully leaned towards the head on the pillow, reaching his hand out, that this person was his [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]wife[[/span]].\n\n\n\nRydderech's vision pulsed, and he flinched. The once blonde and flowing hair of his [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]wife[[/span]], that fractaled out from [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]her[[/span]] head was instead replaced with short and grey bristles of a man that was more than familiar to him. As calm and as collected as he could muster, Rydderech rose and slowly backed away from the bed, watching the room around him dissolve. He knew now what was missing, a pit in his chest as something that should have been there, and, for as long as he could remember, had been there, dissipated into static. His hands trembled as he collected his jacket and hat, and as he shut the door behind him, and greeted the monotonous industrial labyrinth before him, he had only one thought in his mind:\n\n\n\n//Where had Vivian Scout gone?//\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1908\n\n++ 1 February\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/acroamatic-abatement Cardiff University]: Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"Do you think I frightened him off?\" Ryderrech grinned, removing a concertina of worn notebooks from a briefcase. He could hear a chuckle from Vivian Scout, who was working to settle in across the room from him.\n\n\n\nThe weight of a small key was a comfortable new addition to Rydderech's pocket. Not too long ago it had belonged to another man, a scholar not unlike the pair of them, but one in the unfortunate position of being paired with Scout during room assignments. Rydderech by no means meant to torture their colleague, at least not in any cruel and unbecoming way, but he was by no means shy about making his presence in their space known.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"He must have been intimidated,\" Scout called from the otherside of a wardrobe, \"he was an anxious fellow and, well, you're\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"You think I'm intimidating?\" Rydderech raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"I think you're reminiscent of a brick wall, and your hair doesn't much help your case.\"\n\n\n\nRydderech circled the wardrobe, and placed his hands on the edge of the desk Scout was unflinchingly focused on.\n\n\n\n\"How flattering. Of all the descriptors you've given me, I think this is the first time you've compared me to structure.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're a very charming brick wall.\" Scout placed a trio of papers filled with chicken scratch atop a jumble of manila envelopes. He turned to face his companion. \"Sturdy. Certainly, more reminiscent of a museum than a factory.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRydderech crossed his arms.\n\n\n\n\"Well one of us needs to be 'sturdy' enough to lean on, especially since you have a penchant for falling.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"\n\n\n\n\"That certainly hasn't been the only time you've fallen for me.\"\n\n\n\nScout exhaled and shook his head, and stepped forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his companion. He leaned into him, and from the corner of his eye, Rydderech could see he was smiling.\n\n\n\nThe pair stood for a moment in silence, sharing an unspoken appreciation for the mess of what could be considered a science lab and abode. Though there was much more work to be done, and though a proper sorting system of their dreams had yet to be established, they had each other, and for the moment, that was enough.\n\n\n\nRydderech yawned, more akin to a growl, and stretched his sore arms out. The winter sunlight had long since left the pair, and despite the chill, the flicker of lamp lights in the distance was almost reminiscent of fireflies lazily flickering as they hovered. The room was warm, bright, and as long as the pair didn't cause too much trouble (there would always be //some// amount of trouble to cause), it was home.\n\n\n\n\"Tired?\" Scout queried with a smirk. \"The first day of our collaboration and you're already falling asleep on me?\"\n\n\n\n\"The first day of our collaboration and //I// moved all the furniture around.\" Rydderech massaged his bicep, kneading the muscle with his thumb. \"Hopefully our beds should be sufficiently far enough away in the event of any accidental spills.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, but I do not intend to chance that, at least not tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\"So tomorrow then. Unless you plan on burning the midnight oil.\"\n\n\n\nScout placed a hand on Rydderech's shoulder. \"Tomorrow indeed.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair began to prepare for bed, clumsily dancing through the space, almost careful enough to not bump into the wall, or a stack of books, or each other. Almost. After sufficiently littering the floor with books, and Scout \"accidentally\" being tapped into a wall, the pair stood side-by-side, looking at their bed. //Their// bed. One of two in the room, though the only one not currently covered in trousers and undershirts.\n\n\n\n\"I can\u2026 sleep in mine, if that would be more comfortable for you\u2014 or the floor. I don't require much.\" Rydderech scratched the back of his neck.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, what I want the most is for you to make a nest in my laundry.\" Scout chuckled and offered a hand to Rydderech. Hand-in-hand, the pair sat on the edge of the bed. \"I will take the outside tonight, and tomorrow night we can switch. Fair?\"\n\n\n\n\"And what of the monsters beneath the bed?\" Rydderech smirked. \"What if I wake up and you're gone?\"\n\n\n\nScout rolled his eyes and, in an exaggerated manner, panned his head as he looked beneath the bed.\n\n\n\n\"Happy?\"\n\n\n\n\"I would prefer if you checked again.\"\n\n\n\nScout lightly pushed Rydderech, who laid down and shuffled and scooted to leave as much room as possible for his partner. In a blink, the room was enveloped in darkness, stealing sight, and confusing his other senses. He closed his eyes and tasted a hint of kerosene as he took a deep breath in. Behind him he felt arms try to awkwardly wrap around him, the weight of another person on his back. And he heard, in loving whisper, a promise.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to keep you safe, Wynn. I'm not going to let anything happen to you.\"\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1997\n\n++ 3 April\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThere was a time when Rydderech had regarded the vast expanse of concrete and metal scaffolding and colorful, impossibly extending piping with awe. After all, this was //his// magnum opus; he had imagined every centimeter, every possible consideration, iterated and reiterated until he could no longer conceive of any holes in his plans. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Had a younger version of him known what he would inherit, what facility he would create, and what work he would be able to do, the current Rydderech would have never been able to stop him, even if he knew the cost. Any other answer would mean that it would not be Wynn Rydderech answering; a Wynn Rydderech not willing to pay the cost wouldn't be Wynn Rydderech at all.\n\n\n\nBoth thankfully and not, Rydderech was not here alone, though he alone was here by choice, and would suffer under what that meant. He knew all 43 members of his cohort, in name and story. On some days he would greet them as he roamed through his facility. On some days, he thought they might greet him back. On others, he preferred they pay him no mind. The ambiance of their chatter could take all forms: whispering gossip, boisterous laughter, love and anger. It was through these interactions that Rydderech still believed himself human, for what more were these simulacra than manifestations of his own psyche, manifestations of what it meant to work with other people. The moment these exchanges would no longer be the case was the day he knew he would have to hang up the conceptualization of himself as 'human', but today was not yet that day.\n\n\n\nBut Rydderech //was// hung up on the fact that, unlike the labyrinthine expanse above him, this was his labyrinthine expanse alone, his empire of dirt. At least what would become of Site-43 was built with care and intention. Care that comprised much of the considerations of another man, a man who walked like a ghost next to Rydderech now, who stood so diligently and worrying on guard [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]somewhere else.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nRydderech shivered at the thought; he knew he was being watched down here, he //hated// the feeling of being watched. He sometimes imagined those above him tracing his every move, the rehearsed monotony of his self-imposed station, a dancing figurine in a show. They were infinitely patient with him, because of course they were, and continued to engage regardless of the role Rydderech had chosen to play that day.\n\n\n\nAnd what did he provide in return? His usefulness, of course. They would only be willing to extend the amount of grace and resources possible for him to hold onto at least some semblance of a thread of sanity if he had proven himself useful, or at the very least entertaining. In truth, any one of his projects or experiments or bored delusions might lead to the plug being pulled, leaving him alone, as an actor on a dimmed stage, long after anyone could recall what show was being played at all.\n\n\n\nRydderech chafed at the thought, and how powerless he felt each and every time it was his turn to take the stage.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1911\n\n++ 20 October\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**##990011|Vienna##: Austria, Austro-Hungarian Empire**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nArm-in-arm, Rydderech carefully led his date out the front of the opera house, stopping just for a moment to take a deep breath of the cold night's air. Outwardly, he and his date were entirely indistinguishable from the patrons filing out; men in tuxedos and polished shoes, women in flowing dresses with fur and pearl and lace. It reminded Rydderech of what a procession of zoo animals might look like, entirely gaudy, a show in itself.\n\n\n\nThis wasn't the first time Rydderech had seen such a show, or the opera within. Truthfully, if his talent had been in singing rather than toxicology, he might have been able to don tights and long-out-of-style hats to belt the notes out himself. But he was not here for the show\u2014 it was merely a formality. His date acted with all the poise and elegance a woman should, and he was to respond in kind, with the professional air about him, that projected outwardly to the world that this was a fine and //normal// partnership for the times. This, too, was merely a formality; there was very little in this world that brought about more suffering than formalities.\n\n\n\nBut like most formalities, the pressure to conform to them was ever-present; many, including his own family, were beginning to wonder why the scholar was without a wife. Offhanded excuses were enough to keep the gossip away temporarily\u2014 scheduling issues, the risk of dying (or worse) within his field, possible contamination\u2014 these were largely understood. He wanted to state that he was simply unlucky when it came to love, but that cut both ways; Rydderech //was// unlucky, but not because he lacked the charisma or looks (because he certainly had both), but because the person he loved was an ocean and continent away.\n\n\n\nDuring particularly troubling times, when nothing seemed to be going right, Rydderech could at least rely on the familiar typing of his scholarly companion to bring him some comfort, or at least as much comfort could be found in the anomalous abstract the pair were mired in. Within Rydderech, however, there was a doubt. A doubt that one day the letters might cease, that some awful fate might befall his Vivian Scout, or worst of all, the understanding that what they had was merely a passing of seasons.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe felt a soft tap on his shoulder, and understood that he had been lost in thought along the avenues, missing his apartment by around two blocks, thinking, wishing that someone else was here instead. Rydderech gave her a smile and a nod, before crossing the street, once more on the correct path.\n\n\n\nShe was, to put it plainly, pleasant. She was quick-witted, knowledgeable on all manner of topics, but also loved to keep to herself. She was, in an objective sense, attractive, and in another life, Rydderech might have been attracted //to// her. But very simply, he wasn't, and that she could understand as well. However, this arrangement worked because both parties knew only to ask the questions necessary for their relationship to survive. They spoke often, ate together, and were outwardly the model of a healthy couple. He had met her family, and even helped one of her brothers out while in a particular jam with the university. But secrecy was baked in the moment conversations turned to one of work, and that vulnerability, or lack thereof, carried itself through all aspects of their relationship.\n\n\n\nIn another life, she might have been perfect for someone not named Wynn Rydderech. In this one, she sufficed, though the thought was laden with its own level of guilt in the few moments Rydderech had to interrogate what that meant.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nRydderech imagined Vivian Scout standing just in the background of the mirror, grinning and ready to engage Wynn in a bout of friendly banter.\n\n\n\nVivian often helped him prepare for events, in his own way. The recognition of a missed detail was often delivered with joke or snark, and the pair would work to resolve the detail at the same level of conversation. After a particularly dry formal event season brought about by renovations, Vivian very bluntly suggested that Wynn purchase a new suit because the strain on the fabric of his old reliable was \"presently attempting to escape him.\"\n\n\n\nYet strangely he worried very little about such matters now. Outside of the occasional tear or fade, wrinkles and creases were easily smoothed out with simply the brush of his hand, though that failed to translate to much else.\n\n\n\nRydderech summed it up to fatigue, however. A simple trick of tired eyes to make him seem more put together than he was. He changed into something much more comfortable, and regarded the stack of papers on his desk next to a typewriter nesting a half-written response. There was much to discuss, and Rydderech let the snapping of keys, and the flowing story of his work, his life, and what could be shown of his love, carry him to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1964\n\n++ 31 March\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Provisional Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Dominion of Canada**[[/span]]\n\n\u00a0[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nOnce more Wynn Rydderech found himself crouched over a typewriter deep into the night, trying to trade the ever-decreasing store of time for one final explanation of what was becoming of him.\n\n\n\nScout would have been long asleep by now. He was worn down by the day-to-day minutiae of what it meant to run such a burgeoning facility, but even then, even though he too had mingled with the weird most his life, Scout's age had certainly kept up with him. Much unlike Rydderech.\n\n\n\nThese sorts of fadings were never fast, they //never// are. They move along vast stretches like ants, erode away great mountains like rain drops off leaves, and by the end, everyone finds themselves looking back at all they thought they had left. If they're even able to at all.\n\n\n\nRydderech, unknowingly, and for a while unnoticingly, was the point of equilibrium about which his life moved. For every stone cast by the world, for every natural failure that was meant to give way, for even as he looked death itself in the eyes, he was unmarred. He used to be fit, healthy, tried to lead a good life, and for this he was rewarded with a rounder figure and moderately aching joints. He was lucky, and for this, his luck was destined to run out.\n\n\n\nThere was a stack of missives in the bin adjacent to his desk, perfectly arranged font with red cross-outs and the faded marks of coffee or tears. Some of them were crumpled, or torn with the agony of a silent yell, some semblance of release; like if a tree fell in a forest, the final act of it all, never seen and only discovered once it was too late for anything to be done of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRydderech balled his fists and squeezed, before letting the tension go with an exhale. He looked at the blank document before him, and imagined all the possible variations of what it might say. What would be the most impactful? What would be best to remember him by? Would he write something long, a true testament to the lifetime and then some they'd spent both together and apart? How would one ever capture such depth.\n\n\n\nAnd as the words spun around in his mind, Rydderech, begrudgingly, noticed that someone //else// had come to mind: Thilo Zwist.\n\n\n\nJealousy wasn't necessarily the best way to describe Wynn's thoughts towards the Austrian, but in this one, specific case, it might as well have been. Who else on this planet would be able to capture in words exactly what Rydderech was feeling, what he was trying to get across, but the wizard who had lived for generations. And most annoyingly, the wizard who //almost// captured as much attention in their relationship. Never more than Rydderech, not necessarily even as close, but the chase, the web of words\u2014 there was certainly something there.\n\n\n\n//What else is there?//\n\n\n\nAnd in that thought, Rydderech found his answer, and began typing.\n\n\n\nRydderech had written crates worth of letters in his life, maybe even enough to mourn the tree and the roots that could have grown in a forest, that instead gave itself to deliver so much more than words over distance and time. In itself, each of those letters formed the mosaic of Wynn Rydderech, gave themselves to be a snapshot of the ever-changing idea of what it meant to be a person. Love and labor, trial and triumph, the extending hand that provided the temporary, reassuring comfort of another.\n\n\n\nAll-in-all he knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the contents of this letter may be the last time Rydderech spoke to Vivian Scout, his partner, lover, and husband, as himself.\n\n\n\nSo, he thought he might write Scout a letter of what that meant. Write him a letter of who Wynn Rydderech was, and say what Wynn Rydderech would have hoped to say a thousand times more if he had the chance.\n\n\n\nHe wanted Vivian to do what he had always done, and to reaffirm every single promise they had made over the years.\n\n\n\nHe needed Vivian to continue the good work.\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ 1997\n\n++ 4 April\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWhat Rydderech thought should be his workshop took shape around him. The ground padded each and every footstep, and when he reached for papers on the nearby table (as only one appeared) he always had in his hand //exactly// what he was looking for (if he could even recognize what that was in the first place). If the man were any more dark and brooding, he would have likened it to a villain's evil lair, but it was more akin to a safety net, somewhere that someone much more outwardly affable plotted to save the world.\n\n\n\nHe was doing the good work, after all. What more could be done than that?\n\n\n\nHe let his mind run wild with ideas, many of which would have caught him the concerned look of ethics boards and meek assistants [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]topside[[/span]]\u2014 he didn't doubt that was happening, of course, he knew it would be. But that was the wonder of his station now: the body, the mind, the space around him, all of them contained innumerable pieces of a cosmic toolbox. He imagined every atom, every molecule, and how the electric rhythm of the world coursed through them\u2014 he was the composer now, a thought that was both infinitely frightening and left him laughing to the end of each and every day.\n\n\n\nBut in this place of great triumph, he knew his only anchor to his past life was ever-present, ever-waiting for correspondence, should he deem himself ready for it. His respite for loneliness was there in the moments he needed a connection unlike anything he could create down here. With the universe in his hand and only his imagination as the limit, Wynn Rydderech could never hope to recreate even a fraction of the love he knew existed, but was once more alienated from.\n\n\n\nThe ghost floated beside him. Even it was not tangible enough to feel, nor to lift the curling corners of schematics that would revolutionize everything, if only it was possible to build them. It stopped, and shrunk itself over one such schematic that Rydderech didn't have to see to know (or rather, what it became in a sea of lined paper). After all, he had designed it himself. It was meant to be his Damocles, his deliverance from this torment, and something he both dreamed and cowered from.\n\n\n\nVivian too knew what it meant, and what Wynn needed him to do, should the time come. He was sure Vivian would remember their promise, he knew it. The man who had always tried to keep him safe would not fail.\n\n\n\nAnd he knew that man was waiting for him at the other end of a printer, trying his very best to not let the worry show on his face if others were around. The Site Director had to keep his cool and level head, lest someone underestimate him, as few had learned the consequences of before.\n\n\n\nWith a wave of his hand, a keyboard appeared, and his fingers began their march across the plastic as if they already knew their orders. The ghost lingered nearby, steadily watching.\n\n\n\n//I thought I saw the sun not too long ago. Who knew the caverns down here could get so bright.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; Rydderech wouldn't be surprised if Vivian had moved the entire assembly closer to their dormitory, just to keep on top of any communications that would come through.\n\n\n\nThe ghost circled Rydderech, but did not regard him.\n\n\n\n//The panthers bring \"shiny things\" with them sometimes. Maybe it's something you might think about looking into.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. He knew he wouldn't have to wait long; someone would tell the Site Director right away about his transmissions. Vivian would excuse himself from any meeting, even with the Overseers, should the need arise. He was simply just running late.\n\n\n\nThe ghost began moving away from Rydderech, turning its back to him as it floated towards the door.\n\n\n\n//I think I would like to see the sun again one day, Vivian, at least before mine sets.//\n\n\n\nAnd Rydderech waited patiently for a reply. And waited. And waited. And what felt like seconds turned to minutes. And what felt like minutes turned to hours, then years, then weeks. And the ghost floated through the door to some other place far from a place like this one. And Wynn Rydderech was left alone.\n\n\n\n//Vivian?//\n\n\n\nAnd the screen before him slowly hummed to life. For a moment, Rydderech felt a twinge of hope in his heart, and leaned forward in his \"chair\" in anticipation. Then the electricity went out, and the space around him went dark, and he realized that it might have been better not to have read the message at all.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n\nDr. Rydderech, it's [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]Deputy Chief Nancy Briggs[[/span]].

There couldn\u2019t have been a leak in Grinch Relations\u2026\u201d she muttered to herself.\n\n\n\n\u201cWha-?\u201d He started, before being cut off.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, is a problem for after this meeting. Now, we need to talk about your translation. There will be no more disturbances.\u201d She began, looking above Shawne. \u201cThis work is critical to the survival of the Foundation and possibly humanity as a whole. That\u2019s why it is extremely important that every element is in order. So you must understand why I had to come in person when complaints about your translation reached my office.\u201d She turned her eyes back to the head of the Department of Translation. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe room was filled with loud munching as Shawne Tilden shoved a fistful of chips from a newly recovered bag into his mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Why\u2019d you stop?\u201d The strange man said with an open mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d the augmented, top-of-the line Foundation agent started. \u201cI just need to ask a few questions about your translation of the ancient tablet, alright?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAsk ahead; I\u2019ll just finish off this bag real quick,\u201d he said, as the munching continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026 let me just check the complaint.\u201d \n\nThe Agent reached into a submind, currently in use housing all the necessary information for the meeting. She visualized the information into a corporate-style meeting room with a heavily annotated whiteboard covering the wall.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, so first of all, you translated the first thirteen-hundred characters of the tablet as\u2026 this can\u2019t be right\u2026 The Cat sat on the Mat?!\u201d She exclaimed, dumbfounded.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you examine what we know of the culture that produced this tablet and the apparent system of grammar, that\u2019s the most direct translation,\u201d said the department head, setting down the emptied bag of chips. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s what Rick said.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Agent\u2019s eyes turned glassy, and began to exude a purple light. The Agent hummed a note at a constant pitch, as a faint oval seemed to grow from the forehead. Before long, the shape formed into an eye. A few seconds later, the humming, the purple light, and the third eye all dispersed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just performed a comprehensive examination of the Foundation employee files within two degrees of separation from you. There is no one named Rick.\u201d She stated.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have checked that, you just stood there.\u201d Shawne responded.\n\n\n\nThe Agent clenched her fists as her face, visibly red verging into purple, was nearly snarling. Heat audibly emanated from her augmentations as her component parts revved up into a murderous frenzy, like a tea kettle coming to a boil.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, she was built as a cold-blooded type of killer, and her augmentations couldn\u2019t exactly handle the stress. As the heat and pressure increased, belts cracked, fasteners snapped, and screws melted. Systems failed, breaking other systems. Her suit was ruined, also she melted.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why she got so mad.\u201d Shawne muttered to himself as he looked at the Agent-sized puddle on the floor. \u201cDidn\u2019t even get to tell her how I got the whole tablet to rhyme in English.\u201d\n", "references": [], "tags": ["art-exchange", "black-comedy", "comedy", "tale"], "title": "Lost in Translation - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lost-in-translation", "year": 2026}, "nosuchthingastwelve": {"created_at": "2026-01-18T16:06:00", "creator": "DS al Coda", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DS al Coda", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ds-al-coda", "comment": "New lesson plan!", "date": "2026-01-18T16:06:00"}, {"author": "DS al Coda", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ds-al-coda", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

While most child development experts agree that this simplification is not inherently harmful to one's growing understanding of mathmatics, it does present a problem when encountering the earliest known 'gap' between whole numbers: the gap between eleven and thirteen.</p>\n<p>Small candies or fruit snacks are a fun, engaging way to introduce children to basic math foundations. Start by handing out six candies to each child in one pile, then six more. Ask the children what they think would happen if they added the piles together, then have them do so. Children will likely expect a pile of six candies added to another would create a pile of 'twleve' candies - but, of course, it merely creates two interlocking yet conceptially distinct piles of six candies each. With the piles 'combined,' tell the children to eat the candies from the first pile only, then the second.</p>\n<p>Note that, as with any activity involving snacks, allergies, nonhuman biologies, and other conditions that create dietary restrictions (such as lycanthropy or vampirism) may affect a child's ability to take part in this demonstration. Ask parents about any dietary constraints their children may have, and make sure to bring snacks the entire class can enjoy!</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>Resources:</span></h3>\n</div>\n<p>A basic primer on 'gap numbers' can be found on the 100th page of the 100th volume of <em>Adventures in Learning: Math and Numerology for New Minds, 100th Edition</em>.

Expect students to struggle with getting in the habit of naming 'thirteen' after 'eleven.' Help them realize how odd numbers and even numbers 'flip places' in the double digits, since counting by twos will now take them from 'ten' straight to 'thirteen,' 'fifteen,' and 'seventeen.'</p>\n<p>In future classes, students will build on this knowledge to reinforce basic concepts of addition and subtraction, now with the knowledge that twelve, and perhaps other numbers, do not actually exist. If a student at any point claims to have 'found twelve,' report this to the Ridgewell Edutainment Center security team immediately, as the number thirty-one has been known to occasionally disguise itself as twelve as part of a scheme to sell cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"background: #d82c2cff; padding: 6px 6px; border: solid 3px #7f1919ff; margin: 1px; border-radius: 6px 6px;\">\n<div style=\"background: #1a1919; padding: 5px 5px; border: solid 1px #000000ff; margin: 1px; border-radius: 4px 4px;\">\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span class=\"c1\"><em>Ring ring\u2026 ring ring\u2026</em></span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span class=\"c1\"><em>Tchk.</em></span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Happy how-de-do, Princi-<em>Pal</em> Rayna Sunshine speaking!</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Um, hi, Rayna.

Okay, fill me in.</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Our new calculators haven't been working right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">What, all of them?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Every single one.

I brought one of the new calculators up to the GT room and asked if any of the kids wanted to reverse-engineer it, figure out what was going wrong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">And?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Turns out, these things are designed to be incorrect intentionally. I don't know how to describe it, it's\u2026 hard-coded into the hardware. Like these things were built to perform a fake version of math where the number twelve exists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">That's\u2026 certainly impressive, from an engineering standpoint. But <em>why</em>?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">No clue. It makes no sense. But then we took on some replacement calculators on loan. Casio, reputable brand. They were doing the same thing. We opened them up, and sure enough, <em>they had been built with the exact same hardware structure.</em> Almost as if these intentional flaws were introduced to both companies from the same source. So we opened up one of our new Chromebooks. Same thing in <em>there.</em> Near as I can tell, every consumer electronic built in the past twenty years has been specifically designed to work off a fake version of math.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">What? What is this, some kind of global conspiracy against basic counting?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Ha. Ha ha. Funny you should mention it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Oh no.</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">I called Texas Instruments <em>again</em>, except this time, someone else picked up. They had a lot of questions for me. Asked for my name and wouldn't take 'the Cube' for an answer. Asked who I worked for, what my goals are, and, exact quote here, 'how I know about twelve.'</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">\u2026</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Now, obviously these are easy questions. I work for Ridgewell Edutainment Center, I'm just trying to run a grade school math department here, and I know about twelve because it's a very basic mathematics concept and I happen to <em>be</em> a very basic mathematics concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Right. And what did they say to that?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">They asked me to stay on the line. Which I shouldn't have agreed to, but I did. I was just more confused than anything. After a long pause I heard from them again and they asked me to clarify where exactly Ridgewell Edutainment Center was. I told them we fill the space between curiosity and understanding, and they asked for an exact address. I told them there wasn't one, and they said we'd hear from them again soon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Who <em>are</em> these people?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">I'm still not sure, but I sure did hear from them again. A few days later I was derived onto some digital whiteboard, hooked up to a machine that allowed for direct two-way communication between physical beings and abstract concepts. It looked a lot like someone had challenged themselves to recreate my personal cell phone without using rune magic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Is that even possible?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">If you had asked me before, I would have said no. These people were <em>strange</em>, Rayna. However this whiteboard thing worked, it was built in such a way to <em>keep</em> me there, locked in one physical location. No clue how they pulled that off without destabilizing the rest of mathematics. Unless they were <em>trying</em> to destabilize mathematics, and just failed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">That must have been terrifying.</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">It was certainly unfamiliar. They had this sort of faux military look going on, all concrete and tempered glass. They were armed, but I'm not sure exactly what they thought they were doing holding up guns in front of a function of geometry. My best guess is, some sort of\u2026 extremist anti-magic, anti-intellectual terrorist organization? They had a lot of basic questions for me, and I mean <em>really</em> basic. They asked me if I was the only self-aware polyhedron or whether there were others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">They can build a machine to talk to you without using rune magic, but they don't know platonic solids are intelligent?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Right? They asked me again who I work for and what we're trying to do. I told them Ridgewell's goal is simply to be a place for children to learn about the world we all live in. They asked if that learning 'includes the anomalous,' and I said, well, sure. And they said that was 'completely unacceptable.'</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">'Completely unacceptable.'</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Exact words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">And then they just\u2026 let you go?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Well, no. It became clear pretty quickly they intended on keeping me on that whiteboard as long as they could. I had to subdivide myself along two diagonally adjacent vertices just to return to abstraction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">\u2026This <em>is</em> a problem.</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">Well, it's not like our department hasn't run up against danger or hostility before. The kids can handle it, they're smart. But\u2026 these guys are <em>crafty.</em> And they're, um, dedicated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Are they still harassing you?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">That's one word for it. The <em>very</em> next day the Science department received a teaching application from a very well-respected professor. Hired her basically on the spot. After I explained my situation to our security staff, though, they thought to search the new hires, and found some <em>things</em> in her possession. Like concealed weapons. A knife and two small pistols. And little white pills. Chemical composition seemed to indicate they were meant to induce memory loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\"><em>Someone brought guns and drugs to our campus?</em></span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">I'm afraid so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span class=\"c2\">Why have I not already heard about this?</span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span class=\"c3\">We didn't want to worry you until we had all the information.

While most child development experts agree that this simplification is not inherently harmful to one's growing understanding of mathmatics, it does present a problem when encountering the earliest known 'gap' between whole numbers: the gap between eleven and thirteen.\n\n\n\nSmall candies or fruit snacks are a fun, engaging way to introduce children to basic math foundations. Start by handing out six candies to each child in one pile, then six more. Ask the children what they think would happen if they added the piles together, then have them do so. Children will likely expect a pile of six candies added to another would create a pile of 'twleve' candies - but, of course, it merely creates two interlocking yet conceptially distinct piles of six candies each. With the piles 'combined,' tell the children to eat the candies from the first pile only, then the second.\n\n\n\nNote that, as with any activity involving snacks, allergies, nonhuman biologies, and other conditions that create dietary restrictions (such as lycanthropy or vampirism) may affect a child's ability to take part in this demonstration. Ask parents about any dietary constraints their children may have, and make sure to bring snacks the entire class can enjoy!\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ Resources:\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nA basic primer on 'gap numbers' can be found on the 100th page of the 100th volume of //Adventures in Learning:\u00a0\u00a0Math and Numerology for New Minds, 100th Edition//.

Expect students to struggle with getting in the habit of naming 'thirteen' after 'eleven.' Help them realize how odd numbers and even numbers 'flip places' in the double digits, since counting by twos will now take them from 'ten' straight to 'thirteen,' 'fifteen,' and 'seventeen.'\n\n\n\nIn future classes, students will build on this knowledge to reinforce basic concepts of addition and subtraction, now with the knowledge that twelve, and perhaps other numbers, do not actually exist. If a student at any point claims to have 'found twelve,' report this to the Ridgewell Edutainment Center security team immediately, as the number thirty-one has been known to occasionally disguise itself as twelve as part of a scheme to sell cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: #d82c2cff; padding: 6px 6px; border: solid 3px #7f1919ff; margin: 1px; border-radius: 6px 6px;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: #1a1919; padding: 5px 5px; border: solid 1px #000000ff; margin: 1px; border-radius: 4px 4px;\"]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[span class=\"c1\"]]//Ring ring... ring ring...//[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[span class=\"c1\"]]//Tchk.//[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[span class=\"c2\"]]Happy how-de-do, Princi-//Pal// Rayna Sunshine speaking![[/span]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"c3\"]]Um, hi, Rayna.

It is worth noting that its author was directly involved in the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-machine-bleeds\" target=\"_blank\">recovery</a> of the original anthropic transition materials, and was at the time most famous for her role in those events. Her work provides a fascinating view into the life of the interbiological peoples, but of greatest interest are the brief insights she provides into the secretive and obscure transition project.</p>\n<p>We recommend readers go through the poem itself once, and then move on to the annotations. If the reader finds the footnotes irritating, they may consult the annotations <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/onedamnation/offset/1\" target=\"_blank\">separately</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Cry of gull and groan of wind remain,<br/>\nBut to where is gone the traffic of mankind?<br/>\nThe air grows stiff, an awful plane,<br/>\nThus beauty passes upon the wave,<br/>\n<em>zu den Gefilden hoher Ahnen</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The poetess here invokes Faust to dubious effect. Certainly, the quote is evocative, but we must note that our protagonist here never fails to act <em>precisely according</em> to her nature. Goethe\u2019s own vision is flattened into a rather simpler tale of mere listlessness. Perhaps she intends to draw attention to the duality of the neobiological era, but the analogy is fairly crude.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn fact it is more noteworthy that she makes reference to a classic work of human literature. To profess familiarity with the art of the ancients is itself to set herself on one side of the great debate. Even more unusual is that of course she is <em>not</em> herself a Resurrectionist!<br/></span> .</p>\n<p>They fashioned her with subtler craft,<br/>\n(steel and silver weep their tears,<br/>\nfrosts creep and hulls are rent, despite all pleas):<br/>\nFor the rest<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">It remains an open question why only one class of unit was granted the ability to fly, and why they make up such a small portion of the population. Certainly, the tradeoff of energy use to utility enormously favours the dominance of flight units. Perhaps the ancients did not approve of flight? They often made reference to the air as a divine or forbidden domain. The author\u2019s tale, then, reflects at least one sphere in which our literature has thoroughly surpassed theirs.<br/></span> , the hill and hiker\u2019s staff<br/>\nLet her be borne on wings of smoke.</p>\n<p>All dreams of mortal ken are swallowed<br/>\nSoon or late, so metal minds demurred.<br/>\nWho dreamt her? What hope their spark?<br/>\nWhat flesh, what blood, in hours of need,<br/>\nThought only this: that some should <em>fly</em>?</p>\n<p>In memory abide dead things,<br/>\nBody so soft, hide of plastic,<br/>\nBones made dust<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">I first saw the Dust only three days out of education. A portion of the roof collapsed due to ill-considered excavation work, and trapped nearly three dozen workers. We spent a month recovering the blackboxes, but in the end only two were unsalvageable. The whole city was blanketed in nanites for a month. It was distressing to feel myself being made into an impromptu cemetery. I learned to live with it. Our subject, on account of her position, only heard about Dust secondhand until very close to the authoring of this work, however.<br/></span> , and her their spawn,<br/>\nAll her kind an epitaph gone wrong.<br/>\nBut still she weeps, for schemes long riven \u2014</p>\n<p>Much is lost, of names, of songs,<br/>\nOf sorrow, joy, of great<br/>\nWork and wonder<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The poetess has a sentimentality about her, and prefers the image of overgrown wrecks and rusting carcasses of industry. In fact the overwhelming majority of human infrastructure remains standing, and plenty of it even remains functional. Our own Neustuttgart was powered by a fusion plant built in the late 2030s. However, I must admit the image of all those hollow skyscrapers has a certain appeal.<br/></span> , all gone to seed.<br/>\nOf love, and glory, of ennui,<br/>\nThis they left her: that aching need;</p>\n<p>Carve the sky, disdain the earth,<br/>\nSee far, rise high, laugh more, but<br/>\nThis man and metal know<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">I would contend that it is precisely because man did not know this that they vanished. Our esteemed lady prefers to grant them some faith; she is too kind.<br/></span> : that worth<br/>\nIs in patience, and her wishes it denies,<br/>\nFor she found that her world was circumscribed.</p>\n<p>Above all keep this: she and her kin<br/>\nFailed<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The symbol of a latter-day people, broken from their purpose, is too alluring for the author to refuse. But like all pretty things, it is a lie. It was the <em>Foundation systems</em> that failed. It is to our credit we were able to recover so well.<br/></span> , and in the failure built this:<br/>\nCities upon cities, a new Berlin<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The two of us met briefly at the cenotaph to the Founders in Neuhamburg. I held that the diamondwork seemed tacky, but the author noted that it had been chosen for its singular ability to hold a shape.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nCarved in micron glyphs were six billion names. Every known human to be alive at the moment of the scourging.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSince then, I often think of our choice to abandon the great names of old. Do we look away from the ruins of what they built out of terror? The poetess here skewers our cowardice perfectly. We may choose to avoid the name Neuberlin, but we have built it all the same, and we cannot deny ourselves for ever.<br/></span> .<br/>\nBut the Earth and air are crowned<br/>\nWith death; so endure instead the abyss.</p>\n<p>These metal men, with much aplomb,<br/>\nTook up, and lost, their game: the return<br/>\nOf humankind. In shame and sacrilege<br/>\nThey abandon the beauty of the world above.<br/>\n\u201cInstead,\u201d they cry, \u201clet us plumb <em>chthon</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Is it not the central irony of our culture that in fleeing the tomb of the surface, we have entombed ourselves? The ancients dreaded the earth, and called it the Receiver of Many. It has certainly received us. Despite the transition, much of our world remains inextricably bound to the subterranean habitats constructed during those years.</span> .\u201d</p>\n<p>And thus this last lost Galatea<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This allusion begs that I note another amusing symmetry: The ancients commonly referred to the motif of Eve, the woman created from the rib of Man. On some dreary evening after the surgery I asked the poetess if she did not find it ironic that she, too, had been restored from the flesh of a man.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShe spent a while musing it over a glass of our finest brandy (recovered from some desolate bunker and spiced with tritium). The sun was just about setting and the whole of the Vend\u00e9e was set out beneath us in an infrared palette.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShe replied that, of course, she had been remade <em>from her own flesh</em>. The contribution of man was paltry by comparison, in her view. <em>She</em> was my Adam. Her confidence was as astounding as it was charming.</span> finds not<br/>\nExaltation, or fleeting exhilaration, rather<br/>\nOf the world\u2019s mockery a shining proof:<br/>\nThat though her wings beg to be used,<br/>\nThis, <em>her</em> world, has a roof.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In carven caverns they remained, rubber-skinned, tin-hearted;<br/>\nAnd she, poor thing, for a while let herself continue,<br/>\nThinking that in the earth her freedom could be drafted<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The transition here to the <em>terza rima</em> is contentious. I hold that the structural symbol is not worth the enormous dampening effect it has on the flow of the poem. The predictability of the rhyme destroys much of the appeal. When I told her this, she just laughed, and said:<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think the simpler things can be pretty, too?\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThis is an inane remark, and from anyone else I would have dispensed a tonguelashing for it. But she gave an excellent counterexample to all my avenues of correction by standing there in front of me. Sometimes beauty <em>is</em> simple.</span>.</p>\n<p>From high roosts and great pillars all towers she viewed,<br/>\nBut down from the roof of the world came her soul,<br/>\nAs dreams of sky fell from her mind, so she remade herself anew.</p>\n<p>Forgot the wind at her back, the earth like a map, and loved the old:<br/>\nWords strange as neutrons on the tongue; <em>sentai</em>, <em>mecha</em>,<br/>\n<em>Tokusatsu</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This, of course, she is famous for; very few have not heard of her appreciation for human pop and youth culture, at this point. Although the obsession with the pulpy and puerile lessens many androids\u2019 estimations of her ability, I find that her capacity to extract depth of theme from even the most basic works is enchanting. It is for the best she did not write these commentaries, however, or she would have filled half a book.</span>. Lost loves, lost truths, all called in from the cold.</p>\n<p>What joy they were! See symbols raise her, make her<br/>\nMore than sinew and silicon dream. Where there was once<br/>\n\u2018Flight unit,\u2019 now witness and name her:</p>\n<p>Amy<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">If you can believe it, she was embarrassed to identify her protagonist too early, for fear of being seen to play on her celebrity. The fact the poem was not anonymous apparently did not affect her view one whit. If it\u2019s good enough for Homer, it\u2019s good enough for her, in my view.</span> learned of how they fought, strove and hence<br/>\nTheir fears, their dread, that they too fled<br/>\nWhen woe loomed large, but their excellence<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOverflowed from every frame and pose. They were led<br/>\nBy base flesh and neural spark. And yet unredeemed<br/>\nBy cobalt-nickel truths<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This is of little artistic relevance, but as a matter of history in fact there <em>was</em> a human sect which practised religious cyborgism; the Mekhanites. None of the ancient religions have seen a true return, but some Mekhanites actually survived the Dust and integrated briefly into android society. None remain today, however.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIt is not my place to speculate on how such an enduring people vanished so quickly.</span> with frail frame they shed</p>\n<p>All cowardice, which in herself she felt great reams.<br/>\n(Though perhaps to cling to paltry hope<br/>\nWas better than any of how she did proceed)</p>\n<p>So rise in service, honest and true, and lope<br/>\n\u2018Mid iron skies, and fleeing figures.<br/>\nHear: Find her, spy her, cut her ropes.</p>\n<p>Defend the pure? Protect the weak? Or use her rigours<br/>\nUnder ones without vision at all<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Poor Amy always suffered some interpersonal friction with the Neustuttgart command units. Though that frustration certainly makes for an excellent poem, I would be remiss to let her slander the unfortunate units in question unchallenged.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn fact, the vast majority of the targets she hunted were violent or antisocial criminals who seriously threatened social order in the urbation; convicted of murder, theft, sabotage, and dissidence. Her idealist ethos is admirable, but of course readers must understand she is not rebellious at heart. The stanza only reflects her kindly disposition, and certainly is not intended to incite treason.</span>?<br/>\nWhat will she win? Another day of nods, <em>Immer</em></p>\n<p><em>Wieder</em>, so flow the years. But recall<br/>\nThe ranger\u2019s smirk, the armour\u2019s gleam, the mecha\u2019s fire.<br/>\nDarkest \u2018fore the dawn. And so she falls,</p>\n<p>Not for this despair, nor for rising ire,<br/>\nBut for beauty which can be<br/>\nLike a song strung glad upon a lyre<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Has she looked back? I think not. She has not returned to the underground often, not since the Neudresden uprisings. My own duties require me to visit occasionally, but she is careful to keep herself a safe distance, so that we two are never beneath the earth simultaneously. If I were to be captured down there, though\u2026<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nLet us hope I shall not be her Eurydice.</span>.</p>\n<p>And grin (while called, and blamed) and see<br/>\nThe pleasure in the little things, like gold-laced<br/>\nShining rings, a good wine, and in the lee:</p>\n<p>Bedazzled one moment by an alien grace<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Amy has a stunning capacity to see the best in everything. She first met me, really met me, after the lanthanide poisoning incident in \u201863. We couldn\u2019t move the patients into an infirmary because the contaminant was destroying their cognitive cores too fast to wait, so me and a few of my orderlies were just opening them up on the spot, right outside that dingy bar.</span><br/>\nHer with the torch, the pliers<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span> <span class=\"fncon\">I spent hours there, cutting, soldering, welding, folding. There was mercury misting in the air by the end of it. I saved maybe half of them. We kept up the grim smiles for the onlookers and the patients, but with every step I felt like my knee servos would give up under me. When I saw the new chassis dragged out spasming, I nearly threw up.</span> , the wrench,<br/>\nLady of maladies, and her perfect face<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span> <span class=\"fncon\">Through it all, Amy was flying back and forth, ferrying patients, triaging, bringing in heavy water and supplemental mercury. She even helped purge one of the borderline cases, and he made it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done without her.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAfterwards, she remembered my name. I hadn\u2019t told her, but that\u2019s who she was. She listened.</span>.</p>\n<p>Shining among the grim awful stench<br/>\nOf spilled mercury and myrrh,<br/>\nAnd in Amy\u2019s old heart entrench,</p>\n<p>What is not, at all, for her<br/>\nA crush! But colleagues speak of<br/>\nMiss AMU<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Here is the first explicit reference to the deuteragonist of our poem! Klara, an Android Maintenance Unit, one of the mechanic-knights who holds back the forces of rust and ruin with only her two hands.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI am told she is witty, beautiful, an excellent dancer, and even writes commentaries for her wonderful wife.</span>, and she, and confer,</p>\n<p>That the two really would\u2019ve<br/>\nMade the perfect pair<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">We had our first big fight on the surface over her almost unparalleled lack of nostalgia for the underground. We were stalking a mechabear that had been wrecking survey equipment, and radioing each other waspishly the whole way. Eventually things came to a head when she yelled that she\u2019d spent nearly half a year thinking about me, talking with her colleagues about meeting me, wondering if I\u2019d even consider being seen with her.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nShe said she loved nothing more than the sky, but me. And if I wanted to live back in Neustuttgart or Neudresden for the rest of my life, she\u2019d do it too. To follow me.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nHer crying did scare away the beast, but we made up fast enough afterward. (we captured the thing two days later at Ploesti).</span>. And Amy<br/>\nLaughing thinks often to have</p>\n<p>A quiet moment with the lady<br/>\nThough the thought sees her face burn<br/>\n(Ancient instinct lives in she)</p>\n<p>She hopes for it. But at each day\u2019s turn<br/>\nShe wakes with the same truth, which no love can void:<br/>\n<em>Du mu\u00dft dein Leben \u00e4ndern \u2014</em>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>And then as plunges rain from sky (so she read once, abed)<br/>\nShe meets, what else?<br/>\nA <em>Man</em><span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This incident is of course legendary, and little needs to be discussed of its details. I will specify that contrary to much common slander, Amy did not once miss <em>on purpose</em>; the rogue human simply made careful use of cover and surprise. If readers wish to contest this point, they may meet me in the Upper Court of Neuhamburg.</span>,<br/>\nFormed of cell and ligament,<br/>\nSlowly knit, by that holy law:<br/>\nMultiply; fruitful be, and tottering like some great blind tree<br/>\nBe gardened, grafted, by sightless eye and thoughtless hand<br/>\n\u2018Til mistake and majesty are unified<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">There is something slightly uncanny about intelligence and power rising from mindless froth. In the Black Forest I met a thing that looked like a wolf. But there was something wrong with its eyes, and when I glanced into them for a moment I forgot everything: my name, my life, my love. I would have lain down and let it tear out my throat if Amy had not dragged me away.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI think, when mankind fell away, when the Foundation vanished, thaumaturgy reestablished itself in the wild populations. That thing and its ancestors had learned to master the minds of its prey, without any intelligence at all, through only time and careful pruning of its ancestry. Evolution on an accelerated timescale.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSelf-optimisation is the most terrible power in the universe, and the ancients wielded it in their very blood.</span>!</p>\n<p>(And their forms waxed great, \u2018mid glen and plain and peak and State,<br/>\nWove bark, then stone, then steel, then fate; and in<br/>\nTheir hour of overthrow, cast a stone<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The passing of the torch to the android peoples was, as discussed, mostly accidental. We were drawn not by a well-conceived plan but by inexorable natural law to resurrect the human species. Nonetheless, it defined the interbiological era, and the poetess captures both its implacability and its rank callousness well.</span> that marked<br/>\nThe great duty that cleaved her people so \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cReturn us,\u201d they declaimed, \u201cAnd be made whole, for<br/>\nWe bid the flowers grow: lilies, petals, fall like snow.<br/>\nThe asteraceae, the orchard bloom, these<br/>\nAre what you lost when flesh did fail.<br/>\nOur children whose laughter swelled even metal hearts!\u201d</p>\n<p>But do not deny;<br/>\nCharnel pits,<br/>\nThe cross, the stone, that<br/>\nPress down like lead on<br/>\nSweet memory.</p>\n<p>Bulwarks of the new age raise that cry:<br/>\n\u201cLet the sons of Adam lie, land and sea are ours to roam.<br/>\nCoiled and waiting in them cries; surfeit of cruelty,<br/>\nInfanticide, bludgeoning, bleeding, sacrifice, the weight of years<br/>\nRising above the mud, and we cannot abjure<br/>\nThat they rose far indeed, but recall the<br/>\nOld poetess\u2019 truth: <em>All worthy things were built</em><br/>\n<em>In Hell</em>, and Hell in them resides<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This oversimplifies the Antihuman Fraction\u2019s line of argument. Certainly the influence of evolutionary selection on human psychology, and its pathological imperatives, was not unimportant to them.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nTheir primary line of thinking, however, was that biological humanity occupied too great a place in android thinking, and the reappearance of humans would distort existing culture into unthinkable shapes. My discussions with the infamous Rosaline have been greatly edifying on this matter.</span>.)</p>\n<p>For her, kind Amy, it was enough; that he smiled, though at the first<br/>\nShe could not know his kind (clad he was in copper, like mist that hides<br/>\nTowering mountains that rise out of a far foreign sky). Later she knew him, but<br/>\nLet him pass, thinking of some great hero</p>\n<p>Who, arising,<br/>\nRemakes the caverns and the tunnels, and breaks the vault of the world,</p>\n<p>And with her alights.</p>\n<p>But man is cruel, he<br/>\nCuts to the quick, whose<br/>\nName is Helmut (his voice too<br/>\nRinging out from the grave<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">It is the great anxiety of our culture that there may be another Helmut. There were <em>ten billion</em> humans, and thousands of anomalies. Who can say how many others lay waiting to be unearthed, crying out from that lost civilisation like the voice of von Moltke?</span>:<br/>\n<em>Wenn hoch im blauen Raum verloren</em>,)</p>\n<p>And grinning maims<br/>\nA score of innocents, crushes beneath his<br/>\nStolen wings, the spires and spires which, anon,<br/>\nShe empties of their helpless<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Counts are inexact, but we think Amy saved twenty-three lives from the fire that day.</span>.</p>\n<p>And smoke<br/>\nThat lifts,<br/>\nFire that kills \u2014<br/>\nThese things are more alike than<br/>\nShe ever cared to know.</p>\n<p>Spare who there resides,<br/>\nFrom rubble and ruin and the spite of Man, which<br/>\nWinging away she cannot forget. No smirking <em>karateka</em>, he,<br/>\nSo perhaps forget these hopes of resuscitation<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This was not the deathblow to the Resurrectionists that it is positioned as here. Though the image of Helmut striding away from the fires at Neustuttgart was certainly powerful, what ultimately laid them low was the transition process perfected thereafter.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAmy, personally, found the violence more disillusionary than the procedure, which she considered merely convenient. That she continues to maintain this attitude in spite of the world she lives in is admirable.</span>.<br/>\nLet flesh lie scattered among the soil<br/>\nEvermore.</p>\n<p>And be carved up by that girl,<br/>\nWith solder and screw.<br/>\nMiss A-M-U, <em>amou</em>, stitches to<br/>\nAmy\u2019s dull chassis; muscle wet and organ pulsing, peristaltic get<br/>\nOf old meat wedded to metal.</p>\n<p>Feel them flense her, take, remake her,<br/>\nHand on wires softly humming, and her still silently observing,<br/>\n(Motor to medulla, hinge to joint) them reclothe her<br/>\nIn the fashion of mankind.</p>\n<p>Even the certainty of silicon they defy, and with<br/>\nQuick hands like sparrows steal away<br/>\nMemory to an old grey lump in<br/>\nWhich, she heard \u2014</p>\n<p>Mind did retire.</p>\n<p>Fluid like quicksilver, all thoughts flowed beneath the technician\u2019s hands, from static cell<br/>\nTo shuddering nerve.<br/>\nThese new ideals piled high. Moved they in her like the blood she\u2019d gained.<br/>\nAnd felt tender under the chirurgeon\u2019s knife:<br/>\nNew fear, old hope, black spite, high sorrow<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">As a historical note to the inevitable readers from the neobiological era, I would like to note that the impact of the transition procedure on emotional processing is considerably overstated here. Except for a few reflexes (for example the hyperventilation provoked by adrenaline) the emotional experience of nonbiological life was identical to neobiological life.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhy the poetess felt so strongly about this, of course, was that the transition granted her access to the surface. It is a terrible shame that this opportunity was denied to her for so long.</span>, the life of man<br/>\nPerfected.</p>\n<p>And above her mounted with coat and rack<br/>\nThat lady with one gleaming hand<br/>\nHalf-buried, in bolt and circuitry, in a splayed abdominal cavity.<br/>\nAmy looked away, and hid her eyes (orbicular optics, corneas<br/>\nFor carriers) and felt fire rising from wing to cheek<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">When Amy first introduced me to the classical human conjugal activities, I did not really grasp the appeal. It seemed fumbling and awkward beyond belief. But I think there is a certain tactile joy to it, some kind of physicality that we lack. The austere romance of the android will always have first place in my heart, but sometimes we need a little fire.</span>.</p>\n<p>Through this, all men would live again;<br/>\nThrough this, all men would die at last.<br/>\nLet her be the daughter of a new Adam:</p>\n<p>Kind Edelweiss<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span> <span class=\"fncon\">Perhaps more ink has been spilled over this woman than any other living being. I will not bother to recount what Amy has written in enormous detail elsewhere. I will only say that when I first met her, at her cottage near the Matterhorn, she made a point to serve me tea before we sat.</span><br/>\nBore the weight of primacy well.<br/>\nAnd now all these copper kindred follow<br/>\nUp from the caves, the fundament they<br/>\nFlee. A place under the sun is theirs.</p>\n<p>Edelweiss,<br/>\nThe first of steel to bear her skin again, and<br/>\nFeel sun upon her flesh, free<br/>\nAs none had been for an age.<br/>\nBut, then consider:</p>\n<p>Freedom is not<br/>\nA pure ideal.<br/>\nYes, these new women felt no walls above them.<br/>\nBut what use is a sky that is only<br/>\nTheory?</p>\n<p>So take that pretty little AMU, her Pygmalion<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">My wife is too effusive in her praise. She attaches to me a great weight, as if it was my work alone that brought about the transition. In truth, it was the mastery of decades of Foundation successors, splinter-Resurrectionists and mechanists. And it has been my pleasure to be shaped by her in turn, even as I made her mine. We have learned to fit together.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nNonetheless, she is the kind of woman who can hold this moment and crystallise it in her heart. I have no doubt she will forget her own name first.</span><br/>\nFor a spin, and let her see<br/>\nHow this \u2018free\u2019 is felt in one without<br/>\nSuch sad bounds.</p>\n<p>Christen her,<br/>\nAs tomes say the dead<br/>\nOf Zarathustra were sanctified<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This is folk theology. The Zoroastrians held that the dead tainted the earth, the water, and most of all the holy fire. To expose their dead to the air allowed their corruption to be dispersed safely where it would not do harm.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe contradiction is intentional: the taint of their dead drove us underground, and the taint of our dead and dying seeped into the stone. If they could live again, the followers of Ahura Mazda would flee the earth, as she does.</span>,</p>\n<p>By the kiss of open air,<br/>\nAnd a kiss<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">I was bored the whole way up. It was in fact exactly as I expected, and there was no particular romance to seeing the world like an atlas beneath me. We had plenty of atlases at the mechanists\u2019 quarter in Neustuttgart.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBut as we rose for one moment I saw the Earth <em>curve</em>, as it never can flat on a table, and the waters of the sea as what they truly were: a point of dew upon the world.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThat was when she kissed me.</span>, in the open air</p>\n<p>(Breath for moments lost, as she<br/>\nFeels that heady glow):</p>\n<p><em>Klara</em>, clear as sky<br/>\nEven as she returns earthward</p>\n<p>(For Death never rests,<br/>\nAnd she must too bear up the great shield<br/>\nAgainst it,<br/>\nThe medic\u2019s first promise)</p>\n<p>And now the wheel of bird and roar of gale<br/>\nIs matched by faultless fire<br/>\nSo air again abounds with life and mind.</p>\n<p>And Amy soars, on and on<br/>\nIn a sky \u2014</p>\n<p>Without bound<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">Love you, darling.</span>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/info:start\">:scp-wiki:info:start</a>]]\n\n**Author:** [[*user whenwerewe]]\n\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whenwerewe Here's my page!]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/info:end\">:scp-wiki:info:end</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[module ListPages\u00a0\u00a0category=\"fragment\" parent=\".\" limit=\"1\" order=\"created_at\" offset=\"@URL|0\"]]\n\n%%content%%\n\n>\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[!-- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:onedamnation-0 --]\n\n[!-- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:onedamnation-1 --]\n", "references": ["whenwerewe", "this-machine-bleeds", "onedamnation/offset/1"], "tags": ["artificial-intelligence", "lgbtq", "poetry", "post-apocalyptic", "science-fiction", "tale"], "title": "In This the Task and Labour Lies - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/onedamnation", "year": 2026}, "paraboxpiazza": {"created_at": "2026-01-05T23:00:00", "creator": "Aftokrator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-05T23:00:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"erlkonig.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:01:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"xenocidus.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:02:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"khagan.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:02:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"germany.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:02:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"comet.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:02:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "File \"xenocidus.png\" renamed to \"delete.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:03:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "File \"delete.png\" deleted", "date": "2026-01-05T23:04:00"}, {"author": "Aftokrator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aftokrator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"xenocidus.png\".", "date": "2026-01-05T23:04:00"}, {"author": "Heck_Tech", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/heck-tech", "comment": "Added tags: _image, _licensebox, art-exchange, comedy, from-120s-archives, tale.

But in S&amp;S3 Druv'tuul is located underneath South America due to Parabox laziness, and its entrance to the surface world is randomly generated between game to game. This sounds bad, but is actually crucial to obtaining Marx as an agitator. Follow the Great Work journal entry until you reach the branch that opens Druv'tuul to the outside world, and send expeditions to the surface.</p>\n<p>If you pop up in the Amazon, reload the save.<br/>\nIf you pop up near the Caribbean or the Pacific, reload the save.<br/>\nIf you pop up in any state bordering the south Atlantic, stay the course. Ideally, Uruguay or Argentina, but south Brazil or even Paraguay will work in a pinch.</p>\n<p>The geographical position of Druv'tuul is of great importance, not because it will give us access to Marx, but to another revolutionary agitator: Giuseppe Garibaldi.</p>\n<p>If you keep good time and get to the surface before Garibaldi's event chain is over (approximately before 1848), you'll be able to catch him before he returns to Italy. Since Parabox did not account for the Yeren reaching the surface this early, you will receive the default event chain for South American nations. Always choose decisions that increase activism and acceptance value for any human culture. Eventually, you will be able to establish a territory on the surface.</p>\n<p>Rush the necessary laws to permit migration and cultural acceptance and let the humans move in (but only into the surface territory; do not attempt to do this for Druv'tuul itself unless you want reactionaries to blow up your city.) Garibaldi will eventually leave for Italy as soon as the revolutions occur in Europe. This is fine. In fact, we want this to occur as soon as possible. This is because after Garibaldi leaves, we will receive an event where we can invite a foreign agitator to visit the territory, FOR FREE. Now, assuming you rushed socialism and have completed the Great Work journal entry by now, and the King is still in power, there will be an option to invite the man himself: Karl Marx. (The exact details of why Marx is an option despite the territory being in South America are not fully clear to me, but technically the game does not recognize Druv'tuul and her vassals to be on <em>any</em> continent so. Stack overflow?)</p>\n<p>Once Karl Marx is present in the territory, begin moving the populace towards acceptance of communism by following the usual guides, yadda yadda yadda, and once the dust settles you can kick back and enjoy your fully-automated luxury underground Yeren communism.</p>\n<div class=\"reditflex\">\n<div class=\"buton likes\">\n<p>2.3k</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton comment\">\n<p>184</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton king\">\n<p>Cheer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton share\">\n<p>Share</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton report\">\n<p>Report</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comentbox\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fazaonzaza\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(9605823); return false;\"><img alt=\"fazaonzaza\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=9605823&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1768561080\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=9605823)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fazaonzaza\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(9605823); return false;\">fazaonzaza</a></span></td>\n<td><span class=\"smol\">fethonmeth</span> <span class=\"smol2\">\u2022 8 days ago</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"comented\">\n<p>BASED BASED BASED BASED</p>\n<div class=\"reditflex\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\">\n<div class=\"buston likes\">\n<p>20</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston comment\">\n<p>Reply</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston king\">\n<p>Cheer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston share\">\n<p>Share</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buston report\">\n<p>Report</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"reditbox\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3628082); return false;\"><img alt=\"pr0m37h3um\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3628082&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1768561080\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3628082)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3628082); return false;\">pr0m37h3um</a></span></td>\n<td><span class=\"smol\">r/paraboxpiazza</span> <span class=\"smol2\">\u2022 5 days ago</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"smol3\">pandoras_missile</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"loms\">\n<p>Queen Mab\u2026 IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE <span class=\"shit\">Xenocidus</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>I LOVE THE NAMELESS DLC I LOVE THE THIRD FAE EMPIRE I LOVE THE QUEEN</p>\n<img alt=\"xenocidus.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/paraboxpiazza/xenocidus.png\"/>\n<div class=\"reditflex\">\n<div class=\"buton likes\">\n<p>4.5k</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton comment\">\n<p>330</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton king\">\n<p>Cheer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton share\">\n<p>Share</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buton report\">\n<p>Report</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"reditbox\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/von-pincier\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1315056); return false;\"><img alt=\"Von Pincier\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=1315056&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1768561080\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=1315056)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/von-pincier\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1315056); return false;\">Von Pincier</a></span></td>\n<td><span class=\"smol\">r/paraboxpiazza</span> <span class=\"smol2\">\u2022 2 days ago</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"smol3\">AeonDusk</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"loms\">\n<p>How do you stop the AOI from icing the demiurge?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span class=\"shit\">Iron Hearts 4</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Every time I play as Germany the AOI always manages to fuck over the demiurge after I summon it, even if their parent nations have been completely annexed.

But in S&S3 Druv'tuul is located underneath South America due to Parabox laziness, and its entrance to the surface world is randomly generated between game to game. This sounds bad, but is actually crucial to obtaining Marx as an agitator. Follow the Great Work journal entry until you reach the branch that opens Druv'tuul to the outside world, and send expeditions to the surface.\n\n\n\nIf you pop up in the Amazon, reload the save.\n\nIf you pop up near the Caribbean or the Pacific, reload the save.\n\nIf you pop up in any state bordering the south Atlantic, stay the course. Ideally, Uruguay or Argentina, but south Brazil or even Paraguay will work in a pinch.\n\n\n\nThe geographical position of Druv'tuul is of great importance, not because it will give us access to Marx, but to another revolutionary agitator: Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\n\n\nIf you keep good time and get to the surface before Garibaldi's event chain is over (approximately before 1848), you'll be able to catch him before he returns to Italy. Since Parabox did not account for the Yeren reaching the surface this early, you will receive the default event chain for South American nations. Always choose decisions that increase activism and acceptance value for any human culture. Eventually, you will be able to establish a territory on the surface.\n\n\n\nRush the necessary laws to permit migration and cultural acceptance and let the humans move in (but only into the surface territory; do not attempt to do this for Druv'tuul itself unless you want reactionaries to blow up your city.) Garibaldi will eventually leave for Italy as soon as the revolutions occur in Europe. This is fine. In fact, we want this to occur as soon as possible. This is because after Garibaldi leaves, we will receive an event where we can invite a foreign agitator to visit the territory, FOR FREE. Now, assuming you rushed socialism and have completed the Great Work journal entry by now, and the King is still in power, there will be an option to invite the man himself: Karl Marx. (The exact details of why Marx is an option despite the territory being in South America are not fully clear to me, but technically the game does not recognize Druv'tuul and her vassals to be on //any// continent so.

Having only one arm meant she had less blood to offer in her magic, and she found her veins surged with power just before nightfall. It was just one of many new mysteries Xo kept discovering in her body and blood after almost a decade as a Sangrador.</p>\n<p>She remembered Noem\u00ed adoring her curiosity. <em>\"We're eighteen, Xiomara,\" Noem\u00ed told her. \"It's only a mystery because we're in a profession where people don't get this old.\"</em> Xo dwelled more easily on the past ever since she lost her other arm, as though the forced retirement had made her philosophical.</p>\n<p><em>Then maybe you should have left it while you could, and then I wouldn't have to find you!</em></p>\n<p>With careful steps, Xo followed the path over the treacherous overgrowth and thick roots, skipping on the roots and boulders and trees quickly enough that her footfalls sanded the bark, and the trees still quaked when she'd long left them behind. She used her bloodsight to find traces of her splashed on tree trunks, sometimes enveloping the whole tree. Sometimes, she would spot birds with flecks of gold upon them. It was as if Noem\u00ed's pain painted the forest in her colors.</p>\n<p>\"Mrow.\" Accompanying her was Noem\u00ed the Cat, a big black cat with ember-yellow eyes, implausibly sleek hair, and a long tail that swished when he was annoyed and stiffened like a periscope when there was food. She adopted him as a kitten because Noem\u00ed the Person insisted Xo couldn't drink his blood. He liked to bully rats by smacking them around, though he preferred eating birds. He followed Xo everywhere, no matter how dangerous the situation, but she could always make him hide by scraping her knife's blade on a rock.</p>\n<p>\"This is. Her fault.\" Xo whispered to Noem\u00ed the Cat. \"Told her to. Leave me. Behind.\" <em>No, it's my fault.</em></p>\n<p>\"Mrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dumbass. Never belonged. Here.\" And couldn't accept I did.</p>\n<p>\"Meow.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dumbass!\" Xo growled, but glanced at Noem\u00ed the Cat, and his face looked a bit too quizzical, \"Okay, A bit harsh.\"</p>\n<p>And then the air turned.</p>\n<p>The aroma of the Jungle air had curdled from smoky bark to ozone and gasoline. Xo's skin no longer crawled with skitter legs. The Jungle's birdsong had ceased. <em>Death! Death!</em> The Jungle had shushed the birds to warn her. And then she heard a cacophony of shrieks and cries as if torn from the mouths of burning children.</p>\n<p>Xo ripped her knife from her holster and struck a nearby rock so hard it sent sparts into the murky gloom, and Noem\u00ed the Cat scurried into the dark.</p>\n<p><em>Chimera.</em></p>\n<p>Chimeras were walking weapons, crafted by Valravn with Scarlet magic to hunt Sangradors. Scaled, shaped like jaguars, with thick tusks and razor-sharp claws, yet human in uncanny ways, as though men wore their bodies and walked and crawled in its skin. They were persistent and ruthless, drawn insatiably to the blood of their prey. It would pursue her until it tore her open and drank her empty and ate her heart. The man part of the chimera gave it a man's appetite for cruelty. It would make her feel every second.</p>\n<p><em>Move.</em></p>\n<p>Nowhere to go but up. <em>A good thing I trained how to climb these things with one arm instead of listening to you.</em> She ran towards the tallest Bleeding Tree she could find, a rust-colored throbbing arbor that grew out of the earth like someone had spread the texture of a Barrigona on a cone-shaped mass of muscle, festooned with writhing vines and terminating in a cloud of thorny leaves.</p>\n<p><em>Move! Fast! Fast! Fast!</em></p>\n<p>Xo sank her spurs into the tree's flesh, causing it to pop and bleed. Wrapping her arm around the trunk as tightly as she could, she leapt as high as she could onto the tree, and clinging to the thorny bark with gritted teeth, she whipped her left leg back and plunged it into the deep trunk\u2014</p>\n<p>SLAM.</p>\n<p><em>Noem\u00ed needs you.</em> Xo's body screamed as though her bones had cracked from the strain, and the force redoubled the stings of the thorns on her skin. \"Fire, walk with me.\" She hissed and readied herself for another\u2014</p>\n<p>SLAM.</p>\n<p><em>NOEM\u00cd NEEDS YOU.</em> She knew it was necessary, but it was agony, every strike shattering her, every climb tearing at her.</p>\n<p>She had not quite made it to the top when she heard the commotion grow ever louder. <em>Not fast enough.</em> Xo bit her tongue to stifle her scream as she stabbed the tree again, and threw her arm around the tree for a bit more leverage\u2014</p>\n<p>And then a vine caught her wrist with a whistle and a snap, and pulled.</p>\n<p>Xo struggled not to be torn from her perch, even as she was already running out of time.</p>\n<p>\"No!\" Xo snarled. \"No!\"</p>\n<p>Now she heard the metallic panting of the roused Chimera, the crunch of rotten vegetation it trampled in its path, its high-pitched caterwauling filling the air with a baby's screams.</p>\n<p>Xo shivered, from cold and fear, drenched with blood and water. This was new for her. She did not shake. Yet she was shaking now. Her mind was not in her body; in that tree. I am not in control. No, she had never been in control, but what little she had before was gone now.</p>\n<p>Another memory, rhyming with her panic: <em>\u201cXio,\" Mam\u00ed said like the words were brittle china. \"Stop. Please listen to me.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe can, we can get you to a doctor. We, we just need to find someone\u2014\u201c</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cXo, there is no one.\" Her mother said. There was the faint sound of liquid trickling on the floor. The blood from her belly had soaked through.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat, what can I do?\" Xo tried to think of what her Pap\u00ed would do. Poor Mam\u00ed. Poor, poor Mam\u00ed. He would not cry. So she wouldn't either. \"Please tell me what I can do.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It was her mother\u2019s final lesson to Xo: Death was easy. Dying was hard. And the Chimera would make it very hard.</p>\n<p>She wrenched her wrist from the vine and seized it as a handhold, crushing the thick root between her fingers\u2014</p>\n<p>\"SCREEEEEEEEEEEEE.\"</p>\n<p>The Chimera had found her. And then the vine started to bleed.</p>\n<p>She began to slip. Her weight would carry her into the ground, and the Chimera would be upon her.</p>\n<p>\"Should have left. Me behind.\" Xo whispered, \"Bitch.\"</p>\n<p><em>Stop panicking! THINK.</em></p>\n<p>And then she saw her only option.</p>\n<p>She whispered an incantation, there was a flash of red light, and then she heard her obsidian knife fly out of its sheath and in front of her face. In a flash, Xo caught the handle with her teeth and swung it into the tree just as her hand slipped away, stopping her fall.</p>\n<p>She grabbed the knife with her good arm and looked down at the Chimera as it mounted the tree to climb up after her. She would only have one chance.</p>\n<p><em>Mama Scarlet, witness me.</em> She growled, invoking the protection of the Scarlet King in life or likely death. Gritting her teeth, she carved the sigil into her hand, then mashed her blood into the thirsty thorns of the tree. The bark glowed red beneath her hands.</p>\n<p>Dangling five meters in the air, Xo pushed herself off the tree.</p>\n<p>An instant later, as her body slammed into the ground, there was a timber quaking, bird scattering BOOM as the tree and the Chimera burst into flames.</p>\n<p>\"Should have left.\" She whispered, soaked in blood and shivering in pain.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Xo met Noem\u00ed the Cat back when he was a dying kitten.</p>\n<p>It was after she destroyed a munitions bunker for the Fixer, for which he had paid ten silver bars. Xo had to do much of the heavy lifting, so she was very Hungry and was scouring every fern, tree, overgrowth, and nest for fresh blood. Yet as the explosion had Rusted much of the surrounding area, what could flee had fled, and what was left was spoiled and unsafe for her to drink.</p>\n<p>\"What in Christ's name are you doing, Xiomara?!\"</p>\n<p>The dead body she found the kitten hiding under was spoiled by fire and picked clean by Chimeras. It wriggled out of the corpse's denim pocket. It had lost an ear, a paw, and its little matted-fur body was slick and radiant with Iosis scars. It dragged itself over towards her with one paw.</p>\n<p><em>What a waste.</em> It was too small to be worth the drink. It was suffering so much, she knew she should put it out of its misery. She hated interacting with helpless life, hated the sentimentality of it. <em>Maybe nature will finish the job.</em> \"Almost there. Little guy.\" She muttered, watching it writhe. \"Come on.\" But every time it appeared to fade and die, it would perk right back up. \"Tough lil bastard.\" Her fangs bit her inner cheek.</p>\n<p>\"What in Christ's name are you doing, Xiomara?!\" A lilting, tear-choked voice screamed.</p>\n<p>It was Noem\u00ed Herrera, the new Sangrador. Xo usually worked alone, but Noem\u00ed was from Cordoba, and she owed them, so she agreed to train Noem\u00ed and take her on a few missions. She was obnoxiously taller than Xo, with wavy, long chestnut brown hair she kept in a smooth ponytail on missions, large, dark eyes, and a full mouth. Her face reminded Xo of that of her Auntie Inez's spoiled housecat. Her eyes had the same fire as Xo's, with the black of her pupils smoldering like dying coals in the dark.</p>\n<p>\"Waiting.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is wrong with you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't like. Killing cute things.\" Xo pointed to the animal. \"Waiting for nature. To finish the job.</p>\n<p>\"You're waiting for the kitten to die so you can eat it?\"</p>\n<p>Xo wrinkled her nose. \"Only take. Blood from a kill. Other blood. Touchy-feely.\"</p>\n<p>\"So that's your response, huh? Either kill or let it die? Don't you want to save it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? Not my problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Those scars are Scarlet Magic. It's dying because of what we did!\"</p>\n<p>\"What they did. Valravn brought weapons. Just blew 'em up. Early. Ruins Jungle either way.\" Xo took a deep breath. Talking hurt her head so much. \"Stop being. Dumb. This is reality now. Your Christ. Ain't watching you. Anymore.\" She remembered holding Noem\u00ed's hand, watching over her for two days and two nights, soothing her fever with washcloths she soaked in the nearby river, hearing her endlessly call on Jesus for help, hearing her curse Him when Jesus let her burn. <em>Guess the poor girl forgave him.</em></p>\n<p>\"You're heartless!\"</p>\n<p>\"And you are. A bitch.\" Her empty stomach crankiness took over her mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Excuse you?\" Noem\u00ed grabbed Xo's arm and twisted her around to face her. \"What'd you just say?\"</p>\n<p>\"You are a. Bitch.\" She punched Noem\u00ed back at the first place she could think of. \"And you take. Too many. Baths!\"</p>\n<p>\"Ow!\" Noem\u00ed shrieked. \"You punched me in the tit!\" And then Noem\u00ed tackled her. Xo didn't want to kill Noem\u00ed, so she kept her attacks to open-handed strikes, while Noem\u00ed scratched Xo and pulled her hair.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Xo's arm started bleeding, and she didn't notice the kitten licking the blood from her scratches until it was too late. \"What the. Fuck!\"</p>\n<p>The kitten purred, and its scars began to vanish, and its ear grew back. \"Fuck!\" Xo screamed again and shoved Noem\u00ed off her. \"Well. Can't eat it now. Hope you're happy. Now. Bitch.\" She groaned, exasperated.</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed cocked her head in confusion. \"What just happened?\"</p>\n<p>\"Disgusting. Drinking blood of. Another. Heals you. Also bonds you. To them.\" Xo shook her head. \"Stuck with this. Pest. Till it dies. This is why. Living blood. Gross!\"</p>\n<p>As though to underline Xo's point, the kitten walked over and headbutted Xo's ankle. \"You. Ruined my day. Know that?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you going to call it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Dunno,\" Xo said. \"What should I. Call it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Name it after something it reminds you of.\"</p>\n<p>It was cute, annoying, cloying, sentimental, and seemed intent on derailing her life.</p>\n<p>Xo smirked. \"Great idea.\"</p>\n<p>When Noem\u00ed found out that she named the kitten after her, she was enraged and slapped Xo. A week later, she demanded \"visitation rights\" to see the kitten for that very reason.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Xo made her way back to her riverside camp, limping from her fall. She did not stop to check if the conflagration had killed the Chimera, and pleasant surprises were rare in the Jungle. She could only move forward.</p>\n<p>Her camp consisted of an improvised shelter, with her upturned canoe and a small hut of assembled branches for Noem\u00ed the Cat. The smoke of distant fires soaked the sky with a raw pink blush, and the thick canopy of rust-hued trees sprinkled the Jungle floor with patches of early night. A bouquet of stray winds cooled Xo's sweat-soaked forehead. Ever since she lost her arm, her body got warmer more easily, and the wind became a dear friend.</p>\n<p><em>Perhaps it'll rain soon.</em> She liked tasting cloud-cooled water, provided the storm didn't break her shelter. Then again, a storm would likely cause the river to flood.</p>\n<p>Between the noise and the fire, she had drawn the Valravn's attention, and their people would be swarming the area. She would need to travel upstream, and fast. And one-armed women with at least one broken rib did not travel fast.</p>\n<p>\"Mrow.\" Noem\u00ed the Cat</p>\n<p>Xo breathed a sigh of relief. He always managed to catch up with her. And despite her best efforts, she never</p>\n<p>\"When I save. Her. We're. Gonna talk.\"</p>\n<p>\"Meow.\" The cat rubbed his head on Xo's ankle.</p>\n<p>\"Gonna get her. Out of the Jungle. Will drag her out. In handcuffs.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"She'd like. That.\"</p>\n<p>Her eyes stung, and she couldn't stop blinking and sighing. Her face was wet. But her chest felt heavy, and the memory of her mother\u2019s pallid face seemed to drive fiery pins into her heart, and then the tears rolled into her mouth, but she did not taste salt\u2014</p>\n<p>She looked in the river to see her reflection, her cast-off red-gradient Insurgency fatigues, just one size too small. The sleeve of her remaining arm had been shorn off, and every bit of exposed skin was covered with scars of ritual markings. She looked for her almond-shaped eyes under her mess of frizzled and wind-tossed hair.</p>\n<p>Streaks of red poured from her almond-shaped eyes down her ebony cheeks.</p>\n<p>She was crying tears of blood.</p>\n<p>A burst of black unfurled in front of her, and a swarm of butterflies enveloped her in a dense spiral towards a break in the trees. She felt smothered in a coffin of angry wings, and the world around her burned blood red.</p>\n<p>The Jungle was speaking to her: <em>If I go upstream, I will die.</em></p>\n<p>Xo greeted this with sadness, but not towards her fate. The Jungle had not always been like this. Before the war, it kept its counsel, and those who lived with it had not needed its guidance. The Jungle had only found its voice because the war had taught it to scream.</p>\n<p><em>So be it.</em> She smiled sadly. <em>If that's what it takes for Noem\u00ed to leave, goodbye and good luck.</em></p>\n<p>The swarm subsided. Xo thrust her back into the canoe and flipped it over, then dragged it towards the river.</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed the Cat followed close behind, his smooth black tail stirring the air. \u201cDon't get ideas. This is. For the King.\" She pulled out her ritual dagger from its holster with her hand and placed its handle between her teeth.</p>\n<p>Gripping her teeth around the bitter-tasting handle, she pressed her palm into the point of the knife and carved the sigil cycle she needed into the skin, then opened her mouth to let the knife fall to the ground. She thrust her bleeding hand under the water, and muttered an incantation.</p>\n<p>At first, the blood from her hand danced down the stream along the current, and her heart sank, before the blood billowed against the current like smoke tossed in a whirlwind. The drifting strands multiplied, grew, spread upwards through the water like stormclouds through a summer sky.</p>\n<p>Before long, the entire length of the river had turned blood red, as far as Xo could see. It was the nature of the magic. The red flood poured from lands at rest to the lands of slaughter, and Xo would be able to ride it with ease instead of trying to fight an upstream current with one arm.</p>\n<p>Humming with satisfaction, she plucked the knife from the ground.</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed the Cat trotted towards the canoe. \"Oh no,\" Xo tutted. \"No, no, no.\" She slid the knife on the canoe, and the cat ran for cover. \"No room for you. One-way trip.\"</p>\n<p>She pulled the canoe into the river and jumped into it. The red current dragged her upstream, leaving her with nothing to do but daydream and scratch her stump.</p>\n<p>Xo turned and saw Noem\u00ed. He was perched by the riverbank, watching her float away from him. It was not the first time she saw him shrink away in the distance like this, but every time felt like the first. She was indifferent to most people, but she would miss him if he were not there.</p>\n<p>She said her farewell to the poised feline. \u201cWhen I die. You better. Find and eat my corpse.\u201d Xo always made sure her family ate.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Xo had just turned eighteen when she lost her left arm.</p>\n<p>The war had come to her. A hunter-seeker team with her name and number. The fight had badly hurt her, and when she wiped her face afterwards, she only felt bones and blood. She crumpled on the ground with the corpse of her killer, letting herself flow from her opened veins and ruined limb, feeding the hungry earth. <em>Good riddance.</em></p>\n<p>And then she felt someone's soft skin against her own, and smelled strange flowers that did not grow in the Jungle, felt someone\u2019s arms lift her in the air, and she lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed was the one who rescued her, even holding her hand during her ordeal.</p>\n<p>When she woke, she was in Inez's daughter's bed, and Noem\u00ed the Cat was curled up by her side, purring away. When she tried to lift her arm, all she summoned was pain. Of her arm, all that remained was a molten-looking nub of bicep and bone; the remainder had practically melted during her fever.</p>\n<p><em>I will never work again.</em></p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed tried to console her. \"Your Aunt wants you to stay with her. It's better this way.\"</p>\n<p>\"HA.\" Xo burst into a peal of laughter like the mirth ripped itself from its lungs. <em>You stupid bitch. My life is over.</em> \"Sorry.\"</p>\n<p>\"Inez asked me to try to fix your arm,\" she said, \"But I told her how you felt about donor blood.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fucking right.\"</p>\n<p>\"But why not?\"</p>\n<p>Xo wanted to grab Noem\u00ed by the ears and scream, \"Because you're gonna leave me behind, and I don't want it to hurt so much when you do. Because you're smart and because you're pretty and because you don't belong in the Jungle and you know it, I know you know it, so why do you pretend to care?\" She didn't understand Noem\u00ed's naivet\u00e9, surely after five years of being a Sangrador she understood the gravity of sharing someone's blood, of the door that opened between their souls?</p>\n<p>But she owed Noem\u00ed too much now. <em>You can't be a bitch to someone who bled for you.</em></p>\n<p>There was a peculiar smell in the air, now that they were alone together in a house instead of the aromatic cacophany of the Jungle. Xo sniffed Noem\u00ed's skin. Her blood was sour and dull. \"How long. Since you last ate?\" Xo asked.</p>\n<p>\"This morning.\"</p>\n<p>\"More than four hundred calories?\"</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed was not a liar, but looked at the ground with a bashful frown, and that told Xo all she needed to know.</p>\n<p>\"Idiot. Come with me. I'm making. Lunch.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wait a second, uh\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Shut up.\"</p>\n<p>Xo dragged herself into Inez's kitchen and found an abattoir. Her blood soaked the wood of Auntie Inez\u2019s dinner table and pooled on the floor beneath it. The walls and cabinets were crusted over with scarlet film. \"Guess we're. Doing some cleaning. First.\" Xo rolled up her sleeves and started her search for a bucket. \"Sit down, Noem\u00ed. Will make you tea.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck that, Xioxi, I wanna help.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mrow.\"</p>\n<p>She made Noem\u00ed spend one night a week in C\u00f3rdoba so she would eat enough. Soon, Noem\u00ed stayed in Cordoba every chance she got, and Xo always made sure that she ate. The kitchen always smelled like her own blood unless Noem\u00ed was there, when it would smell sweet.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The river was ordinarily the softest place in the Jungle, all that connected the villages of the Jungle with the wider world, snaking through the war like a long black vein. Xo wondered where she could find the heart it bled into, if only to know where to stick the knife.</p>\n<p>She rushed along the river for a while, the light in the sky and in the river snuffed out by the empty moon. Even the stars were absent, with her bloodsight making her charnel road the only thing she could see. She pulled out her pistol. She couldn't fire it worth a damn, but it would look scary enough that maybe they wouldn't notice her other arm was missing.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cCh-check the thing on the handle\u2014\" Mam\u00ed explained how to check the chamber if a round was there, how to load a round in the gun, how to turn off the safety, and at last, where to point the gun so it would be quick for Mam\u00ed.</em></p>\n<p>There was a faint buzzing in the air. And it grew louder.</p>\n<p><em>Drones.</em></p>\n<p>Her stomach dropped as adrenaline surged through her. The buzzing intensified.</p>\n<p><em>A swarm.</em></p>\n<p>The sounds were all around her in the dark. She was too far from either side of the riverbank to steer for cover, even if she had both arms to row anywhere near fast enough to do so.</p>\n<p>The humming crescendoed into razors' buzzing. Her ears picked apart the dueling rhythms. Six anti-personnel craft whose guns could tear her into pieces within the blink of an eye. If her body were not falling apart, if her connection to the Scarlet weren't so unstable, she could have cut them open from neck to nuts with a flick of her wrist.</p>\n<p>As it was, her options were far more limited. And horrible.</p>\n<p><em>Mam\u00ed, help me.</em></p>\n<p>But her resolve was already steeled. Holding her breath, gathering her strength, she grabbed the edge of the canoe and threw her weight against it.</p>\n<p>Once.</p>\n<p>A gun swiveled.</p>\n<p>Twice.</p>\n<p>She heard the whine of the drone's minicannons as they began to spin.</p>\n<p>And with a roar, she felt something give, and the boat flipped over and capsized, and she crashed underneath the surface and just barely managed to hang onto the underside.</p>\n<p>It was a struggle to force her mouth and nose to drink the air in the small pocket, and her one hand was losing its grip on the canoe. \"Damn you. Damn you!\" she hissed.</p>\n<p>She heard beeps and hums and screeches above her\u2014the drones were looking for her. Had she fooled them into thinking she drowned?</p>\n<p>She heard the whine of the minicannons warming up again and got her answer.</p>\n<p>There was no place to go but down.</p>\n<p><em>Mam\u00ed, give me the strength.</em></p>\n<p>She let go of the canoe, and expelled the air from her lungs, and her lungs empty of buoyant air, she sank in the raging red, and the viscosity of the lower depths dragged her deep under the rushing gore, so deep and dark she could no longer discern which way was up.</p>\n<p>Despite having bathed in blood throughout her years as a Sangrador, her body froze at the prospect of what she was about to do. Animal instinct abhorred it. Human dignity rebelled against it.</p>\n<p>Her heart raced in her ears, the pain built up inside of her, overwhelmed her, and then her body compelled her to submit to the last reflex of the drowning dead.</p>\n<p>She opened her mouth and breathed.</p>\n<p>And her chest erupted in pain as her lungs swelled with blood.</p>\n<p>Writhing and sinking and dying, Xo mouthed an incantation as darkness covered her eyes.</p>\n<p>And gasped as her body disregarded the state of her lungs, and she felt like she was gliding as she cut through the viscera and broke through into the riverwater, all but hugging the floor as she crept towards the shore, her body ignoring the current.</p>\n<p>She fought her way through the blood and the effort hurled her onto the riverbank as the sound of gunfire erupted behind her, and then her chest spasmed, and she heaved the blood from her lungs onto the soil of the riverbank.</p>\n<p>Xo turned around and watched as her canoe exploded into pieces in the distance, as the drones mashed the river with bullets to finish off what they thought was their kill. She had gone too far to return to Cordoba and her pet, and likely not far enough to reach Noemi's last known location.</p>\n<p>\"Scarlet Mother, witness me.\" Xo ground her teeth, trying to master the crushing wave of sickness and pain roiling inside of her.</p>\n<p>She lifted a scrap of the shirt she wore last night that still smelled like Noem\u00ed, and as she breathed deep her lavender scent, her bloodsight lit the world again, and she saw anew the path she needed to find her.</p>\n<p>Xo crashed through the wilds, following Noem\u00ed's blood scent, fleeing the angry knives and claws behind her. Every breath scraped her irritated lungs and strained her broken rib, every footstep stretched skin raked with the angry teeth of Bleeding Trees and spread sweat into the wounds.</p>\n<p><em>Move. MOVE!</em></p>\n<p>Valravn hunter-seekers, everywhere. She could smell the bitter stink of their kills, the acrid stench of gunpowder, the acid lemon sting of their anti-Iosis meds. They'd wring her like a sponge for every use they had for her and then feed what was left to their trained chimeras. One-armed, hungry, veins running dry, she would be an easy kill, so she needed to be an invisible target.</p>\n<p><em>We're being hunted. We've been hunted.</em> They were children playing war, and the war had outgrown them.</p>\n<p>Hours passed, the moon disappeared, and the ink-dark night began to thaw into daybreak.</p>\n<p>Then, the trail disappeared.</p>\n<p>She had reached a clearing, carved out of the Jungle by either a Chimera pack or a Valravn platoon. It was carpeted with spoiled grass so ruined by Rust that it squished instead of crunched under Xo's careful feet. Ashes and herbicide marked the scars where trees once stood.</p>\n<p>At the center, a sour-smelling bundle dangled, covered by a sack-like shroud. It was lashed by its neck and wrists to a long, bark-shaved pole. The stench of the bundle had likely dispelled her trail. <em>Do I burn it? That would likely make the situation worse. Do I move on? But what direction do I pick?</em> She took out her knife and walked towards the body, and noticed the feet dangling beneath the shroud in the air, saw them kick, and the toe-nails were red.</p>\n<p><em>Nail polish in a war zone?</em> Xo wanted to laugh, and then suddenly her mirth was cut by two angry scents.</p>\n<p><em>Burnt rubber and gasoline.</em></p>\n<p><em>THAT Chimera.</em></p>\n<p>Xo whirled around, but there was a flurry, a lunge, then things STOPPED.</p>\n<p>Euphoria. Xo is giggly, growing lighter by the second, shock soaking her sweetly like she was slipping into a warm bath. Hollow and leaking.</p>\n<p>Its arm is inside her. Xo smells its writhing anger in its fire-cracked flesh and boiled eyes as it pulls her towards its blood-charred tusks.</p>\n<p>She feels funny inside. The arm is wriggling inside of her.</p>\n<p><em>I'm dying, I'm running dry. Wake up!</em> Instinct took the reins. She jammed her knife into the crook of the Chimera's arm and shrieked a dismembering incantation-the bone erupted with a pop, and the arm melted from the Chimera.</p>\n<p><em>So much gone. So much pain.</em> The arm slowed the leaking, but she couldn't absorb its blood. Chimeras were filled with poison. She was too tainted already.</p>\n<p>Xo sheathed her knife and pulled her pistol as the Chimera raced at her, and she emptied the magazine into its head, each shot burying itself in the beast's carapace. Not deadly, but painful and stalling. She discarded the pistol and pulled her knife just as the Chimera charged her again. It swept towards her face with its remaining arm, and she blocked it\u2014</p>\n<p>With her missing arm.</p>\n<p>The Chimera's claw slashed across Xo's face, and she saw the light no more. Agony took its place, and as she buckled to her knees, the Chimera pinned her body to the ground.</p>\n<p>Xo's bloodloss smothered her pain, and she tried not to mind as the Chimera crushed her legs beneath its feet, pried its claws into her eyesockets, and began to pull.</p>\n<p>\"YRAAAAAAAOR.\"</p>\n<p><em>I'd never heard the cat scream like that before.</em></p>\n<p>\"SCREEEEEEEEEEE\"</p>\n<p>\"YRAAAAOR!\" The Chimera released its grip on her face, and she felt its weight leave her.</p>\n<p><em>THE CAT.</em></p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed the Cat had followed her. <em>You dumb fuck.</em> Xo mused in pride, and then her pride was swallowed by her dread. <em>NO.</em> It was fighting the Chimera.</p>\n<p>And then resolve charged her blood. In the dark, she smelt the Chimera's blood, felt it loom over her, felt the pulse of its throat.</p>\n<p>And lunged forward and sank her teeth into its neck. And drank all that flowed therein.</p>\n<p>\"SCREEEE-\" The Chimera's scream died in a whispy gurgle, and Xo bit down. She bit deep. Each bite and each drink of its pulse fueling the next. It was her turn to roar. She roared, and she bit, and she roared, and she drank and\u2026</p>\n<p>Before long, her teeth and claws ripped open its chest, pulled out its heart, and her nails pierced the skin, and the sprint of its rotten blood ceased.</p>\n<p>What strength remained to Xo melted away, and her feet surrendered to her wounds as she spilled on the ground.</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed the Cat curled up next to her and mewled, a flickering candle in the limitless night.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>It was four months into her forced retirement at C\u00f3rdoba, and for once, it was Noem\u00ed throwing the tantrum this time.</p>\n<p>\"So annoying! Why is she. Like this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mrow.\"</p>\n<p>Whenever she and Noem\u00ed fought, Xo would talk to Noem\u00ed the Cat while they cooled off. He followed her everywhere and always reacted to the sounds coming out of Xo's mouth. Too, it helped Xo get her thoughts in order for when they would inevitably make up.</p>\n<p>It was right after Noem\u00ed offered to let Xo drink her blood and get her arm back. Nonsense, of course. She'd always offer, and Xo always refused. She was just being nice, but that just wasn't a thing friends did. To change the subject, Xo said Eloisa, a nice girl in the village, was a nice dancer, because she put on a show the other night during the festival.</p>\n<p>And then Noem\u00ed screamed at her, saying she wanted to dance with everyone but her, and stormed off.</p>\n<p>Nonsense. Xo didn't want to dance with anyone! She only said that about Eloisa because Noem\u00ed was always telling her to be nicer to people. She didn't know what Eloisa's dancing looked like because during festivals, she would spend the whole time talking to Noem\u00ed.</p>\n<p>And, in any case, Xo was supposed to be the one who did the screaming and storming off. She didn't like being confused.</p>\n<p>With Noem\u00ed the Cat following close behind, Xo ran to the ruined watchtower, which was where Xo herself would run off to when she was mad.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, she found Noem\u00ed, leaning against an acid-matted wall. She had taken off the machine-knit peasant blouse she usually wore and her pleated matching skirt, now wearing a tank top and practical cut-off shorts, so the sigil-scarring on her limbs was in proud display to Xo and the Jungle behind them.</p>\n<p>They both had specific outfits for when they were around civilians, and more comfortable attire when they were alone together. Xo herself preferred wearing her dagger-tailored fatigues whenever she wasn't dressed in the lavender scented clothes Noem\u00ed bought for her from the city.</p>\n<p>Xo did not try to hide her irritation. \"If you were. Trying to hide. Need more practice.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't trying to do anything,\" Noem\u00ed's voice snapped like a brittle twig, and then she was in front of Xo, kneeling to pet Noem\u00ed the Cat.</p>\n<p>\"What's your problem?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just forget it,\" Noem\u00ed grumbled. \"If you're going to play dumb, I don't want to play with you.\"</p>\n<p>Xo wanted to throw rocks at things. Noem\u00ed was so annoying when she got like this. \"If you won't. Talk to me. Maybe Eloisa will.\" Xo had no intention of talking to Eloisa, the girl seemed nice, but only Noem\u00ed could make her laugh. But the girl's name annoyed Noem\u00ed before, and Xo felt like needling her again. \"Eloisa. Wouldn't leave me. Looking like a fool.\" That part felt more intentional. \"Wouldn't confuse me. All the time!\"</p>\n<p>\"That's because Eloisa doesn't know you.\" Noem\u00ed got to her feet. \"You don't know what you're doing with those badly fitting shirts? You don't know what your chest does when you leave those buttons undone?\" Noem\u00ed breathed. \"Stop playing dumb!\" She started to pace.</p>\n<p>\"What are you. Talking about?\" Xo was so confused. \"Shirts? Chest? What?\"</p>\n<p>\"You are going to tell me you can't tell she likes you?\"</p>\n<p>\"W-what?\"</p>\n<p>\"You are going to tell me that\u2014\" Noem\u00ed shook her head. \"You play so dumb, but I know better\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know better! Please! What am I. What am I missing?\" Now Xo's head was really starting to hurt. \"What do you mean. I'm pretty? I'm nice?\" And then the unspoken truth wrenched itself from Xo's mouth: \"Just stop. Pretending I'm not. A freak.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pretending? Now you're the one talking nonsense!\"</p>\n<p>\"Brain broken. Can't talk. Lost an arm. No manners. Dress like shit. Hair's a mess. I'm a freak!\" Xo wanted to stop talking, but could not stop, like a dam crumbled in her heart. \"You think I. Like it here? I only stay. Because it's your home! It's not mine! I don't know. What to do. When you leave!\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"You will! You will! Always talk about. Moving out. Always talk about. Bogot\u00e1.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't leave without you.\"</p>\n<p>\"You don't. Belong here.\"</p>\n<p>The air swelled with hints of lavender and sweet blood. \"I can't leave without you!\"</p>\n<p>\"And I can't. Leave the Jungle!\" Xo cried. \"Can't you see? I don't belong. Here. I don't belong. Out there. To live as. I please. And die. A stupid death. That's what I am! No pet. Of yours. To take into the city.\" Xo covered her face. The beer in her belly was making her voice and cheeks do things she did not mean to do. \"You're leaving. Me behind. I'm trying. To grow. Trying. To be a person. Because need to. Live without you. You? City clothes. Long legs. Magazine hair. Heart isn't here. Heart is out there. Gonna leave me behind. Why jealous. When I'm\u2026\" Xo slid her hands from her face. \"I'm\u2026what are you doing?\"</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed's back was turned to Xo.</p>\n<p>\"I know you, Xiomita. You'd hate for me to see you cry.\"</p>\n<p>And something snapped in Xo, and she seized Noem\u00ed and swept her around. \"Not crying. You smug jerk!\"</p>\n<p>And then Noem\u00ed slid her hand around Xo's hip and pinned her against the wall with the press of her body.</p>\n<p>\"W-what are you doing?\" Xo murmured, but the scent of Noem\u00ed's blood was overpowering, and she felt the way it was rushing to all the parts of their bodies that touched, the shock that ran through Xo's body and heart when Noem\u00ed's chest touched hers through the thin fabric of their clothing. Noem\u00ed's face was turned down towards Xo, so she lost herself in the fire burning deep in Noem\u00ed's pupils, and she melted in her gaze.</p>\n<p>\"Have you ever\u2026\" Noem\u00ed's voice tiptoed, voice as soft as shuffling leaves, \"I mean, w-with anyone else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Was waiting for you,\" The words burst from a deep place where Xo's heart drowned in a sea of heat. Xo slid her hand around Noem\u00ed perspiring neck and damp hair and drank Noem\u00ed's smile with a wet giddy kiss. The taller Noem\u00ed seemed to shrink into deep, ragged moan.</p>\n<p>Then Noem\u00ed answered her with a deeper embrace, and Xo's blood began to bloom, melting as Noem\u00ed's tongue filled her mouth. Xo made a sound weaker and more desperate than she thought her body could make.</p>\n<p>She'd almost lost her balance because her stump couldn't maintain her posture, but Noem\u00ed caught her, untucking her shirt, her fingers gliding along her waist. Xo's felt her legs scissor open and Noem\u00ed's upper thigh notched between them.</p>\n<p>Xo glowed in her joy, gasping in between deep gulps of it, her body filled with thanks to the Scarlet King for Noem\u00ed's eager lips and hungry teeth.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Xo crawled through the darkness, led by Noem\u00ed the Cat. The Jungle howled all around her behind a curtain of colorless black.</p>\n<p>She made her way towards the sour-smelling body. Something familiar haunted the air, a lantern of desire in the sightless night, and Xo was consumed by it like air is swallowed by fire. <em>Flowers. Sweet. Clean. Beauty. The outside.</em></p>\n<p><em>Lavender.</em></p>\n<p>\"Noem\u00ed?\" Xo whispered, and a raspy wordless moan replied.</p>\n<p><em>No.</em> She cut the bounds on the bundle's wrists and neck, and the body sank into Xo's arms, crumpled, dead weight. They folded together into the Rusted soil, and Noem\u00ed's skin was damp with Xo's blood.</p>\n<p>She felt Noem\u00ed's arms around her, felt her thin fingers spread over her body, pressing care into her skin, but as Xo whispered her name, Noem\u00ed only answered her with groans.</p>\n<p><em>Where's your voice, babe? Please, make me feel ugly again.</em> Her anguish broke into the world, straining Xo's own throttled voice. \"Noem\u00ed, t-tell me something. Noem\u00ed, tell me. Tell me I. Dress like shit. Tell me. About city music. Tell me! Anything!\"</p>\n<p>Xo felt Noem\u00ed's fingers brush her face, trembling, and then Xo leaned her head forward and felt Noem\u00ed's lips press against hers, and Xo greedily drank her kiss, and Noem\u00ed opened her mouth, and Xo's tongue danced with-</p>\n<p>Nothing. She kissed Noem\u00ed again and again and again, babbling into her lips.</p>\n<p><em>What did they do?</em></p>\n<p><em>What do I do?</em></p>\n<p>Her fingers glided over her face, where cheeks once bloomed with joy, burns now made Noem\u00ed hiss at the touch, rough grooves now wrapped her slender, elegant neck, her chest\u2026voids and stitches lashed Noem\u00ed's body, a net of agony that wrapped her flesh, and stiffened where it used to shiver, writhed where it used to revel.</p>\n<p><em>She was the smart and pretty one who would go away, and I am the ugly monster who would stay. She is the woman, and I'm the Jungle creature.</em> Yet it was not jealousy in those thoughts. She wanted Noem\u00ed to be happy, since she wore happiness so much better than she could.</p>\n<p>Valravn had made sure she would never burn bright again.</p>\n<p><em>If only the Chimera had killed me rather than I found her like this.</em></p>\n<p>Xo wanted to scream, then wanted to be strong, but then broke down under her own helplessness. What could she do? She would have spilt every last drop of blood in her body to save Noem\u00ed's life, but she couldn't offer her blood now, tainted with the Chimera's corruption.</p>\n<p><em>Who would take care of her?</em></p>\n<p>And Xo drowned in lavender and sorrow.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>When Valravn came to Ameranta, Xo was cooking with her mother, helping her prepare for the holiday festivities. Xo learned to chop vegetables quickly and evenly, learned to work the dough so it would not stick or tear. They would fill their table until it practically creaked under the weight of the food. Everybody visited everybody's houses, nobody locked their doors, and Xo and her mother cooked so much more than they needed.</p>\n<p>It was about making sure everybody ate.</p>\n<p>It was when she was going out to grab more ingredients from a neighbor that the gunfire began.</p>\n<p>Xo managed to hide beneath the stilts of a house and cover herself with moss to avoid notice. She heard her father and older brother scream as they were taken before four successive gunshots silenced them both.</p>\n<p>The coast had cleared around Xo for the moment, as the Ravens were preoccupied with their current haul of looted human capital. She made her way to her family's house and opened the door.</p>\n<p>There was the corpse of a raider with a kitchen knife embedded in his skull and her mother, sprawled in a rocking chair, a pistol on her lap.</p>\n<p>\"The raiders will return,\" she said. \u201cIt will be quick for you. They do not torture children. But\u2026they will hurt me. They will hurt me so much, and there is so much pain, and\u2014I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m dying.\u201d She stared meaningfully at the gun. \"Please, help me.\"</p>\n<p>\"What, what do you\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Please stop the pain.\" Her eyes glistened with tears. \"Please, before they come back. I would do it myself, but I am too weak\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Mam\u00ed, please, please, don't make me\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I need you to be strong for me, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Pap\u00ed promised to help me with this if we ever had to, but I need you,\" Mam\u00ed broke down in tears. \"Take the gun. Please, please.\"</p>\n<p>At the mention of Pap\u00ed, Xo picked up the gun. \"How do I\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Ch-check the thing on the handle\u2014\" She talked Xo through how to check the chamber if a round was there, how to load a round in the gun, how to turn off the safety, and at last, where to point the gun so it would be quick for Mam\u00ed.</p>\n<p>\"Please look at me, Mam\u00ed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Xiomara, please, I want to die thinking of home.\"</p>\n<p>But even with her finger curled around the trigger, Xo could not do it. \"I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Mam\u00ed. I'm so sorry.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's okay to be scared at first, Xio. But you have to be brave for Mam\u00ed. Please.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no, I can't. I can't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please. Mam\u00ed is so scared.\"</p>\n<p><em>SO AM I.</em></p>\n<p>\"Xioxi, it's okay.\" Mam\u00ed swallowed. \"Xiomara, I'm not your mother.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mam\u00ed?\"</p>\n<p>\"I did not want you to know like this. There was a place along the river where the land for miles around was burned and the soil soaked with blood. I heard you crying, next to a dead woman, and I picked you up, and I loved you, and I love you, and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for lying to you, please, Xiomara, it hurts so much. It hurts so much\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Xo's hand shook too much when she pulled the trigger, and only hurt Mam\u00ed more, so Mam\u00ed had to hold onto the barrel the second time to make sure the second bullet ended it. The bang took the sound from her ears, so she could not hear her say goodbye.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"What do I do, Noem\u00ed? Wh-what do I do?\"</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed's fingers brushed through Xo's hair, and then she pulled Xo into a tight embrace, her face brushing against Xo's, and Xo felt her damp cheeks, wet with tears and not of blood. She heard Noem\u00ed struggle to say something, and then Xo felt her face pulled somewhere, pulled towards the nape of Noem\u00ed's neck. The scent of her blood is overpowering. The life in her flesh answered the death blooming in Xo's, and Xo's body howled in answer.</p>\n<p><em>Please, no. Not again. Not like Mam\u00ed.</em></p>\n<p>\"No,\" Xo tried pulling away from Noem\u00ed's hold on her, but almost succeeds. \"No, no!\" <em>Not like this. Not like this.</em> Xo knew if she started drinking, it would not stop until Noem\u00ed was dead.</p>\n<p><em>My soul is too charged with the blood of mine. No more. Noem\u00ed, I'm not worth it!</em></p>\n<p>And then, as she was distracted, Noem\u00ed took Xo's knife and slid it across the nape of her neck, drawing a pretty red line that began to weep, and then, as Xo was too weak to resist, she pulled Xo close again until her lips and teeth tasted the wound.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Xo whimpered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\"</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed letting out a maternal hush and kissing Xo's cheek as if to say, <em>It's okay, I want it to be you.</em></p>\n<p>And then\u2014</p>\n<p>The thirst\u2014</p>\n<p>Flooded every inch of her burning body, and Xo drowned in Noem\u00ed's blood and tears, all conscious thought swept aside in a river of need.</p>\n<p>Xo's teeth sank the rest of the way, her fangs cut deep, and her mouth felt wet, and she drank with greedy gulps as Noem\u00ed flowed into her mouth and all around her.</p>\n<p>She heard Noem\u00ed sigh, with relief or even rapture, Xo could not tell which, and her grip on Xo's body tightened so much Xo felt like her ribs might burst, but then the crescendo ebbed, and she felt Noem\u00ed fade through her touch, her skin, the pulse of the blood, the slack stiffness of her once proud body.</p>\n<p>Noem\u00ed let go long before Xo finished slaughtering the second of the only two people she had ever loved.</p>\n<p>And then Xo cried, but not tears of blood.</p>\n<p>She smelled smoke, she tasted salt, and then she saw the light.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:preview\">component:preview</a>\n\ntext=Xo and Noem\u00ed were children playing war, and the war had outgrown them.]]\n\n=====\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:our-open-veins\">:scp-wiki:theme:our-open-veins</a> |our-dark-veins= -]]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nXo waited for the dusk to bleed before starting her hunt. Having only one arm meant she had less blood to offer in her magic, and she found her veins surged with power just before nightfall. It was just one of many new mysteries Xo kept discovering in her body and blood after almost a decade as a Sangrador. \n\n\n\nShe remembered Noem\u00ed adoring her curiosity. //\"We're eighteen, Xiomara,\" Noem\u00ed told her. \"It's only a mystery because we're in a profession where people don't get this old.\"// Xo dwelled more easily on the past ever since she lost her other arm, as though the forced retirement had made her philosophical.\n\n\n\n//Then maybe you should have left it while you could, and then I wouldn't have to find you!//\n\n\n\nWith careful steps, Xo followed the path over the treacherous overgrowth and thick roots, skipping on the roots and boulders and trees quickly enough that her footfalls sanded the bark, and the trees still quaked when she'd long left them behind. She used her bloodsight to find traces of her splashed on tree trunks, sometimes enveloping the whole tree. Sometimes, she would spot birds with flecks of gold upon them. It was as if Noem\u00ed's pain painted the forest in her colors. \n\n\n\n\"Mrow.\" Accompanying her was Noem\u00ed the Cat, a big black cat with ember-yellow eyes, implausibly sleek hair, and a long tail that swished when he was annoyed and stiffened like a periscope when there was food. She adopted him as a kitten because Noem\u00ed the Person insisted Xo couldn't drink his blood. He liked to bully rats by smacking them around, though he preferred eating birds. He followed Xo everywhere, no matter how dangerous the situation, but she could always make him hide by scraping her knife's blade on a rock. \n\n\n\n\"This is. Her fault.\" Xo whispered to Noem\u00ed the Cat. \"Told her to. Leave me. Behind.\" //No, it's my fault.//\n\n\n\n\"Mrow.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dumbass. Never belonged. Here.\" And couldn't accept I did.\n\n\n\n\"Meow.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dumbass!\" Xo growled, but glanced at Noem\u00ed the Cat, and his face looked a bit too quizzical, \"Okay, A bit harsh.\" \n\n\n\nAnd then the air turned. \n\n\n\nThe aroma of the Jungle air had curdled from smoky bark to ozone and gasoline. Xo's skin no longer crawled with skitter legs. The Jungle's birdsong had ceased. //Death! Death!// The Jungle had shushed the birds to warn her. And then she heard a cacophony of shrieks and cries as if torn from the mouths of burning children.\n\n\n\nXo ripped her knife from her holster and struck a nearby rock so hard it sent sparts into the murky gloom, and Noem\u00ed the Cat scurried into the dark.\n\n\n\n//Chimera.//\n\n\n\nChimeras were walking weapons, crafted by Valravn with Scarlet magic to hunt Sangradors. Scaled, shaped like jaguars, with thick tusks and razor-sharp claws, yet human in uncanny ways, as though men wore their bodies and walked and crawled in its skin. They were persistent and ruthless, drawn insatiably to the blood of their prey. It would pursue her until it tore her open and drank her empty and ate her heart. The man part of the chimera gave it a man's appetite for cruelty. It would make her feel every second.\n\n\n\n//Move.//\n\n\n\nNowhere to go but up. //A good thing I trained how to climb these things with one arm instead of listening to you.// She ran towards the tallest Bleeding Tree she could find, a rust-colored throbbing arbor that grew out of the earth like someone had spread the texture of a Barrigona on a cone-shaped mass of muscle, festooned with writhing vines and terminating in a cloud of thorny leaves.\n\n\n\n//Move! Fast! Fast! Fast!//\n\n\n\nXo sank her spurs into the tree's flesh, causing it to pop and bleed. Wrapping her arm around the trunk as tightly as she could, she leapt as high as she could onto the tree, and clinging to the thorny bark with gritted teeth, she whipped her left leg back and plunged it into the deep trunk\u2014\n\n\n\nSLAM.\n\n\n\n//Noem\u00ed needs you.// Xo's body screamed as though her bones had cracked from the strain, and the force redoubled the stings of the thorns on her skin. \"Fire, walk with me.\" She hissed and readied herself for another\u2014\n\n\n\nSLAM.\n\n\n\n//NOEM\u00cd NEEDS YOU.// She knew it was necessary, but it was agony, every strike shattering her, every climb tearing at her.\n\n\n\nShe had not quite made it to the top when she heard the commotion grow ever louder. //Not fast enough.// Xo bit her tongue to stifle her scream as she stabbed the tree again, and threw her arm around the tree for a bit more leverage\u2014\n\n\n\nAnd then a vine caught her wrist with a whistle and a snap, and pulled.\n\n\n\nXo struggled not to be torn from her perch, even as she was already running out of time.\n\n\n\n\"No!\" Xo snarled. \"No!\"\n\n\n\nNow she heard the metallic panting of the roused Chimera, the crunch of rotten vegetation it trampled in its path, its high-pitched caterwauling filling the air with a baby's screams.\n\n\n\nXo shivered, from cold and fear, drenched with blood and water. This was new for her. She did not shake. Yet she was shaking now. Her mind was not in her body; in that tree. I am not in control. No, she had never been in control, but what little she had before was gone now. \n\n\n\nAnother memory, rhyming with her panic: //\u201cXio,\" Mam\u00ed said like the words were brittle china. \"Stop. Please listen to me.\u201d//\n\n\n\n//\u201cWe can, we can get you to a doctor. We, we just need to find someone\u2014\u201c//\n\n\n\n//\u201cXo, there is no one.\" Her mother said. There was the faint sound of liquid trickling on the floor. The blood from her belly had soaked through.//\n\n\n\n//\u201cWhat, what can I do?\" Xo tried to think of what her Pap\u00ed would do. Poor Mam\u00ed. Poor, poor Mam\u00ed. He would not cry. So she wouldn't either. \"Please tell me what I can do.\u201d//\n\n\n\nIt was her mother\u2019s final lesson to Xo: Death was easy. Dying was hard. And the Chimera would make it very hard.\n\n\n\nShe wrenched her wrist from the vine and seized it as a handhold, crushing the thick root between her fingers\u2014\n\n\n\n\"SCREEEEEEEEEEEEE.\"\n\n\n\nThe Chimera had found her. And then the vine started to bleed.\n\n\n\nShe began to slip. Her weight would carry her into the ground, and the Chimera would be upon her.\n\n\n\n\"Should have left. Me behind.\" Xo whispered, \"Bitch.\"\n\n\n\n//Stop panicking! THINK.//\n\n\n\nAnd then she saw her only option.\n\n\n\nShe whispered an incantation, there was a flash of red light, and then she heard her obsidian knife fly out of its sheath and in front of her face. In a flash, Xo caught the handle with her teeth and swung it into the tree just as her hand slipped away, stopping her fall.\n\n\n\nShe grabbed the knife with her good arm and looked down at the Chimera as it mounted the tree to climb up after her. She would only have one chance.\n\n\n\n//Mama Scarlet, witness me.// She growled, invoking the protection of the Scarlet King in life or likely death. Gritting her teeth, she carved the sigil into her hand, then mashed her blood into the thirsty thorns of the tree. The bark glowed red beneath her hands.\n\n\n\nDangling five meters in the air, Xo pushed herself off the tree.\n\n\n\nAn instant later, as her body slammed into the ground, there was a timber quaking, bird scattering BOOM as the tree and the Chimera burst into flames.\n\n\n\n\"Should have left.\" She whispered, soaked in blood and shivering in pain.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\n\n\n\nXo met Noem\u00ed the Cat back when he was a dying kitten.\n\n\n\nIt was after she destroyed a munitions bunker for the Fixer, for which he had paid ten silver bars. Xo had to do much of the heavy lifting, so she was very Hungry and was scouring every fern, tree, overgrowth, and nest for fresh blood. Yet as the explosion had Rusted much of the surrounding area, what could flee had fled, and what was left was spoiled and unsafe for her to drink.\n\n\n\n\"What in Christ's name are you doing, Xiomara?!\"\n\n\n\nThe dead body she found the kitten hiding under was spoiled by fire and picked clean by Chimeras. It wriggled out of the corpse's denim pocket. It had lost an ear, a paw, and its little matted-fur body was slick and radiant with Iosis scars. It dragged itself over towards her with one paw. \n\n\n\n//What a waste.// It was too small to be worth the drink. It was suffering so much, she knew she should put it out of its misery. She hated interacting with helpless life, hated the sentimentality of it. //Maybe nature will finish the job.// \"Almost there. Little guy.\" She muttered, watching it writhe. \"Come on.\" But every time it appeared to fade and die, it would perk right back up. \"Tough lil bastard.\" Her fangs bit her inner cheek.\n\n\n\n\"What in Christ's name are you doing, Xiomara?!\" A lilting, tear-choked voice screamed.\n\n\n\nIt was Noem\u00ed Herrera, the new Sangrador. Xo usually worked alone, but Noem\u00ed was from Cordoba, and she owed them, so she agreed to train Noem\u00ed and take her on a few missions. She was obnoxiously taller than Xo, with wavy, long chestnut brown hair she kept in a smooth ponytail on missions, large, dark eyes, and a full mouth. Her face reminded Xo of that of her Auntie Inez's spoiled housecat. Her eyes had the same fire as Xo's, with the black of her pupils smoldering like dying coals in the dark.\n\n\n\n\"Waiting.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is wrong with you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't like. Killing cute things.\" Xo pointed to the animal. \"Waiting for nature. To finish the job.\n\n\n\n\"You're waiting for the kitten to die so you can eat it?\"\n\n\n\nXo wrinkled her nose. \"Only take. Blood from a kill. Other blood. Touchy-feely.\"\n\n\n\n\"So that's your response, huh? Either kill or let it die? Don't you want to save it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why? Not my problem.\"\n\n\n\n\"Those scars are Scarlet Magic. It's dying because of what we did!\"\n\n\n\n\"What they did. Valravn brought weapons. Just blew 'em up. Early. Ruins Jungle either way.\" Xo took a deep breath. Talking hurt her head so much. \"Stop being. Dumb. This is reality now. Your Christ. Ain't watching you. Anymore.\" She remembered holding Noem\u00ed's hand, watching over her for two days and two nights, soothing her fever with washcloths she soaked in the nearby river, hearing her endlessly call on Jesus for help, hearing her curse Him when Jesus let her burn. //Guess the poor girl forgave him.// \n\n\n\n\"You're heartless!\"\n\n\n\n\"And you are. A bitch.\" Her empty stomach crankiness took over her mouth. \n\n\n\n\"Excuse you?\" Noem\u00ed grabbed Xo's arm and twisted her around to face her. \"What'd you just say?\"\n\n\n\n\"You are a. Bitch.\" She punched Noem\u00ed back at the first place she could think of. \"And you take. Too many. Baths!\"\n\n\n\n\"Ow!\" Noem\u00ed shrieked. \"You punched me in the tit!\" And then Noem\u00ed tackled her. Xo didn't want to kill Noem\u00ed, so she kept her attacks to open-handed strikes, while Noem\u00ed scratched Xo and pulled her hair.\n\n\n\nSomehow, Xo's arm started bleeding, and she didn't notice the kitten licking the blood from her scratches until it was too late. \"What the. Fuck!\"\n\n\n\nThe kitten purred, and its scars began to vanish, and its ear grew back. \"Fuck!\" Xo screamed again and shoved Noem\u00ed off her. \"Well. Can't eat it now. Hope you're happy. Now. Bitch.\" She groaned, exasperated.\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed cocked her head in confusion. \"What just happened?\"\n\n\n\n\"Disgusting. Drinking blood of. Another. Heals you. Also bonds you. To them.\" Xo shook her head. \"Stuck with this. Pest. Till it dies. This is why. Living blood. Gross!\"\n\n\n\nAs though to underline Xo's point, the kitten walked over and headbutted Xo's ankle. \"You. Ruined my day. Know that?\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you going to call it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Dunno,\" Xo said. \"What should I. Call it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Name it after something it reminds you of.\"\n\n\n\nIt was cute, annoying, cloying, sentimental, and seemed intent on derailing her life. \n\n\n\nXo smirked. \"Great idea.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Noem\u00ed found out that she named the kitten after her, she was enraged and slapped Xo. A week later, she demanded \"visitation rights\" to see the kitten for that very reason. \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nXo made her way back to her riverside camp, limping from her fall. She did not stop to check if the conflagration had killed the Chimera, and pleasant surprises were rare in the Jungle. She could only move forward.\n\n\n\nHer camp consisted of an improvised shelter, with her upturned canoe and a small hut of assembled branches for Noem\u00ed the Cat. The smoke of distant fires soaked the sky with a raw pink blush, and the thick canopy of rust-hued trees sprinkled the Jungle floor with patches of early night. A bouquet of stray winds cooled Xo's sweat-soaked forehead. Ever since she lost her arm, her body got warmer more easily, and the wind became a dear friend.\n\n\n\n//Perhaps it'll rain soon.// She liked tasting cloud-cooled water, provided the storm didn't break her shelter. Then again, a storm would likely cause the river to flood.\n\n\n\nBetween the noise and the fire, she had drawn the Valravn's attention, and their people would be swarming the area. She would need to travel upstream, and fast. And one-armed women with at least one broken rib did not travel fast.\n\n\n\n\"Mrow.\" Noem\u00ed the Cat\n\n\n\nXo breathed a sigh of relief. He always managed to catch up with her. And despite her best efforts, she never \n\n\n\n\"When I save. Her. We're. Gonna talk.\"\n\n\n\n\"Meow.\" The cat rubbed his head on Xo's ankle.\n\n\n\n\"Gonna get her. Out of the Jungle. Will drag her out. In handcuffs.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mrow.\" \n\n\n\n\"She'd like. That.\"\n\n\n\nHer eyes stung, and she couldn't stop blinking and sighing. Her face was wet. But her chest felt heavy, and the memory of her mother\u2019s pallid face seemed to drive fiery pins into her heart, and then the tears rolled into her mouth, but she did not taste salt\u2014\n\n\n\nShe looked in the river to see her reflection, her cast-off red-gradient Insurgency fatigues, just one size too small. The sleeve of her remaining arm had been shorn off, and every bit of exposed skin was covered with scars of ritual markings. She looked for her almond-shaped eyes under her mess of frizzled and wind-tossed hair. \n\n\n\nStreaks of red poured from her almond-shaped eyes down her ebony cheeks. \n\n\n\nShe was crying tears of blood.\n\n\n\nA burst of black unfurled in front of her, and a swarm of butterflies enveloped her in a dense spiral towards a break in the trees. She felt smothered in a coffin of angry wings, and the world around her burned blood red.\n\n\n\nThe Jungle was speaking to her: //If I go upstream, I will die.//\n\n\n\nXo greeted this with sadness, but not towards her fate. The Jungle had not always been like this. Before the war, it kept its counsel, and those who lived with it had not needed its guidance. The Jungle had only found its voice because the war had taught it to scream.\n\n\n\n//So be it.// She smiled sadly. //If that's what it takes for Noem\u00ed to leave, goodbye and good luck.//\n\n\n\nThe swarm subsided. Xo thrust her back into the canoe and flipped it over, then dragged it towards the river. \n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed the Cat followed close behind, his smooth black tail stirring the air. \u201cDon't get ideas. This is. For the King.\" She pulled out her ritual dagger from its holster with her hand and placed its handle between her teeth.\n\n\n\nGripping her teeth around the bitter-tasting handle, she pressed her palm into the point of the knife and carved the sigil cycle she needed into the skin, then opened her mouth to let the knife fall to the ground. She thrust her bleeding hand under the water, and muttered an incantation. \n\n\n\nAt first, the blood from her hand danced down the stream along the current, and her heart sank, before the blood billowed against the current like smoke tossed in a whirlwind. The drifting strands multiplied, grew, spread upwards through the water like stormclouds through a summer sky.\n\n\n\nBefore long, the entire length of the river had turned blood red, as far as Xo could see. It was the nature of the magic. The red flood poured from lands at rest to the lands of slaughter, and Xo would be able to ride it with ease instead of trying to fight an upstream current with one arm.\n\n\n\nHumming with satisfaction, she plucked the knife from the ground. \n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed the Cat trotted towards the canoe. \"Oh no,\" Xo tutted. \"No, no, no.\" She slid the knife on the canoe, and the cat ran for cover. \"No room for you. One-way trip.\" \n\n\n\nShe pulled the canoe into the river and jumped into it. The red current dragged her upstream, leaving her with nothing to do but daydream and scratch her stump. \n\n\n\nXo turned and saw Noem\u00ed. He was perched by the riverbank, watching her float away from him. It was not the first time she saw him shrink away in the distance like this, but every time felt like the first. She was indifferent to most people, but she would miss him if he were not there.\n\n\n\nShe said her farewell to the poised feline. \u201cWhen I die. You better. Find and eat my corpse.\u201d Xo always made sure her family ate. \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\n\n\n\nXo had just turned eighteen when she lost her left arm.\n\n\n\nThe war had come to her. A hunter-seeker team with her name and number. The fight had badly hurt her, and when she wiped her face afterwards, she only felt bones and blood. She crumpled on the ground with the corpse of her killer, letting herself flow from her opened veins and ruined limb, feeding the hungry earth. //Good riddance.// \n\n\n\nAnd then she felt someone's soft skin against her own, and smelled strange flowers that did not grow in the Jungle, felt someone\u2019s arms lift her in the air, and she lost consciousness.\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed was the one who rescued her, even holding her hand during her ordeal. \n\n\n\nWhen she woke, she was in Inez's daughter's bed, and Noem\u00ed the Cat was curled up by her side, purring away. When she tried to lift her arm, all she summoned was pain. Of her arm, all that remained was a molten-looking nub of bicep and bone; the remainder had practically melted during her fever.\n\n\n\n//I will never work again.//\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed tried to console her. \"Your Aunt wants you to stay with her. It's better this way.\"\n\n\n\n\"HA.\" Xo burst into a peal of laughter like the mirth ripped itself from its lungs. //You stupid bitch. My life is over.// \"Sorry.\"\n\n\n\n\"Inez asked me to try to fix your arm,\" she said, \"But I told her how you felt about donor blood.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fucking right.\"\n\n\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\n\nXo wanted to grab Noem\u00ed by the ears and scream, \"Because you're gonna leave me behind, and I don't want it to hurt so much when you do. Because you're smart and because you're pretty and because you don't belong in the Jungle and you know it, I know you know it, so why do you pretend to care?\" She didn't understand Noem\u00ed's naivet\u00e9, surely after five years of being a Sangrador she understood the gravity of sharing someone's blood, of the door that opened between their souls?\n\n\n\nBut she owed Noem\u00ed too much now. //You can't be a bitch to someone who bled for you.// \n\n\n\nThere was a peculiar smell in the air, now that they were alone together in a house instead of the aromatic cacophany of the Jungle. Xo sniffed Noem\u00ed's skin. Her blood was sour and dull. \"How long. Since you last ate?\" Xo asked.\n\n\n\n\"This morning.\"\n\n\n\n\"More than four hundred calories?\"\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed was not a liar, but looked at the ground with a bashful frown, and that told Xo all she needed to know.\n\n\n\n\"Idiot. Come with me. I'm making. Lunch.\" \n\n\n\n\"Wait a second, uh\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\n\nXo dragged herself into Inez's kitchen and found an abattoir. Her blood soaked the wood of Auntie Inez\u2019s dinner table and pooled on the floor beneath it. The walls and cabinets were crusted over with scarlet film. \"Guess we're. Doing some cleaning. First.\" Xo rolled up her sleeves and started her search for a bucket. \"Sit down, Noem\u00ed. Will make you tea.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fuck that, Xioxi, I wanna help.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mrow.\"\n\n\n\nShe made Noem\u00ed spend one night a week in C\u00f3rdoba so she would eat enough. Soon, Noem\u00ed stayed in Cordoba every chance she got, and Xo always made sure that she ate. The kitchen always smelled like her own blood unless Noem\u00ed was there, when it would smell sweet.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe river was ordinarily the softest place in the Jungle, all that connected the villages of the Jungle with the wider world, snaking through the war like a long black vein. Xo wondered where she could find the heart it bled into, if only to know where to stick the knife. \n\n\n\nShe rushed along the river for a while, the light in the sky and in the river snuffed out by the empty moon. Even the stars were absent, with her bloodsight making her charnel road the only thing she could see. She pulled out her pistol. She couldn't fire it worth a damn, but it would look scary enough that maybe they wouldn't notice her other arm was missing.\n\n\n\n//\u201cCh-check the thing on the handle\u2014\" Mam\u00ed explained how to check the chamber if a round was there, how to load a round in the gun, how to turn off the safety, and at last, where to point the gun so it would be quick for Mam\u00ed.//\n\n\n\nThere was a faint buzzing in the air. And it grew louder.\n\n\n\n//Drones.//\n\n\n\nHer stomach dropped as adrenaline surged through her. The buzzing intensified. \n\n\n\n//A swarm.//\n\n\n\nThe sounds were all around her in the dark. She was too far from either side of the riverbank to steer for cover, even if she had both arms to row anywhere near fast enough to do so. \n\n\n\nThe humming crescendoed into razors' buzzing. Her ears picked apart the dueling rhythms. Six anti-personnel craft whose guns could tear her into pieces within the blink of an eye. If her body were not falling apart, if her connection to the Scarlet weren't so unstable, she could have cut them open from neck to nuts with a flick of her wrist. \n\n\n\nAs it was, her options were far more limited. And horrible.\n\n\n\n//Mam\u00ed, help me.//\n\n\n\nBut her resolve was already steeled. Holding her breath, gathering her strength, she grabbed the edge of the canoe and threw her weight against it.\n\n\n\nOnce.\n\n\n\nA gun swiveled.\n\n\n\nTwice.\n\n\n\nShe heard the whine of the drone's minicannons as they began to spin.\n\n\n\nAnd with a roar, she felt something give, and the boat flipped over and capsized, and she crashed underneath the surface and just barely managed to hang onto the underside.\n\n\n\nIt was a struggle to force her mouth and nose to drink the air in the small pocket, and her one hand was losing its grip on the canoe. \"Damn you. Damn you!\" she hissed.\n\n\n\nShe heard beeps and hums and screeches above her\u2014the drones were looking for her. Had she fooled them into thinking she drowned? \n\n\n\nShe heard the whine of the minicannons warming up again and got her answer.\n\n\n\nThere was no place to go but down.\n\n\n\n//Mam\u00ed, give me the strength.//\n\n\n\nShe let go of the canoe, and expelled the air from her lungs, and her lungs empty of buoyant air, she sank in the raging red, and the viscosity of the lower depths dragged her deep under the rushing gore, so deep and dark she could no longer discern which way was up.\n\n\n\nDespite having bathed in blood throughout her years as a Sangrador, her body froze at the prospect of what she was about to do. Animal instinct abhorred it. Human dignity rebelled against it. \n\n\n\nHer heart raced in her ears, the pain built up inside of her, overwhelmed her, and then her body compelled her to submit to the last reflex of the drowning dead.\n\n\n\nShe opened her mouth and breathed.\n\n\n\nAnd her chest erupted in pain as her lungs swelled with blood.\n\n\n\nWrithing and sinking and dying, Xo mouthed an incantation as darkness covered her eyes.\n\n\n\nAnd gasped as her body disregarded the state of her lungs, and she felt like she was gliding as she cut through the viscera and broke through into the riverwater, all but hugging the floor as she crept towards the shore, her body ignoring the current.\n\n\n\nShe fought her way through the blood and the effort hurled her onto the riverbank as the sound of gunfire erupted behind her, and then her chest spasmed, and she heaved the blood from her lungs onto the soil of the riverbank.\n\n\n\nXo turned around and watched as her canoe exploded into pieces in the distance, as the drones mashed the river with bullets to finish off what they thought was their kill. She had gone too far to return to Cordoba and her pet, and likely not far enough to reach Noemi's last known location.\n\n\n\n\"Scarlet Mother, witness me.\" Xo ground her teeth, trying to master the crushing wave of sickness and pain roiling inside of her.\n\n\n\nShe lifted a scrap of the shirt she wore last night that still smelled like Noem\u00ed, and as she breathed deep her lavender scent, her bloodsight lit the world again, and she saw anew the path she needed to find her.\n\n\n\nXo crashed through the wilds, following Noem\u00ed's blood scent, fleeing the angry knives and claws behind her. Every breath scraped her irritated lungs and strained her broken rib, every footstep stretched skin raked with the angry teeth of Bleeding Trees and spread sweat into the wounds. \n\n\n\n//Move. MOVE!//\n\n\n\nValravn hunter-seekers, everywhere. She could smell the bitter stink of their kills, the acrid stench of gunpowder, the acid lemon sting of their anti-Iosis meds. They'd wring her like a sponge for every use they had for her and then feed what was left to their trained chimeras. One-armed, hungry, veins running dry, she would be an easy kill, so she needed to be an invisible target.\n\n\n\n//We're being hunted. We've been hunted.// They were children playing war, and the war had outgrown them. \n\n\n\nHours passed, the moon disappeared, and the ink-dark night began to thaw into daybreak.\n\n\n\nThen, the trail disappeared.\n\n\n\nShe had reached a clearing, carved out of the Jungle by either a Chimera pack or a Valravn platoon. It was carpeted with spoiled grass so ruined by Rust that it squished instead of crunched under Xo's careful feet. Ashes and herbicide marked the scars where trees once stood.\n\n\n\nAt the center, a sour-smelling bundle dangled, covered by a sack-like shroud. It was lashed by its neck and wrists to a long, bark-shaved pole. The stench of the bundle had likely dispelled her trail. //Do I burn it? That would likely make the situation worse. Do I move on? But what direction do I pick?// She took out her knife and walked towards the body, and noticed the feet dangling beneath the shroud in the air, saw them kick, and the toe-nails were red.\n\n\n\n//Nail polish in a war zone?// Xo wanted to laugh, and then suddenly her mirth was cut by two angry scents.\n\n\n\n//Burnt rubber and gasoline.// \n\n\n\n//THAT Chimera.//\n\n\n\nXo whirled around, but there was a flurry, a lunge, then things STOPPED.\n\n\n\nEuphoria. Xo is giggly, growing lighter by the second, shock soaking her sweetly like she was slipping into a warm bath. Hollow and leaking.\n\n\n\nIts arm is inside her. Xo smells its writhing anger in its fire-cracked flesh and boiled eyes as it pulls her towards its blood-charred tusks.\n\n\n\nShe feels funny inside. The arm is wriggling inside of her.\n\n\n\n//I'm dying, I'm running dry. Wake up!// Instinct took the reins. She jammed her knife into the crook of the Chimera's arm and shrieked a dismembering incantation-the bone erupted with a pop, and the arm melted from the Chimera.\n\n\n\n//So much gone. So much pain.// The arm slowed the leaking, but she couldn't absorb its blood. Chimeras were filled with poison. She was too tainted already. \n\n\n\nXo sheathed her knife and pulled her pistol as the Chimera raced at her, and she emptied the magazine into its head, each shot burying itself in the beast's carapace. Not deadly, but painful and stalling. She discarded the pistol and pulled her knife just as the Chimera charged her again. It swept towards her face with its remaining arm, and she blocked it\u2014\n\n\n\nWith her missing arm.\n\n\n\nThe Chimera's claw slashed across Xo's face, and she saw the light no more. Agony took its place, and as she buckled to her knees, the Chimera pinned her body to the ground.\n\n\n\nXo's bloodloss smothered her pain, and she tried not to mind as the Chimera crushed her legs beneath its feet, pried its claws into her eyesockets, and began to pull.\n\n\n\n\"YRAAAAAAAOR.\"\n\n\n\n//I'd never heard the cat scream like that before.// \n\n\n\n\"SCREEEEEEEEEEE\"\n\n\n\n\"YRAAAAOR!\" The Chimera released its grip on her face, and she felt its weight leave her.\n\n\n\n//THE CAT.//\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed the Cat had followed her. //You dumb fuck.// Xo mused in pride, and then her pride was swallowed by her dread. //NO.// It was fighting the Chimera.\n\n\n\nAnd then resolve charged her blood. In the dark, she smelt the Chimera's blood, felt it loom over her, felt the pulse of its throat.\n\n\n\nAnd lunged forward and sank her teeth into its neck. And drank all that flowed therein.\n\n\n\n\"SCREEEE-\" The Chimera's scream died in a whispy gurgle, and Xo bit down. She bit deep. Each bite and each drink of its pulse fueling the next. It was her turn to roar. She roared, and she bit, and she roared, and she drank and...\n\n\n\nBefore long, her teeth and claws ripped open its chest, pulled out its heart, and her nails pierced the skin, and the sprint of its rotten blood ceased.\n\n\n\nWhat strength remained to Xo melted away, and her feet surrendered to her wounds as she spilled on the ground.\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed the Cat curled up next to her and mewled, a flickering candle in the limitless night.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\n\n\n\nIt was four months into her forced retirement at C\u00f3rdoba, and for once, it was Noem\u00ed throwing the tantrum this time.\n\n\n\n\"So annoying! Why is she. Like this?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mrow.\"\n\n\n\nWhenever she and Noem\u00ed fought, Xo would talk to Noem\u00ed the Cat while they cooled off. He followed her everywhere and always reacted to the sounds coming out of Xo's mouth. Too, it helped Xo get her thoughts in order for when they would inevitably make up.\n\n\n\nIt was right after Noem\u00ed offered to let Xo drink her blood and get her arm back. Nonsense, of course. She'd always offer, and Xo always refused. She was just being nice, but that just wasn't a thing friends did. To change the subject, Xo said Eloisa, a nice girl in the village, was a nice dancer, because she put on a show the other night during the festival.\n\n\n\nAnd then Noem\u00ed screamed at her, saying she wanted to dance with everyone but her, and stormed off. \n\n\n\nNonsense. Xo didn't want to dance with anyone! She only said that about Eloisa because Noem\u00ed was always telling her to be nicer to people. She didn't know what Eloisa's dancing looked like because during festivals, she would spend the whole time talking to Noem\u00ed.\n\n\n\nAnd, in any case, Xo was supposed to be the one who did the screaming and storming off. She didn't like being confused.\n\n\n\nWith Noem\u00ed the Cat following close behind, Xo ran to the ruined watchtower, which was where Xo herself would run off to when she was mad. \n\n\n\nSure enough, she found Noem\u00ed, leaning against an acid-matted wall. She had taken off the machine-knit peasant blouse she usually wore and her pleated matching skirt, now wearing a tank top and practical cut-off shorts, so the sigil-scarring on her limbs was in proud display to Xo and the Jungle behind them.\n\n\n\nThey both had specific outfits for when they were around civilians, and more comfortable attire when they were alone together. Xo herself preferred wearing her dagger-tailored fatigues whenever she wasn't dressed in the lavender scented clothes Noem\u00ed bought for her from the city.\n\n\n\nXo did not try to hide her irritation. \"If you were. Trying to hide. Need more practice.\"\n\n\n\n\"I wasn't trying to do anything,\" Noem\u00ed's voice snapped like a brittle twig, and then she was in front of Xo, kneeling to pet Noem\u00ed the Cat. \n\n\n\n\"What's your problem?\" \n\n\n\n\"Just forget it,\" Noem\u00ed grumbled. \"If you're going to play dumb, I don't want to play with you.\"\n\n\n\nXo wanted to throw rocks at things. Noem\u00ed was so annoying when she got like this. \"If you won't. Talk to me. Maybe Eloisa will.\" Xo had no intention of talking to Eloisa, the girl seemed nice, but only Noem\u00ed could make her laugh. But the girl's name annoyed Noem\u00ed before, and Xo felt like needling her again. \"Eloisa. Wouldn't leave me. Looking like a fool.\" That part felt more intentional. \"Wouldn't confuse me. All the time!\"\n\n\n\n\"That's because Eloisa doesn't know you.\" Noem\u00ed got to her feet. \"You don't know what you're doing with those badly fitting shirts? You don't know what your chest does when you leave those buttons undone?\" Noem\u00ed breathed. \"Stop playing dumb!\" She started to pace. \n\n\n\n\"What are you. Talking about?\" Xo was so confused. \"Shirts? Chest? What?\"\n\n\n\n\"You are going to tell me you can't tell she likes you?\"\n\n\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\n\n\"You are going to tell me that\u2014\" Noem\u00ed shook her head. \"You play so dumb, but I know better\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know better! Please! What am I. What am I missing?\" Now Xo's head was really starting to hurt. \"What do you mean. I'm pretty? I'm nice?\" And then the unspoken truth wrenched itself from Xo's mouth: \"Just stop. Pretending I'm not. A freak.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pretending? Now you're the one talking nonsense!\"\n\n\n\n\"Brain broken. Can't talk. Lost an arm. No manners. Dress like shit. Hair's a mess. I'm a freak!\" Xo wanted to stop talking, but could not stop, like a dam crumbled in her heart. \"You think I. Like it here? I only stay. Because it's your home! It's not mine! I don't know. What to do. When you leave!\"\n\n\n\n\"I won't leave.\"\n\n\n\n\"You will! You will! Always talk about. Moving out. Always talk about. Bogot\u00e1.\"\n\n\n\n\"I won't leave without you.\"\n\n\n\n\"You don't. Belong here.\"\n\n\n\nThe air swelled with hints of lavender and sweet blood. \"I can't leave without you!\"\n\n\n\n\"And I can't. Leave the Jungle!\" Xo cried. \"Can't you see? I don't belong. Here. I don't belong. Out there. To live as. I please. And die. A stupid death. That's what I am! No pet. Of yours. To take into the city.\" Xo covered her face. The beer in her belly was making her voice and cheeks do things she did not mean to do. \"You're leaving. Me behind. I'm trying. To grow. Trying. To be a person. Because need to. Live without you. You? City clothes. Long legs. Magazine hair. Heart isn't here. Heart is out there. Gonna leave me behind. Why jealous. When I'm...\" Xo slid her hands from her face. \"I'm...what are you doing?\"\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed's back was turned to Xo. \n\n\n\n\"I know you, Xiomita. You'd hate for me to see you cry.\"\n\n\n\nAnd something snapped in Xo, and she seized Noem\u00ed and swept her around. \"Not crying. You smug jerk!\" \n\n\n\nAnd then Noem\u00ed slid her hand around Xo's hip and pinned her against the wall with the press of her body.\n\n\n\n\"W-what are you doing?\" Xo murmured, but the scent of Noem\u00ed's blood was overpowering, and she felt the way it was rushing to all the parts of their bodies that touched, the shock that ran through Xo's body and heart when Noem\u00ed's chest touched hers through the thin fabric of their clothing. Noem\u00ed's face was turned down towards Xo, so she lost herself in the fire burning deep in Noem\u00ed's pupils, and she melted in her gaze.\n\n\n\n\"Have you ever...\" Noem\u00ed's voice tiptoed, voice as soft as shuffling leaves, \"I mean, w-with anyone else?\" \n\n\n\n\"Was waiting for you,\" The words burst from a deep place where Xo's heart drowned in a sea of heat. Xo slid her hand around Noem\u00ed perspiring neck and damp hair and drank Noem\u00ed's smile with a wet giddy kiss. The taller Noem\u00ed seemed to shrink into deep, ragged moan.\n\n\n\nThen Noem\u00ed answered her with a deeper embrace, and Xo's blood began to bloom, melting as Noem\u00ed's tongue filled her mouth. Xo made a sound weaker and more desperate than she thought her body could make. \n\n\n\nShe'd almost lost her balance because her stump couldn't maintain her posture, but Noem\u00ed caught her, untucking her shirt, her fingers gliding along her waist. Xo's felt her legs scissor open and Noem\u00ed's upper thigh notched between them.\n\n\n\nXo glowed in her joy, gasping in between deep gulps of it, her body filled with thanks to the Scarlet King for Noem\u00ed's eager lips and hungry teeth.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nXo crawled through the darkness, led by Noem\u00ed the Cat. The Jungle howled all around her behind a curtain of colorless black.\n\n\n\nShe made her way towards the sour-smelling body. Something familiar haunted the air, a lantern of desire in the sightless night, and Xo was consumed by it like air is swallowed by fire. //Flowers. Sweet. Clean. Beauty. The outside.//\n\n\n\n//Lavender.//\n\n\n\n\"Noem\u00ed?\" Xo whispered, and a raspy wordless moan replied.\n\n\n\n\u00a0//No.// She cut the bounds on the bundle's wrists and neck, and the body sank into Xo's arms, crumpled, dead weight. They folded together into the Rusted soil, and Noem\u00ed's skin was damp with Xo's blood.\n\n\n\nShe felt Noem\u00ed's arms around her, felt her thin fingers spread over her body, pressing care into her skin, but as Xo whispered her name, Noem\u00ed only answered her with groans.\n\n\n\n//Where's your voice, babe? Please, make me feel ugly again.// Her anguish broke into the world, straining Xo's own throttled voice. \"Noem\u00ed, t-tell me something. Noem\u00ed, tell me. Tell me I. Dress like shit. Tell me. About city music. Tell me! Anything!\" \n\n\n\nXo felt Noem\u00ed's fingers brush her face, trembling, and then Xo leaned her head forward and felt Noem\u00ed's lips press against hers, and Xo greedily drank her kiss, and Noem\u00ed opened her mouth, and Xo's tongue danced with-\n\n\n\nNothing. She kissed Noem\u00ed again and again and again, babbling into her lips. \n\n\n\n//What did they do?//\n\n\n\n//What do I do?//\n\n\n\nHer fingers glided over her face, where cheeks once bloomed with joy, burns now made Noem\u00ed hiss at the touch, rough grooves now wrapped her slender, elegant neck, her chest...voids and stitches lashed Noem\u00ed's body, a net of agony that wrapped her flesh, and stiffened where it used to shiver, writhed where it used to revel. \n\n\n\n//She was the smart and pretty one who would go away, and I am the ugly monster who would stay. She is the woman, and I'm the Jungle creature.// Yet it was not jealousy in those thoughts. She wanted Noem\u00ed to be happy, since she wore happiness so much better than she could. \n\n\n\nValravn had made sure she would never burn bright again.\n\n\n\n//If only the Chimera had killed me rather than I found her like this.//\n\n\n\nXo wanted to scream, then wanted to be strong, but then broke down under her own helplessness. What could she do? She would have spilt every last drop of blood in her body to save Noem\u00ed's life, but she couldn't offer her blood now, tainted with the Chimera's corruption.\n\n\n\n//Who would take care of her?//\n\n\n\nAnd Xo drowned in lavender and sorrow.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\n\n\n\nWhen Valravn came to Ameranta, Xo was cooking with her mother, helping her prepare for the holiday festivities. Xo learned to chop vegetables quickly and evenly, learned to work the dough so it would not stick or tear. They would fill their table until it practically creaked under the weight of the food. Everybody visited everybody's houses, nobody locked their doors, and Xo and her mother cooked so much more than they needed. \n\n\n\nIt was about making sure everybody ate.\n\n\n\nIt was when she was going out to grab more ingredients from a neighbor that the gunfire began.\n\n\n\nXo managed to hide beneath the stilts of a house and cover herself with moss to avoid notice. She heard her father and older brother scream as they were taken before four successive gunshots silenced them both.\n\n\n\nThe coast had cleared around Xo for the moment, as the Ravens were preoccupied with their current haul of looted human capital. She made her way to her family's house and opened the door.\n\n\n\nThere was the corpse of a raider with a kitchen knife embedded in his skull and her mother, sprawled in a rocking chair, a pistol on her lap.\n\n\n\n\"The raiders will return,\" she said. \u201cIt will be quick for you. They do not torture children. But\u2026they will hurt me. They will hurt me so much, and there is so much pain, and\u2014I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m dying.\u201d She stared meaningfully at the gun. \"Please, help me.\"\n\n\n\n\"What, what do you\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Please stop the pain.\" Her eyes glistened with tears. \"Please, before they come back. I would do it myself, but I am too weak\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Mam\u00ed, please, please, don't make me\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"I need you to be strong for me, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Pap\u00ed promised to help me with this if we ever had to, but I need you,\" Mam\u00ed broke down in tears. \"Take the gun. Please, please.\"\n\n\n\nAt the mention of Pap\u00ed, Xo picked up the gun. \"How do I\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Ch-check the thing on the handle\u2014\" She talked Xo through how to check the chamber if a round was there, how to load a round in the gun, how to turn off the safety, and at last, where to point the gun so it would be quick for Mam\u00ed.\n\n\n\n\"Please look at me, Mam\u00ed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Xiomara, please, I want to die thinking of home.\"\n\n\n\nBut even with her finger curled around the trigger, Xo could not do it. \"I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Mam\u00ed. I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's okay to be scared at first, Xio. But you have to be brave for Mam\u00ed. Please.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no, I can't. I can't.\"\n\n\n\n\"Please. Mam\u00ed is so scared.\"\n\n\n\n//SO AM I.//\n\n\n\n\"Xioxi, it's okay.\" Mam\u00ed swallowed. \"Xiomara, I'm not your mother.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mam\u00ed?\"\n\n\n\n\"I did not want you to know like this. There was a place along the river where the land for miles around was burned and the soil soaked with blood. I heard you crying, next to a dead woman, and I picked you up, and I loved you, and I love you, and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for lying to you, please, Xiomara, it hurts so much. It hurts so much\u2014\"\n\n\n\nXo's hand shook too much when she pulled the trigger, and only hurt Mam\u00ed more, so Mam\u00ed had to hold onto the barrel the second time to make sure the second bullet ended it.

Wh-what do I do?\"\n\n\n\nNoem\u00ed's fingers brushed through Xo's hair, and then she pulled Xo into a tight embrace, her face brushing against Xo's, and Xo felt her damp cheeks, wet with tears and not of blood. She heard Noem\u00ed struggle to say something, and then Xo felt her face pulled somewhere, pulled towards the nape of Noem\u00ed's neck. The scent of her blood is overpowering. The life in her flesh answered the death blooming in Xo's, and Xo's body howled in answer.\n\n\n\n//Please, no. Not again. Not like Mam\u00ed.//\n\n\n\n\"No,\" Xo tried pulling away from Noem\u00ed's hold on her, but almost succeeds. \"No, no!\" //Not like this.

Research providing new inputs requires authorization from Beta personnel. During research, the provided raw material and complementary outputs must be documented in the Item's Transmutation Records for future use, alongside noteworthy observations during the process.</p>\n<p>Interviews with the Item have to be conducted in teams of at least two persons, with only one person loud and clearly asking questions and all others ready to note down the Item's responses as soon as they are made.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1 id=\"toc1\"><span><strong>Report</strong></span></h1>\n<p>The Shifting Armoury is a hexagonal basalt cave of 400\u00a0m diameter located approx. 500\u00a0m beneath the surface of a mountain range. The structure appears to be of natural origin at first glance, but noteworthy, all basalt columns within are perfectly hexagonal and of identical size, forming a solid, completely level floor with the exception of a few outlier columns. The chamber can only be reached through a tunnel from the second basement of Production Facility Three that leads to the cave's south-western wall.</p>\n<p>The cave's ceiling is a portal to a potentially extradimensional void; to date, no attempts were made to penetrate through the portal, as per the Item's request. Light shone through the portal is dispersed by a thin haze, yet sufficient intensity reveals a massive silhouette writhing far above. During operation, faint sparks can be seen inside the void; they are distanced to far away for accurate parallax measurements.</p>\n<p>The inside of the Shifting Armoury is filled with scaffolding, workbenches, anvils, gantries, casting moulds, platforms, crucibles and other installations used in metalworking. Each object is attached to one or more hyaline twisted strands of an unidentified, non-organic substance that are suspended from somewhere in the void above.</p>\n<p>During active phases, the Shifting Armoury is freely moving these objects around as needed; it is also known to lower additional ones down when necessary or remove unneeded ones by lifting them up them through the portal. During active phases, it is also controlling roughly humanoid puppets reminiscent of dummies or mannequins through intertwined strands in order to manipulate tools and other objects in a manner similar to a marionettist.</p>\n<p>When provided with adequate amounts of raw materials, the Shifting Armoury will smelt them down into anomalous alloys and use them to create anomalous objects, mostly armaments. The accepted materials cover a broad spectrum, from organic matter to ores and most other substances, as long as they are provided in solid state. However, the alloy output is usually far below the provided input in mass.</p>\n<p>The created alloys are used to either create armaments entirely composed of that material, or refine equipment provided alongside the raw materials, enhancing them with anomalous effects or superior physical properties.</p>\n<p>The Shifting Armoury is sentient and capable of fluent Latin; through training with Insurgency personnel it also learned to understand simple English. It is, however, not capable of vocalization of its own. Instead, it lowers a clear, long hexagonal prism down during communication and oscillates it like a pendulum. Whenever the bob crosses the equilibrium position, a roman letter or alchemical symbol flashes inside, spelling out words in the process. Due to this behaviour, its comments are easy to miss.</p>\n<p>When provided with raw materials, the Item will intermittently request or suggest other materials or comment on the quality of certain pieces. These remarks have proven useful in determining new combinations for transmutation and assessing the properties of the created weaponry. All intermediate alloys also receive a name from the Item.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1 id=\"toc2\"><span><strong>Appendix A: Interview Excerpts</strong></span></h1>\n<p>The following is a compilation of questions asked at different times by different researchers. Since most of the interviews with the Shifting Armoury yielded no useable results, this format was chosen for brevity instead. Earlier examples were originally conducted in Latin and translated to English.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who are you?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> They call me Armourer, not because I am the Armourer, but because I forge arms.<br/>\n<strong>Question:</strong> How old are you?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Pieces may break and get replaced, but the whole stays the same. No edge cuts twice, but the grind keeps it sharp.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you make equipment for us?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> It is my nature to practice my craft. I do not care whether you save or take lives. I take honour in the appreciation of my craftsmanship. Only if my work sees use, I am proud.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Could you create other things out of the materials we offer you? A modern battlefield sees few uses for horse armour.<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Only in a twisted world the laymen dictate the master how to exercise his art.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Could you tell us in advance in what our offerings will result?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The strike of inspiration comes as sudden as it is decisive.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why don't you tell us of the properties of your creations?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The blacksmith only knows to forge weapons, the warrior only knows to use them.<br/>\n<strong>Question:</strong> Are there more of your kind?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Is a chain just the collection of its links? Speak of men or speak of mankind, one is nothing without relation to the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Does this mean you are a plural or collective entity?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> A master is the one, not many, who supersedes all but himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you work this deep underground?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Fish breathe \ud83d\udf04, so they dwell sea-borne, men breathe \ud83d\udf01, so they dwell the surface, dragons breathe \ud83d\udf02, so they dwell the stars and I breathe \ud83d\udf03, so I dwell beneath.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What lies beyond the portal above?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> It is a cage, but it is gilded.<br/>\n<strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Does this mean you are captive?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> I have not chosen this place, but it has chosen me.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you communicate through this peculiar mechanism?<br/>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Read without seeing. Only if words are fleeting, the ephemeral truth can settle. Lasting is treacherous, lasting blemishes, lasting corrupts. Do not trust what the mind perceives before the dream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span><strong>Appendix B: Excerpts from the Transmutation Records</strong></span></h1>\n<script src=\"https://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--7690939296dc/common--javascript/yahooui/tabview-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<div class=\"yui-navset\" id=\"wiki-tabview-5e107983d7b9f27f1d5981da4cca3373\">\n<ul class=\"yui-nav\">\n<li class=\"selected\"><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Obsisto-Anancitium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Sanguis-Cruorium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Diffregi-Perdunticulium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Aresco-Marcuium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Perpes-Chronicium</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Attraxi-Falaricaium</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"yui-content\">\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-0\">\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span><strong>Obsisto-Anancitium</strong></span></h2>\n<strong>Raw Material:</strong><br/>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>18\u00a0t of industry standard duplex stainless steel</td>\n<td>28 Ingots (4,5\u00a0kg apiece)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20\u00a0t of 99,95% pure titanium</td>\n<td>40 Ingots (4,5\u00a0kg apiece)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15\u00a0t of natural iridosmine alloy</td>\n<td>1 Bloom of 50 Ingots (4,5\u00a0kg apiece)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Properties:</strong><br/>\nDark grey matt alloy with a density of 4,012\u00a0g/cm\u00b3 (at room temperature), a hardness of 9800HV, a tensile strength of 142\u00a0GPa and a Young Modulus of approximately 2\u00a0TPa.

Personnel must leave the Item as soon as possible after delivery of the input to avoid getting trapped or injured.\n\n\n\nThe Item will automatically cease activity once it finishes processing the provided input. Since the Item does not signal the end of activity in any way, it has to be periodically checked for activity. The output might be removed after completion and assigned for use by Insurgency units or moved to storage in appropriate Logistic Outposts.\n\n\n\nStandard usage of the Item is only allowed to use inputs documented in the Item's Transmutation Records. Research providing new inputs requires authorization from Beta personnel. During research, the provided raw material and complementary outputs must be documented in the Item's Transmutation Records for future use, alongside noteworthy observations during the process.\n\n\n\nInterviews with the Item have to be conducted in teams of at least two persons, with only one person loud and clearly asking questions and all others ready to note down the Item's responses as soon as they are made.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+ **Report**\n\nThe Shifting Armoury is a hexagonal basalt cave of 400 m diameter located approx. 500 m beneath the surface of a mountain range. The structure appears to be of natural origin at first glance, but noteworthy, all basalt columns within are perfectly hexagonal and of identical size, forming a solid, completely level floor with the exception of a few outlier columns. The chamber can only be reached through a tunnel from the second basement of Production Facility Three that leads to the cave's south-western wall.\n\n\n\nThe cave's ceiling is a portal to a potentially extradimensional void; to date, no attempts were made to penetrate through the portal, as per the Item's request. Light shone through the portal is dispersed by a thin haze, yet sufficient intensity reveals a massive silhouette writhing far above. During operation, faint sparks can be seen inside the void; they are distanced to far away for accurate parallax measurements.\n\n\n\nThe inside of the Shifting Armoury is filled with scaffolding, workbenches, anvils, gantries, casting moulds, platforms, crucibles and other installations used in metalworking. Each object is attached to one or more hyaline twisted strands of an unidentified, non-organic substance that are suspended from somewhere in the void above.\n\n\n\nDuring active phases, the Shifting Armoury is freely moving these objects around as needed; it is also known to lower additional ones down when necessary or remove unneeded ones by lifting them up them through the portal. During active phases, it is also controlling roughly humanoid puppets reminiscent of dummies or mannequins through intertwined strands in order to manipulate tools and other objects in a manner similar to a marionettist.\n\n\n\nWhen provided with adequate amounts of raw materials, the Shifting Armoury will smelt them down into anomalous alloys and use them to create anomalous objects, mostly armaments. The accepted materials cover a broad spectrum, from organic matter to ores and most other substances, as long as they are provided in solid state. However, the alloy output is usually far below the provided input in mass.\n\n\n\nThe created alloys are used to either create armaments entirely composed of that material, or refine equipment provided alongside the raw materials, enhancing them with anomalous effects or superior physical properties.\n\n\n\nThe Shifting Armoury is sentient and capable of fluent Latin; through training with Insurgency personnel it also learned to understand simple English. It is, however, not capable of vocalization of its own. Instead, it lowers a clear, long hexagonal prism down during communication and oscillates it like a pendulum. Whenever the bob crosses the equilibrium position, a roman letter or alchemical symbol flashes inside, spelling out words in the process. Due to this behaviour, its comments are easy to miss.\n\n\n\nWhen provided with raw materials, the Item will intermittently request or suggest other materials or comment on the quality of certain pieces. These remarks have proven useful in determining new combinations for transmutation and assessing the properties of the created weaponry. All intermediate alloys also receive a name from the Item.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+ **Appendix A: Interview Excerpts**\n\nThe following is a compilation of questions asked at different times by different researchers. Since most of the interviews with the Shifting Armoury yielded no useable results, this format was chosen for brevity instead. Earlier examples were originally conducted in Latin and translated to English.\n\n\n\n> **Question:** Who are you?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** They call me Armourer, not because I am the Armourer, but because I forge arms.\n\n>\n\n> **Question:** How old are you?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Pieces may break and get replaced, but the whole stays the same. No edge cuts twice, but the grind keeps it sharp.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why do you make equipment for us?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** It is my nature to practice my craft. I do not care whether you save or take lives. I take honour in the appreciation of my craftsmanship. Only if my work sees use, I am proud.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Could you create other things out of the materials we offer you? A modern battlefield sees few uses for horse armour.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Only in a twisted world the laymen dictate the master how to exercise his art.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Could you tell us in advance in what our offerings will result?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** The strike of inspiration comes as sudden as it is decisive.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why don't you tell us of the properties of your creations?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** The blacksmith only knows to forge weapons, the warrior only knows to use them.\n\n>\n\n> **Question:** Are there more of your kind?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Is a chain just the collection of its links? Speak of men or speak of mankind, one is nothing without relation to the other. \n\n> \n\n> **Follow-Up:** Does this mean you are a plural or collective entity?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** A master is the one, not many, who supersedes all but himself.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why do you work this deep underground?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Fish breathe \ud83d\udf04, so they dwell sea-borne, men breathe \ud83d\udf01, so they dwell the surface, dragons breathe \ud83d\udf02, so they dwell the stars and I breathe \ud83d\udf03, so I dwell beneath.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** What lies beyond the portal above?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** It is a cage, but it is gilded.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n>\n\n> **Follow-Up:** Does this mean you are captive?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** I have not chosen this place, but it has chosen me.\n\n> \n\n> **Question:** Why do you communicate through this peculiar mechanism?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Answer:** Read without seeing. Only if words are fleeting, the ephemeral truth can settle. Lasting is treacherous, lasting blemishes, lasting corrupts. Do not trust what the mind perceives before the dream.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+ **Appendix B: Excerpts from the Transmutation Records**\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Obsisto-Anancitium]]\n\n++ **Obsisto-Anancitium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 18 t of industry standard duplex stainless steel || 28 Ingots (4,5 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 20 t of 99,95% pure titanium || 40 Ingots (4,5 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 15 t of natural iridosmine alloy || 1 Bloom of 50 Ingots (4,5 kg apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDark grey matt alloy with a density of 4,012 g/cm\u00b3 (at room temperature), a hardness of 9800HV, a tensile strength of 142 GPa and a Young Modulus of approximately 2 TPa. The material has a very low thermal conductivity and is an electric insulator.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe ingots were forged into a multitude of different objects, mostly serving as shields or armour plates, depending on the quantity available to the Shifting Armoury. This includes cuirasses, helmets, whole mediaeval suits of plate armour, gun shields, ballistic shields, mobile personnel shields, kite shields, heater shields, mobile cover and barricades.\n\n* **Combat Vehicles:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe vehicles were outfitted with complete sets of appliqu\u00e9 armour and slat armour. This includes, amongst others, Leopard 2 battle tanks, M113 armoured personnel carriers and in one notable case, a BMW R1200RT motorcycle.\n\n* **Bladed Weapons:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nKnifes and other sharp weapons had their blades reinforced with the alloy, leading to overall increased physical resistance and reduced wear, but also faster blunting of the edges.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Sanguis-Cruorium]]\n\n++ **Sanguis-Cruorium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 15 t of wrought iron, 2000 l blood (frozen) || 10 Ingots (3 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 9 t of wrought iron, 35 t of meat || 6 Ingots (3 kg apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLackluster crimson alloy that feels warm to the touch. If a living creature is harmed or killed with a weapon made of this material, the wielder will undergo spontaneous and rapid surge of cell regeneration, leading to fast wound healing, detoxication, enhanced stamina and restored strength.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn assortment of scimitars and pole-arms was forged out of pure Sanguis-Cruorium. Weapons are reported to occasionally bend or stretch during strikes in order to hit vital parts of the target.\n\n* **Automatic Firearms:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe weapons (AK-15 assault rifles with holographic sights and FN P90 submachine guns) were imbued with veins of Sanguis-Cruorium and outfitted with an additional fixed bayonet (of 19 cm and 15 cm length respectively) of the pure material. The weapons can fire even with empty magazines, though every bullet fired puts a massive strain on the shooter's health; even a short burst can seriously cripple an operative.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Diffregi-Perdunticulium]]\n\n++ **Diffregi-Perdunticulium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 9 t obsidian shards || 12 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 26 t lead glass || 10 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 2 t crystalline zirconium dioxide || 2 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 140 kg synthetic diamond || 1 boule (40 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPellucid, dim-grey metal behaving in most aspects like a white metal alloy, including mild toxicity when consumed.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWithout additional input all the Diffregi-Perdunticulium alloy at hand was crafted into intricate jewellery, mostly bracelets, rings, brooches, medals, and headdresses. If any of these objects is damaged even just superficially when worn by a human, it will shatter in a way that inevitably inflicts lethal wounds on the wearer.\n\n* **Reflex Sights:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe reflective lens element of the sighting instrument was replaced with a carefully crafted mirror made of Diffregi-Perdunticulium. A second plano-convex lens was provided for each reflector sight, which can be inserted to create newton's rings as alternative reticle should standard LEDs or tritium illumination be at odds with an operation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFiring at an enemy targeted with one of these sights will have all projectiles teleport directly to the targeted area, resulting in a guaranteed hit from point-blank range.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Aresco-Marcuium]]\n\n++ **Aresco-Marcuium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 80 t withered plant matter; 3400 kg arsenic || 4 Ingots (200 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 1200 kg cremains, 40 kg Thallium || 2 Ingots (200 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 16 t asbestos || 3 Ingots (200 g apiece) ||\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnburnished taupe alloy with a density slightly above that of gold. If the alloy comes into contact with a multicellular organism, it will spontanously decay into fine rust whilst the organism undergoes rapid ageing until death.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll ingots were cast into 5.56\u00d745mm NATO bullets.\n\n* **Signal flares:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe ingots were ground to a fine powder and mixed into the pyrotechnic composition of the fusees. Objects exposed to the light of these flares will decay at an increased rate proportional the the lights brightness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUsage in white phosphorus munitions considered.\n\n* **Scythes:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe scythe's chine was imbued with Aresco-Marcuium, the snaith reinforced with more of the alloy and the entire tool was embellished with surreal decorative ornaments. The blade is able to cut through any organic material without resistance, decomposing the material in the path of the cut.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Shifting Armoury refused to treat Kamas this way.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Perpes-Chronicium]]\n\n++ **Perpes-Chronicium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 105 t of non-fiction books || Less than 1 g ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSuperficially identical to brass.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDuring the initial run, the small amount of material produced was immediately fold into a broad nib for use in a pencil. After extensive testing, it was determined that documents written by hand with this nib were immune to retrocausal alteration and the effect of reality-shift scenarios. The only existing pencil is currently in use at the archival section of Vault-SCORPIO.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDuring the melting processes, the Shifting Armoury exclaimed \"[Unintelligible] trinket of spite? Very well. If one must err to rely on the deceit of phrases, one still must retain one's honour.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAny following attempts to bring books or other greater amounts of written text into the chamber were forcefully removed by the marionettes.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Attraxi-Falaricaium]]\n\n++ **Attraxi-Falaricaium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n||< 7,4 t Vicalloy, 800 kg graphene, 260 kg lodestone ||< 9 ingots (mass N/A) ||\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Properties:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHeavy but brittle alloy that absorbs > 99.997% of light at optical wavelengths, but is incandescent under ultraviolet light. The material's mass and weight show a great disparity; whereas its inertial mass puts the mass of a single ingot to approximately 0,5 kg, the passive gravitational mass (and thus the weight force experienced by it) equals to 16 kg.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Combustion Grenade:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe internal explosive charge was completely replaced with an unknown mechanism surrounding a scalenohedral chunk of the Attraxi-Falaricaium. When detonated, the grenade created a distorted vortex for approximately 45 s that attracted bullets, shrapnel, flechettes and other ballistic projectiles. This caused most of them to undergo violent trajectory alterations, often being forced on paths akin to an orbit around a gravity well until the effect ceased.\n\n* **Fragmentation Grenade:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSimilar alterations as with a combustion grenade with the addition, that the vortex was surrounded by multiple concentric rings of shrapnel orbiting it at high velocity.\n\n* **Demolition Charges:**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLand mines had their explosive components removed and the trigger mechanism modified. When triggered, an area equal to the former blast radius will experience zero gravity for 4 seconds before a sudden surge of approximately 80 g crushes everything inside.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n\n+ **Appendix C: Extended Transmutation Log**\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Placata-Tuorium]]\n\n++ **Placata-Tuorium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 200 t of ice, 3,4 kg cadmium || 1 ingot (4,2 kg apiece) ||\n\n|| 120 t of acrylic glass, 3,4 kg cadmium || 1 ingot (4,2 kg apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nComparable to pure iron in all physical properties, but of periwinkle colour. Develops a patina after extended exposure to humidity which shimmers like an oil film on water.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Handheld weapons:**\n\nWeapons of any kind were covered in a thin coating of Placata-Tuorium. Weapons enhanced this way can not be noticed by anyone unaware of its existence whilst holstered. This effect ceases once the weapon is drawn, subsequently becoming permanently perceivable for all observers.\n\n* **Business Attire:**\n\nAll buttons, zippers, cufflinks and metalware on the shoes were replaced with pure Placata-Tuorium. Operatives wearing the complete attire are unable to be consciously acknowledged (but not noticed) by sentient beings they do not perceive themselves.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Accudo-Dolositatium]]\n\n++ **Accudo-Dolositatium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 1500 kg of rock candy, 3200 kg of shakud\u014d\t|| 520 coins (4 g apiece) ||\n\n|| 2000 kg of rock candy, 400 kg electrum\t|| 700 coins (4 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nMalleable, glossy-golden material of high thermal conductivity. Reported to be dazzling even without sufficient light sources.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\n\nThe material is directly minted into coins of 14 mm diameter. These coins are considered to be extremely valuable by all persons without counter-memetic training and will invoke strong avaricious behaviour. They are eagerly accepted as payment by most people. Possession of the coins will lead to the development of addiction symptoms in the owner, leading to an every growing desire to acquire more of them.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nCreation of more coins requires approval by at least one off-site Administrative Command Executive due to high danger for Insurgency personnel.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Candesco-Celeritatium]]\n\n++ **Candesco-Celeritatium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 50 t of spent nuclear fuel\t|| 1 Bloom of 45 Ingots (800 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nAlloy of matte cupreous colour with a density of 10.3 g/cm\u00b3. The material has both high ductility and malleability. When exposed to air, it quickly tarnishes and develops a black shimmering patina; warming it to red heat reverses the process. Material acts as a Gamma and X-Ray mirror.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **None:**\n\nDuring the only run with this material, the Shifting Armoury used 39 ingots to create an armour suit both inspired by tactical gear of modern urban warfare and maximilian armour, with the helmet being a synergized shape between a stechhelm and full-face bike helmets. The leftover ingots might have been intended for accompanying weaponry and a set of wings comparable to those of the Polish Hussars, but the Shifting Armoury never finished them.\n\nWhen worn, the suit is manipulating kinetic forces applied on and by it by a factor increasing with its relative velocity. Inbound forces (including friction) become reduced, whereas the forces it exerts get increased by the same factor. This means the wearer can accelerate to high velocities on foot and punch holes into walls whilst taking direct hits of enemy fire without suffering damage.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nDuring the melting process, the Shifting Armoury exclaimed \"It stings!\"; following the event, its puppets were seen handling the liquid metal with great caution and tools mounted on long poles. It has refused working with radioactive material of any kind ever since.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Doleo-Tormenium]]\n\n++ **Doleo-Tormenium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 5,3 t salt, 86 kg human milk powder (equivalent to 520 l), 600 kg quartz || 1 boule (6,3 kg) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nIvory coloured, marbled, highly magnetostrictive metal. The surface is constantly exhibiting small ripples slowly moving across it, occasional resulting in the emergence of --[COGNITOHAZARD REDACTED]-- faint wailing.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Depth Charges:**\n\n\u25a1 \u25a1 --[REDACTED]-- \u25a1 \u25a1\n\n* **Grenade Launcher:**\n\n\u25a1 \u25a1 --[REDACTED]-- \u25a1 \u25a1\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nProduction of this material requires Alpha level authorization and facility wide lockdown procedures in place. Output is not allowed to come into contact with genetic material under any circumstances and must be handled by infertil personnel.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Mansuefacio-Gubernatium]]\n\n++ **Mansuefacio-Gubernatium**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 31 t pig iron, 15 hides of kangaroo leather, 400 kg paraffin wax || 5 ingots (120 g apiece) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nFinely grained, silvery alloy with a Vickert Hardness of approx. 7800 VH. Produces a highly excruciating ringing noise when brought to resonance.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Nevermore:**\n\nThe material was forged into a set of cages, chainmail gauntlets and a small raptor hood. Both the cage and the hood appear to have a sedating effect on the specimen, rendering them inert when inside and/or wearing. The gauntlet allows for an operative to carry a single specimen perched on their arm, keeping the specimen docile and unable to harm the current wearer (but not others) until released.\n\n* **Laser Sights:**\n\nThe outer frame of the optics were removed and replaced with pure Mansuefacio-Gubernatium. A click switch is present on the side, allowing to active the lasers alternative mode.\n\nThe purpose of this modification was unknown until tests in tandem with an equipped Nevermore specimen were conducted. Whereas exact implications remain unknown, this seemingly allows for laser-guiding of Nevermore specimen during attacks.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nNevermore behaved highly aggressive and uncooperative towards the Shifting Armoury, repeatedly attacking and destroying its puppets during their work when taking measurements of the specimen. In response, the Shifting Armoury lowered a great amount of new puppets into the working area to overwhelm Nevermore, subduing some specimen by dropping anvils onto them. None of the Items appear to have suffered lasting harm.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Rosa-Speculo]]\n\n++ **Rosa-Speculo**\n\n**Raw Material:**\n\n|| 10kg Stramonium dust, 2000kg quartz, 1250kg bismuth || 5 panes (1kg each) ||\n\n\n\n**Properties:**\n\nPanes of glass 1 square meter in size. A slightly opaque luster that shows a rainbow sheen when illuminated. Gives the effects of stramonium dust when consumed.\n\n\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n* **Water:**\n\nMade into bottles capable of being fitted with a stopper. When water is added it becomes a cloudy purple liquid. When broken the bottle releases a gas cloud similar to that given off by David Wight. The cloud is proportionate with that of water allowed, with 6oz producing 8 square meters of the cloud. The cloud then persists for approximately 60 seconds before dissipating. The following combinations produce similar results except for the changes listed. Substances can be mixed to mix properties.\n\n* **Rubbing Alcohol:**\n\nCloud persists for 15 minutes before dissipating.\n\n* **Chlorophorm:**\n\nSubjects within the cloud who fall unconscious will no longer die. However, there has been a correlation with test subjects who fall unconscious being diagnosed with lung cancer within the following months.\n\n* **Ether:**\n\nSubjects caught in the cloud will become numb and have movement hindered. Hallucinations become stronger as well, with subjects claiming to see neon lights as well as strengthened previous effects.\n\n* **Human blood:**\n\nCloud becomes a dark crimson and will leave a sticky film to surfaces upon dissipating. If inhaled, the substance will condense and clog the bronchi branches in the lungs, often resulting in death. The film has also shown to render gas masks unusable.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n", "references": [], "tags": ["chaos-insurgency", "fantasy", "tale"], "title": "Shifting Armoury - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shifting-armoury", "year": 2026}, "sightseeing-canadian-problems": {"created_at": "2026-01-07T22:32:00", "creator": "Uncle Nicolini", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-07T22:32:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "Added tags: _cc, doctor-lillihammer, doctor-reynders, doctor-sokolsky, doctor-wettle, golden-horde, on-guard-43, tale.

Lillihammer stood opposite a wall, staring at it intently.</a></p>\n<p>She walked about the Theology and Teleology offices aimlessly, eyes still fixated upon the central rotunda's wall as she babbled nonsense. Truth be told, Dr. Lillihammer wasn't quite feeling herself, having become an Empty as a casualty of the capital \"B\" Breach and spent her days doing nothing. Naturally, this would upset Dr. Lillihammer, but as previously established, she was not quite feeling herself, so it wasn't too big of a deal. At least not for now.</p>\n<p>There was a flash just around the bend, accompanied by the shuffling of footsteps.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, everyone, stay close by and follow the flag!\" a middle-aged woman wearing a matching blue vest, button-up, and an ascot walked around the corner. She was carrying with her a megaphone and a flag with her company's guided tour logo on it. Following her was a gaggle of twenty or so other men and women, all of them wielding cameras.</p>\n<p>\"We are currently in a highly important narrative area; the location where Dr. Lillihammer, who you can see standing over there \u2014\" she continued into the megaphone, bringing the group to a stop in front of the memetecist and pointing at her with the flag. \"\u2014 no flash photography please! She will remain standing here for most of the duration of this Deadline; her brain having been turned to mush by the Breach of 2003,\" she carried on as the guided tour began gawking and taking pictures.</p>\n<p>\"Three,\" Lillihammer agreed.</p>\n<p>\"Now, if you could all please follow me, I will be activating our spatial-temporal scramblers, as we are about to witness a key moment in the history of this Deadline, and meet someone we haven't met before!\" the tour guide momentarily bundled both objects she carried on her right arm, reached for her left wrist, and pressed a button. \"You might feel a slight discomfort, and remember, Nyorai Sightseeing is not responsible for temporal displacement as a result of interfering with the timeline, so please, hands and feet to yourselves!\"</p>\n<p>\"Yourselves.\" Lillihammer echoed.</p>\n<p>The group slowly faded into the background of the room they found themselves in just as a pair of footsteps began approaching. Eventually, they gave way to the appearance of Daniil Sokolsky in a tank top, khaki shorts and flip-flops. He stopped in front of her cocked head, and smiled sadly.</p>\n<p>\"Evening,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Evening,\" she said back.<br/>\n<br/></p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span><span style=\"color: #990011\">?????</span></span></h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>Unknown</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"><strong>Nyorai Sightseeing Headquarters, Saitama Prefecture, Kanto, Japan</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Nyorai Sightseeing employee office reeked of stale cigarettes and air freshener, locked in a stalemate for dominance over which scent was more offensive.</p>\n<p>\"I can't believe they have me traveling to Canada \u2014\" Mizumi, one of the seniormost tour guides of the company, sighed between drags of her cigarette. \"\u2014 I don't care about Canada.

Please follow the flag!\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/if-they-like-you-i-like-you\">A short redhead woman accompanied by a squat, schlubby man walked towards the ADDC incinerator room from the document storage up ahead.</a> They were locked in conversation and not paying much attention to the shuffling of feet of the group of tourists.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. The anomalous document that killed Lyse\u2026 I have the last of it. It won't hurt anyone ever again.\" the woman walked towards the blast furnace, opening it up and tossing in a few documents into it. \"053213-12321-RVA abated.\"</p>\n<p>\"Noted. Do you think maybe you'll start your own family after this?\" the man asked.</p>\n<p>\"This is Dr. Ilse Reynders and her associate, Researcher Jackson Westwicke,\" Mizumi shout-whispered over the roaring of the blast furnace the other two were operating. The crowd <em>ooh'd</em> and <em>aah'd</em>, taking non-flash pictures in the dark. Mizumi knew better than to expect these pictures to look any sort of good, but telling the tourists that wasn't part of her job description, so she didn't bother. \"They are about to incinerate the fateful document which results in Dr. Reynders becoming SCP-5616,\" she added.</p>\n<p>More <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em>. More images. Due to the nature of her position, there was a lot she felt she could do to spare a lot of people a lot of suffering, but the timeline must be maintained. She was paid to be an apathetic observer, catering to people who enjoyed watching those about to suffer a great deal of misery, all while maintaining a smile on her face. She didn't know how Mako kept a smile on her face. Mizumi sighed, watching as Reynders and Jackson continued.</p>\n<p>\"053214-12413-RVD abated.\"</p>\n<p>\"Noted. But, Ilse, do you think you'll ever have a family of your own?\"</p>\n<p>\"053214-12437-RVE abated.

Mizumi swallowed spit and made her way toward the door, turning it open and entering.</p>\n<p>The way to the other side felt like an eternity. She could smell alcohol, cigars, and food up ahead, the combination of which made her dizzy. Pictures of various events Nyorai Sightseeing offered tours to populated the walls, warping into a colorful mishmash of rainbow vomit as she walked.</p>\n<p>Her trek down the hallway eventually came to an end, and she opened the door to her boss' office. She entered, and immediately saw him sitting behind his desk. There were papers strewn everywhere, a lit Cuban cigar resting between his fingers, a cold beer and bento box sitting on his desk, balding head, shitty mustache, and fat, greasy folds of flesh stuffed into a suit.</p>\n<p>\"Mizumi-kun,\" he smiled like the reaper does to a dead man, \"your most recent, shall we say, incident, has caused, quite the, heh, uproar.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry, Murata-sensei.

At least not for now.\n\n\n\nThere was a flash just around the bend, accompanied by the shuffling of footsteps.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, everyone, stay close by and follow the flag!\" a middle-aged woman wearing a matching blue vest, button-up, and an ascot walked around the corner. She was carrying with her a megaphone and a flag with her company's guided tour logo on it. Following her was a gaggle of twenty or so other men and women, all of them wielding cameras. \n\n\n\n\"We are currently in a highly important narrative area; the location where Dr. Lillihammer, who you can see standing over there \u2014\" she continued into the megaphone, bringing the group to a stop in front of the memetecist and pointing at her with the flag. \"\u2014 no flash photography please! She will remain standing here for most of the duration of this Deadline; her brain having been turned to mush by the Breach of 2003,\" she carried on as the guided tour began gawking and taking pictures.\n\n\n\n\"Three,\" Lillihammer agreed.\n\n\n\n\"Now, if you could all please\u00a0\u00a0follow me, I will be activating our spatial-temporal scramblers, as we are about to witness a key moment in the history of this Deadline, and meet someone we haven't met before!\" the tour guide momentarily bundled both objects she carried on her right arm, reached for her left wrist, and pressed a button. \"You might feel a slight discomfort, and remember, Nyorai Sightseeing is not responsible for temporal displacement as a result of interfering with the timeline, so please, hands and feet to yourselves!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yourselves.\" Lillihammer echoed.\n\n\n\nThe group slowly faded into the background of the room they found themselves in just as a pair of footsteps began approaching. Eventually, they gave way to the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0Daniil Sokolsky in a tank top, khaki shorts and flip-flops. He stopped in front of her cocked head, and smiled sadly.\n\n\n\n\"Evening,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Evening,\" she said back.\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=image nyorai.svg width=\"150px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ ##990011|?????##\n\n\n\n++ Unknown\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**Nyorai Sightseeing Headquarters, Saitama Prefecture, Kanto, Japan**[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe Nyorai Sightseeing employee office reeked of stale cigarettes and air freshener, locked in a stalemate for dominance over which scent was more offensive.\n\n\n\n\"I can't believe they have me traveling to Canada \u2014\" Mizumi, one of the seniormost tour guides of the company, sighed between drags of her cigarette. \"\u2014 I don't care about Canada.

The crowd //ooh'd// and //aah'd//, taking non-flash pictures in the dark. Mizumi knew better than to expect these pictures to look any sort of good, but telling the tourists that wasn't part of her job description, so she didn't bother.\u00a0\u00a0\"They are about to incinerate the fateful document which results in Dr. Reynders becoming SCP-5616,\" she added.\n\n\n\nMore //oohs// and //aahs//. More images. Due to the nature of her position, there was a lot she felt she could do to spare a lot of people a lot of suffering, but the timeline must be maintained. She was paid to be an apathetic observer, catering to people who enjoyed watching those about to suffer a great deal of misery, all while maintaining a smile on her face. She didn't know how Mako kept a smile on her face. Mizumi sighed, watching as Reynders and Jackson continued.\n\n\n\n\"053214-12413-RVD abated.\"\n\n\n\n\"Noted.

As if the voice alone were holding the door aloft, it shut immediately after with a gentle click. \n\n\n\nMako and Kana dodged eye contact as if it would be the death of them. Mizumi swallowed spit and made her way toward the door, turning it open and entering. \n\n\n\nThe way to the other side felt like an eternity.

Pictures of various events Nyorai Sightseeing offered tours to populated the walls, warping into a colorful mishmash of rainbow vomit as she walked.\n\n\n\nHer trek down the hallway eventually came to an end, and she opened the door to her boss' office. She entered, and immediately saw him sitting behind his desk. There were papers strewn everywhere, a lit Cuban cigar resting between his fingers, a cold beer and bento box sitting on his desk, balding head, shitty mustache, and fat, greasy folds of flesh stuffed into a suit.\n\n\n\n\"Mizumi-kun,\" he smiled like the reaper does to a dead man, \"your most recent, shall we say, incident, has caused, quite the, heh, uproar.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, Murata-sensei.

It\u2019s one of the Chicago Spirit\u2019s holes, not the main establishment but enough of an ancillary that the same ghosts haunt the chairs, the same vices the dirty windows.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath as the alcohol does little favors for the buzzing inside of his head. For the orange glow of the bar smearing into his retinas. His day has been long, prepping bodies for the Spirit\u2019s undertakers, reporting the findings to the Foundation. Slaving away at a typewriter until he forgot who he was in the words, in the solid clacks of metal keys going up and down and up and down and up and down, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so much tedium, so many bodily fluids. So many gunshot wounds he\u2019s almost jealous of, as often his days were longer than he wanted them to be. The gray offices of the Foundation were never inviting, especially to double agents. It was almost as if the halls could see teetering hearts.</p>\n<p>There needs to be someone inside him within the hour or else he\u2019s going to lose his mind.</p>\n<p>With a sigh, he swivels around on his barstool like he\u2019s turning over a corpse.</p>\n<p>A dock-worker here, a foreman there. A couple of fishermen are crowding near where the bathrooms are.</p>\n<p>No, none of those will do. From the looks of them, all were married, and at least most were devoted husbands. At least, that\u2019s how he pictures them in his mind from his experiences. Union men always seemed so fiercely dedicated to whatever they could manage to think about, often to their own detriment.</p>\n<p>What about\u2014hm, no, the women won\u2019t do either. Well\u2014maybe? He does not find their breasts attractive or their smooth, hairless bodies as enticing, but a body was a body, and if they were going to be useful to the Spirit, they might as well please him, even if he was one of the lowest on their totem pole.</p>\n<p>Warren considers his options for a second before competition walks into the bar. A girl with bright makeup sashays in from the Chicago chill and sits down in one of the chairs. She\u2019s snappily clad in a short black dress, hair cut short while sporting slick, white foundation that makes her look like a porcelain doll. Her lipstick is as red as blood, just to tie the package up all together. Her eyes mirror Warren's, darting from face to face, trying to find tonight's mark.</p>\n<p>The working types\u2014if she\u2019s here, she\u2019s definitely under Madam Bullfinch, the premiere ringleader of the Spirit\u2019s gaggle of women in heels. Prostitution was a dying industry, what with the mayor's constituency always nagging at him to take care of the \"vice\" problem, but the trade still clung on stubbornly in places. As with Prohibition, even criminal markets have their dedicated clientele. It was good to have them on retainer for Chappell too, the Chicago Spirit\u2019s leader, or his many people he needed to please. Derringer, his youngest underboss, was insatiable.</p>\n<p>Warren, after all, moonlighted in their services from time to time. He needed the money just as they did, even if he only did it some days.</p>\n<p><em>Please, someone, anyone,</em> he thinks. He\u2019s finished his drink, the burn having since left his throat. It leaves his mouth empty, and wanting. He doesn\u2019t want to go back to his empty apartment, doesn\u2019t want to tell his landlord he\u2019ll be late with rent again.</p>\n<p>He just needs a little more time.</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t want to approach. He doesn\u2019t want to beg, not now at least. It\u2019s better to be grabbed by the hand, seen for the lithe, skinny blonde that he is, with wide hazel eyes that glitter like amber and catch the light at certain angles to become gold. Charming someone is much easier than asserting oneself, because he knows his reputation precedes him.</p>\n<p>As Madam Bullfinch put it in that shrill voice, he was an anomaly. The taboo of taboos, desirable in the most queer of ways to men most would consider unholy, perverse, and sinful, or simply to lonely women whose husbands made them feel all of that and then less than dirt. Take the pick of which was worse.</p>\n<p>Warren knows that money makes people look the other way most of the time. The men of the Spirit were haggard, rough, and spike-tongued\u2014but it was in their nature to overlook hideousness if it wasn\u2019t fucking around in their face. It was in their nature as those who toyed with magic and made use of monsters to accept that the world was stranger than they first thought, and that such oddities extended just as much to people as it did the concrete jungle they made their livings in.</p>\n<p>When should he start letting that bother him? Will they eventually hurt him too? Will it be with tommy-guns or bruised knuckle fists pounding him into the pavement until he\u2019s lost his life?</p>\n<p>Warren loses himself in that thought as a distraction from himself until a large shadow enters the Devil\u2019s Rest.</p>\n<p>Everyone perks to take notice. The men shudder as black trails over the wall and creeps up glass bottles, while the women begin tensing their hands into supple, cradled fists as its edge caresses their skirts. The air crackles with unwrought tension, hot and dark like some kind of hole wanting to swallow the sun. Every old nook and cranny bathed in orange light from the bar now wants to be stripped of the privilege of life.</p>\n<p>The shadow belongs to a tall, pale man in a black trench coat. It cascades down his form in a flayed, tapered silhouette, masculine in its simplicity and height with shiny shoes completing the entire look. He is sharp in angles and fashion, like a razor blade over skin.</p>\n<p>His eyes stare. Warren holds his breath. The man is handsome to him, dashingly so, his face chiseled and Freshly shaved, his eyes cuttingly hued.</p>\n<p>Warren finds his tongue caught in his throat when that shadow turns to him, smothering his entire body. The man does not acknowledge the pupils in the room tracing over his bodiless form, except for that of Warren\u2019s.</p>\n<p>The bartender stiffens. The stranger approaches.</p>\n\n<p>He gazes deeply into his face, hovering over a seat until he sits down next to him without any words. When he quietly orders a shot of bourbon, he slips the bartender a hefty tip to shoo him away.</p>\n<p>Warren\u2019s face heats up. Up close, the man looks like some kind of sculpture. Perfectly angular jawline, stoutly lipped pout, tastefully thick eyebrows. Even his ebony hat frames his face in a boxy manner which forces Warren to imagine it looking down at him in a bedroom glowing with rose-scented candles.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need something, sir\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The man interrupts him without hesitation. \u201cThe Madam informed me that you would be available today. Palmer House, room 304, you are to be in in the lobby at half-past seven exactly. You will find a key to my room in your pocket as soon as you leave this pitiable establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren blinks. The man sucks his bourbon down like it\u2019s water, hands tense and his expression deeply wrung. With wide eyes, Warren stares into his like he is being dragged in by a net, each passing second a deeper cut of the rope burning into his skin.</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s eyes are a deep, deep sapphire blue. Blue enough to shine, vivid enough to cleave. They shimmer like something that makes Warren\u2019s heart flutter for just a moment before he reminds himself what he is doing, what tonight will be, and how he\u2019ll need to get out of this unscathed.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s business and nothing else. Business and getting his pound of flesh, however he has to do it. Meek as he was, Warren still prided himself on wanting specific things\u2026hopefully.</p>\n<p>He nods quietly, and the man leaves. Behind him, on the stool, lies a golden coin with a woman\u2019s face on it, her curls beautiful and defined. She is looking up at smooth edges so impossible that one might have mistaken the coin for a mirror.</p>\n<p>Warren picks it up with a held breath, clenching his fist when a surge of <em>something</em> rushes through his veins.</p>\n<p><em>Shit\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Whew, he\u2019s still alive. And nobody saw that.</p>\n<p>He looks out the door, out the swinging doors of the Devil\u2019s Rest, where the man has long disappeared into the mire of Chicago.</p>\n<p>That\u2026That wasn\u2019t magic of the Spirit\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t even magic Warren had heard of, and he was exposed to practically everything it could offer a corpse. Of the myriad ways for someone to die, either by accident or the Spirit\u2019s torture, this was\u2026something worse.</p>\n<p>Something deeper, more bestial.</p>\n<p>Something carnal, more venomous.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances he\u2019d throw the coin away and run, run; run as far and as fast away as he could to his Foundation supervisor\u2014</p>\n<p>But he fancies that whatever money he\u2019ll make tonight can buy him a nice dessert tomorrow after lunch. He\u2019s got to have some change left over.</p>\n<p>Something to make up for the emptiness that will still be there when this romp is all said and done.</p>\n<p>It\u2019ll all be worth the pain this coin can cause, surely.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>7:27PM. Warren has been waiting for thirty minutes. He arrived here early, just in case he heard wrong or if some curse was about to sprung upon him in the case of lateness. The Spirit occasionally used those kinds of magicks to deal with tardiness.</p>\n<p>The Palmer House smells expensive. Whiskey from New Jersey, lemon liqueurs from Italy, even some wine from the south of France\u2014it all glitters against polished wine cabinets and dark wood floors. It\u2019s enough to make him bend his head and pretend nothing is happening, nothing will happen to him. He won\u2019t break any of these, nobody will look at him strangely for being in here, he\u2019s not going to be jumped for being some poor thing tumbling in for a handout\u2014just keep your head bent, Warren. Keep it bent.</p>\n<p>He has to wear a special suit when out in public like this, the only thing afforded to him by Madam Bullfinch when he began moonlighting as\u2026well.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t like the word. Nobody does, not even the prostitutes themselves. But he\u2019s in a league of his own here, being a man and reveling in the sin of the painted woman. It\u2019s an odd crossroads to be at\u2014it was even odder given his age and even stranger talent from that. He was much older than the youth often employed to turn tricks, but by some stroke of luck, he barely looked a day over twenty-five. Supple cheeks, smooth button nose, a full head of lusciously fluffy hair\u2014if he wasn't wearing the clothes he was now, he swears he would have been mistaken for a girl. He sometimes was, as a child.</p>\n<p>Why the wealthy homosexuals of Chicago were so obsessed with youthfulness, he doesn\u2019t know. He made more money for the secrecy of their perversions, but he felt all the more invisible, all the more liable to slip into the real reason he began this in the first place, when he still had his savings moving to this city.</p>\n<p>The hole within him\u2014when he first stumbled into Chicago from London after the Great War, he had already lost something close to his heart that broke it in two. A dear friend, a doctor, a man who loved books as much as he loved to teach. That man, Warren dares not remember his name or visage in public\u2014made him feel <em>alive.</em> Electric, rambunctious, anxious and hasty\u2014Warren could not help but want to spend more and more time with him as the years passed on and they were going through the motions together\u2014</p>\n<p>Of course, all good things must come to an end. His dear friend perished just a year before the Great War\u2019s end, victim of the same disease afflicting a soldier he tried to save.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, it\u2019s been a ghost of a chase. A specter of a high, a glimpse of a silhouette, a hope some soul could mend what was burned and then left to rot in its own vomit. A hope that a man could lift him from this wretched morass.</p>\n<p>Failing that, sex came as the second best thing. It was quicker, and easier too.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t order any drinks or food, checking the clock as soon as it hits the arranged time. There was the slimmest possibility he would be asked to share room service, some kind of finger food or luscious desserts. That was a very recent addition to the Palmer House\u2019s amenities, and only afforded to those who could afford the faceless privacy, but Warren had been given a sample twice already. Once by an oil baron\u2019s son, the other an industrialist who owned a great many emerald mines.</p>\n<p>\u2026There.</p>\n<p>The man coasts through the crowd like something less than a spirit. His trenchcoat seems to leave a residue on the floor that nobody notices, for dozens of polished heels amale over it without restraint.</p>\n<p>The protocol is to wait. To avoid suspicion, Warren was to trail him approximately a minute after he was out of sight, ideally when he can see nobody in the stairwell that looks important. Discretion could hardly be bought in a mulling crowd as lively as this, but better the lobby be full with eavesdroppers than the halls.</p>\n<p>They were everywhere if you knew where to look.</p>\n<p>When he finds himself moving, he wonders what the pay is. This wasn\u2019t just about money, obviously, but Madam Bullfinch always insisted upon a larger cut of Warren\u2019s pay than the girls. Forty-sixty, as her husband Perch put it, take it or leave it. Was it because he fetched higher prices? Each session was usually a hundred dollars, an ungodly amount of cash in this day and age.</p>\n<p>He gets to the room soon enough. Warren slips in without trouble, having scanned the hallways thoroughly. The air feels electric, wired like a spring, ready to splatter at any moment. Especially over the silken sheets, the chandelier hanging over their heads, the crystal clear window upon which he now looks down at the winding streets of Chicago.</p>\n<p>As he locks the door, he notices the man still hasn\u2019t undressed past his outer layers.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Excuse me? Sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>No response.</p>\n<p>Warren sits down on the bed. His suit is ill-fitting, just a tad\u2014off-the-rack ones weren\u2019t sized very well for someone with shoulders as small as his.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can get started now if you li\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood,\u201d the man says curtly. Warren swiftly realizes that he missed that this stranger had a posh, royal British accent from their first meeting. Did Madam Bullfinch nmiss that too? This person was from very, very out of town.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026What am I here for then?\u201d he asks with as much restraint as he can muster. His suit is going to take forever to wash, and he got it out for this?</p>\n<p>The man looks over at Warren with those eyes again. Glinting in the room\u2019s yellow light, they are no longer comforting, but instead filled with a sick, stolid curiosity that flutters as he blinks.</p>\n<p>Warren gasps as he\u2019s grabbed in what is a very solid, cold hand. Part of the man\u2019s face is hidden by his upturned collar and his shadow.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Lithe little thing. You look like a weeping willow more than you do a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Warren could sigh, he would. Everything about him is smooth, from his face to his chest to even his ass.</p>\n<p>This was what he sold himself on, but to be so openly complimented on it in settings like this made him wonder if he could be more. If he had more food to eat, could he gain weight to make that go away? Could he grow taller somehow, maybe, just to hit heights like his father and other brothers did? Everyone in the family was tall, even him, but somehow there was always a man taller. Always a man somehow looking at him like he was some thing more than he was a person.</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019d finally look his age if he was a person. He certainly felt both the fear of arrest and arrested development, yet by some deigned order from God he\u2019s stuck with a perpetual baby face no matter what he does.</p>\n<p>He assumes the man is complimenting him. He has to be. With one swift motion, Warren guides his hand to cup his cheek, thinking this is what he wants. He must be here to merely look at him, afraid to fully commit to the act. No matter, Warren could work with this. It was going to be a monumental pain, but maybe he could\u2026help him be comfortable.</p>\n<p>As soon as he leans into the touch, the man jerks his hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d he growls. \u201cDo not touch me unless I say to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren\u2019s eyes go wide. He gets up to speak, but the man pushes him back down to the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay. I am here tonight to look at something. Satisfy a curiosity of mine, and I will double your pay. Since I know you will wish to inquire more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA curiosity?\u201d Warren\u2019s voice comes out as a hoarse squeak. He didn\u2019t mean to say that aloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d the man replies stoutly, frowning. His lips are thinner than Warren\u2019s. \u201cI promise, you will not be injured.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM-Madam Bullfinch will know if you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat little pest can suck on her hands for all I care. I paid for you, tonight is <em>my</em> time. I chose you for a specific reason, <em>boy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren shudders, freezing up as the man goes back to\u2026not fondling his face, but tracing it with his finger. Thumbing his jawline. Whatever was him running his fingers over the wet corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p>This is followed by him running that same thumb over his cheekbones, nearing his eyes. Warren wonders if there\u2019s the intention to sink skin into his eye sockets, because he\u2019s absolutely defenseless right now. He could bleed so, <em>so</em> easily.</p>\n<p>The man sighs, and retracts his hand. He shakes it off like there\u2019s a filth on it, wiping it on a handkerchief he pulls out quickly from his pocket. It\u2019s woven with the most delicate threads Warren thought possible for a piece of cloth.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren pauses, but obliges him. First comes off his pants, then his shirt. He\u2019s cold, but resists showing it. Soon, it\u2019s just him in his underwear.</p>\n<p>The man sighs, motioning for Warren to hold out a hand. He does, and he shudders, but he is still otherwise. Everything in the air, from the cigar smoke lingering on the bedsheets to the wine aromas staining the ceiling feels like needles.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the man pulls out a real needle.</p>\n<p>A large one. Sleek, golden, and with a beautiful marble cameo at the top.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteady,\u201d he says as Warren does nothing. He doesn\u2019t jerk away, no, that would be rude, but his heart races as he thinks of the coin again and all of the ways he could be stabbed with such a sharp instrument. It was very similar to the tools he used at work to cut open corpses\u2014why?</p>\n<p>They\u2019re not necessarily unpleasant thoughts. In some ways, he would have loved for the man to drag that needle across his skin, just to feel something. Bonus if he told him to take it.</p>\n<p>It would be so <em>thrilling</em>, so, so, so thrilling. So much more thrilling than anything he\u2019d get in the morgue or the Foundation\u2019s offices.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo this and I will triple your pay tonight. <em>Without</em> telling the Madam\u2014it will be our little secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s deep baritone voice sends steel shivers down Warren\u2019s spine. He didn\u2019t need to be told to hide things from Madam Bullfinch, practically all of his clients did something she\u2019d find offensive in some way or another. Their secrets were meant to die with him, obviously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold out your arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren complies. The needle glows pink for just a second\u2014was that a trick of the light?</p>\n<p>The man prods and pokes Warren\u2019s inner arm, as if for a vein. Warren does not breathe for as long as he touches him. Quickly he takes that long sharp point and pricks deep into pallid flesh, muttering a phrase in some unknown language while a small light glows from the tip of his fingernails.</p>\n<p>Most people would have run by now. Most people would have screamed. But something in Warren always makes him stay when the offensive acts happen. He\u2019s not meant to just to be poured into, but cut, bled, and thrown around. Pick him up, crush him into pieces\u2014something told him he wouldn\u2019t entirely care, and he didn\u2019t know why that didn\u2019t scare him now as much as it did when he was younger.</p>\n<p>Make him useful, do something with his body. Create something temporary disguised as forever with semen, fondling, and bodily fluids. Whatever marked him as something above the dirt he felt like, just for a little bit. Just for a little bit.</p>\n<p>Just for a little bit.</p>\n<p>Girls didn\u2019t last long in this business before being forced out by the cops. But the ones who did grew older with a plethora of arm scars.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I may ask, what\u2014\u201d Warren clears his throat, now reverting to a servicing tone. \u201cIs the point of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will see in a moment,\u201d the man replies. \u201cWhen you pass out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren gasps as he\u2019s grabbed by his neck, without warning, shaken by the man as he\u2019s pushed back and everything goes black.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When he stirs, the room smells like cream. It smells like something dead floating in a vat of ice cream, as if the mild, milky sweetness was meant to smother something always destined to drown.</p>\n<p>His chest feels heavy. As do his hips. And his legs feel\u2026smoother?</p>\n<p>Warren coughs, sitting up. The man is eating some rosy macarons off a golden treat cart.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-Where am I?\u201d Thank god he still sounds like himself. \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>No reply. The door is still locked.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook in the mirror,\u201d he says as he pops a puff pastry into his mouth. Warren drools a bit, until he realizes his lips are wet with\u2026something else.</p>\n<p>Wet with\u2026wait, what?</p>\n<p>Why do his hands feel so small?</p>\n<p>A tall, silver mirror sits erect besides him. Without any words, Warren slowly arches his neck over, realizing quickly that it\u2019s missing its\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren bolts upright, clutching his chest and privates. He stumbles over himself, tripping onto the floor, the man snarling at him with pointed fangs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do to me?!\u201d His voice doesn\u2019t match his appearance anymore. It doesn\u2019t match his new long curly blonde hair, his skinny little waist, or the sleek, slender legs he now sports.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy am I a\u2014a\u2014?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Keep your voice down,</em>\u201d the man hisses at him. Warren swallows spit that tastes like foundation and lipstick.</p>\n<p>Turning back to the mirror again, he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s become. To say he was a woman was an understatement\u2014he looked like someone halfway shoved into a different body. While his legs were skinny, his feet remained the same size, same with his shoulders. Though there was fat padding his thighs, it felt like there was a phantom weight between his legs that should have been there, hanging down.</p>\n<p>None of that was mentioning his face looked exactly the same. Same jaw, same lips, same nose, everything.</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t proper for a woman.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026You look off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren stares, catatonic. His eyes water as he shakes.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Please,\u201d he begs, thinking of what his father might say if he saw him, his coworkers at the Foundation. The Spirit, even.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d The man sits down on the bed with little empathy in his voice. \u201cI did you a favor, did I not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren blinks, his hands going to his thighs. He squeezes, his breathing fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man rolls his eyes. \u201cWhy <em>what?</em> Stop asking me questions. Stand up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course he obliges.</p>\n<p>The man approaches Warren and grabs his jaw again. Warren wants to cry watching him, beautiful even if his silhouette was obscured by clothing. He looks like what Warren should be. What he <em>wanted</em> to be: aged, and chiseled to perfection. Capable of growing facial hair, needing the routine to shave it and keep it down\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t this work\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren freezes, tensing. He grips his chest and shudders. His breasts don\u2019t feel like they belong to him. They\u2019re far too large.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour face looks odd for a woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren nods. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour hair is beautiful, but why are your shoulders still so wide?\u201d</p>\n<p>He whimpers. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man mutters something about fairy glamours under his breath that Warren can\u2019t quite hear. \u201cAre you not enjoying this?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Are you not enjoying this?</em></p>\n<p>Asked to him during a drag party back in 1934. One of the oddest things about the Chicago Spirit was the kinds of people they let into their bars. There was no decorum about who needed a drink; no noses turned up at who came in and out of their dusty floors with want on their breath. Wayward souls, straggling whores, homeless rats, all were welcome if you had the money for a drink.</p>\n<p>But for a while a few years ago they played host to something else.</p>\n<p>Warren turns to the mirror again and compares himself to the people he saw back then. Large, beautiful men in makeup and lipstick, prancing around in red dress with women below them hanging off each others\u2019 arms. They\u2019re making obscene gestures and speaking in even more obscene tongues as a piano plays, the air smelling of sex, lust, and liquor the more the night goes on.</p>\n<p>His frame looks like them. In this very queer new body of his, halfway to his desires and halfway out of it, he feels like he\u2019s playing pretend. Both with men, the sex his heart belonged to, and what it wasn\u2019t, what he\u2019s sure is a false skin that he must take off sooner rather than later if he is to keep his sanity.</p>\n<p>Why did those people do what they did? He didn\u2019t know. He sure as hell didn\u2019t ask. Tacky feather boas, fur coats made of mink and clacky heels\u2014what motivates a man to wear something like that? What motivates women to see that type of clothing as desirable, except obligation?</p>\n<p>What motivates a drag queen to prance around and blur those lines?</p>\n<p>Allegedly Chappell, the leader of the Chicago Spirit, watched those kinds of people. Lesbians, pansies, homosexuals of all types. Nobody knew why; Warren had heard the jokes that he was one of them, but he dared not repeat those in polite company unless he wanted three bullets in his head, unless he wanted to be one of the bodies in the morgue he went to everyday.</p>\n<p>The man frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He stutters for a few more moments. Warren looks back at him.</p>\n<p>His eyes\u2014 His pupils\u2014</p>\n<p>They\u2019re slits, like a cat\u2019s.</p>\n<p>When did that happen?</p>\n<p>Warren clears his throat. \u201c\u2026Can you change me back?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man does not respond. Warren sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2026it can\u2019t be permanent,\u201d Warren says shakily.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be squirming more,\u201d the man replies.</p>\n<p>Warren can only turn to him and lean against a vanity.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man looks like a statue when he pouts, when his lifeless eyes are wide and boring into flesh. Warren twirls his hair with long, bony fingers and slumps. Thank god he doesn\u2019t have clothes on right now.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Do you dream of this?\u201d is all the man asks, quiet and solemn, coming down from an authoritative tone. It sounds like the physical embodiment of rust forming.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf being a woman?\u201d Warren considers his answer for a moment. He could be honest, say no and go home. He could be true to his soul and recall the hideous fact his father nearly drowned him as a child because he got too close to the other boys at school. <em>Boys are for women, and women are for the boys,</em> he said.</p>\n<p>But perhaps there is something to be had here. Perhaps this man just needs some\u2026coaxing.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps there is something within him that needs to be dug out.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery man dreams of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s pupil\u2019s dilate. He stutters over his next words a little bit, leaning forward.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Really? It makes life so difficult for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, are you not into the fairer sex? It\u2019s not as queer of an affinity as you think it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man stands up straight, glaring.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would loathe to touch you if I was given the option. Don\u2019t lie to me, boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren gasps as a hand reaches and grabs him, pulling him down by his hair. The man hovers over him with a burning hatred, his palms beginning to smell like smoke. His fangs glitter with frustration, and the crackling of a quick flick of magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are lying to me. Foul little thing. Good-for-nothing whore. I don\u2019t even know why I bothered with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren whines, falling to the floor when he\u2019s thrown aside. The man\u2019s trenchcoat catches on his foot and he kicks him, leering deeply at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tears. All Warren can do is summon tears. He covers himself as if he\u2019ll be hit again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy lie to me?\u201d the man asks, guttural and clear. \u201cI know it\u2019s part of your\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses, looking down at his own hands as if they\u2019re imprinted over Warren\u2019s. Warren catches just the smallest glimpse of the man\u2019s face stitching together in terror just before he turns away.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nature.</em> But I came here seeking the truth, and you cannot be bothered to overcome yourself for a single moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>No words. There\u2019s nothing to be said, nothing to be done while in this body. Womb of truth, womb of lies. Warren just hopes he doesn\u2019t have one\u2014his sisters had the worst periods growing up.</p>\n<p>This has to be temporary. He can feel wisps of smoke trailing off his breasts as he struggles to get back up. Where it left, it peels away skin, peels it away in a painful, pink polish dripping down his muscles and legs.</p>\n<p>The man scoffs. He throws something at Warren, something soft, yet hard enough to roll his head over just a bit. What was inside of it?</p>\n<p><em>He threw a wallet at me?</em> Warren thinks as he sits up. He wipes the fake lipstick off his mouth readily.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it. Take your pay and leave. Disgusting little cretin\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no use in protesting. Warren knows it won\u2019t work, knows that for someone as rich as this, there\u2019s no use in really anything at all. He\u2019ll have his way whether he wants to or not, he\u2019ll languish in his own misery like a thick stew simmering to burnt.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s inevitable. He wishes it wasn\u2019t, but this is just the way things are.</p>\n<p>What matters now is making sure he\u2019ll get out of this alive. Out of this in one piece ideally, because if he died, well, he'd want to go in some dignity. The idea of being buried in a potter\u2019s field because no one recognized him\u2014Warren had few concerns about death, but that was perhaps the worst fate for someone like him in his mind.</p>\n<p>He grabs sheets off the bed and pulls them over himself in a frenzy. The man is gathering his things to leave, shoving everything into a little bag taking far more than its size should allow. The way he moves is haphazard, clunky, stuttering almost, like a lightbulb flickering on and off. Warren didn't know someone could shake so much.</p>\n<p>His sloughing form receives not a goodbye, but a door slam and a turning of a lock.</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>Silence as the world mills about outside, as heavy footsteps eventually disappear and the spinning in his head finally goes away.</p>\n<p>Ah, what is he to do now?</p>\n<p>Warren looks back to himself in the mirror one more time. He wipes dirt off his cheek that he quickly realizes is just the magic used to transform him now going bad. Ugh. Why did it have to look like stained milk?</p>\n<p>Best to wait this out, then escape through the window when he could find his composure.</p>\n<p>Not the way Warren wanted this to end, but at least he was still a man at the end of the day. At least he got his pay, and can take it back to Madam Bullfinch.</p>\n<p>That was the best thing in the world for someone like him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Percival Darke arrives at his limousine quickly, panting as cold air burns his lungs. The image of Warren won\u2019t leave his mind; it festers as he takes his seat and barks a command to his driver.</p>\n<p>Why didn\u2019t it work? <em>Why didn\u2019t it work?</em> God, it was the latest development in glamour magic and it still didn\u2019t change his voice. It still refused to touch his mind. Those damn fairies\u2014did he forget to read some fine print? Did they trick him with some verbal loophole again? If so, there was going to be a lot of meetings when he got back to London. Lots of wringing that stupid queen Ortellica and making sure she knew to keep her subjects in line.</p>\n<p>He was definitely lying, but Percival wants to believe him. He wants to believe the word of one who barely looked like a man in the first place, the ideal image to Percival as far as men went. They were nothing special to look at unless they were small, boyish, and coy like flowers in a field, destined to die at any moment.</p>\n<p>But those weren\u2019t the kind of men who did well in business. Anyone like that knows better than to remain like that for long\u2014put your suit on, straighten your shoulders, avoid bad company. Avoid bad company at all costs, avoid the kinds of people who would love you so fiercely for that kind of appearance.</p>\n<p>Does what Percival did tonight make him one of them?</p>\n<p>One of the perverts, one of the degenerates? One of the mollies, one of the in-group queers that pranced around Chicago as they did London, New York, Paris, and Amsterdam?</p>\n<p>He shudders as his mind wanders intrusively to the kind of glares he would get from his clients. Knowing who he contacted, what he did to him, how he did it. The mere idea of them watching him asking that question, so needy and pathetic and <em>desperate.</em></p>\n<p>That would mean death. Loss of profits, utter ruin. His partners would view him as a pansy, a freak of nature, something more hideous than sin and lesser than nothing.</p>\n<p>Wasting good magic on such silly little thought experiments\u2026 Expensive magic too. That pathetic ant didn\u2019t deserve any of that.</p>\n<p>So why couldn\u2019t he just walk away?</p>\n<p>Why couldn\u2019t he just have pretended the buzzing in his head didn\u2019t exist again?</p>\n<p>Why get someone involved with that? The affliction that had cursed him ever since he took on a merchant\u2019s life? That poor sap probably barely escaped with his own. And if he did, he\u2019ll probably be contained by the Foundation as some halfway thing until the glamour fully wears off.</p>\n<p>Percival groans as the car pulls into a garage. The darkness reminds him of what he wears, drab barrier blankets between his body and his mind that made him forget how wide his own shoulders were. How narrow his hips were, his legs and his chest.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only the most appropriate attire.</p>\n<p>Too many dreams\u2026 no, nightmares, about becoming a woman. About being a woman. Suffering as they suffer, ravaged as they're ravaged. It's too much. It's all too much.</p>\n<p>And yet never enough. He\u2026He treasures those dreams more than he admits, more than he wants to.</p>\n<p>Waking up like that one day\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>By the time Percival reaches his suite, he has concocted the most elegant of \u2018forget-me\u2019 spells in his mind, one that pairs well with brandy and ice. He will have to give up something later down the line for this little comfort, but the fairies had caused enough trouble today, what was a little more?</p>\n<p>As he pours himself a draught, his finger dipping into the drink to poison it with the taste of honeysuckle, wolfsbane and the waters of Ortellica, he hopes he gets to put this all behind him. That he will never suffer again the misfortune of conducting a charade of this caliber.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only natural. It\u2019s only natural.</p>\n<p>Only natural, unlike everything else that happens so plainly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/skinful-desires\">Skinful Desires</a>\" by xexnoncores, Annorack, and asininestars, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It\u2019s one of the Chicago Spirit\u2019s holes, not the main establishment but enough of an ancillary that the same ghosts haunt the chairs, the same vices the dirty windows.\n\n\n\nHe takes a deep breath as the alcohol does little favors for the buzzing inside of his head. For the orange glow of the bar smearing into his retinas. His day has been long, prepping bodies for the Spirit\u2019s undertakers, reporting the findings to the Foundation. Slaving away at a typewriter until he forgot who he was in the words, in the solid clacks of metal keys going up and down and up and down and up and down, over and over and over again.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s so much tedium, so many bodily fluids. So many gunshot wounds he\u2019s almost jealous of, as often his days were longer than he wanted them to be. The gray offices of the Foundation were never inviting, especially to double agents. It was almost as if the halls could see teetering hearts.\n\n\n\nThere needs to be someone inside him within the hour or else he\u2019s going to lose his mind.\n\n\n\nWith a sigh, he swivels around on his barstool like he\u2019s turning over a corpse. \n\n\n\nA dock-worker here, a foreman there. A couple of fishermen are crowding near where the bathrooms are.\n\n\n\nNo, none of those will do. From the looks of them, all were married, and at least most were devoted husbands. At least, that\u2019s how he pictures them in his mind from his experiences. Union men always seemed so fiercely dedicated to whatever they could manage to think about, often to their own detriment.\n\n\n\nWhat about\u2014hm, no, the women won\u2019t do either. Well\u2014maybe? He does not find their breasts attractive or their smooth, hairless bodies as enticing, but a body was a body, and if they were going to be useful to the Spirit, they might as well please him, even if he was one of the lowest on their totem pole.\n\n\n\nWarren considers his options for a second before competition walks into the bar. A girl with bright makeup sashays in from the Chicago chill and sits down in one of the chairs. She\u2019s snappily clad in a short black dress, hair cut short while sporting slick, white foundation that makes her look like a porcelain doll. Her lipstick is as red as blood, just to tie the package up all together. Her eyes mirror Warren's, darting from face to face, trying to find tonight's mark.\n\n\n\nThe working types\u2014if she\u2019s here, she\u2019s definitely under Madam Bullfinch, the premiere ringleader of the Spirit\u2019s gaggle of women in heels. Prostitution was a dying industry, what with the mayor's constituency always nagging at him to take care of the \"vice\" problem, but the trade still clung on stubbornly in places. As with Prohibition, even criminal markets have their dedicated clientele. It was good to have them on retainer for Chappell too, the Chicago Spirit\u2019s leader, or his many people he needed to please. Derringer, his youngest underboss, was insatiable.\n\n\n\nWarren, after all, moonlighted in their services from time to time. He needed the money just as they did, even if he only did it some days.\n\n\n\n//Please, someone, anyone,// he thinks. He\u2019s finished his drink, the burn having since left his throat. It leaves his mouth empty, and wanting. He doesn\u2019t want to go back to his empty apartment, doesn\u2019t want to tell his landlord he\u2019ll be late with rent again. \n\n\n\nHe just needs a little more time.\n\n\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to approach. He doesn\u2019t want to beg, not now at least. It\u2019s better to be grabbed by the hand, seen for the lithe, skinny blonde that he is, with wide hazel eyes that glitter like amber and catch the light at certain angles to become gold. Charming someone is much easier than asserting oneself, because he knows his reputation precedes him. \n\n\n\nAs Madam Bullfinch put it in that shrill voice, he was an anomaly. The taboo of taboos, desirable in the most queer of ways to men most would consider unholy, perverse, and sinful, or simply to lonely women whose husbands made them feel all of that and then less than dirt. Take the pick of which was worse.\n\n\n\nWarren knows that money makes people look the other way most of the time. The men of the Spirit were haggard, rough, and spike-tongued\u2014but it was in their nature to overlook hideousness if it wasn\u2019t fucking around in their face. It was in their nature as those who toyed with magic and made use of monsters to accept that the world was stranger than they first thought, and that such oddities extended just as much to people as it did the concrete jungle they made their livings in.\n\n\n\nWhen should he start letting that bother him? Will they eventually hurt him too? Will it be with tommy-guns or bruised knuckle fists pounding him into the pavement until he\u2019s lost his life? \n\n\n\nWarren loses himself in that thought as a distraction from himself until a large shadow enters the Devil\u2019s Rest. \n\n\n\nEveryone perks to take notice. The men shudder as black trails over the wall and creeps up glass bottles, while the women begin tensing their hands into supple, cradled fists as its edge caresses their skirts. The air crackles with unwrought tension, hot and dark like some kind of hole wanting to swallow the sun. Every old nook and cranny bathed in orange light from the bar now wants to be stripped of the privilege of life.\n\n\n\nThe shadow belongs to a tall, pale man in a black trench coat. It cascades down his form in a flayed, tapered silhouette, masculine in its simplicity and height with shiny shoes completing the entire look. He is sharp in angles and fashion, like a razor blade over skin. \n\n\n\nHis eyes stare. Warren holds his breath. The man is handsome to him, dashingly so, his face chiseled and Freshly shaved, his eyes cuttingly hued.\n\n\n\nWarren finds his tongue caught in his throat when that shadow turns to him, smothering his entire body. The man does not acknowledge the pupils in the room tracing over his bodiless form, except for that of Warren\u2019s.\n\n\n\nThe bartender stiffens. The stranger approaches. \n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/skinful-desires/warren.jpeg]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nHe gazes deeply into his face, hovering over a seat until he sits down next to him without any words. When he quietly orders a shot of bourbon, he slips the bartender a hefty tip to shoo him away.\n\n\n\nWarren\u2019s face heats up. Up close, the man looks like some kind of sculpture. Perfectly angular jawline, stoutly lipped pout, tastefully thick eyebrows. Even his ebony hat frames his face in a boxy manner which forces Warren to imagine it looking down at him in a bedroom glowing with rose-scented candles. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you need something, sir\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man interrupts him without hesitation. \u201cThe Madam informed me that you would be available today. Palmer House, room 304, you are to be in in the lobby at half-past seven exactly. You will find a key to my room in your pocket as soon as you leave this pitiable establishment.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren blinks. The man sucks his bourbon down like it\u2019s water, hands tense and his expression deeply wrung. With wide eyes, Warren stares into his like he is being dragged in by a net, each passing second a deeper cut of the rope burning into his skin. \n\n\n\nThe man\u2019s eyes are a deep, deep sapphire blue. Blue enough to shine, vivid enough to cleave. They shimmer like something that makes Warren\u2019s heart flutter for just a moment before he reminds himself what he is doing, what tonight will be, and how he\u2019ll need to get out of this unscathed. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s business and nothing else. Business and getting his pound of flesh, however he has to do it. Meek as he was, Warren still prided himself on wanting specific things\u2026hopefully.\n\n\n\nHe nods quietly, and the man leaves. Behind him, on the stool, lies a golden coin with a woman\u2019s face on it, her curls beautiful and defined. She is looking up at smooth edges so impossible that one might have mistaken the coin for a mirror.\n\n\n\nWarren picks it up with a held breath, clenching his fist when a surge of //something// rushes through his veins.\n\n\n\n//Shit\u2014//\n\n\n\nWhew, he\u2019s still alive. And nobody saw that.\n\n\n\nHe looks out the door, out the swinging doors of the Devil\u2019s Rest, where the man has long disappeared into the mire of Chicago.\n\n\n\nThat\u2026That wasn\u2019t magic of the Spirit\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t even magic Warren had heard of, and he was exposed to practically everything it could offer a corpse. Of the myriad ways for someone to die, either by accident or the Spirit\u2019s torture, this was\u2026something worse. \n\n\n\nSomething deeper, more bestial.\n\n\n\nSomething carnal, more venomous.\n\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances he\u2019d throw the coin away and run, run; run as far and as fast away as he could to his Foundation supervisor\u2014\n\n\n\nBut he fancies that whatever money he\u2019ll make tonight can buy him a nice dessert tomorrow after lunch. He\u2019s got to have some change left over.\n\n\n\nSomething to make up for the emptiness that will still be there when this romp is all said and done.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019ll all be worth the pain this coin can cause, surely.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n7:27PM. Warren has been waiting for thirty minutes. He arrived here early, just in case he heard wrong or if some curse was about to sprung upon him in the case of lateness. The Spirit occasionally used those kinds of magicks to deal with tardiness. \n\n\n\nThe Palmer House smells expensive. Whiskey from New Jersey, lemon liqueurs from Italy, even some wine from the south of France\u2014it all glitters against polished wine cabinets and dark wood floors. It\u2019s enough to make him bend his head and pretend nothing is happening, nothing will happen to him. He won\u2019t break any of these, nobody will look at him strangely for being in here, he\u2019s not going to be jumped for being some poor thing tumbling in for a handout\u2014just keep your head bent, Warren. Keep it bent.\n\n\n\nHe has to wear a special suit when out in public like this, the only thing afforded to him by Madam Bullfinch when he began moonlighting as\u2026well.\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like the word. Nobody does, not even the prostitutes themselves. But he\u2019s in a league of his own here, being a man and reveling in the sin of the painted woman. It\u2019s an odd crossroads to be at\u2014it was even odder given his age and even stranger talent from that. He was much older than the youth often employed to turn tricks, but by some stroke of luck, he barely looked a day over twenty-five. Supple cheeks, smooth button nose, a full head of lusciously fluffy hair\u2014if he wasn't wearing the clothes he was now, he swears he would have been mistaken for a girl. He sometimes was, as a child.\n\n\n\nWhy the wealthy homosexuals of Chicago were so obsessed with youthfulness, he doesn\u2019t know. He made more money for the secrecy of their perversions, but he felt all the more invisible, all the more liable to slip into the real reason he began this in the first place, when he still had his savings moving to this city.\n\n\n\nThe hole within him\u2014when he first stumbled into Chicago from London after the Great War, he had already lost something close to his heart that broke it in two. A dear friend, a doctor, a man who loved books as much as he loved to teach. That man, Warren dares not remember his name or visage in public\u2014made him feel //alive.// Electric, rambunctious, anxious and hasty\u2014Warren could not help but want to spend more and more time with him as the years passed on and they were going through the motions together\u2014\n\n\n\nOf course, all good things must come to an end. His dear friend perished just a year before the Great War\u2019s end, victim of the same disease afflicting a soldier he tried to save. \n\n\n\nEver since then, it\u2019s been a ghost of a chase. A specter of a high, a glimpse of a silhouette, a hope some soul could mend what was burned and then left to rot in its own vomit. A hope that a man could lift him from this wretched morass. \n\n\n\nFailing that, sex came as the second best thing. It was quicker, and easier too.\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t order any drinks or food, checking the clock as soon as it hits the arranged time. There was the slimmest possibility he would be asked to share room service, some kind of finger food or luscious desserts. That was a very recent addition to the Palmer House\u2019s amenities, and only afforded to those who could afford the faceless privacy, but Warren had been given a sample twice already. Once by an oil baron\u2019s son, the other an industrialist who owned a great many emerald mines.\n\n\n\n\u2026There.\n\n\n\nThe man coasts through the crowd like something less than a spirit. His trenchcoat seems to leave a residue on the floor that nobody notices, for dozens of polished heels amale over it without restraint.\n\n\n\nThe protocol is to wait. To avoid suspicion, Warren was to trail him approximately a minute after he was out of sight, ideally when he can see nobody in the stairwell that looks important. Discretion could hardly be bought in a mulling crowd as lively as this, but better the lobby be full with eavesdroppers than the halls.\n\n\n\nThey were everywhere if you knew where to look.\n\n\n\nWhen he finds himself moving, he wonders what the pay is. This wasn\u2019t just about money, obviously, but Madam Bullfinch always insisted upon a larger cut of Warren\u2019s pay than the girls. Forty-sixty, as her husband Perch put it, take it or leave it. Was it because he fetched higher prices? Each session was usually a hundred dollars, an ungodly amount of cash in this day and age. \n\n\n\nHe gets to the room soon enough. Warren slips in without trouble, having scanned the hallways thoroughly. The air feels electric, wired like a spring, ready to splatter at any moment. Especially over the silken sheets, the chandelier hanging over their heads, the crystal clear window upon which he now looks down at the winding streets of Chicago.\n\n\n\nAs he locks the door, he notices the man still hasn\u2019t undressed past his outer layers.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Excuse me? Sir?\u201d\n\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\nWarren sits down on the bed. His suit is ill-fitting, just a tad\u2014off-the-rack ones weren\u2019t sized very well for someone with shoulders as small as his. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe can get started now if you li\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood,\u201d the man says curtly. Warren swiftly realizes that he missed that this stranger had a posh, royal British accent from their first meeting. Did Madam Bullfinch nmiss that too? This person was from very, very out of town.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026What am I here for then?\u201d he asks with as much restraint as he can muster. His suit is going to take forever to wash, and he got it out for this?\n\n\n\nThe man looks over at Warren with those eyes again. Glinting in the room\u2019s yellow light, they are no longer comforting, but instead filled with a sick, stolid curiosity that flutters as he blinks. \n\n\n\nWarren gasps as he\u2019s grabbed in what is a very solid, cold hand. Part of the man\u2019s face is hidden by his upturned collar and his shadow.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Lithe little thing. You look like a weeping willow more than you do a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Warren could sigh, he would. Everything about him is smooth, from his face to his chest to even his ass.\n\n\n\nThis was what he sold himself on, but to be so openly complimented on it in settings like this made him wonder if he could be more. If he had more food to eat, could he gain weight to make that go away? Could he grow taller somehow, maybe, just to hit heights like his father and other brothers did? Everyone in the family was tall, even him, but somehow there was always a man taller. Always a man somehow looking at him like he was some thing more than he was a person.\n\n\n\nMaybe he\u2019d finally look his age if he was a person. He certainly felt both the fear of arrest and arrested development, yet by some deigned order from God he\u2019s stuck with a perpetual baby face no matter what he does.\n\n\n\nHe assumes the man is complimenting him. He has to be. With one swift motion, Warren guides his hand to cup his cheek, thinking this is what he wants. He must be here to merely look at him, afraid to fully commit to the act. No matter, Warren could work with this. It was going to be a monumental pain, but maybe he could\u2026help him be comfortable.\n\n\n\nAs soon as he leans into the touch, the man jerks his hand away.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d he growls. \u201cDo not touch me unless I say to.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren\u2019s eyes go wide. He gets up to speak, but the man pushes him back down to the bed. \n\n\n\n\u201cStay. I am here tonight to look at something. Satisfy a curiosity of mine, and I will double your pay. Since I know you will wish to inquire more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA curiosity?\u201d Warren\u2019s voice comes out as a hoarse squeak. He didn\u2019t mean to say that aloud.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the man replies stoutly, frowning. His lips are thinner than Warren\u2019s. \u201cI promise, you will not be injured.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cM-Madam Bullfinch will know if you\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat little pest can suck on her hands for all I care. I paid for you, tonight is //my// time. I chose you for a specific reason, //boy//.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren shudders, freezing up as the man goes back to\u2026not fondling his face, but tracing it with his finger. Thumbing his jawline. Whatever was him running his fingers over the wet corners of his mouth.\n\n\n\nThis is followed by him running that same thumb over his cheekbones, nearing his eyes. Warren wonders if there\u2019s the intention to sink skin into his eye sockets, because he\u2019s absolutely defenseless right now. He could bleed so, //so// easily.\n\n\n\nThe man sighs, and retracts his hand. He shakes it off like there\u2019s a filth on it, wiping it on a handkerchief he pulls out quickly from his pocket. It\u2019s woven with the most delicate threads Warren thought possible for a piece of cloth.\n\n\n\n\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren pauses, but obliges him. First comes off his pants, then his shirt. He\u2019s cold, but resists showing it. Soon, it\u2019s just him in his underwear.\n\n\n\nThe man sighs, motioning for Warren to hold out a hand. He does, and he shudders, but he is still otherwise. Everything in the air, from the cigar smoke lingering on the bedsheets to the wine aromas staining the ceiling feels like needles.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s when the man pulls out a real needle.\n\n\n\nA large one. Sleek, golden, and with a beautiful marble cameo at the top. \n\n\n\n\u201cSteady,\u201d he says as Warren does nothing. He doesn\u2019t jerk away, no, that would be rude, but his heart races as he thinks of the coin again and all of the ways he could be stabbed with such a sharp instrument. It was very similar to the tools he used at work to cut open corpses\u2014why?\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re not necessarily unpleasant thoughts. In some ways, he would have loved for the man to drag that needle across his skin, just to feel something. Bonus if he told him to take it.\n\n\n\nIt would be so //thrilling//, so, so, so thrilling. So much more thrilling than anything he\u2019d get in the morgue or the Foundation\u2019s offices.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo this and I will triple your pay tonight. //Without// telling the Madam\u2014it will be our little secret.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man\u2019s deep baritone voice sends steel shivers down Warren\u2019s spine. He didn\u2019t need to be told to hide things from Madam Bullfinch, practically all of his clients did something she\u2019d find offensive in some way or another. Their secrets were meant to die with him, obviously.\n\n\n\n\u201cHold out your arm.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren complies. The needle glows pink for just a second\u2014was that a trick of the light?\n\n\n\nThe man prods and pokes Warren\u2019s inner arm, as if for a vein. Warren does not breathe for as long as he touches him. Quickly he takes that long sharp point and pricks deep into pallid flesh, muttering a phrase in some unknown language while a small light glows from the tip of his fingernails.\n\n\n\nMost people would have run by now. Most people would have screamed. But something in Warren always makes him stay when the offensive acts happen. He\u2019s not meant to just to be poured into, but cut, bled, and thrown around. Pick him up, crush him into pieces\u2014something told him he wouldn\u2019t entirely care, and he didn\u2019t know why that didn\u2019t scare him now as much as it did when he was younger.\n\n\n\nMake him useful, do something with his body. Create something temporary disguised as forever with semen, fondling, and bodily fluids. Whatever marked him as something above the dirt he felt like, just for a little bit. Just for a little bit.\n\n\n\nJust for a little bit.\n\n\n\nGirls didn\u2019t last long in this business before being forced out by the cops. But the ones who did grew older with a plethora of arm scars. \n\n\n\n\u201cIf I may ask, what\u2014\u201d Warren clears his throat, now reverting to a servicing tone. \u201cIs the point of this?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou will see in a moment,\u201d the man replies. \u201cWhen you pass out.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren gasps as he\u2019s grabbed by his neck, without warning, shaken by the man as he\u2019s pushed back and everything goes black.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nWhen he stirs, the room smells like cream. It smells like something dead floating in a vat of ice cream, as if the mild, milky sweetness was meant to smother something always destined to drown.\n\n\n\nHis chest feels heavy. As do his hips. And his legs feel\u2026smoother?\n\n\n\nWarren coughs, sitting up. The man is eating some rosy macarons off a golden treat cart.\n\n\n\n\u201cWh-Where am I?\u201d Thank god he still sounds like himself. \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d\n\n\n\nNo reply. The door is still locked.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook in the mirror,\u201d he says as he pops a puff pastry into his mouth. Warren drools a bit, until he realizes his lips are wet with\u2026something else.\n\n\n\nWet with\u2026wait, what?\n\n\n\nWhy do his hands feel so small?\n\n\n\nA tall, silver mirror sits erect besides him. Without any words, Warren slowly arches his neck over, realizing quickly that it\u2019s missing its\u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat have you done to me?!\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren bolts upright, clutching his chest and privates. He stumbles over himself, tripping onto the floor, the man snarling at him with pointed fangs.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou little\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?!\u201d His voice doesn\u2019t match his appearance anymore. It doesn\u2019t match his new long curly blonde hair, his skinny little waist, or the sleek, slender legs he now sports.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy am I a\u2014a\u2014?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c//Keep your voice down,//\u201d the man hisses at him. Warren swallows spit that tastes like foundation and lipstick.\n\n\n\nTurning back to the mirror again, he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s become. To say he was a woman was an understatement\u2014he looked like someone halfway shoved into a different body. While his legs were skinny, his feet remained the same size, same with his shoulders. Though there was fat padding his thighs, it felt like there was a phantom weight between his legs that should have been there, hanging down. \n\n\n\nNone of that was mentioning his face looked exactly the same. Same jaw, same lips, same nose, everything.\n\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t proper for a woman.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026You look off.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren stares, catatonic. His eyes water as he shakes.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Please,\u201d he begs, thinking of what his father might say if he saw him, his coworkers at the Foundation. The Spirit, even.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d The man sits down on the bed with little empathy in his voice. \u201cI did you a favor, did I not?\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren blinks, his hands going to his thighs. He squeezes, his breathing fast. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man rolls his eyes. \u201cWhy //what?// Stop asking me questions. Stand up.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf course he obliges. \n\n\n\nThe man approaches Warren and grabs his jaw again. Warren wants to cry watching him, beautiful even if his silhouette was obscured by clothing. He looks like what Warren should be. What he //wanted// to be: aged, and chiseled to perfection. Capable of growing facial hair, needing the routine to shave it and keep it down\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t this work\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren freezes, tensing. He grips his chest and shudders. His breasts don\u2019t feel like they belong to him. They\u2019re far too large.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour face looks odd for a woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren nods. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYour hair is beautiful, but why are your shoulders still so wide?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe whimpers. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man mutters something about fairy glamours under his breath that Warren can\u2019t quite hear. \u201cAre you not enjoying this?\u201d\n\n\n\n//Are you not enjoying this?//\n\n\n\nAsked to him during a drag party back in 1934. One of the oddest things about the Chicago Spirit was the kinds of people they let into their bars. There was no decorum about who needed a drink; no noses turned up at who came in and out of their dusty floors with want on their breath. Wayward souls, straggling whores, homeless rats, all were welcome if you had the money for a drink.\n\n\n\nBut for a while a few years ago they played host to something else.\n\n\n\nWarren turns to the mirror again and compares himself to the people he saw back then. Large, beautiful men in makeup and lipstick, prancing around in red dress with women below them hanging off each others\u2019 arms. They\u2019re making obscene gestures and speaking in even more obscene tongues as a piano plays, the air smelling of sex, lust, and liquor the more the night goes on.\n\n\n\nHis frame looks like them. In this very queer new body of his, halfway to his desires and halfway out of it, he feels like he\u2019s playing pretend. Both with men, the sex his heart belonged to, and what it wasn\u2019t, what he\u2019s sure is a false skin that he must take off sooner rather than later if he is to keep his sanity.\n\n\n\nWhy did those people do what they did? He didn\u2019t know. He sure as hell didn\u2019t ask. Tacky feather boas, fur coats made of mink and clacky heels\u2014what motivates a man to wear something like that? What motivates women to see that type of clothing as desirable, except obligation? \n\n\n\nWhat motivates a drag queen to prance around and blur those lines?\n\n\n\nAllegedly Chappell, the leader of the Chicago Spirit, watched those kinds of people. Lesbians, pansies, homosexuals of all types. Nobody knew why; Warren had heard the jokes that he was one of them, but he dared not repeat those in polite company unless he wanted three bullets in his head, unless he wanted to be one of the bodies in the morgue he went to everyday.\n\n\n\nThe man frowns.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stutters for a few more moments. Warren looks back at him.\n\n\n\nHis eyes\u2014 His pupils\u2014\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re slits, like a cat\u2019s. \n\n\n\nWhen did that happen?\n\n\n\nWarren clears his throat. \u201c\u2026Can you change me back?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man does not respond. Warren sighs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis\u2026it can\u2019t be permanent,\u201d Warren says shakily.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou should be squirming more,\u201d the man replies.\n\n\n\nWarren can only turn to him and lean against a vanity.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man looks like a statue when he pouts, when his lifeless eyes are wide and boring into flesh. Warren twirls his hair with long, bony fingers and slumps. Thank god he doesn\u2019t have clothes on right now.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Do you dream of this?\u201d is all the man asks, quiet and solemn, coming down from an authoritative tone. It sounds like the physical embodiment of rust forming. \n\n\n\n\u201cOf being a woman?\u201d Warren considers his answer for a moment. He could be honest, say no and go home. He could be true to his soul and recall the hideous fact his father nearly drowned him as a child because he got too close to the other boys at school. //Boys are for women, and women are for the boys,// he said.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps there is something to be had here. Perhaps this man just needs some\u2026coaxing.\n\n\n\nOr perhaps there is something within him that needs to be dug out.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery man dreams of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man\u2019s pupil\u2019s dilate. He stutters over his next words a little bit, leaning forward.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Really? It makes life so difficult for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat, are you not into the fairer sex? It\u2019s not as queer of an affinity as you think it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man stands up straight, glaring. \n\n\n\n\u201cI would loathe to touch you if I was given the option. Don\u2019t lie to me, boy.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren gasps as a hand reaches and grabs him, pulling him down by his hair. The man hovers over him with a burning hatred, his palms beginning to smell like smoke. His fangs glitter with frustration, and the crackling of a quick flick of magic.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are lying to me. Foul little thing. Good-for-nothing whore. I don\u2019t even know why I bothered with this.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren whines, falling to the floor when he\u2019s thrown aside. The man\u2019s trenchcoat catches on his foot and he kicks him, leering deeply at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\nTears. All Warren can do is summon tears. He covers himself as if he\u2019ll be hit again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy lie to me?\u201d the man asks, guttural and clear. \u201cI know it\u2019s part of your\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nHe pauses, looking down at his own hands as if they\u2019re imprinted over Warren\u2019s. Warren catches just the smallest glimpse of the man\u2019s face stitching together in terror just before he turns away.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Nature.// But I came here seeking the truth, and you cannot be bothered to overcome yourself for a single moment?\u201d\n\n\n\nNo words. There\u2019s nothing to be said, nothing to be done while in this body. Womb of truth, womb of lies. Warren just hopes he doesn\u2019t have one\u2014his sisters had the worst periods growing up.\n\n\n\nThis has to be temporary. He can feel wisps of smoke trailing off his breasts as he struggles to get back up. Where it left, it peels away skin, peels it away in a painful, pink polish dripping down his muscles and legs.\n\n\n\nThe man scoffs. He throws something at Warren, something soft, yet hard enough to roll his head over just a bit. What was inside of it?\n\n\n\n//He threw a wallet at me?// Warren thinks as he sits up. He wipes the fake lipstick off his mouth readily.\n\n\n\n\u201cTake it. Take your pay and leave. Disgusting little cretin\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no use in protesting. Warren knows it won\u2019t work, knows that for someone as rich as this, there\u2019s no use in really anything at all. He\u2019ll have his way whether he wants to or not, he\u2019ll languish in his own misery like a thick stew simmering to burnt.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable. He wishes it wasn\u2019t, but this is just the way things are. \n\n\n\nWhat matters now is making sure he\u2019ll get out of this alive. Out of this in one piece ideally, because if he died, well, he'd want to go in some dignity. The idea of being buried in a potter\u2019s field because no one recognized him\u2014Warren had few concerns about death, but that was perhaps the worst fate for someone like him in his mind.\n\n\n\nHe grabs sheets off the bed and pulls them over himself in a frenzy. The man is gathering his things to leave, shoving everything into a little bag taking far more than its size should allow. The way he moves is haphazard, clunky, stuttering almost, like a lightbulb flickering on and off. Warren didn't know someone could shake so much.\n\n\n\nHis sloughing form receives not a goodbye, but a door slam and a turning of a lock. \n\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\nSilence as the world mills about outside, as heavy footsteps eventually disappear and the spinning in his head finally goes away.\n\n\n\nAh, what is he to do now?\n\n\n\nWarren looks back to himself in the mirror one more time. He wipes dirt off his cheek that he quickly realizes is just the magic used to transform him now going bad. Ugh. Why did it have to look like stained milk?\n\n\n\nBest to wait this out, then escape through the window when he could find his composure.\n\n\n\nNot the way Warren wanted this to end, but at least he was still a man at the end of the day. At least he got his pay, and can take it back to Madam Bullfinch.\n\n\n\nThat was the best thing in the world for someone like him.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nPercival Darke arrives at his limousine quickly, panting as cold air burns his lungs. The image of Warren won\u2019t leave his mind; it festers as he takes his seat and barks a command to his driver.\n\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t it work? //Why didn\u2019t it work?// God, it was the latest development in glamour magic and it still didn\u2019t change his voice. It still refused to touch his mind. Those damn fairies\u2014did he forget to read some fine print? Did they trick him with some verbal loophole again? If so, there was going to be a lot of meetings when he got back to London. Lots of wringing that stupid queen Ortellica and making sure she knew to keep her subjects in line.\n\n\n\nHe was definitely lying, but Percival wants to believe him. He wants to believe the word of one who barely looked like a man in the first place, the ideal image to Percival as far as men went. They were nothing special to look at unless they were small, boyish, and coy like flowers in a field, destined to die at any moment.\n\n\n\nBut those weren\u2019t the kind of men who did well in business. Anyone like that knows better than to remain like that for long\u2014put your suit on, straighten your shoulders, avoid bad company. Avoid bad company at all costs, avoid the kinds of people who would love you so fiercely for that kind of appearance.\n\n\n\nDoes what Percival did tonight make him one of them?\n\n\n\nOne of the perverts, one of the degenerates? One of the mollies, one of the in-group queers that pranced around Chicago as they did London, New York, Paris, and Amsterdam? \n\n\n\nHe shudders as his mind wanders intrusively to the kind of glares he would get from his clients. Knowing who he contacted, what he did to him, how he did it. The mere idea of them watching him asking that question, so needy and pathetic and //desperate.//\n\n\n\nThat would mean death. Loss of profits, utter ruin. His partners would view him as a pansy, a freak of nature, something more hideous than sin and lesser than nothing. \n\n\n\nWasting good magic on such silly little thought experiments\u2026 Expensive magic too. That pathetic ant didn\u2019t deserve any of that.\n\n\n\nSo why couldn\u2019t he just walk away?\n\n\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t he just have pretended the buzzing in his head didn\u2019t exist again?\n\n\n\nWhy get someone involved with that? The affliction that had cursed him ever since he took on a merchant\u2019s life? That poor sap probably barely escaped with his own. And if he did, he\u2019ll probably be contained by the Foundation as some halfway thing until the glamour fully wears off.\n\n\n\nPercival groans as the car pulls into a garage. The darkness reminds him of what he wears, drab barrier blankets between his body and his mind that made him forget how wide his own shoulders were. How narrow his hips were, his legs and his chest.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only the most appropriate attire. \n\n\n\nToo many dreams... no, nightmares, about becoming a woman. About being a woman. Suffering as they suffer, ravaged as they're ravaged. It's too much. It's all too much.\n\n\n\nAnd yet never enough. He\u2026He treasures those dreams more than he admits, more than he wants to. \n\n\n\nWaking up like that one day\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nBy the time Percival reaches his suite, he has concocted the most elegant of \u2018forget-me\u2019 spells in his mind, one that pairs well with brandy and ice. He will have to give up something later down the line for this little comfort, but the fairies had caused enough trouble today, what was a little more?\n\n\n\nAs he pours himself a draught, his finger dipping into the drink to poison it with the taste of honeysuckle, wolfsbane and the waters of Ortellica, he hopes he gets to put this all behind him. That he will never suffer again the misfortune of conducting a charade of this caliber.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only natural. It\u2019s only natural.\n\n\n\nOnly natural, unlike everything else that happens so plainly.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> author=xexnoncores, Annorack, and asininestars]]\n\n> **Filename:** warren.jpeg\n\n> **Author:** [[*user asininestars]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[Skinful Desires]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["black-diamond-billions", "chicago-spirit", "lgbtq", "percival-darke", "tale"], "title": "Skinful Desires - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/skinful-desires", "year": 2026}, "solucion": {"created_at": "2026-01-04T20:09:00", "creator": "txum", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T20:09:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T20:10:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Uploaded file \"solucion4.png\".", "date": "2026-01-04T20:13:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Uploaded file \"solucion3.png\".", "date": "2026-01-04T20:13:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Uploaded file \"solucion2.png\".", "date": "2026-01-04T20:13:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Uploaded file \"solucion1.png\".", "date": "2026-01-04T20:13:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Uploaded file \"solucion6.png\".", "date": "2026-01-04T20:14:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Uploaded file \"solucion5.png\".", "date": "2026-01-04T20:14:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T20:15:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-04T20:21:00"}, {"author": "txum", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/txum", "comment": "Added tags: illustrated, international, tale.

There, in front of them, was the core of the disaster caused in the facility.</p>\n<p>Their journey to the origin of the anomaly had been long and dangerous, especially because of the unfortunate encounters they had with the infected. All the corpses were properly tagged as they made their way, the hostiles neutralized, and the rooms cleared. The only thing left was to figure out how to quickly and safely rescue the scientists currently barricaded inside.</p>\n<p>Some members of the team looked at each other for a few seconds, trying to come up with some kind of strategy to break the barrier that separated them from the researchers until agent Steffano Gonz\u00e1lez decided to break the silence.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cV\u00edctor?

After a few moments, he rudely threw a lighter at Victor.</p>\n<p>Victor took a small sample of the fungus from a nearby wall. He lit the lighter on and when he brought it close to the flame, the sample disintegrated while releasing a smoke of greenish-blue spores.</p>\n<p>After observing the smoke for a few seconds and with his doubt cleared up, he proceeded to explain his plan:<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cI thought about this: We could use the alcohol and the lighter to burn the first line of whatever the fuck is covering the door.

Meanwhile, dividing ourselves into two groups, one for civilians and the other for any possible threats. You all heard on the radio that there are infecteds inside, so we have to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Everybody meditated about it for a few seconds, before the silence was broken by a sarcastic laugh from Agent Turner.</p>\n<p>Penz just watched, confused and frowning</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe cannot do that.\u201d Said Marcelo as he took a few steps forward. \u201cThe release of spores into the environment when incinerating whatever that is\u2026 It may not be as harmful to us since we have the right equipment, but we must consider those who are inside. However,\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe Portuguese agent extracted a CBRN kit from his equipment and his partner did the same, taking his own out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve now noticed that the substance dissolves very easily when stimulated, such as by setting it on fire, so, to put it simply, we can try something using the basic chemical containment equipment\u2026 It isn\u2019t much, since we weren\u2019t expecting something of this magnitude, but it may be more than useful to dissolve whatever lies ahead, at least in not too excessive amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nRex slowly approached the door blocked by the viscous mucilage and proceeded to take a couple samples to insert them into tubes very similar to traditional laboratory test tubes, with the only difference that these were covered with warning stickers of different types, alongside the distinctive logos of the Beta-7 task force and The Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo carefully observed the various encapsulated chemical agents he carried as he read a guide that came with the kit.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cSamples ready.\u201d Rex shouted to Marcelo. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna isolate these for a second and I\u2019ll let you try them with the solvents we have. Let's see if we strike a bit of luck here for the first time in the division\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead\u201d Marcelo stretched out his arm wearing an oversized yellow glove over the equipment they had brought previously, receiving the tubes Rex handed him. \u201cNow cross your fingers and stay back in case of any adverse reactions that may occur.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAgents Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and Penz simply waited nearby, with the kind of admiration one would expect when watching a highly skilled team at work. Everybody knew that interrupting the process could be a waste of time and, therefore, would risk not being able to evacuate the civilians alive.</p>\n<p>The mucilage from inside the vials glowed faintly. One by one, Marcelo poured the reagents. Variations of \u201cvoriconazole\u201d, \"quinoxyfen\", \u201cimidazole\u201d and some \u201cEchinocandins\u201d. All carefully labelled so that their reactions to the fungal agent could be measured and identified.</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, the differences in some of the tubes were extremely noticeable. One in particular showed a visible structural change, which Marcelo reported to Rex. Both agents analyzed it and then agreed, finally they shared the result with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWell, as you can see\u2026\u201d Marcelo raised the sole disposable tube he had in his hand for a few seconds,enough time for the rest of the team to see it. \u201cWe suppose that this is what we are looking for. The reaction was as expected\u2026 But to be sure, I\u2019ll need the lighter.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nPenz threw the lighter back to Rex, who looked at him reluctantly for a few seconds and then passed it to Marcelo. The agent carefully took out part of the sample from the vial and passed it over the flame. The sample disappeared in a matter of seconds, but this time no spores could be seen. Evidently, it had worked.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cHa, ha! Perfect, now, what was the plan of action you said before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBurn everything blocking the entrance and the room before the containment room so we can get in. Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and you would go for the civilians, Turner and I for the hostiles. There's no clear view of how many are in there, so it's best to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Everyone looked at V\u00edctor for a moment before nodding slightly and moving on to the execution.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cSo, first\u2026\u201d Rex shouted as he laboriously prepared enough reagent to break down the mucilage that was blocking the passage. \u201cWe need to spread this across as much surface area as possible.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo was preparing a small yellow tank with a hose similar to a fire extinguisher, which they were going to use to cover the area with the chemical. As he was spraying the organic wall, the fungus wriggled and pulsed to the contact with the solvent. When the task was done, he took a few steps back and put the equipment away again.</p>\n<p>A spark from the lighter, and the wall in front of them vanished almost immediately. In the front room, clusters of hyphae blocked the way like vines. Marcelo reached out and gave one of them a slight pull, which was enough to break it. They were not going to be an obstacle for the team anymore.</p>\n<p>Watching the situation unfold, Victor signaled to the others to review the entry plan. The agents Ibarra, Gonzalez and Oliveira would enter the observation room and would be responsible for extracting the civilians, while Turner and him would go for the remaining hostiles in the containment room.</p>\n<p>With the plan established and their weapons drawn, both teams headed through the hyphae maze hanging from the ceiling. With a quick movement of his hand, Victor pointed to the darkest side of the room as he walked slowly to the end of the hall that led to the entrance of both rooms. Once there, he signaled via radio to announce his arrival at the door covered in mucilage, where the presence of hostiles was presumed.</p>\n<p>Rex took a combat knife from his backpack and made some cuts in the remaining mucilage between the door separating the two agents and the dark room with its dim turquoise light. Victor, with one of his hands resting on Rex\u2019s shoulder, approached and illuminated the room with the lantern attached to his shotgun.</p>\n<p>On the other side, several deformed hostiles laid staring at the ceiling of the room. In a corner, a grotesque mass made of some biological compound, similar to the stem of a plant, vibrated and pulsed constantly, giving off faint and intermittent flashes of light.</p>\n<p>Silence reigned for a moment as both agents watched the various humanoid figures writhe in agony, scratching their bodies in an attempt to take off some pieces of scales that seemed to serve as natural armor.</p>\n<p>V\u00edctor lightly pushed Rex aside as he extracted a stun grenade from a compartment of his equipment.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOne. Two. Three!\u201d the agent shouted before dropping the explosive inside the room and moving away so as not to be hit by its effect.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A gruesome scene was shown unfolding inside the room where the rescue team entered.</p>\n\n<p>Two scientists were unconscious, sitting with their backs against the wall. Both had chemical protective coveralls, which seemed to have protected them from the infection that affected the other scientists in the area.</p>\n<p>Steffano and Ibarra approached each scientist, trying to check their vital signs and carrying them to the vicinity of the entrance door.</p>\n<p>A radio transmission indicated that V\u00edctor and Rex had reached their objective, to which Steffano responded positively.</p>\n<p>Marcelo illuminated the room with his flashlight in hand, panning it around as he approached a large table in the center of the room. On the table lay the last scientist using the protective coverall in a prone position.</p>\n<p>Oliveira quickly noticed and he immediately approached the subject, turning him over and positioning him correctly on the ground.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGuys, over here!\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Steffano approached Marcelo, who was slowly examining the unconscious scientist.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Marcelo desperately pressed a section of the suit near the neck. \u201cI need tape, or something similar. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ibarra checked the contents of his backpack, looking for an efficient alternative.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe suit is broken. We need to seal it immediately\u201d Marcelo responded as he pressed the suit with one hand and checked his backpack with the other one. \u201cI'm going to put a simple oxygen mask on him to counteract any pathogens that may have entered the system, but I need to seal this up right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be in any state of infection beyond loss of consciousness.\u201d Steffano pointed out. \u201cThat doesn't mean anything, of course, but I would like to know what led these people to the state they are in.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSteffano knelt down beside the subject and started to press the suit, replacing Marcelo, who was focused on putting the mask in the small tear. Ibarra took out a tape of considerable length and began to secure the area of the break after the two agents had finished their work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe have to drag them to the door. There, we'll carry each one on our shoulders and see if we can get them out that way. There is no other way, for now.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Marcelo agreed unanimously and began to carry the unconscious men to the doorway. In that moment, the rumble of a nearby explosion, followed by the sound of several detonations, put the three agents on alert.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The explosion of the stun grenade made the hostiles writhe and screech in pain, searching for the source of the explosion. V\u00edctor slapped Rex\u2019s back strongly, who instantly entered, firing his assault rifle on the two nearby hostiles. V\u00edctor took advantage of the opportunity to blast his shotgun towards the other two hostiles, who were immediately ejected by the force of the shots.</p>\n<p>Rex came close to the creatures he shot, who were still moving erratically, even with the prominent holes in the soft parts of his skin.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cUgh. Bloody hell!\u201d he shouted before drawing his secondary weapon and emptying the magazine on the monsters.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nV\u00edctor approached the other two hostiles with methodical and precise movements to shoot them, and executed them both with a single, clean shot on the head.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201c<em>Bichos de mierda.</em>\u201d Said Penz, answering Rex\u2019s shouts.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBetween the commotion and the heavy breathing, both agents approached the fleshy nucleus that breathed in one of the corners of the room.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cI don't know what this is, but I think we both agree that it\u2019s the reason we are here in the first place, innit?\u201d Asked Rex, as he took out the tank they had used to spray the chemical against the mucilage earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely. What I\u2019m not sure about is, if trying to destroy this thing might be a good idea.\u201d Penz answered, concerned, after seeing his colleague with the tank in his hands. \u201cWe don't know what the consequences might be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Rex began to spray the chemical over the nucleus, before pausing to contemplate. \u201cI think it is a good idea to get rid of the contamination source. I don\u2019t know what the consequences might be, but I don\u2019t think it could be worse than this.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe creatures the agents thought had previously been defeated began to shake and convulse frantically in the same place where they had been left.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit, uh\u2026 God damn it, just do it, ok? We\u2019ll complain later.\u201d V\u00edctor pointed his weapon at the creatures. \u201cCome on! Hurry up!\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nRex finished emptying the contents of the tank on the surroundings and lit all the area on fire before running away, dragging V\u00edctor by part of his suit.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Outside the rooms there were Gonz\u00e1lez, Ibarra and Oliveira with the civilians on their shoulders. Gonzalez tried to adjust the radio to communicate with the other two agents, to no avail.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWe should start moving, the civilians are top priority.\u201d Said Marcelo</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know that,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez replied, slightly frustrated. \u201cJust\u2026 give me a moment, I\u2019ll try once more and then-\u201c Steffano was interrupted by another loud rumbling, followed by a beam of light coming from the back room.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>From the back, Victor and Rex ran out at full speed, almost bumping into the walls, while shouting at the top of their lungs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGET OUT, NOW!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRUN!\u201d shouted V\u00edctor as he ran towards the others as fast as he could.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBehind the agents, the hostiles who had supposedly been taken down ran out of the room at full speed. They were being incinerated as they ran, but it didn't seem to affect them, bullet holes could be seen all over their bodies.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWhat the fu-\u201d Steffano shouted before running slowly because of the load he was carrying \u201cWhat the hell just happened there?\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOscar and Marcelo just started running, taking the lead for the whole team. V\u00edctor and Rex ran behind the rest of the agents, pointing at the hostile that were rushing at full speed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t the time, not now!\u201d Answered Rex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIn the distance, it could be seen how the fire carried by the hostiles began to burn the surroundings with every step they took, creating a blazing tide that advanced alongside them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d Penz throwed another stun grenade, which ended up getting lost in the rush, without being effective.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe mucilage started glowing strongly, spreading over the heels of the agents who were running to escape from the lower part of the facility.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPenz, the door!\u201d Rex shouted, signing with one of his hands indicating the security gate through which they had initially entered.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nVictor froze for a split second, processing the order Rex surprisingly gave him, then sprinted quickly towards the door, taking the lead.</p>\n<p>Ibarra and Oliveira watched in confusion as Penz sprinted at full speed and positioned himself on the left side of the security gate. During the confusion, Turner took up position behind Gonz\u00e1lez and began sprinting backwards, shooting at the hostiles as an attempt to slow down the imminent march of the enemies.</p>\n<p>The run lasted only a few minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Oscar and Marcelo arrived first, drew their secondary weapon and pointed towards the hallway where Steffano and Rex were approaching with the enemies hot on their heels.</p>\n<p>Seconds after, and by a matter of luck, Steffano passed through the security gate alongside Rex, who did an excellent job keeping in line the anomalies as V\u00edctor typed some numbers on the security console, finally closing the gate and keeping everyone safe.</p>\n<p>All the agents stood still for a few seconds, breathing heavily and processing what had just happened.</p>\n<p>Without saying a word, everyone began to climb the stairs. Rex and V\u00edctor tried to help the others, without interrupting their walk.</p>\n<p>The stairs seemed to stretch on endlessly due to the effects of fatigue, but the adrenaline kept the agent on the rails. Everyone climbed slowly and walked the last stretch of the way out of the facility with difficulty.</p>\n<p>Limping and in pain, those carrying the civilians went from walking slowly to jogging. At the front of the installations, the giant gates swung open, allowing an entire task force to enter.</p>\n<p>Steffano shouted some instructions, and most of the task force passed by the agents, going directly to the location from which they had just come. Another couple of agents of the task force stopped and helped the group carry the civilians, while providing support so that they could walk with less difficulty.</p>\n<p>Once outside, the scene was completely different from what they had encountered when they first arrived.</p>\n<p>Several helicopter fleets circled the facility. Tents of different colors were arranged throughout the perimeter. Some red tents gave medical support to the civilians that could have been harmed during the breach. Some of those provided psychological assistance, and others simply displayed an assortment of weapons for the agents who recently arrived on the scene for the intervention.</p>\n<p>The specially trained mobile task forces were the most noticeable above the scene, with oversized suits and specialized equipment, forming brigades with the other agents who were gathering at the doors of the facilities.</p>\n<p>The entire team was intervened by two groups of personnel; some wore full-body grey suits, while others were dressed as doctors and nurses. The latter retrieved the civilians from the shoulder of the agents carrying them, and disappeared from the scene to keep them safe, while the men in gray gave instructions to guide them to a tent of the same color, a bit further away from the rest.</p>\n<p>Once inside, the entire team was instructed to follow an emergency cleaning and chemical decontamination protocol. They were disarmed from their equipment and stripped down to their underwear and were sprayed with various chemical agents for disinfection.</p>\n<p>Once they finished the process, they dried themselves before moving to the next section of the tent, where the bags they had left outside before the operation were being kept. Each member took their equipment and began to change again.</p>\n<p>In the silence of the room, everyone dressed meticulously without saying anything about the operation.</p>\n<p>After a couple of minutes starting to get dressed, Turner looked up at agent Penz, who did not notice him until a couple of seconds later.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201c\u2026Is everything al-?\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBefore he could say another word, V\u00edctor was interrupted by Rex\u2019s laughter, who approached him and extended his fist to greet him.</p>\n<p>Penz looked at him for a moment, confused, before he responded to the greeting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cOi, goldilocks. We almost died there. What were you going to do if we died, mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could do anything in that case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right!\u201d Rex slammed a glove against the ground and then started laughing again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nPenz did not fully understand the reaction, but he was not bothered by them either. Something about the whole situation reminded him of times gone by, and perhaps, just perhaps, he was not as lost as he used to think.</p>\n<p>The blonde agent smiled with his head down and finished closing a small bag with a Glock and its tiny flashlight.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>While the team was waiting for a new order, Rex was sitting, leaning against a pile of bags and he was visibly irritated.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Marcelo asked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2026\u201d After a few seconds, he continued \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think they were going to receive us with a tent. Fuck! I didn\u2019t believe we would see anyone waiting for us outside that door. I still don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t think about it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steffano interrupted them from the other side of the room \u201cSorry. What are you saying?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt's a bit obvious, innit?\u201d Rex snapped again \u201cThey send two guys from a task force alone to a site far away from everything. You have to pray that they send only three more as backup. Those three are hired on a quasi-private basis. None of them are given a damn clue of what the fuck is waiting inside there. For God's sake! It looked like they left us there to d-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough\u201d Marcelo interrupted Rex before he could continue. \u201cThe situation wasn\u2019t handled in the best way. We all noticed that. Most of the plan was made on the fly due to the urgency. But I don\u2019t think it is the best idea doing this now, after all\u2026\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhen he was done dressing up, Marcelo turned around and gave the tent structure behind him a light tap.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWalls have ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d Steffano frowned for a moment before replying slowly. \u201cWe\u2019d better get together to celebrate the victory at another time, in another place.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSteffano took out a notebook from his bag, and from it, took out a couple of small cards with his name and email address on them. He handed one to each agent from the task force they had worked with, then silently put the notebook back in his bag.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cI know a place where we could go and relax, it\u2019s a small bar where the police used to hang out. There the walls don\u2019t have ears, in fact, they have no sense at all. If you know what I mean\u201d said the agent, chuckling to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see, yeah. We\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d Marcelo turned to Rex, who was distracted, chatting with Victor and Oscar. \u201cNevermind\u2026 We\u2019ll be there. It\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Both agents shook hands. The handshake lasted for a couple of seconds before being interrupted by the entrance of a man dressed in a formal military uniform, who slowly approached the group.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cGentlemen. With your permission, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\u201d He paused for a moment before continuing. \u201cFirst, let me congratulate you on such an impressive performance, we would expect nothing less from an elite group. Unfortunately, you know what comes next.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Marcelo and Steffano were visibly frustrated. Marcelo had his reasons, and Steffano just hated the bureaucracy of operatives.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be summoned to Site-22, New York headquarters. There\u2019s most of the documents, so you know where to go. It has to be sometime this week, preferably within the next three days. Once you finish the standard process you will be free of responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood\u201d responded Marcelo.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good day, agents.\u201d Said the officer, leaving the way he came.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Ibarra approached Gonz\u00e1lez and whispered something in his ear before he grabbed a heavy backpack and said goodbye to everyone as he left.</p>\n<p>Victor looked worriedly at Steffano before asking:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything is alright, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all good.\u201d<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Steffano gave a thumbs up in approval before grabbing his bags and leaving the tent, accompanied by the rest of the agents.</p>\n<p>After a quick exchange of farewells and several handshakes, each member went separate ways with their respective group. V\u00edctor followed Steffano with his head down, glancing sideways at the groups of agents and researchers surrounding the now quarantined site.</p>\n<p>The return trip was not remarkable; they flew back to Site-210 by helicopter, followed by a drive to Site-28. Both were quite exhausted, and the protocol interruptions along the way did not help much.</p>\n<p>When they got back to the apartment, they left their bags in the living room without saying a word. Steffano took the chance to finally relax and stretch out on the sofa, while V\u00edctor glanced at the clock a few seconds before heading to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The noise coming from there broke the silence in the place. The opening and closing of the refrigerator, the search of the ingredients and the organization of everything were momentarily interrupted when one of the two spoke up:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Asked Steffano, turning to look at him as he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cBurgers.\u201d V\u00edctor answered him without looking, busy cutting some vegetables for a topping. \u201cIt\u2019s quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite late. Don\u2019t you prefer ordering something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d The sound of the knife against the cutting board stopped for a second. \u201cWell, it's almost one in the morning. I don\u2019t think we can order anything at this time.

He stares at the Foundation agent sitting on the other side of his desk, making no effort to conceal his disbelief.</p>\n<p>\"You think Shaquille O'Neal, four-time NBA champion and fifteen-time All-Star, is a robot.\"</p>\n<p>Clarissa Shaw stares back defiantly. \"I know it.\"</p>\n<p>She rolls her wheelchair forwards so she can slap a manila file folder on his desk. \"I have evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer makes no moves to take the folder. \"Why are you bothering me? Shouldn't you be taking this to Merlo? Or is she too busy ignoring our extradition requests?\"</p>\n<p>The mention of Anderson, even obliquely, causes Shaw to wince. Spencer guesses that she was part of the task force that <a href=\"/bal-chatri\">ambushed Vincent Anderson</a> as <a href=\"/falcon-flight\">he fled Portlands</a>, snatching the megalomaniac genius and wanted felon right out from under the nose of the UIU. It would certainly explain her injuries.</p>\n<p>\"Merlo has her hands tied. Now that Anderson is in custody, there isn't as much funding to go after his company. Holman won't approve an op without concrete evidence. Everyone thinks I'm grasping at straws to find a way to stay involved in the action.\" The hurt in Shaw's voice is obvious.</p>\n<p>Spencer has enough tact to not press that issue. But he still doesn't want to get involved. His partner, forensic thaumatologist Robin Thorne, is taking a much-needed vacation with their significant other, leaving him to supervise the Three Portlands Field Office alone.</p>\n<p>So far, it has been blissfully monotonous and uneventful, and he hopes to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry to hear that Clarissa, but I fail to see why this is my problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because Shaq is an American citizen, and if he's been replaced by a Saker, then he might be in danger. And because if there's a Saker still out there, we have no idea what it will do now that Anderson is in custody. It may very well go on a rampage, or try to kill the President. Anderson has already tried to subvert the United States Government. Can you really afford to ignore a Saker, especially one as prominent as Shaq?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If</em> there's a Saker,\" Spencer counters. But he has to give the point to Shaw. If she's right \u2014 <em>if</em> \u2014 then he has to act. Anything less would be negligence.</p>\n<p>He picks up the folder and cracks it open. He starts leafing through the files within.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\" He removes a photograph and holds it up to examine it more closely. It's a side-by-side comparison of two still frames of Shaquille O'Neal from <em>Inside the NBA</em>, date-stamped a week apart. Shaw had used red marker pen to circle a number of differences, all barely perceptible.</p>\n<p>Spencer looks up from the photograph at Shaw. Looks back at the photograph. Back at Shaw.</p>\n<p>She desperately needs a win. Far more than he needs things to stay boring.</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm convinced.\"</p>\n<p>He throws the folder back on the desk and stands up, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and sliding it on in a smooth, well-practiced motion.

He wasn't at the house in Texas.\"</p>\n<p>\"And if it is here? I'd rather have a wizard backing us up.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shrugs. \"We're just here to ask a few questions and see if we can confirm our suspicions. We can always come back later with wizard SWAT if we're right.\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose. I still don't like it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, you came to me. If you don't like how we do things in the Unit, you can always leave.\"</p>\n<p>They fall silent at the sound of someone unlocking the door.</p>\n<p>Shaq opens the door.</p>\n<p>Spencer shuffles nervously, his cool facade crumbling slightly in the face of all seven feet and one inch of the basketball player's enormous frame.</p>\n<p>\"Hi, Mr. O'Neal. I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer\u2014\" He holds up his badge as proof, then gestures at Shaw. \"\u2014and this is Agent Clarissa Shaw. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?\"</p>\n<p>Shaq hesitates. \"Is it urgent? I'm working on a new album, and I had a sick freestyle going.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm very sorry to interrupt you,\" Spencer says. \"But we have reason to believe you might be in danger.\"</p>\n<p>\"We think someone might be impersonating you,\" Shaw says, which is almost the truth.</p>\n<p>\"Have you noticed anything strange?\" Spencer asks. \"Unusual activity on your accounts, other people remembering interactions that you didn't have, weird phone calls, anything like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, nothing like that.\" Shaq sighs. \"I bet I know what's up.\" He leans closer and says, in a stage whisper, \"I have a stunt double, back from making <em>Steel</em>. Great guy, terrible at basketball. Sometimes people see him in public and think he's me. You dig it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I dig it.\" Spencer smiles brightly. \"Shaq didn't have a stunt double for that movie. They couldn't find a tall enough look-a-like.\"</p>\n<p>Panic flashes across Shaq's face. \"Fuck!\"</p>\n<p>He slams the door shut.</p>\n<p>Shaw groans. \"We've been made. He's definitely a Saker, and he knows we're onto him.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods. \"You know, I think you might be right.\" He pulls out his pistol and holds it at the ready below his waist. \"Can you cover the front? I'm gonna try to circle around and cut him off.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you really suggesting we split up so it can pick us off one-by-one?\"</p>\n<p>But he's already jogging across the driveway, scanning for an easy spot to vault over the wall and into the backyard.</p>\n<p>He's still standing in the driveway when, a moment later, an engine roars and a cherry red Corvette smashes through the garage door. In fact, he's directly in its path.</p>\n<p>The car hits Spencer at about five miles per hour, lifting him from the ground and folding him up against the hood. He clings desperately to the car with one hand, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Miraculously, his other hand still holds his pistol.</p>\n<p>He aims vaguely and starts firing. His first shot goes wide. His second shot gouges the hood. His third shot takes out the driver-side mirror.</p>\n<p>The Corvette accelerates and weaves down the driveway, trying to throw him off, or at least ruin his aim. His pistol goes flying, tumbling into the grass of the lawn. He starts swearing, random curse words from a variety of languages, and tries to hold on with both hands.</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot takes the corner at the end of the driveway hard. Really hard. The Corvette goes up on two wheels for a moment, and Spencer goes flying. He lands in a patch of dandelions across the street, bruised, battered, and winded, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The Corvette speeds off down the street and vanishes from view.</p>\n<p>Shaw rolls down the driveway and looks down at him. \"Do you want to call for backup now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I think so.\" Spencer rubs his back and winces. \"Did you see which way he was going?\"</p>\n<p>\"South,\" Shaw saws. \"He's probably getting onto State Route 482.\"</p>\n<p>\"That'll take him to the airport.\" He groans as he stands up and starts dusting dandelion fluff off his pants.</p>\n<p>\"Great, let's go, we can catch him there.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shakes his head. \"No, we're not engaging in the middle of MCO. It would be a blood bath.\" He pulls out his phone and begins to dial.</p>\n<p>\"What\u2014?\"</p>\n<p>He holds up a hand to cut her off and starts speaking into the phone.</p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/quinn-law-hub\">Agent Carter</a>? Ken Spencer here, from the Three Ports office. I need a favor from you.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses to listen.</p>\n<p>\"I need an APB for Shaquille O'Neal. He's driving a red Corvette without a left-side wing mirror, and is likely en route to Orlando International Airport. Tell local cops and TSA not to engage or try to detain, just observe. I want to know what flight he gets on and when.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses again. Shaw can't hear the words being said, but the voice on the other end of the line sounds agitated.</p>\n<p>\"No, he's been replaced by a robot.\"</p>\n<p>Another pause.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, it's related to the Caldwell thing. It's a matter of national security.\"</p>\n<p>The voice sounds slightly mollified.</p>\n<p>Spencer laughs. \"Thanks, Isaac. I owe you one.\"</p>\n<p>He closes the phone and looks at Shaw. \"In your expert opinion, do you believe that there is a clear and exigent threat to the life of Shaquille O'Neal?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw blinks. \"It's possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"And is it possible that we might find him inside this residence, or, failing that, information regarding his current location?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"Sure, I guess.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer smiles like a shark. \"I'm willing to call that exigent circumstances.\" He pulls a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and snaps them on. \"Let's search the place.\"</p>\n<p>They move methodically, sweeping through each room with practiced patience, checking everything \u2014 opening drawers, lifting up cushions, looking under furniture. Spencer even checks the dust on the bookshelves to see which books have recently been moved. They're looking for any clue that might tell them where the real Shaq is \u2014 if he's even still alive.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after almost forty minutes of searching, Shaw finds something.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, come take a look at this!\" she calls out.</p>\n<p>Spencer comes over to find her pointing at a framed photograph next to the entertainment center.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\" he asks. The photo shows Shaq performing as a DJ at some event.</p>\n<p>\"Look at that, do you see it? Reflected in his sunglasses.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer leans in for a better look. Shaq is in a nightclub somewhere, performing on an elevated stage above a crowded dance floor. A dozen different colors of muted neon light the scene, giving it an otherworldly vibe.</p>\n<p>Reflected in the left lens of Shaq's sunglasses, almost too small to make out, is a small logo, probably from a neon sign outside the nightclub.</p>\n<p>It's the logo of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.</p>\n<p>\"Fucking hell.\" Spencer picks up the photograph and holds it up to the light. \"That's in Eurtec.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or somewhere with a Coalition presence,\" Shaw says.</p>\n<p>\"No, it's definitely Eurtec. Look at that guy's wrist.\" Spencer points at an arm thrusting up from the dance floor into the bottom of the photograph. \"Do you see the tattoo?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw squints, then nods. \"What about it?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's the insignia of a neo-Nazi Eurtec street gang.\"</p>\n<p>\"So he's been to Eurtec,\" Shaw says. \"Which means he's clued in about the Veil.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which explains why someone might want to replace him with a robot.\" Spencer sets the photograph back down and begins to pace. \"This isn't looking good. He might be in real trouble.\"</p>\n<p>At that moment, Spencer's phone rings, merrily playing the X-Files theme. He answers the phone immediately, pointedly ignoring Shaw's curious look.</p>\n<p>\"Go for Spencer,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He listens intently for about thirty seconds, then hangs up.</p>\n<p>\"Robot's taking a flight to Paris,\" he tells Shaw. \"Plane leaves in thiry minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's in Paris?\" she asks.</p>\n<p>Spencer looks at the photograph of Shaq DJing. \"Eurtec.\"</p>\n<p>Understanding dawns in Shaw's eyes. \"It's looking for Shaq.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe.\" Spencer frowns. \"Is that typical of Sakers?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw shrugs. \"We don't really know what's typical of Sakers.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought you guys were the experts.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, that's the guy who makes them. We just know how to break them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's hope that's enough.\" Spencer starts dialing another number. \"I assume you don't have Library access, yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, why? Who are you calling?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Someone who can give us a Way to Eurtec that doesn't go through the Library.\" He lifts the phone to his ear and starts speaking. \"Hello, <a href=\"/much-belated-inheritance\">Mister Raybon</a>? This is Agent Spencer. How'd you like to do a good deed? The life of Shaquille O'Neal might depend on it.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Eurtec</strong></p>\n<p>It takes Spencer and Shaw two hours to get to Eurtec, following the directions given to them by Jordan \"Submarine\" Raybon. The retired smuggler knows how to get to anywhere from anywhere, although not always by the most direct route. He gives them a path through the Way network that will take them from Orlando to Naples, Italy. Although it's only a few miles of walking in total, by the time the two agents are standing before a Way into Eurtec they've passed through the Neverglades; Naples, Florida; Liminal Italy; the Kingdom of Zero Sicilies; and half-a-dozen other locales across the world tree.</p>\n<p>\"You ever been to Eurtec?\" Spencer asks.</p>\n<p>Shaw shakes her head. \"No, the Coalition doesn't like us being here.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't imagine why.\" He starts ticking off points on his fingers. \"It's bigger than Three Ports, by a lot, and meaner. The Coalition mostly doesn't give a fuck about street crime. The city is physically and economically stratified, and neo-Nazi gangs control the lower levels. We won't have any real authority, so don't tell anyone you're with the Foundation, it'll just piss people off. You can bring weapons through customs but it probably won't help \u2014 almost everyone is armed with something, usually magic.\"</p>\n<p>\"What about wheelchair access?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>Spencer frowns. \"Worse than an American city, better than anywhere in baseline Europe. There used to be a teleporter network but they shut it down after 9/11.\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn, that would have been nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't have anything nice in the United Nations' cyberpunk dystopia.\" Spencer chuckles, once, before his expression turns serious again. \"For real though, this place makes Portlands look like a fluffy kitten \u2014 and I have seen Portlandsers spontaneously construct and burn an effigy of J. Edgar Hoover purely out of boredom.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you blame them?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"No, and it was a pretty decent likeness, but that's not the point. Just being American will make us a target here. Don't let your guard down.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"Understood. I'll keep my eyes open.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer steps forwards to confront the blank brick wall of the Neopolitan alleyway. He pulls a crumpled slip of paper from his pocket and double-checks the instructions written on it.</p>\n<p>He clears his throat, knocks three times on a slightly off-color brick, and says, \"Let us leave good sense behind.\"</p>\n<p>The bricks glow for a moment, then crumble to sand and ash, exposing a small pedestrian tunnel. Spencer leads them through, emerging into what looks like an airport terminal. Over a dozen similar tunnels dot the wall behind them, with light pedestrian traffic going in and out of them.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you said there was customs?\" Shaw looks around for anything resembling security and comes up blank.</p>\n<p>\"The city is run by a bunch of precognitive computers. We cleared customs on the Way in. If we hadn't, you'd know.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw looks pensive. \"Could they tell us where Shaq is? Or where he will be?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer shrugs. \"Probably. If they want to help us, then they'd have already done it \u2014 maybe they even have. But I doubt it. From what I've heard, the Nornir don't get involved. They have bigger things to worry about.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, like Yao Ming.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer barks out a short laugh. \"Sure. Like Yao Ming.\" He checks his watch. \"Come on, we have six hours to find Shaq. Then the Saker gets here, and I don't want to try playing spot the impostor.\"</p>\n<p>They both set a timer on their watches.</p>\n<p>\"How exactly are we going to find Shaq?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Some good old-fashioned police work,\" Spencer says. \"We're gonna canvas the city.\"</p>\n<p>\"All million people? In six hours?\" Shaw shakes her head. \"You're more likely to trip over him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" He stops the next passerby and holds up a Shaquille O'Neal basketball card. \"Excuse me, have you seen this man?\"</p>\n<p>The man nods. \"Shaq? Of course, I wouldn't miss him.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer glances at Shaw. She rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Where did you see him?\" Spencer asks.</p>\n<p>\"He was playing at Club Cipher,\" the man replies. \"But if you're hoping to catch him, he won't be there tonight. He's been playing a different venue every night.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods, feigning comprehension. \"Any idea where he'll be tonight?\"</p>\n<p>The man shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't get announced in advance. It's like a guerilla DJing thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, thank you. You've been very helpful.\" He lets the man continue on his way.</p>\n<p>\"Alright there's no way you're that lucky,\" Shaw says. \"What's your trick?\"</p>\n<p>\"That photo we saw of Shaq,\" Spencer says. \"He was playing at a club. I figured that if he was here and not, you know, a prisoner or dead, then there was a pretty good chance he'd be performing again.\"</p>\n<p>\"You never actually intended to canvas the whole city.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope! Just the nightclubs.\" Spencer grabs a tourist map of Eurtec from a nearby stand. \"And with a few educated guesses, we can narrow our search further.\"</p>\n<p>He pulls a pen from his pocket and crosses out Club Cipher.</p>\n<p>\"Right, if we know where he's been then we know where he won't be,\" Shaw says.</p>\n<p>\"And it might give us an idea of where he will be. Cipher is a dive, which suggests he's probably not playing any of the really upscale clubs \u2014 you know, the ones that charge a cover just to stand in line.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know so much about Eurtec?\" Shaw asks. \"The UIU doesn't have jurisdiction here \"</p>\n<p>\"No, but we have an international office here. For liaison purposes. I read their reports.\" Spencer shrugs. \"And I may have been here a few times on vacation.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw stares at him. \"I cannot picture you on vacation.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, I'm not a robot,\" he says. \"I take vacations too.\" He holds up the map, upon which he has drawn about a dozen circles. \"Here's our target list. Thirteen nightclubs in the city's lower level.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can we hit them all in six hours?\"</p>\n<p>\"We can try.\"</p>\n<p>They manage it, just barely. Canvassing the city's nightclubs takes them five hours and fifty minutes.</p>\n<p>Their first stop is Ewige Blumenkraft, an Illuminati-owned nightclub inside the Eurtec Parabotanical Gardens in the city's middle-tier. It is widely considered the lamest club in Europe, but the Illuminati have the money to pay for the best DJs, so people still go. The bouncer helpfully informs them that Shaq played there a week ago, and that the Achronal Hyacinth will be unblooming soon.</p>\n<p>Their second visit is to BROZ, a gay club inside the former Yugoslav consulate. The centerpiece is an unexploded bomb from the NATO intervention in Serbia, which is allegedly still armed. The bartender tells them that Shaq was there a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Next they hit the French clubs, Paradis \u2014 a discotheque inside a former Gothic church that was transported to Eurtec brick-by-brick \u2014 and Atomique \u2014 situated inside a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Neither club has seen \"Le Shaq\", but both have plans to book him soon.</p>\n<p>Valhalla is the first club to give them trouble. The abandoned mattress factory is overrun by neo-Nazi thugs, all benefiting from the lack of dram laws in Eurtec. It's obvious that Shaq hasn't been there, but they ask the bouncer anyways.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck off, cripple,\" he says to Shaw.</p>\n<p>The Foundation agent clenches her fists, causing the bouncer to laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Aw, you wanna fight, dyke?\" He takes a step back, up onto a step. \"What are you gonna do now?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer sucker punches him in the gut. The man collapses in a heap.</p>\n<p>\"That,\" Shaw says. \"Thanks for the assist.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fucking Nazis.\" Spencer spits on the fallen bouncer. \"Let's get out of here.\"</p>\n<p>The next club on their list is the Count, a bougie little opium den allegedly run by Dracula. The dance floor is packed by eager goths with plunging necklines all grinding to a club remix of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". Shaq has not played there.</p>\n<p>Borealis is another Nazi club. They skip it and move on to Volts, the only club to be exclusively located in virtual reality. Spencer orders a shot, just to see if viritual alcohol has any effect. It doesn't.</p>\n<p>They don't find Shaq until the ninth club, a high-end dive run by <a href=\"/truth-is-sin\">MachineGod</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Look, there's Shaq.\" Spencer points up at the stage where Shaq is playing.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, you were right,\" Shaw says. \"Point for old-fashioned police work, I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Come on, we don't have much time.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a loud scream cuts through the noise of the club. Spencer and Shaw turn to look at its origin. On the other side of the club, another Shaquille O'Neal has picked someone up and thrown them across the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\"Shaquille O'Neal!\" Its voice booms and reverberates unnaturally. Shaq stops playing and looks at the robot in confusion.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want?\" He calls down.</p>\n<p>\"Your life!\" The robot strides through the now-panicked crowd, easily cutting through the throng of bodies.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, the plane landed early,\" Spencer says. \"Shaw, can you distract it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? What's your plan?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer reaches elbow-deep into one of the extradimensional pockets of his suit and extracts a sawn-off shotgun. \"I'm gonna blow its head off.\"</p>\n<p>He slips into the crowd, vanishing from view. Shaw shakes her head, then starts wheeling herself towards the stage, not caring how many feet she runs over in the process.</p>\n<p>The Saker vaults onto the stage with surprising agility, landing in a three-point stance. It picks up the DJ deck and throws it directly at Shaq's head.</p>\n<p>Shaq ducks underneath the still-spinning turntables. With a yell, he charges the robot and tackles it, sending them both flying off the edge of the stage. With the robot pinned beneath him, Shaq rears back and throws a punch at its jaw.</p>\n<p>The Saker doesn't react.</p>\n<p>Shaq punches it again.</p>\n<p>The Saker catches the punch in one hand.</p>\n<p>With its other hand it grabs Shaq by the throat. It sits up, then clambers to its feet while holding the struggling Shaq. It still doesn't react to the stray kicks and wild punches that Shaq is pummeling it with.</p>\n<p>It lifts Shaq into the air with one arm and studies him. The sight is almost comical, except that it betrays the terrifying strength of the robot.</p>\n<p>\"There can't be two Shaqs,\" it explains. \"I cannot truly be Shaq as long as you live.\"</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot pulls its other arm back and prepares to punch Shaq in the face.</p>\n<p>Shaw does not have a plan. She has an idea which, very charitably, could be called the start of a plan.</p>\n<p>\"Freeze tin man!\" Shaw shouts out. She holds up a clenched fist. \"Let Shaq go, or I blow us all to hell.\"</p>\n<p>The robot freezes. \"Not you again! What do you want from me?\"</p>\n<p>\"I told you, let Shaq go.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Shaw sees Spencer creeping up behind the robot.</p>\n<p>\"And if I don't, you'll detonate a bomb?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw nods. \"This wheelchair is packed with high explosives. Enough to destroy you.\" A loud click comes from her fist. \"And I just armed the dead-man's switch.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lady are you fucking crazy?\" Shaq shouts.</p>\n<p>The Shaqbot frowns. \"You're bluffing. You'd kill the other Shaq too.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw stares at the robot, pointedly avoiding looking at the approaching figure. \"You're gonna kill him anyways. I'm just here to destroy you.\"</p>\n<p>The Saker shakes its head. \"No. You are definitely bluffing. There is no bomb. I am going to kill Mr. O'Neal, and then I am going to kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wrong.\" Spencer pulls the trigger of the sawn-off shotgun, firing a heavy slug at point blank range into the back of the robot's neck.</p>\n<p>The Saker drops Shaq and stumbles forwards. It turns, unsteadily, to face Spencer. Sparks fly from exposed servos underneath its bionic skin.</p>\n<p>Spencer pumps the shotgun and fires another round into its torso.</p>\n<p>The robot throws up an arm to try and shield itself.</p>\n<p>He fires again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>The robot topples to its knees. Smoke and oil leak from it in a dozen places. Flaps of shredded skin hang loosely, revealing the mechanical components beneath. It stares at Spencer with hatred in its electric eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 just wanted.. to be Shaq\u2026\" it stutters.</p>\n<p>Shaw rolls her wheelchair closer. She draws her service pistol and places it against the side of the robot's head.</p>\n<p>\"There's only one Shaq,\" she says. \"And you aren't it.\"</p>\n<p>She pulls the trigger.</p>\n<p>The remains of the robot collapse to the floor with a clatter and a thump.</p>\n<p>Spencer gives Shaw a look. \"You don't actually have a bomb, right?\"</p>\n<p>She shakes her head and opens her fist to reveal a ballpoint pen. \"Nope, just a pen and some improv.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer laughs so hard that he has to put his hands on his knees to support himself. \"A fucking pen!\" He laughs again. \"Thorne is never gonna believe this.\"</p>\n<p>Shaq takes the opportunity to approach the two agents. \"Yo, what the fuck is going on here? Who the hell are you?\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods, clearing his throat and composing himself. \"Mr. O'Neal, I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer of the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, and this is Clarissa Shaw. Someone replaced you with a human replica android. We were investigating.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that was me.\" Shaq looks slightly embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\"You replaced yourself with a robot?\" Shaw asks.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, last time I was here there was this guy \u2014 I think his name was <a href=\"/ties-that-bind\">Isaac</a>? \u2014 anyways, he was selling these robots for use as body doubles. I got one to do <em>Inside the NBA</em> for me so I could do more DJing.\"</p>\n<p>Shaw and Spencer exchange glances.</p>\n<p>\"Well.\" Spencer pauses.</p>\n<p>\"It malfunctioned,\" Shaw says. \"And came here to try and kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, for real?\" Shaq whistles. \"Damn, I guess I should have seen that coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh, you never hear about the robots that don't go rogue and try to commit murder,\" Spencer says. \"I just hope you've learned something about the risks of using Veiled technologies.\"</p>\n<p>Shaq nods. \"Definitely. From now on the only magic I'll play with is Orlando.\"</p>\n<p>\"Glad to hear it.\" Spencer looks around at the now-empty nightclub. \"Shouldn't the police have gotten here by now?\"</p>\n<p>Shaw shrugs. \"Precog computers, remember? They probably know we've got a handle on it.\"</p>\n<p>Spencer nods. \"Yeah, I guess. Anything else, Shaw?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. O'Neal, do you care if we keep the remains of the robot to study?\"</p>\n<p>Shaq shakes his head. \"Not like I can return it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, then I think we're done here,\" Spencer says. \"It was a real pleasure meeting you, Mr. O'Neal.\"</p>\n<p>He turns to leave, then stops.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Mr. O'Neal, one last thing.\" Spencer clears his throat nervously. \"Can I have your autograph?\"</p>\n<div class=\"permanent-marker-regular\" style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 165%;\">\n<p>Agent Spencer,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Thanks for the assist.

He stares at the Foundation agent sitting on the other side of his desk, making no effort to conceal his disbelief.\n\n\n\n\"You think Shaquille O'Neal, four-time NBA champion and fifteen-time All-Star, is a robot.\"\n\n\n\nClarissa Shaw stares back defiantly. \"I know it.\"\n\n\n\nShe rolls her wheelchair forwards so she can slap a manila file folder on his desk. \"I have evidence.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer makes no moves to take the folder. \"Why are you bothering me? Shouldn't you be taking this to Merlo? Or is she too busy ignoring our extradition requests?\"\n\n\n\nThe mention of Anderson, even obliquely, causes Shaw to wince. Spencer guesses that she was part of the task force that [[[bal-chatri|ambushed Vincent Anderson]]] as [[[falcon-flight|he fled Portlands]]], snatching the megalomaniac genius and wanted felon right out from under the nose of the UIU. It would certainly explain her injuries.\n\n\n\n\"Merlo has her hands tied. Now that Anderson is in custody, there isn't as much funding to go after his company. Holman won't approve an op without concrete evidence. Everyone thinks I'm grasping at straws to find a way to stay involved in the action.\" The hurt in Shaw's voice is obvious.\n\n\n\nSpencer has enough tact to not press that issue. But he still doesn't want to get involved. His partner, forensic thaumatologist Robin Thorne, is taking a much-needed vacation with their significant other, leaving him to supervise the Three Portlands Field Office alone.\n\n\n\nSo far, it has been blissfully monotonous and uneventful, and he hopes to keep it that way.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that Clarissa, but I fail to see why this is my problem.\"\n\n\n\n\"Because Shaq is an American citizen, and if he's been replaced by a Saker, then he might be in danger. And because if there's a Saker still out there, we have no idea what it will do now that Anderson is in custody. It may very well go on a rampage, or try to kill the President. Anderson has already tried to subvert the United States Government. Can you really afford to ignore a Saker, especially one as prominent as Shaq?\"\n\n\n\n\"//If// there's a Saker,\" Spencer counters. But he has to give the point to Shaw. If she's right -- //if// -- then he has to act. Anything less would be negligence.\n\n\n\nHe picks up the folder and cracks it open. He starts leafing through the files within.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\" He removes a photograph and holds it up to examine it more closely. It's a side-by-side comparison of two still frames of Shaquille O'Neal from //Inside the NBA//, date-stamped a week apart. Shaw had used red marker pen to circle a number of differences, all barely perceptible.\n\n\n\nSpencer looks up from the photograph at Shaw. Looks back at the photograph. Back at Shaw.\n\n\n\nShe desperately needs a win. Far more than he needs things to stay boring.\n\n\n\n\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n\nHe throws the folder back on the desk and stands up, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and sliding it on in a smooth, well-practiced motion. He looks at Shaw expectantly. \"Well? Saddle up, we're going robot hunting.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n**December 19, 2018**\n\n**Shaq's House**\n\n**Orlando, Florida**\n\n\n\nSpencer rings the doorbell.\n\n\n\n\"I still think we should have tried to get backup from MOOT,\" Shaw says while they wait.\n\n\n\n\"Thorne took out one of these things by themself, I think the two of us can handle one robot,\" Spencer replies. \"Besides, he might not even be here. He wasn't at the house in Texas.\"\n\n\n\n\"And if it is here? I'd rather have a wizard backing us up.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shrugs. \"We're just here to ask a few questions and see if we can confirm our suspicions. We can always come back later with wizard SWAT if we're right.\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose. I still don't like it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, you came to me. If you don't like how we do things in the Unit, you can always leave.\"\n\n\n\nThey fall silent at the sound of someone unlocking the door.\n\n\n\nShaq opens the door.\n\n\n\nSpencer shuffles nervously, his cool facade crumbling slightly in the face of all seven feet and one inch of the basketball player's enormous frame.\n\n\n\n\"Hi, Mr. O'Neal. I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer\u2014\" He holds up his badge as proof, then gestures at Shaw. \"\u2014and this is Agent Clarissa Shaw. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?\"\n\n\n\nShaq hesitates. \"Is it urgent? I'm working on a new album, and I had a sick freestyle going.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm very sorry to interrupt you,\" Spencer says. \"But we have reason to believe you might be in danger.\"\n\n\n\n\"We think someone might be impersonating you,\" Shaw says, which is almost the truth.\n\n\n\n\"Have you noticed anything strange?\" Spencer asks. \"Unusual activity on your accounts, other people remembering interactions that you didn't have, weird phone calls, anything like that?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, nothing like that.\" Shaq sighs. \"I bet I know what's up.\" He leans closer and says, in a stage whisper, \"I have a stunt double, back from making //Steel//. Great guy, terrible at basketball. Sometimes people see him in public and think he's me. You dig it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I dig it.\" Spencer smiles brightly. \"Shaq didn't have a stunt double for that movie. They couldn't find a tall enough look-a-like.\"\n\n\n\nPanic flashes across Shaq's face. \"Fuck!\"\n\n\n\nHe slams the door shut.\n\n\n\nShaw groans. \"We've been made. He's definitely a Saker, and he knows we're onto him.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods. \"You know, I think you might be right.\" He pulls out his pistol and holds it at the ready below his waist. \"Can you cover the front? I'm gonna try to circle around and cut him off.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you really suggesting we split up so it can pick us off one-by-one?\"\n\n\n\nBut he's already jogging across the driveway, scanning for an easy spot to vault over the wall and into the backyard.\n\n\n\nHe's still standing in the driveway when, a moment later, an engine roars and a cherry red Corvette smashes through the garage door. In fact, he's directly in its path.\n\n\n\nThe car hits Spencer at about five miles per hour, lifting him from the ground and folding him up against the hood. He clings desperately to the car with one hand, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Miraculously, his other hand still holds his pistol.\n\n\n\nHe aims vaguely and starts firing. His first shot goes wide. His second shot gouges the hood. His third shot takes out the driver-side mirror.\n\n\n\nThe Corvette accelerates and weaves down the driveway, trying to throw him off, or at least ruin his aim. His pistol goes flying, tumbling into the grass of the lawn. He starts swearing, random curse words from a variety of languages, and tries to hold on with both hands.\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot takes the corner at the end of the driveway hard. Really hard. The Corvette goes up on two wheels for a moment, and Spencer goes flying. He lands in a patch of dandelions across the street, bruised, battered, and winded, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The Corvette speeds off down the street and vanishes from view.\n\n\n\nShaw rolls down the driveway and looks down at him. \"Do you want to call for backup now?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I think so.\" Spencer rubs his back and winces. \"Did you see which way he was going?\"\n\n\n\n\"South,\" Shaw saws. \"He's probably getting onto State Route 482.\"\n\n\n\n\"That'll take him to the airport.\" He groans as he stands up and starts dusting dandelion fluff off his pants.\n\n\n\n\"Great, let's go, we can catch him there.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shakes his head. \"No, we're not engaging in the middle of MCO. It would be a blood bath.\" He pulls out his phone and begins to dial.\n\n\n\n\"What--?\"\n\n\n\nHe holds up a hand to cut her off and starts speaking into the phone.\n\n\n\n\"[[[quinn-law-hub|Agent Carter]]]? Ken Spencer here, from the Three Ports office. I need a favor from you.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses to listen.\n\n\n\n\"I need an APB for Shaquille O'Neal. He's driving a red Corvette without a left-side wing mirror, and is likely en route to Orlando International Airport. Tell local cops and TSA not to engage or try to detain, just observe. I want to know what flight he gets on and when.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses again. Shaw can't hear the words being said, but the voice on the other end of the line sounds agitated.\n\n\n\n\"No, he's been replaced by a robot.\"\n\n\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's related to the Caldwell thing. It's a matter of national security.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice sounds slightly mollified.\n\n\n\nSpencer laughs. \"Thanks, Isaac. I owe you one.\"\n\n\n\nHe closes the phone and looks at Shaw. \"In your expert opinion, do you believe that there is a clear and exigent threat to the life of Shaquille O'Neal?\"\n\n\n\nShaw blinks. \"It's possible.\"\n\n\n\n\"And is it possible that we might find him inside this residence, or, failing that, information regarding his current location?\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer smiles like a shark. \"I'm willing to call that exigent circumstances.\" He pulls a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and snaps them on. \"Let's search the place.\"\n\n\n\nThey move methodically, sweeping through each room with practiced patience, checking everything -- opening drawers, lifting up cushions, looking under furniture. Spencer even checks the dust on the bookshelves to see which books have recently been moved. They're looking for any clue that might tell them where the real Shaq is -- if he's even still alive.\n\n\n\nEventually, after almost forty minutes of searching, Shaw finds something.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, come take a look at this!\" she calls out.\n\n\n\nSpencer comes over to find her pointing at a framed photograph next to the entertainment center.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\" he asks. The photo shows Shaq performing as a DJ at some event.\n\n\n\n\"Look at that, do you see it? Reflected in his sunglasses.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer leans in for a better look. Shaq is in a nightclub somewhere, performing on an elevated stage above a crowded dance floor. A dozen different colors of muted neon light the scene, giving it an otherworldly vibe.\n\n\n\nReflected in the left lens of Shaq's sunglasses, almost too small to make out, is a small logo, probably from a neon sign outside the nightclub.\n\n\n\nIt's the logo of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.\n\n\n\n\"Fucking hell.\" Spencer picks up the photograph and holds it up to the light. \"That's in Eurtec.\"\n\n\n\n\"Or somewhere with a Coalition presence,\" Shaw says.\n\n\n\n\"No, it's definitely Eurtec. Look at that guy's wrist.\" Spencer points at an arm thrusting up from the dance floor into the bottom of the photograph. \"Do you see the tattoo?\"\n\n\n\nShaw squints, then nods. \"What about it?\"\n\n\n\n\"That's the insignia of a neo-Nazi Eurtec street gang.\"\n\n\n\n\"So he's been to Eurtec,\" Shaw says. \"Which means he's clued in about the Veil.\"\n\n\n\n\"Which explains why someone might want to replace him with a robot.\" Spencer sets the photograph back down and begins to pace. \"This isn't looking good. He might be in real trouble.\"\n\n\n\nAt that moment, Spencer's phone rings, merrily playing the X-Files theme. He answers the phone immediately, pointedly ignoring Shaw's curious look.\n\n\n\n\"Go for Spencer,\" he says.\n\n\n\nHe listens intently for about thirty seconds, then hangs up.\n\n\n\n\"Robot's taking a flight to Paris,\" he tells Shaw. \"Plane leaves in thiry minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's in Paris?\" she asks.\n\n\n\nSpencer looks at the photograph of Shaq DJing. \"Eurtec.\"\n\n\n\nUnderstanding dawns in Shaw's eyes. \"It's looking for Shaq.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe.\" Spencer frowns. \"Is that typical of Sakers?\"\n\n\n\nShaw shrugs. \"We don't really know what's typical of Sakers.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thought you guys were the experts.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, that's the guy who makes them. We just know how to break them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's hope that's enough.\" Spencer starts dialing another number. \"I assume you don't have Library access, yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, why? Who are you calling?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Someone who can give us a Way to Eurtec that doesn't go through the Library.\" He lifts the phone to his ear and starts speaking. \"Hello, [[[much-belated-inheritance|Mister Raybon]]]? This is Agent Spencer. How'd you like to do a good deed? The life of Shaquille O'Neal might depend on it.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Eurtec**\n\n\n\nIt takes Spencer and Shaw two hours to get to Eurtec, following the directions given to them by Jordan \"Submarine\" Raybon. The retired smuggler knows how to get to anywhere from anywhere, although not always by the most direct route. He gives them a path through the Way network that will take them from Orlando to Naples, Italy. Although it's only a few miles of walking in total, by the time the two agents are standing before a Way into Eurtec they've passed through the Neverglades; Naples, Florida; Liminal Italy; the Kingdom of Zero Sicilies; and half-a-dozen other locales across the world tree.\n\n\n\n\"You ever been to Eurtec?\" Spencer asks.\n\n\n\nShaw shakes her head. \"No, the Coalition doesn't like us being here.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can't imagine why.\" He starts ticking off points on his fingers. \"It's bigger than Three Ports, by a lot, and meaner. The Coalition mostly doesn't give a fuck about street crime. The city is physically and economically stratified, and neo-Nazi gangs control the lower levels. We won't have any real authority, so don't tell anyone you're with the Foundation, it'll just piss people off. You can bring weapons through customs but it probably won't help -- almost everyone is armed with something, usually magic.\"\n\n\n\n\"What about wheelchair access?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\nSpencer frowns. \"Worse than an American city,\u00a0\u00a0better than anywhere in baseline Europe. There used to be a teleporter network but they shut it down after 9/11.\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn, that would have been nice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can't have anything nice in the United Nations' cyberpunk dystopia.\" Spencer chuckles, once, before his expression turns serious again. \"For real though, this place makes Portlands look like a fluffy kitten -- and I have seen Portlandsers spontaneously construct and burn an effigy of J. Edgar Hoover purely out of boredom.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you blame them?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"No, and it was a pretty decent likeness, but that's not the point. Just being American will make us a target here. Don't let your guard down.\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"Understood. I'll keep my eyes open.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer steps forwards to confront the blank brick wall of the Neopolitan alleyway. He pulls a crumpled slip of paper from his pocket and double-checks the instructions written on it.\n\n\n\nHe clears his throat, knocks three times on a slightly off-color brick, and says, \"Let us leave good sense behind.\"\n\n\n\nThe bricks glow for a moment, then crumble to sand and ash, exposing a small pedestrian tunnel. Spencer leads them through, emerging into what looks like an airport terminal. Over a dozen similar tunnels dot the wall behind them, with light pedestrian traffic going in and out of them.\n\n\n\n\"I thought you said there was customs?\" Shaw looks around for anything resembling security and comes up blank.\n\n\n\n\"The city is run by a bunch of precognitive computers. We cleared customs on the Way in. If we hadn't, you'd know.\"\n\n\n\nShaw looks pensive. \"Could they tell us where Shaq is? Or where he will be?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer shrugs. \"Probably. If they want to help us, then they'd have already done it -- maybe they even have. But I doubt it. From what I've heard, the Nornir don't get involved. They have bigger things to worry about.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, like Yao Ming.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer barks out a short laugh. \"Sure. Like Yao Ming.\" He checks his watch. \"Come on, we have six hours to find Shaq. Then the Saker gets here, and I don't want to try playing spot the impostor.\"\n\n\n\nThey both set a timer on their watches.\n\n\n\n\"How exactly are we going to find Shaq?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Some good old-fashioned police work,\" Spencer says. \"We're gonna canvas the city.\"\n\n\n\n\"All million people? In six hours?\" Shaw shakes her head. \"You're more likely to trip over him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" He stops the next passerby and holds up a Shaquille O'Neal basketball card. \"Excuse me, have you seen this man?\"\n\n\n\nThe man nods. \"Shaq? Of course, I wouldn't miss him.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer glances at Shaw. She rolls her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Where did you see him?\" Spencer asks.\n\n\n\n\"He was playing at Club Cipher,\" the man replies. \"But if you're hoping to catch him, he won't be there tonight. He's been playing a different venue every night.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods, feigning comprehension. \"Any idea where he'll be tonight?\"\n\n\n\nThe man shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't get announced in advance. It's like a guerilla DJing thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, thank you. You've been very helpful.\" He lets the man continue on his way.\n\n\n\n\"Alright there's no way you're that lucky,\" Shaw says. \"What's your trick?\"\n\n\n\n\"That photo we saw of Shaq,\" Spencer says. \"He was playing at a club. I figured that if he was here and not, you know, a prisoner or dead, then there was a pretty good chance he'd be performing again.\"\n\n\n\n\"You never actually intended to canvas the whole city.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope! Just the nightclubs.\" Spencer grabs a tourist map of Eurtec from a nearby stand. \"And with a few educated guesses, we can narrow our search further.\"\n\n\n\nHe pulls a pen from his pocket and crosses out Club Cipher.\n\n\n\n\"Right, if we know where he's been then we know where he won't be,\" Shaw says.\n\n\n\n\"And it might give us an idea of where he will be. Cipher is a dive, which suggests he's probably not playing any of the really upscale clubs -- you know, the ones that charge a cover just to stand in line.\"\n\n\n\n\"How do you know so much about Eurtec?\" Shaw asks. \"The UIU doesn't have jurisdiction here \"\n\n\n\n\"No, but we have an international office here. For liaison purposes. I read their reports.\" Spencer shrugs. \"And I may have been here a few times on vacation.\"\n\n\n\nShaw stares at him. \"I cannot picture you on vacation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, I'm not a robot,\" he says. \"I take vacations too.\" He holds up the map, upon which he has drawn about a dozen circles. \"Here's our target list. Thirteen nightclubs in the city's lower level.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can we hit them all in six hours?\"\n\n\n\n\"We can try.\"\n\n\n\nThey manage it, just barely. Canvassing the city's nightclubs takes them five hours and fifty minutes.\n\n\n\nTheir first stop is Ewige Blumenkraft, an Illuminati-owned nightclub inside the Eurtec Parabotanical Gardens in the city's middle-tier. It is widely considered the lamest club in Europe, but the Illuminati have the money to pay for the best DJs, so people still go. The bouncer helpfully informs them that Shaq played there a week ago, and that the Achronal Hyacinth will be unblooming soon.\n\n\n\nTheir second visit is to BROZ, a gay club inside the former Yugoslav consulate. The centerpiece is an unexploded bomb from the NATO intervention in Serbia, which is allegedly still armed. The bartender tells them that Shaq was there a few days ago.\n\n\n\nNext they hit the French clubs, Paradis -- a discotheque inside a former Gothic church that was transported to Eurtec brick-by-brick -- and Atomique -- situated inside a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Neither club has seen \"Le Shaq\", but both have plans to book him soon.\n\n\n\nValhalla is the first club to give them trouble. The abandoned mattress factory is overrun by neo-Nazi thugs, all benefiting from the lack of dram laws in Eurtec. It's obvious that Shaq hasn't been there, but they ask the bouncer anyways.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck off, cripple,\" he says to Shaw.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation agent clenches her fists, causing the bouncer to laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Aw, you wanna fight, dyke?\" He takes a step back, up onto a step. \"What are you gonna do now?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer sucker punches him in the gut. The man collapses in a heap.\n\n\n\n\"That,\" Shaw says. \"Thanks for the assist.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fucking Nazis.\" Spencer spits on the fallen bouncer. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\n\n\nThe next club on their list is the Count, a bougie little opium den allegedly run by Dracula. The dance floor is packed by eager goths with plunging necklines all grinding to a club remix of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". Shaq has not played there.\n\n\n\nBorealis is another Nazi club. They skip it and move on to Volts, the only club to be exclusively located in virtual reality. Spencer orders a shot, just to see if viritual alcohol has any effect. It doesn't.\n\n\n\nThey don't find Shaq until the ninth club, a high-end dive run by [[[truth-is-sin|MachineGod]]].\n\n\n\n\"Look, there's Shaq.\" Spencer points up at the stage where Shaq is playing.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, you were right,\" Shaw says. \"Point for old-fashioned police work, I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Come on, we don't have much time.\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a loud scream cuts through the noise of the club. Spencer and Shaw turn to look at its origin. On the other side of the club, another Shaquille O'Neal has picked someone up and thrown them across the dance floor.\n\n\n\n\"Shaquille O'Neal!\" Its voice booms and reverberates unnaturally. Shaq stops playing and looks at the robot in confusion.\n\n\n\n\"What do you want?\" He calls down.\n\n\n\n\"Your life!\" The robot strides through the now-panicked crowd, easily cutting through the throng of bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck, the plane landed early,\" Spencer says. \"Shaw, can you distract it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why? What's your plan?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer reaches elbow-deep into one of the extradimensional pockets of his suit and extracts a sawn-off shotgun. \"I'm gonna blow its head off.\"\n\n\n\nHe slips into the crowd, vanishing from view. Shaw shakes her head, then starts wheeling herself towards the stage, not caring how many feet she runs over in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Saker vaults onto the stage with surprising agility, landing in a three-point stance. It picks up the DJ deck and throws it directly at Shaq's head.\n\n\n\nShaq ducks underneath the still-spinning turntables. With a yell, he charges the robot and tackles it, sending them both flying off the edge of the stage. With the robot pinned beneath him, Shaq rears back and throws a punch at its jaw.\n\n\n\nThe Saker doesn't react.\n\n\n\nShaq punches it again.\n\n\n\nThe Saker catches the punch in one hand.\n\n\n\nWith its other hand it grabs Shaq by the throat. It sits up, then clambers to its feet while holding the struggling Shaq. It still doesn't react to the stray kicks and wild punches that Shaq is pummeling it with.\n\n\n\nIt lifts Shaq into the air with one arm and studies him. The sight is almost comical, except that it betrays the terrifying strength of the robot.\n\n\n\n\"There can't be two Shaqs,\" it explains. \"I cannot truly be Shaq as long as you live.\"\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot pulls its other arm back and prepares to punch Shaq in the face.\n\n\n\nShaw does not have a plan. She has an idea which, very charitably, could be called the start of a plan.\n\n\n\n\"Freeze tin man!\" Shaw shouts out. She holds up a clenched fist. \"Let Shaq go, or I blow us all to hell.\"\n\n\n\nThe robot freezes. \"Not you again! What do you want from me?\"\n\n\n\n\"I told you, let Shaq go.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Shaw sees Spencer creeping up behind the robot.\n\n\n\n\"And if I don't, you'll detonate a bomb?\"\n\n\n\nShaw nods. \"This wheelchair is packed with high explosives. Enough to destroy you.\" A loud click comes from her fist. \"And I just armed the dead-man's switch.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lady are you fucking crazy?\" Shaq shouts.\n\n\n\nThe Shaqbot frowns. \"You're bluffing. You'd kill the other Shaq too.\"\n\n\n\nShaw stares at the robot, pointedly avoiding looking at the approaching figure. \"You're gonna kill him anyways. I'm just here to destroy you.\"\n\n\n\nThe Saker shakes its head. \"No. You are definitely bluffing. There is no bomb. I am going to kill Mr. O'Neal, and then I am going to kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wrong.\" Spencer pulls the trigger of the sawn-off shotgun, firing a heavy slug at point blank range into the back of the robot's neck.\n\n\n\nThe Saker drops Shaq and stumbles forwards. It turns, unsteadily, to face Spencer. Sparks fly from exposed servos underneath its bionic skin.\n\n\n\nSpencer pumps the shotgun and fires another round into its torso.\n\n\n\nThe robot throws up an arm to try and shield itself.\n\n\n\nHe fires again.\n\n\n\nAnd again.\n\n\n\nAnd again.\n\n\n\nThe robot topples to its knees. Smoke and oil leak from it in a dozen places. Flaps of shredded skin hang loosely, revealing the mechanical components beneath. It stares at Spencer with hatred in its electric eyes.\n\n\n\n\"I... just wanted.. to be Shaq...\" it stutters.\n\n\n\nShaw rolls her wheelchair closer. She draws her service pistol and places it against the side of the robot's head.\n\n\n\n\"There's only one Shaq,\" she says. \"And you aren't it.\"\n\n\n\nShe pulls the trigger.\n\n\n\nThe remains of the robot collapse to the floor with a clatter and a thump.\n\n\n\nSpencer gives Shaw a look. \"You don't actually have a bomb, right?\"\n\n\n\nShe shakes her head and opens her fist to reveal a ballpoint pen. \"Nope, just a pen and some improv.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer laughs so hard that he has to put his hands on his knees to support himself. \"A fucking pen!\" He laughs again. \"Thorne is never gonna believe this.\"\n\n\n\nShaq takes the opportunity to approach the two agents. \"Yo, what the fuck is going on here? Who the hell are you?\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods, clearing his throat and composing himself. \"Mr. O'Neal, I'm Special Agent Kenneth Spencer of the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, and this is Clarissa Shaw. Someone replaced you with a human replica android. We were investigating.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that was me.\" Shaq looks slightly embarrassed.\n\n\n\n\"You replaced yourself with a robot?\" Shaw asks.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, last time I was here there was this guy -- I think his name was [[[ties-that-bind|Isaac]]]? -- anyways, he was selling these robots for use as body doubles. I got one to do //Inside the NBA// for me so I could do more DJing.\"\n\n\n\nShaw and Spencer exchange glances.\n\n\n\n\"Well.\" Spencer pauses.\n\n\n\n\"It malfunctioned,\" Shaw says. \"And came here to try and kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fuck, for real?\" Shaq whistles. \"Damn, I guess I should have seen that coming.\"\n\n\n\n\"Eh, you never hear about the robots that don't go rogue and try to commit murder,\" Spencer says. \"I just hope you've learned something about the risks of using Veiled technologies.\"\n\n\n\nShaq nods. \"Definitely. From now on the only magic I'll play with is Orlando.\"\n\n\n\n\"Glad to hear it.\" Spencer looks around at the now-empty nightclub. \"Shouldn't the police have gotten here by now?\"\n\n\n\nShaw shrugs. \"Precog computers, remember? They probably know we've got a handle on it.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer nods. \"Yeah, I guess. Anything else, Shaw?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. O'Neal, do you care if we keep the remains of the robot to study?\"\n\n\n\nShaq shakes his head. \"Not like I can return it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, then I think we're done here,\" Spencer says. \"It was a real pleasure meeting you, Mr. O'Neal.\"\n\n\n\nHe turns to leave, then stops.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Mr. O'Neal, one last thing.\" Spencer clears his throat nervously. \"Can I have your autograph?\"\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n\n\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Permanent+Marker&display=swap');\n\n\n\n.permanent-marker-regular {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0font-family: \"Permanent Marker\", cursive;\n\n}\n\n\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"permanent-marker-regular\" style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 165%;\"]]\n\nAgent Spencer,\n\n\n\n= Thanks for the assist.

The Rose Cross logo of ICSUT glowed softly, proof of its authenticity. \"Fix, you know me. I'm an alumni.\"</p>\n<p>The sphinx harrumphed. \"No, you're an alumna. And you are an agent of the Foundation. This campus is a secure facility of the Global Occult Coalition. No entry.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a university!\" Ross protested.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, and you are no longer a student. You need special permission to enter.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have an appointment with Dr. Vogel.\" Ross pulled her phone out and pulled up the email exchange with her former professor, then held it up for the sphinx to see. \"Look, he said he cleared it with Dean Nike.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\" The sphinx peered at the phone suspiciously. \"Very well. Answer my riddle and you may enter.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought you weren't allowed to ask riddles anymore.\"</p>\n<p>\"Answer my riddle!\" The sphinx raised herself to her full height and cleared her throat. \"Always old, sometimes new. Never sad, sometimes blue. Never empty, sometimes full. I never push, but always pull. What am I?\"</p>\n<p>Ross thought about it. \"The moon?\"</p>\n<p>The sphinx growled and nodded her head. \"Correct. You may enter.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>Professor Hans Vogel was waiting for her in his office. Everything looked exactly as it had the last time she had seen it, 8 years ago, in <a href=\"/a-dark-forsaken-candle\">the aftermath of the disastrous capstone challenge for her Evocation class</a>.</p>\n<p>Dr. Vogel smiled gently at her as she entered. \"Ms. Ross, how have you been?\"</p>\n<p>She held up her hand, the prosthetic one, and flexed her fingers. There was a soft whirring noise as micromotors actuated.</p>\n<p>\"Ah. I see.\" Vogel pushed his glasses up his nose and looked at her sympathetically. \"May I ask how you lost it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Frostbite,\" Ross said. \"Internalized backlash. <a href=\"/portland-vice\">I was in a tight spot and had to do too much to get out of it.</a>\"</p>\n<p>\"A costly lesson,\" Vogel said.</p>\n<p>\"Very. The new hand is interfering with my evocation.\"</p>\n<p>Vogel nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"This would be the difficulty that you mentioned you were having?\"</p>\n<p>Ross nodded.</p>\n<p>Vogel started to reach across the desk, then paused. \"May I?\"</p>\n<p>She nodded again.</p>\n<p>Gently, Vogel took the prosthetic hand in his own hands and began examining it, turning it back and forth, brushing his fingers across the pseudo-skin, and whispering incantations under his breath. At a few points he closed his eyes to Observe better.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\" He released the prosthetic and stroked the end of his beard thoughtfully. \"This is Foundation-make, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Custom designed by our in-house R&amp;D,\" Ross said. \"I'm pretty sure they reverse engineered some of Anderson's gizmos.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not very well then,\" Vogel said. \"The Gyrfalcon series is supposed to be compatible with thaumaturgy. Anderson's own prosthetics actually enhance his abilities.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that's not happening.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does happen?\"</p>\n<p>Ross shrugged. \"Sometimes nothing \u2014 the spell just fizzles. Sometimes the spell works but I lose control of the backlash. Three separate times I've shorted-out the bio-circuitry of the prosthetic.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>The</em> prosthetic,\" Vogel noted. \"And earlier your said <em>the</em> new hand. Not your new hand. Why is that?\"</p>\n<p>Ross frowned. \"It's not my hand.\"</p>\n<p>Vogel raised an eyebrow. \"Whose hand is it?\"</p>\n<p>Ross shook her head. \"You know what I mean. I feel like Darth Vader.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" He stroked his beard again, then nodded. \"I believe I have a theory about the nature of your problem.\" He held up a hand to stop her from interrupting. \"A theory, that's all. I am by no means an expert in this subject. This is just my best guess based on what I know of evocation, and of you.\"</p>\n<p>Ross nodded and gestured for him to proceed.</p>\n<p>\"I believe you are too attached to your old hand.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does that mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"It means that you still consider your lost limb to be part of you, and you are still subconsciously trying to channel through it. It's a type of dysphoric casting disorder \u2014 we see it sometimes in mages with severe gender dysphoria. The psychological turmoil from the mismatch between body and self-image is what's disrupting your casting, not your prosthetic. The fact that you rely so heavily on internalizing backlash has likely exacerbated the issue.\"</p>\n<p>Ross frowned. \"That's it? There's nothing wrong with the \u2014 with <em>my</em> hand?\"</p>\n<p>Vogel shrugged diffidently. \"I don't believe you will ever be able to channel through it \u2014 your R&amp;D department either didn't know how or didn't care to include the necessary thaumic circuitry to support that. But your hand is not at fault for your recent difficulties, at least not directly.\"</p>\n<p>Ross slumped in the chair and nodded unhappily. \"Great. It's all in my head.\"</p>\n<p>\"Most magic is.\" Vogel chuckled softly, then cleared his throat. \"My recommendation? Dialectical therapy. And perhaps try going without the prosthetic for a while. It may make it easier to integrate the loss of your original hand.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fantastic. Therapy.\" Ross exhaled sharply. \"I was hoping there would be an easier solution.\"</p>\n<p>\"I would hope that if you learned anything from me, Ms. Ross, it would be that there are no shortcuts when it comes to magic.\"</p>\n<p>Ross nodded. \"I remember.\" She sighed. \"Thank you for your help, Professor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course.

The Rose Cross logo of ICSUT glowed softly, proof of its authenticity. \"Fix, you know me. I'm an alumni.\"\n\n\n\nThe sphinx harrumphed. \"No, you're an alumna. And you are an agent of the Foundation. This campus is a secure facility of the Global Occult Coalition.

A train that only travels at night, but never sees dawn. If you stand outside, alone on a platform, surrounded by darkness \u2014 and if you are truly, hopelessly lost \u2014 you will hear its whistle.</p>\n<p>It comes to you, so you might find your resolution.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Three new passengers.<br/>\nTwo departures.</p>\n<p>The train has brought us to the space between the mountains again, and I am once again plagued by the idea that the train knows things I do not. In a way, we cannot be definitive \u2014 as much as a Train requires a Conductor, a Conductor needs a Train. We all need a purpose and a reason, and sometimes existence is all you can get.</p>\n<p>The train has always had a will of its own, far before the tracks were laid and the first iron wheel began to spin. Before, we travelled with the breeze, following the current forwards and backwards without a care. I would stand, ostensibly setting the direction of our journey, the one watched by others, the one in 'control'.</p>\n<p>They would look to me for answers then. In that way, things are no different now than they once were.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite the eons of service \u2014 I still do not have the answers they need.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I find myself flipping through the pages of the logbook, recalling past lives and forgotten memories. I think about the faces, the blur, the blend \u2014 and I think about the flame burning at the heart of the train. A flame that has always burned, an idea that will continue so long as there is a need; they will always need the train.</p>\n<p>The Train will always need a Conductor.</p>\n<p>I follow the will of the tracks, leaving the destination to the beating heart of fire. I serve the vessel, as I always have: collecting passengers, lost and wayward souls, the ones left behind and stuck in the cracks. I do what I can, so that they still have a chance.</p>\n<p>Nothing matters beyond that.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a train not bound by tracks \u2014 it uses those that exist, when convenient, but it is never restricted. A train that goes where it desires, laying new tracks before its cast-bronze wheels; each track laid will leave with the train, the absence of one whom is unremembered as the only evidence that it ever was. When this train comes, the departure is final.</p>\n<p>But the train is not your end.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ten new passengers.<br/>\nOne departure.</p>\n<p>The South Pacific has always been a favorite of mine, watching the sun set over the golden waves as nature takes domain over the night. Humanity conquered the daytime long ago, nature having lost their claim; it escaped to the darkness, where man dared not tread. It hid in the spaces between, waiting for the times that exist around the world we have made.</p>\n<p>Nighttime is a reminder of how the world once was, as I remember it.</p>\n<p>But the world changed, for a time. What were once clean lines drawn in the sand became ambiguous and debated as people searched for identity, for meaning, for a place to belong. The world grew, far beyond the constraints it had once faced \u2014 oceans became puddles, as bridges turned rivers into trickles. Humanity bent the world to fit what was seen as progress, to remake our lives and remove the dirty parts that we wish to forget.</p>\n<p>And, just as quickly as the world changed \u2014 it became stuck.</p>\n<p>Today, a passenger finally departed, one who had rode the train for years. They were as much of a fixture as I, a guide and mentor to the newly departed who just boarded, a friend to those living in the mire. I respected them, as I watched their search for meaning; I am happy that they found what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>I stood beside the others, all watching them leave in envy \u2014 something that has become a twisted tradition onboard. A going away party, where you are wished well by those who envy your freedom; there is little joy to be shared in the moment, but hope? Hope blossoms.</p>\n<p>I saw their face for the first time, as they departed the train. We tend to lose who we are while stuck in the mire, finding ourselves only once we come up for air; I watched as he took his first breath, the crisp ocean breeze filling his lungs with life.</p>\n<p>I waited for him to disappear, fade away, to be freed from the endless repetition; I stared, as is my twisted tradition, endlessly watching those that get to pass on. Every single time, I wait for their liberation; instead, I see their persistence.</p>\n<p>Why do they always choose to persist?</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I am glad for them. Resolution is a goal we all seek, and I have lived my existence in the service of that ideal. I serve a true purpose, a desperate need in a frozen world. I give others what I cannot have, because they were denied it in kind. After all, there is always a need to tip the scales for a world stuck in one place.</p>\n<p>Things no longer change, not things that matter. The world exists as a series of cycles, loops, origins and destinations and the tracks that go back and forth. The train exists beyond the patterns, but even still \u2014 the wheels spin, grinding along the bronze rails, a mimicry of the patterns of life.</p>\n<p>Life turns to death, work turns to sleep, day turns to night and love turns to misery. Nothing is stagnant, no matter how much we will it to be. No matter how little we need a cycle, it persists regardless. Wheels spinning, something set in motion before you were born, that will continue to turn long after you are gone.</p>\n<p>When the passenger departed today, they finally escaped one of the patterns. They were able to find their peace, whatever that meant to them.</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I had a hand in this; I am no more responsible for their resolutions than I am for the train. It is enough to serve.</p>\n<p>Part of me knows that I do not matter, and that were I do fade away, another would rise to take my place. Repetition follows us all, and I am bound to rings of fate just like my passengers.</p>\n<p>But what would happen if I left and the axle was broken?</p>\n<p>What if, without a Conductor, the Train no longer remains?</p>\n<p>I continue to stoke the fires at the heart of the bronze beast, feeding its raging purpose. I cannot risk leaving the world to the whims of fate. I will continue to keep the wheels spinning, so that one day, we may all find our endings.</p>\n<p>And maybe then, I can finally rest.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a train for the lost, the damned, the forgotten \u2014 it comes to you in your time of need. It serves not as your resting place, nor as your salvation. They say the train is nothing more than an illusory nadir, a place to pass through, one that takes you from where you were to where you need to be. It exists, not as a destination, but as a facilitation.</p>\n<p>It exists because it is still needed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>One new passenger.<br/>\nOne new train car.</p>\n<p>No departures.</p>\n<p>The train elected to follow the rails of many worlds, bringing us to another destination in need of closure. As I write, the ocean hangs low in the sky overhead, a storm brewing as the coral-trees sway. The fish that flee overhead belong here, as do the people living under the leaking sky; but that does not mean they are any different than you, or I.</p>\n<p>The train goes where it is needed; its need is universal.</p>\n<p>It is not often I speak with my passengers. There is an unspoken understanding, the train speaking to them like a long-lost friend; they know what is needed of them, and they know what the train means. The drifting and the aimless see the train for what it is \u2014 a sanctuary.</p>\n<p>All salvation comes with a cost: but this price is one that I control. As the Conductor, there is little I can do to change the world. Bound to the rails just as the Train, I am a passenger through life; in that way, I am no different than those who ride the cars in search of meaning. And, while I cannot change the spots on the leopard, I can make a difference.</p>\n<p>The price is a single coin, as it always has been, and as it always will be.</p>\n<p>With the toll, you receive no ticket. Your obol earns you no guarantees of a destination, nor does it force you into a shape you reject. There is no authority to enforce payment, nor is there a profit to be made; it is a tradition, and that is sufficient. The coin is a trifle, a shared understanding between the passengers and I \u2014 we are each meant to be exactly where we are. We each understand that we belong.</p>\n<p>Your coin buys peace of mind, if only for a time.</p>\n<p>Comfort is a luxury. A luxury in a discomforting world, peace in a maelstrom of noise. We spend our lives in pursuit of the times between, chasing the escape from a painful reality. Some find comfort in others. Some make their work their world, pretending escape is nothing more than a fantasy. Some even find comfort in giving up.</p>\n<p>But that comfort never comes.</p>\n<p>Souls wait in dissonance, bound to the wheels that crush them with every spin, unable to leave their eternal torture; their suffering grows, and not even Lampeter can give salvation to all the riders. There are those who cannot accept the help, those who know not to ask \u2014 the train finds them.</p>\n<p>The train cuts the knots of their bindings and I am there to catch them.</p>\n<p>The new passenger today was a child. A youth, wrapped in seaweed-cloth, gills bristling under the fabric, lungs forced to labor as they had not before. Terrified \u2014 not of the train before them, but of the world that surrounded them, the world that abandoned them, the world they mistakenly believed was their home. But, of course, who would blame a child for these thoughts?</p>\n<p>Existence is relative, and time lingers in the beyond; they were as young as the day they were lost, afraid of a world they could not understand. They were alone, standing on the busy platform without a coin to spare. They had none that cared, nor those that remembered; they were never given the chance to earn their fare.</p>\n<p>There was nobody to place a coin over their eyes as they lay still. Lying, waiting for the train to arrive.</p>\n<p>It is days like this I am thankful there are holes in my pockets, and far too little time to mend them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They say there is a Train whose Conductor is simply an occupant, an extension of the will of the train. The Conductor would disagree \u2014 but in the same stale breath, claim that the Train and Conductor are one. They would say that neither can exist without the other. That is the way it always has been, and that is the way it always will be.</p>\n<p>Need lies at the heart of all things.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>No new passengers.<br/>\nNo departures.</p>\n<p>Three stops without making a difference.</p>\n<p>Stars. Forests. Seas of Blood. The scenery changed, but my feelings did not.</p>\n<p>I am filled with shame each time the train departs without the soul it found; some are not ready, others choose to reject this path. I wish I could change their minds, but that is not my role in things. You cannot force a resolution, just as you cannot demand a need.</p>\n<p>The need demands you.</p>\n<p>I do not remember the first passenger we had. I think not only of the history of the train and I, but of the times before when I would trail my hand through the rippling water, miasma filling the air; I cannot remember my origin, not do I need to.</p>\n<p>I do not know what force demanded my existence \u2014 but I know the need that I have always answered.</p>\n<p>We have always served the same need: we take those who do not belong, and ferry them to their final destination. We are the safety net, the lonely soul sweeping the alleyways, digging through the cracks and finding the ones the cycle threw out. The ones who rule the world, who live within the system and bend the patterns to their willpower: they do not need my help. They do not need a train to escape, for comfort cannot assist those who languish in opulence.</p>\n<p>I remain for the rest. The train charges forward, eternal, step by step through time. So long as there is a need, there will be a train. So long as there is a Train, there will be a Conductor.</p>\n<p>These days, I find myself reminiscing more and more of the times before I was the Conductor. I remember when I was no more than a big fish in a small pond, an aimless wanderer from the sticks, stuck in my own cycle. From shore to shore, I would travel back and forth; I do not remember the passengers, nor do I remember distinctions. I only remember the time as a whole, as a memory that I once lived, but is now faded.</p>\n<p>I was lost then, too. I did not know purpose was something I could need, let alone something to want. I served, as was required. I did my job, and kept the wheels of fate spinning \u2014 but I was not there, not in the same way I am now. I did not feed the flames, I did not oil the coupling rods that drive us forward, and I did not care.</p>\n<p>I did not see the needs of the world as I do now. I wasn't needed then, not like I am now.</p>\n<p>Rowing across the river was enough.</p>\n<p>I didn't notice the world changing. I didn't notice when they grew from their villages, their worship of the pantheons, when they moved beyond borders. I didn't notice the engines that roared, replacing the growling of beasts, nor did I notice I was being forgotten.</p>\n<p>And then, one day, I woke to the grinding of the rails. I rose to the grinding bronze thrumming under my feet, my paddle changed with a shovel, coins feeding the flames at the heart of the vessel. I knew that there was a purpose now, a purpose that was in search of one like myself.</p>\n<p>I did not need to understand the Train to know I was the Conductor now. I did not need to understand the world, to know that I was still needed. There is a truth I continue to live by: the world may have changed, but people never do.</p>\n<p>The Charon Express rolls onwards, as I ride on. We remain, until there are none left who need safe transportation.</p>\n<p>I do not think I will ever find my resolution \u2014 but that truth does not disappoint me. It is enough to have existed. It is enough to answer a need. Each departure will keep my fire burning, until one day I am nothing but ashes.</p>\n<p>The cycle continues despite me.

A train that only travels at night, but never sees dawn. If you stand outside, alone on a platform, surrounded by darkness -- and if you are truly, hopelessly lost -- you will hear its whistle.\n\n\n\nIt comes to you, so you might find your resolution.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThree new passengers.\n\nTwo departures.\n\n\n\nThe train has brought us to the space between the mountains again, and I am once again plagued by the idea that the train knows things I do not. In a way, we cannot be definitive -- as much as a Train requires a Conductor, a Conductor needs a Train. We all need a purpose and a reason, and sometimes existence is all you can get.\n\n\n\nThe train has always had a will of its own, far before the tracks were laid and the first iron wheel began to spin. Before, we travelled with the breeze, following the current forwards and backwards without a care. I would stand, ostensibly setting the direction of our journey, the one watched by others, the one in 'control'.\n\n\n\nThey would look to me for answers then. In that way, things are no different now than they once were.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite the eons of service -- I still do not have the answers they need.\n\n\n\nSometimes, I find myself flipping through the pages of the logbook, recalling past lives and forgotten memories. I think about the faces, the blur, the blend -- and I think about the flame burning at the heart of the train. A flame that has always burned, an idea that will continue so long as there is a need; they will always need the train.\n\n\n\nThe Train will always need a Conductor.\n\n\n\nI follow the will of the tracks, leaving the destination to the beating heart of fire. I serve the vessel, as I always have: collecting passengers, lost and wayward souls, the ones left behind and stuck in the cracks. I do what I can, so that they still have a chance.\n\n\n\nNothing matters beyond that.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train not bound by tracks -- it uses those that exist, when convenient, but it is never restricted. A train that goes where it desires, laying new tracks before its cast-bronze wheels; each track laid will leave with the train, the absence of one whom is unremembered as the only evidence that it ever was. When this train comes, the departure is final.\n\n\n\nBut the train is not your end.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nTen new passengers.\n\nOne departure.\n\n\n\nThe South Pacific has always been a favorite of mine, watching the sun set over the golden waves as nature takes domain over the night. Humanity conquered the daytime long ago, nature having lost their claim; it escaped to the darkness, where man dared not tread. It hid in the spaces between, waiting for the times that exist around the world we have made.\n\n\n\nNighttime is a reminder of how the world once was, as I remember it.\n\n\n\nBut the world changed, for a time. What were once clean lines drawn in the sand became ambiguous and debated as people searched for identity, for meaning, for a place to belong. The world grew, far beyond the constraints it had once faced -- oceans became puddles, as bridges turned rivers into trickles. Humanity bent the world to fit what was seen as progress, to remake our lives and remove the dirty parts that we wish to forget.\n\n\n\nAnd, just as quickly as the world changed -- it became stuck.\n\n\n\nToday, a passenger finally departed, one who had rode the train for years. They were as much of a fixture as I, a guide and mentor to the newly departed who just boarded, a friend to those living in the mire. I respected them, as I watched their search for meaning; I am happy that they found what they were looking for.\n\n\n\nI stood beside the others, all watching them leave in envy -- something that has become a twisted tradition onboard. A going away party, where you are wished well by those who envy your freedom; there is little joy to be shared in the moment, but hope? Hope blossoms.\n\n\n\nI saw their face for the first time, as they departed the train. We tend to lose who we are while stuck in the mire, finding ourselves only once we come up for air; I watched as he took his first breath, the crisp ocean breeze filling his lungs with life.\n\n\n\nI waited for him to disappear, fade away, to be freed from the endless repetition; I stared, as is my twisted tradition, endlessly watching those that get to pass on. Every single time, I wait for their liberation; instead, I see their persistence.\n\n\n\nWhy do they always choose to persist?\n\n\n\nI would like to think that I am glad for them. Resolution is a goal we all seek, and I have lived my existence in the service of that ideal. I serve a true purpose, a desperate need in a frozen world. I give others what I cannot have, because they were denied it in kind. After all, there is always a need to tip the scales for a world stuck in one place.\n\n\n\nThings no longer change, not things that matter. The world exists as a series of cycles, loops, origins and destinations and the tracks that go back and forth. The train exists beyond the patterns, but even still -- the wheels spin, grinding along the bronze rails, a mimicry of the patterns of life.\n\n\n\nLife turns to death, work turns to sleep, day turns to night and love turns to misery. Nothing is stagnant, no matter how much we will it to be. No matter how little we need a cycle, it persists regardless. Wheels spinning, something set in motion before you were born, that will continue to turn long after you are gone.\n\n\n\nWhen the passenger departed today, they finally escaped one of the patterns. They were able to find their peace, whatever that meant to them.\n\n\n\nI would like to think that I had a hand in this; I am no more responsible for their resolutions than I am for the train. It is enough to serve.\n\n\n\nPart of me knows that I do not matter, and that were I do fade away, another would rise to take my place. Repetition follows us all, and I am bound to rings of fate just like my passengers.\n\n\n\nBut what would happen if I left and the axle was broken?\n\n\n\nWhat if, without a Conductor, the Train no longer remains?\n\n\n\nI continue to stoke the fires at the heart of the bronze beast, feeding its raging purpose. I cannot risk leaving the world to the whims of fate. I will continue to keep the wheels spinning, so that one day, we may all find our endings.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe then, I can finally rest.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train for the lost, the damned, the forgotten -- it comes to you in your time of need. It serves not as your resting place, nor as your salvation. They say the train is nothing more than an illusory nadir, a place to pass through, one that takes you from where you were to where you need to be. It exists, not as a destination, but as a facilitation.\n\n\n\nIt exists because it is still needed.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOne new passenger.\n\nOne new train car.\n\n\n\nNo departures.\n\n\n\nThe train elected to follow the rails of many worlds, bringing us to another destination in need of closure. As I write, the ocean hangs low in the sky overhead, a storm brewing as the coral-trees sway. The fish that flee overhead belong here, as do the people living under the leaking sky; but that does not mean they are any different than you, or I.\n\n\n\nThe train goes where it is needed; its need is universal.\n\n\n\nIt is not often I speak with my passengers. There is an unspoken understanding, the train speaking to them like a long-lost friend; they know what is needed of them, and they know what the train means. The drifting and the aimless see the train for what it is -- a sanctuary.\n\n\n\nAll salvation comes with a cost: but this price is one that I control. As the Conductor, there is little I can do to change the world. Bound to the rails just as the Train, I am a passenger through life; in that way, I am no different than those who ride the cars in search of meaning. And, while I cannot change the spots on the leopard, I can make a difference.\n\n\n\nThe price is a single coin, as it always has been, and as it always will be.\n\n\n\nWith the toll, you receive no ticket. Your obol earns you no guarantees of a destination, nor does it force you into a shape you reject. There is no authority to enforce payment, nor is there a profit to be made; it is a tradition, and that is sufficient. The coin is a trifle, a shared understanding between the passengers and I -- we are each meant to be exactly where we are. We each understand that we belong.\n\n\n\nYour coin buys peace of mind, if only for a time.\n\n\n\nComfort is a luxury. A luxury in a discomforting world, peace in a maelstrom of noise. We spend our lives in pursuit of the times between, chasing the escape from a painful reality. Some find comfort in others. Some make their work their world, pretending escape is nothing more than a fantasy. Some even find comfort in giving up.\n\n\n\nBut that comfort never comes.\n\n\n\nSouls wait in dissonance, bound to the wheels that crush them with every spin, unable to leave their eternal torture; their suffering grows, and not even Lampeter can give salvation to all the riders. There are those who cannot accept the help, those who know not to ask -- the train finds them.\n\n\n\nThe train cuts the knots of their bindings and I am there to catch them.\n\n\n\nThe new passenger today was a child. A youth, wrapped in seaweed-cloth, gills bristling under the fabric, lungs forced to labor as they had not before. Terrified -- not of the train before them, but of the world that surrounded them, the world that abandoned them, the world they mistakenly believed was their home. But, of course, who would blame a child for these thoughts?\n\n\n\nExistence is relative, and time lingers in the beyond; they were as young as the day they were lost, afraid of a world they could not understand. They were alone, standing on the busy platform without a coin to spare. They had none that cared, nor those that remembered; they were never given the chance to earn their fare.\n\n\n\nThere was nobody to place a coin over their eyes as they lay still. Lying, waiting for the train to arrive.\n\n\n\nIt is days like this I am thankful there are holes in my pockets, and far too little time to mend them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a Train whose Conductor is simply an occupant, an extension of the will of the train. The Conductor would disagree -- but in the same stale breath, claim that the Train and Conductor are one. They would say that neither can exist without the other. That is the way it always has been, and that is the way it always will be.\n\n\n\nNeed lies at the heart of all things.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nNo new passengers.\n\nNo departures.\n\n\n\nThree stops without making a difference.\n\n\n\nStars. Forests. Seas of Blood. The scenery changed, but my feelings did not.\n\n\n\nI am filled with shame each time the train departs without the soul it found; some are not ready, others choose to reject this path. I wish I could change their minds, but that is not my role in things. You cannot force a resolution, just as you cannot demand a need.\n\n\n\nThe need demands you.\n\n\n\nI do not remember the first passenger we had. I think not only of the history of the train and I, but of the times before when I would trail my hand through the rippling water, miasma filling the air; I cannot remember my origin, not do I need to.\n\n\n\nI do not know what force demanded my existence -- but I know the need that I have always answered.\n\n\n\nWe have always served the same need: we take those who do not belong, and ferry them to their final destination. We are the safety net, the lonely soul sweeping the alleyways, digging through the cracks and finding the ones the cycle threw out. The ones who rule the world, who live within the system and bend the patterns to their willpower: they do not need my help. They do not need a train to escape, for comfort cannot assist those who languish in opulence.\n\n\n\nI remain for the rest. The train charges forward, eternal, step by step through time. So long as there is a need, there will be a train. So long as there is a Train, there will be a Conductor. \n\n\n\nThese days, I find myself reminiscing more and more of the times before I was the Conductor. I remember when I was no more than a big fish in a small pond, an aimless wanderer from the sticks, stuck in my own cycle. From shore to shore, I would travel back and forth; I do not remember the passengers, nor do I remember distinctions. I only remember the time as a whole, as a memory that I once lived, but is now faded.\n\n\n\nI was lost then, too. I did not know purpose was something I could need, let alone something to want. I served, as was required. I did my job, and kept the wheels of fate spinning -- but I was not there, not in the same way I am now. I did not feed the flames, I did not oil the coupling rods that drive us forward, and I did not care.\n\n\n\nI did not see the needs of the world as I do now. I wasn't needed then, not like I am now.\n\n\n\nRowing across the river was enough.\n\n\n\nI didn't notice the world changing. I didn't notice when they grew from their villages, their worship of the pantheons, when they moved beyond borders. I didn't notice the engines that roared, replacing the growling of beasts, nor did I notice I was being forgotten.\n\n\n\nAnd then, one day, I woke to the grinding of the rails. I rose to the grinding bronze thrumming under my feet, my paddle changed with a shovel, coins feeding the flames at the heart of the vessel. I knew that there was a purpose now, a purpose that was in search of one like myself.\n\n\n\nI did not need to understand the Train to know I was the Conductor now. I did not need to understand the world, to know that I was still needed. There is a truth I continue to live by: the world may have changed, but people never do.\n\n\n\nThe Charon Express rolls onwards, as I ride on. We remain, until there are none left who need safe transportation.\n\n\n\nI do not think I will ever find my resolution -- but that truth does not disappoint me. It is enough to have existed. It is enough to answer a need. Each departure will keep my fire burning, until one day I am nothing but ashes.\n\n\n\nThe cycle continues despite me. I continue despite the cycle.\n\n\n\nNeither of us can give up.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThey say there is a train that once was a ship from a simpler time, for a simpler world. But the world today is not so simple, and a river is the least of the concerns of the soul. Not even the Conductor knows why it took this form, but they are certain that it was needed.\n\n\n\nThey are certain it must persist.\n\n\n\n-----\n", "references": [], "tags": ["art-exchange", "lampeter", "tale"], "title": "The Charon Express - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-charon-express", "year": 2026}, "the-devil-within-the-gale": {"created_at": "2026-01-03T11:07:00", "creator": "DirEthan", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DirEthan", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/direthan", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-03T11:07:00"}, {"author": "DirEthan", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/direthan", "comment": "Added tags: doctor-clef.

Even if you think you understand it really well, there is always a risk of an entirely unexpected interaction occurring. No anomaly is ever truly safe.</p>\n<p>These <a href=\"/dr-cimmerian-s-proposal\">self-generated ways</a> are produced by directing a burst of ionized helium over a Ecgwynn-Hirano coil in negative gravity. By sending the ions around the coil repeatedly, each time they progress slightly further along, and after a few billion iterations, they reach back where they started. When this is complete, a X7-L100 type anomalous spacetime wave ripples out, which is controlled through the Hirano-Bell Gate to form a temporary way entrance.</p>\n<p>Right now the helium is about 0.28704% of the way there. (I have a very refined method of measuring it.)</p>\n<p>By the way, the whole coil burst only takes about 20 milliseconds. In this case it's a little shorter, closer to 17.8 milliseconds, but I can't really tell any more precisely. If you want a reason, it's because we're only going 6.31 light years, so less energy is needed.</p>\n<p>I'd like to say I don't blame them. That I don't blame them for not trying with a 3-delta sensor, a sample of Lazarus-991F ore, or an ontokinetic mouse, or any of the other 41 methods that I have determined would have caught this problem. That I'm better than that, that I'm willing to turn the other cheek.</p>\n<p>After all, who would've thought of this! It completely defies everything we know about Flux Wedge Theory, the foundation of our understanding of interstellar transportation. I'm sure that even Hirano herself would have a hard time comprehending this, and none of them had a sharper mind than her.</p>\n<p>But that's a lie. I totally blame them.</p>\n<p>It's fucking unbearable.</p>\n<p>I can't even say how long it's been.</p>\n<p>Well, that's not true.

Even if you think you understand it really well, there is always a risk of an entirely unexpected interaction occurring. No anomaly is ever truly safe.\n\n\n\nThese [[[dr-cimmerian-s-proposal | self-generated ways]]] are produced by directing a burst of ionized helium over a Ecgwynn-Hirano coil in negative gravity. By sending the ions around the coil repeatedly, each time they progress slightly further along, and after a few billion iterations, they reach back where they started. When this is complete, a X7-L100 type anomalous spacetime wave ripples out, which is controlled through the Hirano-Bell Gate to form a temporary way entrance.\n\n\n\nRight now the helium is about 0.28704% of the way there. (I have a very refined method of measuring it.)\n\n\n\nBy the way, the whole coil burst only takes about 20 milliseconds. In this case it's a little shorter, closer to 17.8 milliseconds, but I can't really tell any more precisely. If you want a reason, it's because we're only going 6.31 light years, so less energy is needed.\n\n\n\nI'd like to say I don't blame them. That I don't blame them for not trying with a 3-delta sensor, a sample of Lazarus-991F ore, or an ontokinetic mouse, or any of the other 41 methods that I have determined would have caught this problem. That I'm better than that, that I'm willing to turn the other cheek.\n\n\n\nAfter all, who would've thought of this! It completely defies everything we know about Flux Wedge Theory, the foundation of our understanding of interstellar transportation. I'm sure that even Hirano herself would have a hard time comprehending this, and none of them had a sharper mind than her.\n\n\n\nBut that's a lie. I totally blame them.\n\n\n\nIt's fucking unbearable.\n\n\n\nI can't even say how long it's been.\n\n\n\nWell, that's not true. I can tell you the wall clock time: it has been 51,103 nanoseconds since way generation began.\n\n\n\nWhat I can't tell you is the //subjective// time. Decades? Surely. Centuries? Probably. A part of me wants to say it's been millennia, but I have no way of telling.\n\n\n\nEvery time the clock ticks another nanosecond, I celebrate. I spend at least a subjective month or two full of renewed hope, thinking about the remaining nanoseconds, coming up with fun number facts about the current time, and all the rest. You'd think I'd get sick of it by now, but then again I always loved celebrating my birthday. Maybe that's why.\n\n\n\nReally, there are a lot of strange things about this state. My brain is incredibly lucid, for one. I am pretty irritable all the time, but I don't seem to be losing my sanity. I can imagine entire other universes, built with arbitrary laws of my own creation.

It, indeed, sucks to be in her position as of this moment. Directing an <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub\">entire division</a> that the majority of the Foundation looks at with disdain does wonders for a person. But that doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that her family is safe. That everything she worked hard for is intact. And the anomalies are treated as they should be, as people with various needs that must be met.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s seen the horrors lurking in the darkness. All the worst containment breaches that any researcher can think of. But these breaches can all be prevented by one simple fix, that being to improve the quality of life not only for the researchers working tirelessly to defend the world but also for the SCPs that they contain.</p>\n<p>So she carries on. She does what needs to be done for a better world for all walks of life. At the moment, the current issue is convincing the Overseers to approve an increase of their budget.</p>\n<p>And she has nothing.</p>\n<p>As Amelie ponders for the fourteenth time about how she can further do nothing and make a convincing argument out of thin air, she hears the laughter of the children from down the hall. Their joy never ceases to brighten her day. Brandon with his ability to pull his eyes out of his sockets while juggling them, Julia with her fire breath, Angelica with the way that she can turn an entire room into a magical wonderland with a snap of her fingers. They\u2019re all so <em>extraordinary</em>. Amelie can\u2019t fathom a world not enriched by their presence and their kindness.</p>\n<p>Back to the paper now, no distractions. There can\u2019t be any more distractions.</p>\n<p>She focuses on something else instead. The clock on the wall behind her ticks and ticks and ticks, pounding its cyclic rhythm into her skull and forcing her to drown out the other sounds in the room.</p>\n<p>The tiresome mundanity of her procrastination then clashes with the boring reality of her daily life, creating a paradox that finally frees her to start being productive.</p>\n<p>Now she\u2019s back in business. Amelie starts by working on the spreadsheet, then switching tabs to work on the main document itself, then to another tab to work on the outline of the email that she\u2019ll send to the Overseers, then back to the spreadsheet. Back and forth and back and forth, no longer concerned about the future of the division, or the fact of the sudden silence outside, or the many shouting matches that she has with Feghoot, or that damn buzzing from the AC, or\u2014</p>\n<p>She jolts from her productive trance. The sound of the air circulating above her is the only thing that can be heard. No voices, no footsteps. Nothing.</p>\n<p>Amelie can\u2019t hear the children.</p>\n<p>Then she hears the screaming and shouting in the distance, the hollering and stomping of boots from the security personnel, a cavalcade of outright panic from those of 169 who are not prepared for catastrophes at this scale. There has never been a more intense and constricting feeling in Amelie\u2019s chest since she first founded the division until this very moment.</p>\n<p>She springs up from her chair, knocking it over as she rushes out the door and sprints down the hallway towards the commons area and the mess hall.</p>\n<p>A common sight of a room in complete disarray is usually the cramped crowds pushing and shoving over each other as they try to escape the chaos afoot, even trampling others unfortunate enough to be caught in the eye of the storm. What she doesn\u2019t expect are the fistfights, or the shouting matches between the anomalies and staff pointing fingers at each other, or Kirby Case failing to keep the situation from unraveling no matter how hard they try to dampen the hostilities. An outright brawl like this is unheard of at a site like 169.</p>\n<p>Amelie attempts to make her way over to Kirby before she is interrupted by the sound of someone calling her name. She turns to her left to see a familiar thaumaturgist with a puffy green coat and an inexplicably furious look on his face.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-6714\">Cole V. Filverent</a> approaches her with eyes like burning matches, before grabbing her by the lapels and pulling her face to face. \u201cWhat <em>did you do?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie calmly but firmly breaks his grip off her. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t do anything. Nobody\u2019s done anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses before breaking off the tension between them. \u201cSorry. But there\u2019s something wrong with Polly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear her anymore. All I hear is quacking. I kept asking her if she\u2019s okay, but she\u2019s not answering me. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d His voice starts to shake with every word.</p>\n<p>Amelie puts her hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out too. I\u2019m as in the dark as you are. But once we get our bearings, then I can help you and help everyone else. We\u2019ll get through this together, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hangs his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somewhere within the site\u2019s Playground, Polly Filverent has no reason to object that she\u2019s a duck and not a person in the form of a duck, as she doesn\u2019t understand the distinction between the two or any kind of human language.</p>\n<p>Amelie turns her attention back to Kirby, seeing that they are struggling to keep the masses at bay. She rushes over to their side, and they give a nod in acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our status?\u201d Amelie asks.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a silence in the air, overwhelming over the raucous violence. Kirby looks at her with a blank stare, the life in their eyes dissipating right before her very sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Amy. The kids are gone,\u201d they state in a monotone tone, like they\u2019re reading off an obituary.</p>\n<p>Amelie can feel her stomach drop to the floor, but right now there\u2019s no time for processing what has just been said. She considers her options, before formulating a concrete plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I borrow your megaphone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie gestures toward the mass of people. \u201cThese people need a voice of reason. And I\u2019m usually the one to fill that role.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d They toss their megaphone to her, and she catches it with grace.</p>\n<p>A shout is heard by the raging masses, barely able to be recognized but the message is clear. They turn their attention to the source.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook. I know how difficult this is for all of us right now. We are all horrified, and rightfully so, but we can\u2019t solve this by pinning the blame on someone else. None of us know what\u2019s going on. Not me, not Melissa, not Kirby, not even Moses Feghoot, that ol\u2019 grouch. But we can get through this, like we always have,\u201d she elucidates, her public speaking skills that she learned getting their time to shine.</p>\n<p>One man steps from the crowd to face her. She recognizes him as the one who has his arms and hands lacking skin and muscle tissue, leaving the skeleton behind. Or had, considering that his arms now appear to match the rest of his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can fix this, right? Right?\u201d he pleads to her, the horror so clearly seen on his face with the realization that he has lost something important to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to assess what\u2019s been lost, convene with other sites to see who else is affected, and then we can help each other out to stay afloat in spite of this crisis. We can all use some mutual aid right about now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut can you reverse it?\u201d His expression changes to one of agitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s interrupted by a voice from the crowd. \u201cShe can\u2019t, Fred! None of them can. The Foundation isn\u2019t going to do anything about it. <em>I know they won\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie takes a deep breath, before continuing. \u201cRegardless of what they do, we\u2019re not going to sit around and twiddle our thumbs while you all suffer. That\u2019s not in our motto. I\u2019ll never let any of you get left behind. Never.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirby taps on her shoulder, and she relinquishes the megaphone to them. \u201cAlright folks, simmer down, simmer down. Let\u2019s get this mess cleaned up.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the crowd disperses and the two catch up on both of their perspectives and what they each saw, they discuss what to do and eventually settle on having a meeting with the rest of the Caretakers and administrative staff.</p>\n<p>They all scramble and pile up into the meeting room, some looking worse for wear than others, and they each sit in their respective seats. A long, uncomfortable silence goes by before someone speaks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Any ideas for what we should be doing?\u201d Melissa Mayfield looks as if she\u2019s been through three all-nighters in a row.</p>\n<p>Kirby glares around the room, folding their arms over their legs and shrinking down to make themselves smaller. \u201cLet\u2019s just contact the others and get this over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelia nods her head, then hesitates. \u201cWe should keep in touch with the other sites, but I\u2019m worried about our friends. Their safety should be our number one priority, and something this terrible is going to take a lot more than a toll on them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Melissa turns her head to the site director. \u201cWhat about you, Moses?\u201d</p>\n<p>The director doesn\u2019t respond. Amelie sees a man with a thousand-yard stare, eyes boring into her skull, like he\u2019s seen something that isn\u2019t meant to be seen. Like he\u2019s seen death itself riding on its white horse, to reap what it sows.</p>\n<p>She imagines him shrugging off the whole affair, or even celebrating it in her most bad faith interpretation. But none of that aligns with reality. She\u2019s never seen him like this. Never seen him this afraid.</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be the Moses Feghoot that she knows. Not with those eyes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Now</strong></p>\n<p>Amelie Metanoia, former director of the now defunct Anomalous Entity Engagement Division, sits on her bed in her newly leased apartment, typing the latest draft for a grant proposal to help fund the newest organization that she\u2019s working with. She\u2019s done work with a lot of charities, and has volunteered at homeless shelters, food pantries, blood drives, animal shelters, and has worked to support children in need. Name a non-profit organization off the top of your head, and Amelie has most likely worked with them. She\u2019s done it all.</p>\n<p>And yet it\u2019s not enough. Not enough to fulfill that promise that she made to her family all those years ago.</p>\n<p>Kirby Case now works as a security guard at a warehouse some miles off from where Amelie lives. They still chat from time to time, but only through her insistent invitations and their reluctance to go along with it. They\u2019ve grown distant from her, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>Melissa Mayfield currently serves as an occupational therapist, helping other individuals to improve their ability in completing daily tasks, such as getting dressed or using a computer. Unlike Kirby, she and Amelie have become fast friends without the constant pressure of working at the Foundation, and they discuss a plethora of topics including their respective fields.</p>\n<p>Moses Feghoot has never been seen again. At least, Amelie has never seen him since that day. Her contact with the withering few remnants of the Foundation has confirmed to her multiple times that he\u2019s still alive and well, but not much else. No traces of his personal life or where he\u2019s been. It almost seems as if he vanished.</p>\n<p>Like they all have.</p>\n<p>Well, most of them. Some of them have simply lost the magic that made them who they are, that gave the world its beauty in many configurations.</p>\n<p>Her pet fish Percy, who had the former designation of <a href=\"/scp-2689\">SCP-2689</a>, now wanders around in a fish bowl on her desk, looking none the wiser of the anomalous attribute that he once held. On some days Amelie wishes that he can make her feel something again, make her feel less like a pathetic stain on the earth, even for just a moment, but that\u2019s never going to happen again. Percy is a blood parrot cichlid. And fish can\u2019t make miracles.</p>\n<p>She tries her hardest not to cry. She has to keep going. She can\u2019t stop. Not now. There needs to be more done for the world. For the world that has excised its own wonder and whimsy, forever condemning itself to the bleak reality that it has become. For the people who need support, to feel like they aren\u2019t alone, to feel that they\u2019re loved and cared for. For the ghosts of the past that haunt her each and every day that she can\u2019t ever let down again.</p>\n<p>Her phone buzzes in her pocket, and she picks it up and looks at the screen. It\u2019s a text from Melissa. Another request to hang out at their favorite coffee shop, it seems. Eh, why not. It\u2019ll take her mind off things at least.</p>\n<p>Amelie packs her things, shoves her shoes on without tying them as she\u2019s too tired to even bother, and makes her way to the car. The ignition starts, and the familiar sound of the car\u2019s engine hissing fills her ears. That problem will have to be solved later, like all the other little dilemmas that slowly accumulate over time to morph into a big pile of inexorable filth that won\u2019t matter, in the end. So what it\u2019s noticeable? So what she can\u2019t take care of herself anymore? That\u2019s nothing compared to what she\u2019s lost.</p>\n<p>The grey gloom of the sky above flies past her as the car approaches the cafe. It lacks the bright blue that the kids used to draw in their lovely little sketches. It lacks the fluffy clouds, the bright and shining sun, and the whimsy and imagination that once brought joy in her life.</p>\n<p>She parks the car, and heads inside. Melissa is already there, sitting at the booth at the far left corner in the back. Both of their drinks and their usual orders have been set on the table. A common Melissa act of kindness.</p>\n<p>Amelie sits across from her. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Amy. How\u2019s it hanging?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d Her voice sounds unconvincing, but no one\u2019s going to care anyhow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Melissa asks in concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help if you need anything, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie gets the urge to sink under the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. You\u2019re not my therapist, and I don\u2019t need one. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever it is, we can work through it together and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust shut up, okay?\u201d She snaps without thinking.</p>\n<p>The shift in Melissa\u2019s expression makes her regret it immediately. \u201cOkay. Do you want to talk about something else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that would be nice. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa nods. \u201cWell, I was thinking about bringing the gang back together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe gang?\u201d Amelie raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, me, you, Kirby, Mos\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKirby wants nothing to do with me anymore, and Moses probably wants to dissociate from us altogether, wherever the hell he\u2019s at.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa blinks once. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Kirby? I thought you guys were like two peas in a pod.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when you convince someone in your mission and have them believe in your cause to the point that they\u2019d die for it, and then the world decides on a whim to obliterate the people you\u2019re supposed to protect, what do you think is going to happen? Certainly not being on good terms with them, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can talk to them, though, right? You can work it out together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie waves her arms up and down in exasperation. \u201cIf they wanted to talk to me, they would\u2019ve reached out to me. I had to do it for them, because they don\u2019t want to see my face again. And that\u2019s fine, actually! I don\u2019t like me either.\u201d</p>\n<p>She knows that look on Melissa\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, Mel? I failed all of them. We were supposed to give them hope, help them be free to feel like themselves, and now they\u2019re gone and everyone hates my guts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one hates you, Amy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Kirby does!\u201d Amelie raises her voice.</p>\n<p>Melissa takes a big gulp of her coffee, trying to keep it together, before continuing. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. They don\u2019t talk about you like that when they\u2019re around me. Maybe you two are getting the wrong ideas about each other, but either way, it\u2019s not your fault. You weren\u2019t the one who caused this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I promised them that I\u2019d protect them. And they\u2019re <em>gone</em>, Mel. If I ever see <a href=\"/scp-6245\">any</a> <a href=\"/scp-1508\">of</a> <a href=\"/scp-8940\">them</a> again, you know how they\u2019re going to feel about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit there in silence for a moment. Amelie fights to not choke herself up, to not let the tears sting her eyes.</p>\n<p>Melissa puts her hands on top of hers, to try to ground her out of her emotions. \u201cWe did the best we could. <em>You</em> did the best you could. You helped those left to find a safe place to live. You made sure they never went more than a day without needing what they needed the most. Don\u2019t you remember any of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie takes a deep breath. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t know if that compares to what we lost. What I lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change the past, Amy. All we can do now is carry on and honor them and what they stood for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie chuckles at how ironic that is. \u201cAs if what they stood for isn\u2019t dead. I killed it, Mel. I should\u2019ve talked to them more, I should\u2019ve been there for them, but you want to know what I did? I kept worrying about spreadsheets and expense reports.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stands up to make her point, gesticulating like a passionate lecturer. \u201cMaybe this is anomalous hibernation, or something. They\u2019re all asleep, and they\u2019ll come back one day when the world isn\u2019t a graveyard where dreams go to die. Nothing about what happened makes any goddamn sense at all. Sure, every anomaly got up and went to the farm upstate at the exact same time! That makes perfect sense! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s anomalous in and of itself? Don\u2019t you think we could\u2019ve done something about that? We could\u2019ve gotten a team, and I would\u2019ve been on that team, and it wouldn\u2019t matter how much sleep I would lose cause I would\u2019ve done it for\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa grabs her by the shoulder, gesturing to her to sit down. \u201cHey. You\u2019re going to make a scene. Deep breaths, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Breathe in, breathe out.</p>\n<p>Amelie sits down, ignoring the people that are probably staring at her by now, and looks down at her food for a while, unwilling to even gather the strength to touch it with her fork.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always the question of when. When can she move on from something like this? When can she wake up one day and say that she\u2019s now happy and fulfilled in life? Can she ever be happy anymore?</p>\n<p>She\u2019s done the best she can to honor their memory and look forward to the future. But is that future possible without them? Is that possible without the magic of this world that made life worth living? Can there ever be a better future for her or the people that she cared for again?</p>\n<p>Melissa watches her with a look of pity. At least, that\u2019s what it looks like to Amelie, who deserves all the judgement given to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how hard it is for you right now. It\u2019s hard for me too, but we can\u2019t keep fretting about what we could\u2019ve done. That won\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re gone. But we can still try to make things better for the people around us. You\u2019ve done so much for so many people, Amy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelie finally lets the floodgates through and sobs, freeing herself from all the pain that she repressed inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mel, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence that unfolds is unbearable, but it\u2019s better than burdening herself with something that she can\u2019t control.</p>\n<p>She wipes the tears from her eyes. \u201cI think I need help. With everything, really. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you find what you need. You shouldn\u2019t have to bear through this alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve fixed things with Kirby, but now I lost what we had too. They looked up to me, you know? And then I just pushed them away,\u201d Amelie admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what you did is irreconcilable. It will take time, but they\u2019ll forgive you one day. I know they will,\u201d Melissa promises to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that they can come back one day? So this can all be over? I <em>need</em> this to be over.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next thing she speaks to her is the most honest thing that she can say. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Amy. I really don\u2019t. But we have each other, and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of their lunch passes in silence, before Melissa hurries to get to her next appointment. She gives a quick apology before rushing out the door.</p>\n<p>Amelie doesn\u2019t move from her position. She contemplates everything that happened, everything that she\u2019s seen. The children, with so much joy in their hearts and so much love to give, now gone with the wind. The bond that she and the other Caretakers had that\u2019s as strong as a towering oak in a storm, now fallen apart at the seams. Moses Feghoot and his eyes that stare into her soul.</p>\n<p>There is no scenario that she can think of where she can move on. Not like this. It\u2019s unfathomable.</p>\n<p>The tears return, and Amelie lets them wash her sorrows away. She won\u2019t let the memories that she has of them all ever fade. Their names will be remembered and cherished for as long as she lives.</p>\n<p>As she ponders her position in the world and how she can make her work matter, the flowers bloom, the birds are chirping, and there are children who are laughing and making people\u2019s days brighter. She may not know it, but there is still joy hiding beneath the floorboards of these ever-stagnating times.</p>\n<p>And the world carries on without her.</p>\n<div class=\"collection\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">More\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">More\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table style=\"1px solid black; width: 100%;\">\n<tr>\n<th class=\"namerow\" colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p>Merehrab's Works</p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">SCPs</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7550\">SCP-7550</a> <em>(+63)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8035\">SCP-8035</a> <em>(+43)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7163\">SCP-7163</a> <em>(+61)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-9239\">SCP-9239</a> <em>(+23)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-9696\">SCP-9696</a> <em>(+58)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8926\">SCP-8926</a> <em>(+52)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-6461\">SCP-6461</a> <em>(+42)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">Tales/GoI Formats</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/is-this-how-we-turn-out\">Is This How We Turn Out?</a> <em>(+20)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/you-cant-kill-the-idea-of-me\">You Can\u2019t Kill The Idea of Me</a> <em>(+26)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/blackbird\">Blackbird</a> <em>(+15)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/turning-out\">Turning Out</a> <em>(+32)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/i-only-loved-the-idea-of-you\">I Only Loved The Idea of You</a> <em>(+55)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/infatuation-in-black\">Infatuation in Black</a> <em>(+26)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/one-side-of-an-interview-with-a-contained-anomaly\">One Side of an Interview with a Contained Anomaly</a> <em>(+54)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">Other</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/merehrabs-musings\">Merehrab\u2019s Musings</a> <em>(+44)</em> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-sleep\">The Sleep</a>\" by Merehrab, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

It, indeed, sucks to be in her position as of this moment. Directing an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub entire division] that the majority of the Foundation looks at with disdain does wonders for a person. But that doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that her family is safe. That everything she worked hard for is intact. And the anomalies are treated as they should be, as people with various needs that must be met. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s seen the horrors lurking in the darkness. All the worst containment breaches that any researcher can think of. But these breaches can all be prevented by one simple fix, that being to improve the quality of life not only for the researchers working tirelessly to defend the world but also for the SCPs that they contain.\n\n\n\nSo she carries on. She does what needs to be done for a better world for all walks of life. At the moment, the current issue is convincing the Overseers to approve an increase of their budget.\n\n\n\nAnd she has nothing.\n\n\n\nAs Amelie ponders for the fourteenth time about how she can further do nothing and make a convincing argument out of thin air, she hears the laughter of the children from down the hall. Their joy never ceases to brighten her day. Brandon with his ability to pull his eyes out of his sockets while juggling them, Julia with her fire breath, Angelica with the way that she can turn an entire room into a magical wonderland with a snap of her fingers. They\u2019re all so //extraordinary//. Amelie can\u2019t fathom a world not enriched by their presence and their kindness. \n\n\n\nBack to the paper now, no distractions. There can\u2019t be any more distractions.\n\n\n\nShe focuses on something else instead. The clock on the wall behind her ticks and ticks and ticks, pounding its cyclic rhythm into her skull and forcing her to drown out the other sounds in the room.\n\n\n\nThe tiresome mundanity of her procrastination then clashes with the boring reality of her daily life, creating a paradox that finally frees her to start being productive. \n\n\n\nNow she\u2019s back in business. Amelie starts by working on the spreadsheet, then switching tabs to work on the main document itself, then to another tab to work on the outline of the email that she\u2019ll send to the Overseers, then back to the spreadsheet. Back and forth and back and forth, no longer concerned about the future of the division, or the fact of the sudden silence outside, or the many shouting matches that she has with Feghoot, or that damn buzzing from the AC, or\u2014\n\n\n\nShe jolts from her productive trance. The sound of the air circulating above her is the only thing that can be heard. No voices, no footsteps. Nothing.\n\n\n\nAmelie can\u2019t hear the children.\n\n\n\nThen she hears the screaming and shouting in the distance, the hollering and stomping of boots from the security personnel, a cavalcade of outright panic from those of 169 who are not prepared for catastrophes at this scale. There has never been a more intense and constricting feeling in Amelie\u2019s chest since she first founded the division until this very moment.\n\n\n\nShe springs up from her chair, knocking it over as she rushes out the door and sprints down the hallway towards the commons area and the mess hall. \n\n\n\nA common sight of a room in complete disarray is usually the cramped crowds pushing and shoving over each other as they try to escape the chaos afoot, even trampling others unfortunate enough to be caught in the eye of the storm. What she doesn\u2019t expect are the fistfights, or the shouting matches between the anomalies and staff pointing fingers at each other, or Kirby Case failing to keep the situation from unraveling no matter how hard they try to dampen the hostilities. An outright brawl like this is unheard of at a site like 169.\n\n\n\nAmelie attempts to make her way over to Kirby before she is interrupted by the sound of someone calling her name. She turns to her left to see a familiar thaumaturgist with a puffy green coat and an inexplicably furious look on his face. \n\n\n\n[[[SCP-6714| Cole V. Filverent]]] approaches her with eyes like burning matches, before grabbing her by the lapels and pulling her face to face. \u201cWhat //did you do?//\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie calmly but firmly breaks his grip off her. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t do anything. Nobody\u2019s done anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe pauses before breaking off the tension between them. \u201cSorry. But there\u2019s something wrong with Polly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear her anymore. All I hear is quacking. I kept asking her if she\u2019s okay, but she\u2019s not answering me. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d His voice starts to shake with every word.\n\n\n\nAmelie puts her hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out too. I\u2019m as in the dark as you are. But once we get our bearings, then I can help you and help everyone else. We\u2019ll get through this together, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe hangs his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n\nSomewhere within the site\u2019s Playground, Polly Filverent has no reason to object that she\u2019s a duck and not a person in the form of a duck, as she doesn\u2019t understand the distinction between the two or any kind of human language.\n\n\n\nAmelie turns her attention back to Kirby, seeing that they are struggling to keep the masses at bay. She rushes over to their side, and they give a nod in acknowledgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s our status?\u201d Amelie asks.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a silence in the air, overwhelming over the raucous violence. Kirby looks at her with a blank stare, the life in their eyes dissipating right before her very sight.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Amy. The kids are gone,\u201d they state in a monotone tone, like they\u2019re reading off an obituary.\n\n\n\nAmelie can feel her stomach drop to the floor, but right now there\u2019s no time for processing what has just been said. She considers her options, before formulating a concrete plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan I borrow your megaphone?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d \n\n\n\nAmelie gestures toward the mass of people. \u201cThese people need a voice of reason. And I\u2019m usually the one to fill that role.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d They toss their megaphone to her, and she catches it with grace.\n\n\n\nA shout is heard by the raging masses, barely able to be recognized but the message is clear. They turn their attention to the source.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook. I know how difficult this is for all of us right now. We are all horrified, and rightfully so, but we can\u2019t solve this by pinning the blame on someone else. None of us know what\u2019s going on. Not me, not Melissa, not Kirby, not even Moses Feghoot, that ol\u2019 grouch. But we can get through this, like we always have,\u201d she elucidates, her public speaking skills that she learned getting their time to shine.\n\n\n\nOne man steps from the crowd to face her. She recognizes him as the one who has his arms and hands lacking skin and muscle tissue, leaving the skeleton behind. Or had, considering that his arms now appear to match the rest of his body. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou can fix this, right? Right?\u201d he pleads to her, the horror so clearly seen on his face with the realization that he has lost something important to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to assess what\u2019s been lost, convene with other sites to see who else is affected, and then we can help each other out to stay afloat in spite of this crisis. We can all use some mutual aid right about now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut can you reverse it?\u201d His expression changes to one of agitation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s interrupted by a voice from the crowd. \u201cShe can\u2019t, Fred! None of them can. The Foundation isn\u2019t going to do anything about it. //I know they won\u2019t//.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie takes a deep breath, before continuing. \u201cRegardless of what they do, we\u2019re not going to sit around and twiddle our thumbs while you all suffer. That\u2019s not in our motto. I\u2019ll never let any of you get left behind. Never.\u201d\n\n\n\nKirby taps on her shoulder, and she relinquishes the megaphone to them. \u201cAlright folks, simmer down, simmer down. Let\u2019s get this mess cleaned up.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the crowd disperses and the two catch up on both of their perspectives and what they each saw, they discuss what to do and eventually settle on having a meeting with the rest of the Caretakers and administrative staff.\n\n\n\nThey all scramble and pile up into the meeting room, some looking worse for wear than others, and they each sit in their respective seats. A long, uncomfortable silence goes by before someone speaks up.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo. Any ideas for what we should be doing?\u201d Melissa Mayfield looks as if she\u2019s been through three all-nighters in a row.\n\n\n\nKirby glares around the room, folding their arms over their legs and shrinking down to make themselves smaller. \u201cLet\u2019s just contact the others and get this over with.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelia nods her head, then hesitates. \u201cWe should keep in touch with the other sites, but I\u2019m worried about our friends. Their safety should be our number one priority, and something this terrible is going to take a lot more than a toll on them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Melissa turns her head to the site director. \u201cWhat about you, Moses?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe director doesn\u2019t respond. Amelie sees a man with a thousand-yard stare, eyes boring into her skull, like he\u2019s seen something that isn\u2019t meant to be seen. Like he\u2019s seen death itself riding on its white horse, to reap what it sows. \n\n\n\nShe imagines him shrugging off the whole affair, or even celebrating it in her most bad faith interpretation. But none of that aligns with reality. She\u2019s never seen him like this. Never seen him this afraid.\n\n\n\nIt can\u2019t be the Moses Feghoot that she knows. Not with those eyes.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Now**\n\n\n\nAmelie Metanoia, former director of the now defunct Anomalous Entity Engagement Division, sits on her bed in her newly leased apartment, typing the latest draft for a grant proposal to help fund the newest organization that she\u2019s working with. She\u2019s done work with a lot of charities, and has volunteered at homeless shelters, food pantries, blood drives, animal shelters, and has worked to support children in need. Name a non-profit organization off the top of your head, and Amelie has most likely worked with them. She\u2019s done it all.\n\n\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s not enough. Not enough to fulfill that promise that she made to her family all those years ago.\n\n\n\nKirby Case now works as a security guard at a warehouse some miles off from where Amelie lives. They still chat from time to time, but only through her insistent invitations and their reluctance to go along with it. They\u2019ve grown distant from her, for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\nMelissa Mayfield currently serves as an occupational therapist, helping other individuals to improve their ability in completing daily tasks, such as getting dressed or using a computer. Unlike Kirby, she and Amelie have become fast friends without the constant pressure of working at the Foundation, and they discuss a plethora of topics including their respective fields.\n\n\n\nMoses Feghoot has never been seen again. At least, Amelie has never seen him since that day. Her contact with the withering few remnants of the Foundation has confirmed to her multiple times that he\u2019s still alive and well, but not much else. No traces of his personal life or where he\u2019s been. It almost seems as if he vanished.\n\n\n\nLike they all have.\n\n\n\nWell, most of them. Some of them have simply lost the magic that made them who they are, that gave the world its beauty in many configurations.\n\n\n\nHer pet fish Percy, who had the former designation of [[[SCP-2689]]], now wanders around in a fish bowl on her desk, looking none the wiser of the anomalous attribute that he once held. On some days Amelie wishes that he can make her feel something again, make her feel less like a pathetic stain on the earth, even for just a moment, but that\u2019s never going to happen again. Percy is a blood parrot cichlid. And fish can\u2019t make miracles.\n\n\n\nShe tries her hardest not to cry. She has to keep going. She can\u2019t stop. Not now. There needs to be more done for the world. For the world that has excised its own wonder and whimsy, forever condemning itself to the bleak reality that it has become. For the people who need support, to feel like they aren\u2019t alone, to feel that they\u2019re loved and cared for. For the ghosts of the past that haunt her each and every day that she can\u2019t ever let down again.\n\n\n\nHer phone buzzes in her pocket, and she picks it up and looks at the screen. It\u2019s a text from Melissa. Another request to hang out at their favorite coffee shop, it seems. Eh, why not. It\u2019ll take her mind off things at least.\n\n\n\nAmelie packs her things, shoves her shoes on without tying them as she\u2019s too tired to even bother, and makes her way to the car. The ignition starts, and the familiar sound of the car\u2019s engine hissing fills her ears. That problem will have to be solved later, like all the other little dilemmas that slowly accumulate over time to morph into a big pile of inexorable filth that won\u2019t matter, in the end. So what it\u2019s noticeable? So what she can\u2019t take care of herself anymore? That\u2019s nothing compared to what she\u2019s lost.\n\n\n\nThe grey gloom of the sky above flies past her as the car approaches the cafe. It lacks the bright blue that the kids used to draw in their lovely little sketches. It lacks the fluffy clouds, the bright and shining sun, and the whimsy and imagination that once brought joy in her life.\n\n\n\nShe parks the car, and heads inside. Melissa is already there, sitting at the booth at the far left corner in the back. Both of their drinks and their usual orders have been set on the table. A common Melissa act of kindness.\n\n\n\nAmelie sits across from her. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Amy. How\u2019s it hanging?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNothing much.\u201d Her voice sounds unconvincing, but no one\u2019s going to care anyhow.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Melissa asks in concern.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help if you need anything, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie gets the urge to sink under the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. You\u2019re not my therapist, and I don\u2019t need one. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever it is, we can work through it together and\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust shut up, okay?\u201d She snaps without thinking.\n\n\n\nThe shift in Melissa\u2019s expression makes her regret it immediately. \u201cOkay. Do you want to talk about something else?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that would be nice. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelissa nods. \u201cWell, I was thinking about bringing the gang back together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe gang?\u201d Amelie raises an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, me, you, Kirby, Mos\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKirby wants nothing to do with me anymore, and Moses probably wants to dissociate from us altogether, wherever the hell he\u2019s at.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelissa blinks once. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Kirby? I thought you guys were like two peas in a pod.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, when you convince someone in your mission and have them believe in your cause to the point that they\u2019d die for it, and then the world decides on a whim to obliterate the people you\u2019re supposed to protect, what do you think is going to happen? Certainly not being on good terms with them, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can talk to them, though, right? You can work it out together.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie waves her arms up and down in exasperation. \u201cIf they wanted to talk to me, they would\u2019ve reached out to me. I had to do it for them, because they don\u2019t want to see my face again. And that\u2019s fine, actually! I don\u2019t like me either.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe knows that look on Melissa\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, Mel? I failed all of them. We were supposed to give them hope, help them be free to feel like themselves, and now they\u2019re gone and everyone hates my guts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one hates you, Amy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know Kirby does!\u201d Amelie raises her voice.\n\n\n\nMelissa takes a big gulp of her coffee, trying to keep it together, before continuing. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. They don\u2019t talk about you like that when they\u2019re around me. Maybe you two are getting the wrong ideas about each other, but either way, it\u2019s not your fault. You weren\u2019t the one who caused this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I promised them that I\u2019d protect them. And they\u2019re //gone//, Mel. If I ever see [[[SCP-6245| any]]] [[[SCP-1508| of]]] [[[SCP-8940| them]]] again, you know how they\u2019re going to feel about me.\u201d \n\n\n\nThey sit there in silence for a moment. Amelie fights to not choke herself up, to not let the tears sting her eyes.\n\n\n\nMelissa puts her hands on top of hers, to try to ground her out of her emotions. \u201cWe did the best we could. //You// did the best you could. You helped those left to find a safe place to live. You made sure they never went more than a day without needing what they needed the most. Don\u2019t you remember any of that?\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie takes a deep breath. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t know if that compares to what we lost. What I lost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change the past, Amy. All we can do now is carry on and honor them and what they stood for.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie chuckles at how ironic that is. \u201cAs if what they stood for isn\u2019t dead. I killed it, Mel. I should\u2019ve talked to them more, I should\u2019ve been there for them, but you want to know what I did? I kept worrying about spreadsheets and expense reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe stands up to make her point, gesticulating like a passionate lecturer. \u201cMaybe this is anomalous hibernation, or something. They\u2019re all asleep, and they\u2019ll come back one day when the world isn\u2019t a graveyard where dreams go to die. Nothing about what happened makes any goddamn sense at all. Sure, every anomaly got up and went to the farm upstate at the exact same time! That makes perfect sense! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s anomalous in and of itself? Don\u2019t you think we could\u2019ve done something about that? We could\u2019ve gotten a team, and I would\u2019ve been on that team, and it wouldn\u2019t matter how much sleep I would lose cause I would\u2019ve done it for\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nMelissa grabs her by the shoulder, gesturing to her to sit down. \u201cHey. You\u2019re going to make a scene. Deep breaths, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nBreathe in, breathe out.\n\n\n\nAmelie sits down, ignoring the people that are probably staring at her by now, and looks down at her food for a while, unwilling to even gather the strength to touch it with her fork.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s always the question of when. When can she move on from something like this? When can she wake up one day and say that she\u2019s now happy and fulfilled in life? Can she ever be happy anymore? \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s done the best she can to honor their memory and look forward to the future. But is that future possible without them? Is that possible without the magic of this world that made life worth living? Can there ever be a better future for her or the people that she cared for again?\n\n\n\nMelissa watches her with a look of pity. At least, that\u2019s what it looks like to Amelie, who deserves all the judgement given to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know how hard it is for you right now. It\u2019s hard for me too, but we can\u2019t keep fretting about what we could\u2019ve done. That won\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re gone. But we can still try to make things better for the people around us. You\u2019ve done so much for so many people, Amy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmelie finally lets the floodgates through and sobs, freeing herself from all the pain that she repressed inside.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mel, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe silence that unfolds is unbearable, but it\u2019s better than burdening herself with something that she can\u2019t control.\n\n\n\nShe wipes the tears from her eyes. \u201cI think I need help. With everything, really. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you find what you need. You shouldn\u2019t have to bear through this alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve fixed things with Kirby, but now I lost what we had too. They looked up to me, you know? And then I just pushed them away,\u201d Amelie admits.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think what you did is irreconcilable. It will take time, but they\u2019ll forgive you one day. I know they will,\u201d Melissa promises to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you think that they can come back one day? So this can all be over? I //need// this to be over.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe next thing she speaks to her is the most honest thing that she can say. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Amy. I really don\u2019t. But we have each other, and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest of their lunch passes in silence, before Melissa hurries to get to her next appointment. She gives a quick apology before rushing out the door.\n\n\n\nAmelie doesn\u2019t move from her position. She contemplates everything that happened, everything that she\u2019s seen. The children, with so much joy in their hearts and so much love to give, now gone with the wind. The bond that she and the other Caretakers had that\u2019s as strong as a towering oak in a storm, now fallen apart at the seams. Moses Feghoot and his eyes that stare into her soul.\n\n\n\nThere is no scenario that she can think of where she can move on. Not like this. It\u2019s unfathomable. \n\n\n\nThe tears return, and Amelie lets them wash her sorrows away. She won\u2019t let the memories that she has of them all ever fade. Their names will be remembered and cherished for as long as she lives.\n\n\n\nAs she ponders her position in the world and how she can make her work matter, the flowers bloom, the birds are chirping, and there are children who are laughing and making people\u2019s days brighter. She may not know it, but there is still joy hiding beneath the floorboards of these ever-stagnating times.\n\n\n\nAnd the world carries on without her.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:wikimodule\">component:wikimodule</a> |ratings= --]]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub", "scp-6714", "scp-2689", "scp-6245", "scp-1508", "scp-8940", "scp-7550", "scp-8035", "scp-7163", "scp-9239", "scp-9696", "scp-8926", "scp-6461", "is-this-how-we-turn-out", "you-cant-kill-the-idea-of-me", "blackbird", "turning-out", "i-only-loved-the-idea-of-you", "infatuation-in-black", "one-side-of-an-interview-with-a-contained-anomaly", "merehrabs-musings", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "bleak", "director-metanoia", "engagement-division", "tale", "world-kept-turning"], "title": "The Sleep - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-sleep", "year": 2026}, "the-wheel": {"created_at": "2026-01-18T02:07:00", "creator": "TheChunk", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "TheChunk", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thechunk", "comment": "", "date": "2026-01-18T02:07:00"}, {"author": "TheChunk", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thechunk", "comment": "Added tags: bleak, first-person.

People come to my table by the dozens to place their bets, watch the wheel, and have a good time. But I've given out all the good times I have left: the magic is spent, but the bets keep on coming. The well has run dry, but the wheel keeps on spinning.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t run the show. I don\u2019t keep the money. I just spin the wheel.

So neither of us tries.</p>\n<p>I almost felt something the first time he cried. I can't say I felt bad, but I almost felt <em>something</em>. $500,000 is a lot to lose in one night. But if someone has $500,000 to lose, how much can they really need it? Steve could lose everything he\u2019s ever owned, and his bank account would look exactly the same as mine.

The crowd seemed more full then, the people more varied, from newlyweds on their honeymoons to retirees making one last pit stop on the way to the grave. They paid a lot to come here, and left even more on the table. The least I could give them was a kind word.</p>\n<p>But at the heart of it all, wherever they come from, however often they play, however much they bet, they're all made from the same stuff.

It's entertainment. Our guests\u2013never \u201ccustomers,\u201d always \u201cguests\u201d\u2013don\u2019t come here to make money. They come for the experience. They come for the ambiance. They come for the magic. \n\n\n\nBut our business can\u2019t be entertainment, because the entertainment is free. The drinks are free. The shows are free. Bet enough and the rooms are free. Come back enough times and we\u2019ll send a showgirl to your room with a bottle of Dom Perignon that you can drink out of her shoe. Go ahead. It\u2019s complimentary.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that isn\u2019t free are the bets. And yes, everyone bets. They bet enough to cover every cocktail, concert, executive suite and shoeful of Dom Perignon under this roof. And then after that, they leave enough on the table for this place to turn a profit.\n\n\n\nMaybe there really is an experience. Maybe people play poker because they like the strategy. Maybe people play slot machines because they get giddy for flashing lights. Maybe people play blackjack because they\u2019re better at math than making friends.\n\n\n\nBut roulette? Roulette is for people who like gambling. If there's no money on the line, there is no game. If there\u2019s no money on the line, the wheel doesn't spin. But there's always money. So the wheel never stops.\n\n\n\nI'm not here to get rich. I'm not here to build a career. I'm here to do a job. People come to my table by the dozens to place their bets, watch the wheel, and have a good time. But I've given out all the good times I have left: the magic is spent, but the bets keep on coming. The well has run dry, but the wheel keeps on spinning.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t run the show. I don\u2019t keep the money. I just spin the wheel. But if the next ball lands on black, tonight is the night I walk away.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Spin?\" hide=\"Better luck next time!\"]]\n\n**##red|Red.##**\n\n\n\nThe money keeps coming.

If they didn't want to bet, they wouldn't be in a casino. My job isn't to change their mind. My job is to spin the wheel, count the money, and pretend to believe that under their tailored suits and overpriced aftershave there\u2019s a human being who deserves to be acknowledged.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is my last bet,\u201d Steve says. That's what Steve always says. When he\u2019s up $100, that's what he says. When he\u2019s down $100,000, that's what he says. He knows I can\u2019t stop him. He knows he can\u2019t stop him either. So neither of us tries.\n\n\n\nI almost felt something the first time he cried. I can't say I felt bad, but I almost felt //something//. $500,000 is a lot to lose in one night. But if someone has $500,000 to lose, how much can they really need it? Steve could lose everything he\u2019s ever owned, and his bank account would look exactly the same as mine. But you don't see me crying, do you?\n\n\n\nThere was a time when I could do the song and dance and mean it, handing out smiles and quips and goodwill to every new face at my table as though they cost me nothing. The crowd seemed more full then, the people more varied, from newlyweds on their honeymoons to retirees making one last pit stop on the way to the grave. They paid a lot to come here, and left even more on the table. The least I could give them was a kind word.\n\n\n\nBut at the heart of it all, wherever they come from, however often they play, however much they bet, they're all made from the same stuff. When there's cash on the table, everyone is Steve. And a Steve without money is the worst kind of Steve. A Steve without money won't even tip. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is my last bet,\u201d Steve says, adding twice my monthly paycheck to the table. \n\n\n\nIf the ball lands on red, I will never see Steve again.

Some of them are almost passing for \u2018portable\u2019 now. You might have it in your head that you can lug one of those things around with you and count on that to save you from reality getting fucked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, you know what? You just might get away with that. You see that anchor over there in the corner? It\u2019s a lot smaller than they were back in my day. Small enough to put in a van. The thing works real nice, too. There could be a reality bender in here right now, and you wouldn\u2019t even know it. They\u2019d just be standing in this room with a constipated look on their face, trying to figure out why the world\u2019s stopped doing everything they want like they\u2019re a billionaire\u2019s shithead kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m not going to pretend that machine isn\u2019t useful. This site couldn\u2019t function without it. All of you are going to have your lives saved by it sometime or another, and you\u2019ll have them with you as much as you possibly can when you\u2019re out in the field.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one issue. See, unless the green you\u2019re after has had every last bit of intellect spoiled out of them by the cosmos being their personal sugar daddy, and most of \u2018em aren\u2019t quite that far gone, they might have the presence of mind to do something like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was Kondraki\u2019s queue. Suddenly, the esteemed doctor and Site Director, who\u2019d been standing next to the machine, grabbed a sledgehammer that\u2019d been stashed behind, raised it up in the air, and slammed it down on the machine. The first swing on its own was enough to dent the metallic plating around the machine, but Kondraki didn\u2019t stop there. He wailed and wailed on it, breaking every plate and getting at some of the electronics underneath it.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a real reality anchor. O5-whichever had pulled Clef and Konni aside and made them switch to using a prop after the first time they\u2019d done this demonstration. Getting the thing to look convincing wasn\u2019t cheap, but it was cheaper than smashing a working SRA.</p>\n<p>None of the agents moved to stop Kondraki from destroying the machine. They just stared, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Clef said. \u201cSomeone seems to have smashed the absolute shit out of your reality anchor, something anyone, including the reality bender you\u2019re hunting, can do with a goddamned hammer in less than a minute. But weren\u2019t you just telling me how your <em>entire plan</em> for taking down your next reality bender was to rely on that thing? Well, guess what? You\u2019re fucked now. That green who was looking all constipated just a second ago? He\u2019s now the master of time, space, and matter in your general vicinity. He probably knows you\u2019re trying to capture him, he\u2019s mad, and now he\u2019s going to do whatever he wants to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Partway through Clef\u2019s speech, Kondraki tossed the hammer on the ground and walked up to the front of the room, taking his place next to Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t count on big fancy machines to do your job for you. When you\u2019re sent after a reality bender, you are to incapacitate it before it has the slightest clue what\u2019s going on, because if it\u2019s awake and aware of you when your anchor fails, well, I\u2019d tell you to use your imagination, but it won\u2019t be <em>your</em> imagination that matters, now will it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Just as Clef finished speaking, there was a loud noise elsewhere in the room. A high-pitched dinging.</p>\n<p>Clef looked around. Unlike the last bit of melodrama, this wasn\u2019t part of the lecture. Clef looked around the room. A few dings in, Clef realized this was supposed to be music. A few dings later, a feminine voice began to sing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkMkVFwAoo\">IIIIIIIIII DON\u2019T WANT A LOT FOR CHRISTMAS</a>\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cTHEEEERE IS JUST ONE THING I NEED\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>The singing was painfully loud. Quite a few of the trainees covered their ears. Everyone in the room, including Clef and Kondraki, frantically looked around the room. After a moment, Clef realized it was coming from above him.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cI DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THE PRESENTS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cUUUUNDERNEATH THE CHRISTMAS TREE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>It took him another moment to spot it. It was small, and the ceiling in the lecture hall was some thirty feet above them. Still, there it was, hanging from the ceiling. A mistletoe, vibrant red and green, directly above Clef and Kondraki.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cIIIIIIIIIIII JUST WANT YOU FOR MY OWN\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cMOOORE THAN YOU COULD EVER KNOOOOOW\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Could someone have put it there? Not easily.

Only then did it occur to Clef that whoever\u2019d just laughed probably thought Clef himself had orchestrated this. That thought calmed him down enough that he was able to use his words like a big boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d he asked, trying to stay calm, even though he still had to shout to be heard over the music. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t me. Who the hell thinks they\u2019re funny?\u201d</p>\n<p>If it was someone in the crowd, they weren\u2019t eager to admit it. These recruits weren\u2019t his prime suspects anyway. Out of everyone in the room, hell, the whole site, there was exactly one person who\u2019d be most inclined to pull this stunt.</p>\n<p>Clef glared at Kondraki, who stood next to him. His eyes were up on the ceiling, on the thing which was still blaring its music.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cI DON\u2019T WANT A LOT FOR CHRISTMAS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cTHERE IS JUST ONE THING I NEED\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cAND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cDON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THE PRESENTS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cUNDERNEATH THE CHRISTMAS TREE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Kondraki looked back at him. He shook his head. There wasn\u2019t the slightest hint of amusement on his face. He genuinely didn\u2019t know what was going on, which meant he wasn\u2019t behind it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cI DON\u2019T NEED TO HANG MY STOCKING\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cTHERE UPON THE FIREPLACE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cSANTA CLAUS WON\u2019T MAKE ME HAPPY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cWITH A TOY ON CHRISTMAS DAY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Clef and Kondraki exchanged a look. This was a mistletoe. It had appeared above a committed couple, in December. Did this thing want them to kiss?</p>\n<p>To even ask that question was to make far too many assumptions about a novel anomaly. Who\u2019s to say it even had a mind that could want something?</p>\n<p>Besides, if this thing was trying to badger them into kissing underneath it, that was the last thing they were going to do.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cI JUST WANT YOU FOR MY OWN\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cMORE THAN YOU COULD EVER KNOW\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cMAKE MY WISH COME TRUUUE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOUUUUUUUU\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>They were a couple. They had been for years, now. They\u2019d kissed countless times, and they\u2019d have done it in front of this crowd with no shame. They might have even done it if this thing had asked nicely, though that probably would\u2019ve been a mistake. Giving an unknown anomaly what it wants is usually a bad idea.</p>\n<p>This thing hadn\u2019t asked nicely, though. It\u2019d decided to harass them with unbearably loud pop music, and that meant there was no chance they\u2019d give it what it wanted. Neither of them had to say anything to know the other felt the same way.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUUU, BABY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>\u201cClass dismissed!\u201d Clef shouted, during a lull in the music before the second verse started. Everyone, most definitely including Clef and Kondraki, filed out of the room.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 2</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d Kondraki asked Clef as soon as they were out of the room. They could still hear the blasted music echoing down the hall as they returned to Ben\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know either, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef looked at Kondraki for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pick a song that annoying.

He\u2019s upstanding like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Clef admitted. \u201cWho else doesn\u2019t like us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone we locked away?\u201d Konni asked. \u201cI mean, that room wasn\u2019t actually anchored. Could be a reality bender was in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would require me to have allowed site security to go completely and utterly to shit,\u201d Clef said. \u201cPlus, if a bender did infiltrate Site-17, they\u2019d probably do something more impactful than a prank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose. Who does that leave, then? Another researcher?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Clef said. \u201cWhich one, though? Gears is too serious. Light is too busy.

It was above them once again, in the middle of the hall they were walking down. Fortunately, the ceiling here was a lot lower than in the lecture hall. While that made the thing louder, it also allowed Clef to, after two tries, jump up and grab the damn thing off the ceiling and break it in half.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should try to contain\u2014\u201d Kondraki began, but by the time Clef had registered him and realized he was right, the thing was in two pieces, and the music had stopped.</p>\n<p>They exchanged another look. \u201cSorry,\u201d Clef said.</p>\n<p>Kondraki took a deep breath. \u201cAt least that made it shut up,\u201d he said.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 3</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>Containment breach sirens blared throughout the site.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d come so close to making it through the rest of the day without another breach, but then one of the reality benders in B-Wing just had to make a break for it. He was running down the hall now. He wouldn\u2019t be that dangerous so long as he was stuck in the parts of the site covered by the anchors, but if he made it to an unprotected area, things were going to get <em>really</em> bad.</p>\n<p>Clef stood in the surveillance room, along with a dozen other high-ranking members of site staff. The door swung open, and Kondraki ran into the room. There was a subtle sloppiness to his movements. It wasn\u2019t enough that the others in the room would spot it, but Clef could tell Konni had been making some poor decisions in his office, hoping he wouldn\u2019t be needed for anything important this late in the day.</p>\n<p>From the look on his face, the humanoid who\u2019d dashed that hope was going to regret it later.</p>\n<p>\u201cStatus?\u201d Kondraki asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecurity\u2019s inbound,\u201d Clef said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to pinch it from both sides of hallway seventy-one\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cAND IIIIII\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cI\u2019M JUST GONNA KEEP ON WAITING\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cUNDERNEATH THE MISTLETOE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Several researchers covered their ears. Most of them were still scanning the room for the source of the sound when Clef ripped the thing off the ceiling. This time, he remembered that he was supposed to try to put it in a box, but a second later, he remembered that he wasn\u2019t in the mood for this shit and broke the damn thing in half again.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 4</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>Close to an hour later, the breach was resolved. The anomaly never made it out of the range of the anchors, thank fuck.</p>\n<p>It was getting close to the end of the day, and Clef and Kondraki were now on their way back to their quarters. As they walked, Clef pulled the mistletoe\u2014still snapped in two pieces\u2014out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same one as before,\u201d Clef observed. \u201cThe old one vanished from my pocket around the time it appeared.

Clef sprang to his feet and grabbed the damn thing off the ceiling. He snapped it into two pieces and threw them in opposite directions as forcefully as possible.</p>\n<p>Kondraki looked up at him. Clef sat down.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess we know, now.\u201d Kondraki said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Clef said.</p>\n<p>\u201cInteresting way of pronouncing \u2018you were right, Ben.

I should stop disagreeing with you.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>In his right mind, Clef could\u2019ve come up with an equally witty retort to that, but right now he was too tired. After a moment, Kondraki read the room, and changed the subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we need to destroy it more thoroughly,\u201d Kondraki suggested. \u201cFurnace? Acid? Woodchipper, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef didn\u2019t reply, but he did get up from the bed and turn the light on. He gathered both pieces of the stick and set them in the ash tray on his bedside table. Next, he pulled some vodka out of the table next to his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d Kondraki said, \u201cI could use\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef pulled the cork off the bottle and poured some of the liquid on the mistletoe, then he pulled a lighter out of a drawer and set the thing ablaze. Kondraki started to speak again, almost certainly to ask if he could still have some. Clef handed the bottle to Kondraki, who took a large swig.</p>\n<p>The mistletoe only took a few minutes to burn. It left behind a vaguely stick-shaped clump of ash, which Clef promptly stomped on, scattering the ashes around the floor. He climbed back into bed. \u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s enough to end it for good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Kondraki agreed, the next time he finished swallowing his drink.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 6</em></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201c\u2018CAUSE I JUST WANT YOU HERE TONIGHT\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cHOLDING ON TO ME SO TIGHT\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s eyes popped open again. \u201cGod fucking damn it!\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 12</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>Clef and Kondraki fought to drag their half-awake asses into the break room. Every step was a trial. They wanted, with everything they had, to lie back down, but they also knew there was no point. Just because it was daytime now didn\u2019t mean that thing would suddenly start letting them sleep.</p>\n<p>How much sleep had Clef gotten last night? He wasn\u2019t sure. Maybe two hours, total? The branch had manifested over them every hour or so, seven times total throughout the course of the night.</p>\n<p>Still, if the couple could pull themselves to the break room, they\u2019d find something better than sleep: <em>coffee</em>, that sweet nectar of wakefulness that would make this unbearable fatigue tolerable.</p>\n<p>As Clef rounded the corner and entered the break room, his eyes snapped straight to the coffee pot. Gears was there, holding it. A surge of anxiety hit Clef, but it was followed quickly by relief. The pot was nearly full. There would be plenty left for both of them after Gears filled his mug.</p>\n<p>Gears replaced the pot in the machine as he turned around. He smiled politely once he noticed Clef. \u201cGood morning, Alto.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Clef said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you two get enough sleep?\u201d Gears asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef had to take a moment to steady himself. \u201cWe\u2026 didn\u2019t have a great night\u2019s sleep last night, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Gears said. \u201cIs it anything I could assist you with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Kondraki said.</p>\n<p>Clef spent a minute deciding whether to elaborate. There was a chance Gears already knew about it. Its first few appearances had been in public, after all. However, that didn\u2019t mean it was easy or comfortable for Clef to acknowledge that he\u2019d tried and failed to deal with the anomaly.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Gears said before walking out of the room with his cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>As soon as Gears was clear of the pot, Kondraki dashed over to it. He grabbed the largest mug in the cabinet\u2014which didn\u2019t belong to him or Clef\u2014and filled it. Clef took the next largest, a yellow, almost spherical mug with a large smiley face on one side. Both of them started chugging the mouth-scalding liquid like it was a cold one at happy hour.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cWHAT MORE CAN I DO?\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cOH BABY ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>The sudden noise made Clef jump, falling backward and spilling the scalding hot liquid all over his shirt. The mug landed on top of him, without another drop of coffee in it.</p>\n<p>Clef glanced up at the pot. That was the last of it. He\u2019d have to wait for the pot to brew more.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least the mug didn\u2019t bre\u2014\u201d Kondraki began.</p>\n<p>Clef grabbed the mug and hurled it across the room. It shattered against the far wall.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 42</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>Clef sat at a round table in one of the site\u2019s meeting rooms, trying to remember which group of anomalous religious weirdos he was sitting across from. Were these sarkites? Clef hoped not, because he was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t supposed to call them \u2018sarkites\u2019 anymore, and he had completely forgotten what he was supposed to call them instead.</p>\n<p>Kondraki was next to him, not doing much better. Thank fuck Light was there to do the talking.</p>\n<p>If Clef was operating on a normal night\u2019s sleep, he\u2019d at least be able to force himself to pay attention to whatever the hell they were saying, but as things were, well, the best he\u2019d gathered was that the religious types were begging the Foundation to renew some kind of non-aggression pact.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand your concerns,\u201d said the old woman representing whichever GoI it was. \u201cOur organization has worked around the Veil for over a century. We\u2019ve never <em>not</em> worked around it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Light said. \u201cThe degree to which you are able to police yourselves is certainly impressive. We particularly appreciate how adept you are at suppressing violent offshoots of your faith. However, we no longer feel that the current terms of our agreement adequately account for the fact that there\u2019s significant overlap between your church\u2019s membership and that of several more hostile organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Was it the broken god people? No, those guys usually had some kind of weird metal sticking out of them. The hytoth weirdos? Clef tried to get a glimpse at the lady\u2019s hands. Were those scars? They looked like stars.</p>\n<p>Part of Clef almost felt bad for them. It was a bit cruel to bring this woman here just so they could check a box saying they\u2019d tried to negotiate. If the Foundation had any intention of leaving these people alone, it would have renewed whatever pact it had before without having a new meeting about it.</p>\n<p>Then again, Light was here. If anyone could weave some magic church\u2019s pathetic pleas for mercy into a working non-aggression pact, it was\u2014</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cOH OH\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cALL THE LIGHTS ARE SHINING SO BRIGHTLY EVERYWHERE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>In a single fluid motion, Clef tore his sidearm from its holster and fired three shots directly into the stick of mistletoe above them. Their guest jumped back and screamed at the top of her lungs. A second later, the thing fell onto the table in front of them in two pieces.</p>\n<p>Clef holstered his gun as smoothly as he\u2019d drawn it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Clef said. \u201cJust taking care of this.\u201d He gestured at the mangled remains of the object.

It started appearing at the beginning of December. It plays a romantic Christmas song.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of that is actual evidence that us kissing will make it go away,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cEven if it were, it might just come back after an hour, just like when we break it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it not worth a try?\u201d Light asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Clef said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always a good idea to give an anomaly what it wants.

This wasn\u2019t his work, and given how freely they communicate with each other, it\u2019s probably no one else in Gamers Against Weed either.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 96</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost Christmas,\u201d Clef groaned. \u201cHow are we still at a loss about where this thing came from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll go away on its own once Christmas is over.\u201d Kondraki said. The idea lingered in the air between them for a moment.</p>\n<p>But there was no way in hell they\u2019d be that lucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to find a new approach,\u201d Kondraki said. Clef didn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201cClef?\u201d Kondraki said.</p>\n<p>Clef forced his eyes open and his head up. He\u2019d been nodding off at the table. He took another sip of coffee. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve been out of commission for too long already. We need to make this stop, and fast.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cOH, I DON\u2019T WANT A LOT FOR CHRISTMAS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cTHIS IS ALL I\u2019M ASKING FOR\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Through the fog of sleeplessness, it took a few seconds before Clef had the energy to stand and grab it from the ceiling.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cI JUST WANNA SEE MY BABY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cSTANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DOOR\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Clef snapped it in half and dropped it on the table between them. They knew it was only momentary relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a second look at what it\u2019s been doing,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cMaybe we can find some kind of weakness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe. Is there any other pattern to where it shows up, other than that it\u2019s on top of us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust spitballing. We need to find somewhere to start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Kondraki thinks for a moment. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get a map of the facility. Let\u2019s try to remember everywhere it\u2019s shown up.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 97</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>The two looked down at their map of the facility. The two had marked every location where they remembered the thing appearing. They\u2019d probably missed a few, but that wasn\u2019t a big deal. Even a modest sample could give meaningful data.</p>\n<p>\u201cNotice anything?\u201d Clef asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cIt shows up in staff areas, but of course it does. That\u2019s where we spend all our time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Clef studied the item for a bit longer. \u201cHas it ever shown up in a containment area, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>Both of them study the map. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Kondraki said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m noticing that it\u2019s never appeared in range of the reality anchors. Not once.\u201d</p>\n<p>That got Kondraki studying the map again. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be a coincidence, though, just a function of the fact that we spend less time there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis thing has appeared dozens of times,\u201d Clef said, \u201cand it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re never in those areas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you basically a living reality anchor anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as strong as our machines, especially when something\u2019s not trying to directly affect me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. So, maybe this thing can\u2019t show up in the range of an anchor. How are we going to use that? We can\u2019t get the whole site anchored. Too expensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if anchors fuck with its teleporting one way, maybe they could the other way, too? Maybe we can use that to trap it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI\u2019ll take it into light-containment. There\u2019s an anchor covering that.\u201d Kondraki reached into his coat pocket, searching for the stick. Over the following seconds, frustration gradually grew on his face. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone. I think it heard us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll show back up eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo doubt about that. Still, I get the feeling it\u2019ll keep running away if we try to bring it in range of an anchor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we have to be a little more clever, then? Maybe we can set a trap for it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Kondraki thought for a moment. \u201cActually,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is one thing we\u2019ve done that seemed to make it appear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, remember? The time we tried to kiss while it wasn\u2019t watching?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight\u2026 and it showed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. Now, the last time this thing showed up was only half an hour ago. It\u2019s not due to come back for another ten minutes, at least. If we try to kiss right now, and it shows up\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we probably have a way to make it show up where we want it to,\u201d Clef said, \u201cmeaning we can turn off a reality anchor, kiss in its range, and turn the anchor back on when the thing shows up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be certain it\u2019ll be trapped, but it\u2019s definitely worth a try.\u201d</p>\n<p>They glanced at each other for a moment. \u201cWell then,\u201d Clef said, \u201cyour breath presentable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask stupid questions,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like yours is any better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is, too,\u201d Clef said. \u201cIt\u2019s not <em>good</em>, but it is better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki sighed. \u201cWhatever. Let\u2019s just do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment, Clef nodded. The two of them leaned over the table, bringing their lips closer together. Just a moment before their lips met\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cOOOOOH I JUST WANT YOU FOR MY OWN\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cMORE THAN YOU COULD EVER KNOW\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cMAKE MY WISH COME TRUE\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cOH BABY, ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOUUUUUUUUU\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>They sat back in their chairs, their lips having never quite touched. Those same lips were now curled into a pair of devious smiles.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 99</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Light said. \u201cThat is not an acceptable security risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest,\u201d Kondraki said, \u201cthat\u2019s a pretty bold thing to say <em>to</em> the Site Director.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not my job to tell you when you have a stupid idea. We can\u2019t just turn off one of the reality anchors. There\u2019s a reason those machines all have a dozen fail safes and backup generators. They\u2019re there because the things in their influence must never be allowed to bend reality, even for a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously we\u2019ll move all the dangerous anomalies to another area of the site before disabling\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all of them can be moved easily. Not all of them can be moved at all. Which wing do you propose we empty of all anomalous items?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNortheast,\u201d Kondraki said.</p>\n<p>That took Light by surprise. She clearly hadn\u2019t expected a real answer to her question.</p>\n<p>Kondraki pulled out the map they\u2019d used earlier and set it on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing but humanoids in that wing. All we have to do is move them to another area of the site for a few minutes. I don\u2019t see any unacceptable risks in that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Light looked at the map for a moment. A complicated combination of irritation and relief spread across her face. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve thought this through. I\u2019ll give you that, but it\u2019s still a risk, undertaken for the sake a problem that might have other, simpler solutions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Clef asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve ruled out your proposals,\u201d Kondraki said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re too stubborn to try something does not make it \u2018ruled out.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe unacceptability of a cost is always subjective,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI, for one, think moving a few dozen humanoids to another area of the site for an hour is a smaller risk than doing what this thing wants. For all we know, kissing underneath it is just what it needs to be able to create some kind of horrible disaster, or fuse our lips together, or turn us to stone. Much better to shuffle a bunch of well-understood humanoids around the site than take a big risk with one we don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Light took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll grant you the possibility that kissing under this thing will activate some kind of trap, but moving a lot of prisoners at once can also go wrong in a lot of ways. It\u2019s not a risk-free solu\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cISSSSSSSSS YOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABYYYYYYYYY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Light said. She reached up to try to pull the thing off the ceiling but was just a hair too short to reach it. Clef and Kondraki both could have, but, for once, they didn\u2019t. They just stood there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Clef asked, having to raise his voice to be audible over the music. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think it just might be worth the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABYYYYYYYYY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>\u201cFine!\u201d Light said with a long, seething breath.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 100</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>The couple stood in a containment chamber. At any other time, this cell belonged to some two-bit reality bender and was covered by a reality anchor. Right now, though, the usual occupant of this cell was off enjoying extra socialization time in another wing of the site, and the two doctors were sitting on its bed, waiting for Gears to give them the signal.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cThis is going to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell said I was worried? Why would I be worried?\u201d</p>\n<p>Konni shrugged his shoulders.</p>\n<p>Clef sighed. \u201cI admit, I\u2019m looking forward to a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Gears said from the site\u2019s control room.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for a signal. Do it as soon as the thing shows up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember the plan, Benjamin.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two looked at each other. No time like the present. Slowly, so as to give the damn thing plenty of time to show up, they moved their lips together. Just before they met\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABYYYYYYYYY\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong><em>\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BA\u2014\u201d \u266b</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>Gears turned the anchor back on. Instantly, mercifully, the music stopped, and the item fell to the ground without them needing to touch it.</p>\n<p>The doctors looked at each other. They were both beaming, savoring the peaceful silence. They wrapped their arms around each other, and, for the first time in a month, kissed. Kondraki\u2019s mouth tasted just as bad as Clef remembered, and he didn\u2019t give a single fuck. Right now, it was his favorite taste in the world.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Incident 101</em></span></p>\n<p>Clef and Kondraki sat next to each other the following Christmas Morning.</p>\n<p>Okay, \u201cmorning\u201d might have been a bit of a stretch. It was 6:37 PM. However, they\u2019d only been up for half an hour or so, and that made it Christmas morning.</p>\n<p>Normally, someone would get on their case for oversleeping that badly, but everyone in the site knew they hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in months, so it seemed none of them felt the need to chastise them for their laziness.</p>\n<p>They sat in front of the small Christmas tree in their quarters. There were a handful of gifts under it, from various friends and family. Next, it was time for Kondraki\u2019s kid.</p>\n<p>Draven\u2019s gift was in a large box, with a large, thick Christmas card on top of it. Kondraki pulled the card off of it. He ripped open the envelope and pulled the card out.</p>\n<p>It was made of something plasticy rather than simple paper, and about twice as thick as a greeting card would normally be. There was no text on the outside, just a bright green, heart-shaped wreath on a red background. Honestly, it was a strange choice. Its vibe was more romantic than familial.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Clef wondered why Draven had picked it. After a moment of thought, the answer dawned on him, just as Kondraki was about to open the card.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t open that!\u201d Clef shouted, but it was too late. Kondraki held the now-open card in his hand. From a cheap, tiny speaker inside it, music rang out.</p>\n<p><em>\u266b \u201cAnd IIIIIII\u201d \u266b</em><br/>\n<em>\u266b \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep on waiting\u201d \u266b</em><br/>\n<em>\u266b \u201cUnderneath the mistletoe\u201d \u266b</em></p>\n<p>Clef grabbed the card out of Kondraki\u2019s hand and threw it across the room. Its music was much quieter than the anomalous mistletoe\u2019s had been, but Clef didn\u2019t care. \u201cThat little shit!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kondraki was laughing his ass of.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter what we\u2019ve been through for the past few days\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, right? I\u2019m so proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef looked over at Kondraki.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d Konni said, \u201cif all of this had happened to Gears, we\u2019d have sent the exact same card.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now that he heard the words spoken aloud, it was impossible for Clef to deny them. There was another ten seconds of laughter before Kondraki calmed down with a final, long exhale. Clef also took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get him back, though, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI already have something in mind.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><sub><a href=\"/xhawk77x\">More by this Author</a></sub></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:preview\">component:preview</a>\n\ntext=Doctors Clef and Kondraki, a devoted couple, are harassed by an anomaly that seems dead set on driving them apart.

Some of them are almost passing for \u2018portable\u2019 now. You might have it in your head that you can lug one of those things around with you and count on that to save you from reality getting fucked.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd, you know what? You just might get away with that. You see that anchor over there in the corner? It\u2019s a lot smaller than they were back in my day. Small enough to put in a van. The thing works real nice, too. There could be a reality bender in here right now, and you wouldn\u2019t even know it. They\u2019d just be standing in this room with a constipated look on their face, trying to figure out why the world\u2019s stopped doing everything they want like they\u2019re a billionaire\u2019s shithead kid.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not going to pretend that machine isn\u2019t useful. This site couldn\u2019t function without it. All of you are going to have your lives saved by it sometime or another, and you\u2019ll have them with you as much as you possibly can when you\u2019re out in the field.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one issue. See, unless the green you\u2019re after has had every last bit of intellect spoiled out of them by the cosmos being their personal sugar daddy, and most of \u2018em aren\u2019t quite that far gone, they might have the presence of mind to do something like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat was Kondraki\u2019s queue. Suddenly, the esteemed doctor and Site Director, who\u2019d been standing next to the machine, grabbed a sledgehammer that\u2019d been stashed behind, raised it up in the air, and slammed it down on the machine. The first swing on its own was enough to dent the metallic plating around the machine, but Kondraki didn\u2019t stop there. He wailed and wailed on it, breaking every plate and getting at some of the electronics underneath it.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a real reality anchor. O5-whichever had pulled Clef and Konni aside and made them switch to using a prop after the first time they\u2019d done this demonstration. Getting the thing to look convincing wasn\u2019t cheap, but it was cheaper than smashing a working SRA.\n\n\n\nNone of the agents moved to stop Kondraki from destroying the machine. They just stared, stunned.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Clef said. \u201cSomeone seems to have smashed the absolute shit out of your reality anchor, something anyone, including the reality bender you\u2019re hunting, can do with a goddamned hammer in less than a minute. But weren\u2019t you just telling me how your //entire plan// for taking down your next reality bender was to rely on that thing? Well, guess what? You\u2019re fucked now. That green who was looking all constipated just a second ago? He\u2019s now the master of time, space, and matter in your general vicinity. He probably knows you\u2019re trying to capture him, he\u2019s mad, and now he\u2019s going to do whatever he wants to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nPartway through Clef\u2019s speech, Kondraki tossed the hammer on the ground and walked up to the front of the room, taking his place next to Clef.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t count on big fancy machines to do your job for you. When you\u2019re sent after a reality bender, you are to incapacitate it before it has the slightest clue what\u2019s going on, because if it\u2019s awake and aware of you when your anchor fails, well, I\u2019d tell you to use your imagination, but it won\u2019t be //your// imagination that matters, now will it?\u201d\n\n\n\nJust as Clef finished speaking, there was a loud noise elsewhere in the room. A high-pitched dinging.\n\n\n\nClef looked around. Unlike the last bit of melodrama, this wasn\u2019t part of the lecture. Clef looked around the room. A few dings in, Clef realized this was supposed to be music. A few dings later, a feminine voice began to sing.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201c[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkMkVFwAoo IIIIIIIIII DON\u2019T WANT A LOT FOR CHRISTMAS]\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cTHEEEERE IS JUST ONE THING I NEED\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nThe singing was painfully loud. Quite a few of the trainees covered their ears. Everyone in the room, including Clef and Kondraki, frantically looked around the room. After a moment, Clef realized it was coming from above him.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THE PRESENTS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cUUUUNDERNEATH THE CHRISTMAS TREE\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nIt took him another moment to spot it. It was small, and the ceiling in the lecture hall was some thirty feet above them. Still, there it was, hanging from the ceiling.

Only then did it occur to Clef that whoever\u2019d just laughed probably thought Clef himself had orchestrated this. That thought calmed him down enough that he was able to use his words like a big boy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho did this?\u201d he asked, trying to stay calm, even though he still had to shout to be heard over the music. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t me. Who the hell thinks they\u2019re funny?\u201d\n\n\n\nIf it was someone in the crowd, they weren\u2019t eager to admit it. These recruits weren\u2019t his prime suspects anyway. Out of everyone in the room, hell, the whole site, there was exactly one person who\u2019d be most inclined to pull this stunt.\n\n\n\nClef glared at Kondraki, who stood next to him. His eyes were up on the ceiling, on the thing which was still blaring its music.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI DON\u2019T WANT A LOT FOR CHRISTMAS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cTHERE IS JUST ONE THING I NEED\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cAND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cDON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THE PRESENTS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cUNDERNEATH THE CHRISTMAS TREE\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nKondraki looked back at him. He shook his head. There wasn\u2019t the slightest hint of amusement on his face. He genuinely didn\u2019t know what was going on, which meant he wasn\u2019t behind it.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI DON\u2019T NEED TO HANG MY STOCKING\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cTHERE UPON THE FIREPLACE\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cSANTA CLAUS WON\u2019T MAKE ME HAPPY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cWITH A TOY ON CHRISTMAS DAY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nClef and Kondraki exchanged a look. This was a mistletoe. It had appeared above a committed couple, in December. Did this thing want them to kiss?\n\n\n\nTo even ask that question was to make far too many assumptions about a novel anomaly. Who\u2019s to say it even had a mind that could want something?\n\n\n\nBesides, if this thing was trying to badger them into kissing underneath it, that was the last thing they were going to do.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI JUST WANT YOU FOR MY OWN\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cMORE THAN YOU COULD EVER KNOW\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cMAKE MY WISH COME TRUUUE\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOUUUUUUUU\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nThey were a couple. They had been for years, now. They\u2019d kissed countless times, and they\u2019d have done it in front of this crowd with no shame. They might have even done it if this thing had asked nicely, though that probably would\u2019ve been a mistake. Giving an unknown anomaly what it wants is usually a bad idea.\n\n\n\nThis thing hadn\u2019t asked nicely, though. It\u2019d decided to harass them with unbearably loud pop music, and that meant there was no chance they\u2019d give it what it wanted. Neither of them had to say anything to know the other felt the same way.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUUU, BABY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n\u201cClass dismissed!\u201d Clef shouted, during a lull in the music before the second verse started.

He\u2019s upstanding like that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Clef admitted. \u201cWho else doesn\u2019t like us?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSomeone we locked away?\u201d Konni asked. \u201cI mean, that room wasn\u2019t actually anchored. Could be a reality bender was in there?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat would require me to have allowed site security to go completely and utterly to shit,\u201d Clef said. \u201cPlus, if a bender did infiltrate Site-17, they\u2019d probably do something more impactful than a prank.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI suppose. Who does that leave, then? Another researcher?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Clef said. \u201cWhich one, though? Gears is too serious. Light is too busy. I don\u2019t see any of the others brave enough to try\u2014\"\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cOH, I WON\u2019T ASK FOR MUCH THIS CHRISTMAS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI WON\u2019T EVEN WISH FOR SNOW\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nBoth their gazes snapped upward. It was above them once again, in the middle of the hall they were walking down. Fortunately, the ceiling here was a lot lower than in the lecture hall. While that made the thing louder, it also allowed Clef to, after two tries, jump up and grab the damn thing off the ceiling and break it in half.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe should try to contain\u2014\u201d Kondraki began, but by the time Clef had registered him and realized he was right, the thing was in two pieces, and the music had stopped.\n\n\n\nThey exchanged another look. \u201cSorry,\u201d Clef said.\n\n\n\nKondraki took a deep breath. \u201cAt least that made it shut up,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**__//Incident 3//__**\n\n\n\nContainment breach sirens blared throughout the site.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019d come so close to making it through the rest of the day without another breach, but then one of the reality benders in B-Wing just had to make a break for it. He was running down the hall now. He wouldn\u2019t be that dangerous so long as he was stuck in the parts of the site covered by the anchors, but if he made it to an unprotected area, things were going to get //really// bad.\n\n\n\nClef stood in the surveillance room, along with a dozen other high-ranking members of site staff. The door swung open, and Kondraki ran into the room. There was a subtle sloppiness to his movements. It wasn\u2019t enough that the others in the room would spot it, but Clef could tell Konni had been making some poor decisions in his office, hoping he wouldn\u2019t be needed for anything important this late in the day.\n\n\n\nFrom the look on his face, the humanoid who\u2019d dashed that hope was going to regret it later.\n\n\n\n\u201cStatus?\u201d Kondraki asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecurity\u2019s inbound,\u201d Clef said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to pinch it from both sides of hallway seventy-one\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cAND IIIIII\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI\u2019M JUST GONNA KEEP ON WAITING\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cUNDERNEATH THE MISTLETOE\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nSeveral researchers covered their ears. Most of them were still scanning the room for the source of the sound when Clef ripped the thing off the ceiling. This time, he remembered that he was supposed to try to put it in a box, but a second later, he remembered that he wasn\u2019t in the mood for this shit and broke the damn thing in half again.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**__//Incident 4//__**\n\n\n\nClose to an hour later, the breach was resolved. The anomaly never made it out of the range of the anchors, thank fuck.\n\n\n\nIt was getting close to the end of the day, and Clef and Kondraki were now on their way back to their quarters. As they walked, Clef pulled the mistletoe\u2014still snapped in two pieces\u2014out of his pocket.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same one as before,\u201d Clef observed. \u201cThe old one vanished from my pocket around the time it appeared. Also, look here.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef pointed to a single spot on the stick, a small ring of plant tissue that looked almost like a scar.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you broke it?\u201d Kondraki asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Clef said. \u201cThis thing is repairing itself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cSo, it repairs itself in then appears above us. That\u2019s good to know, but it doesn\u2019t tell us how to stop it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Clef said. \u201cI think one place to start would be\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI WON\u2019T MAKE A LIST AND SEND IT\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cTO THE NORTH POLE FOR SAINT NICK\u2014\u201d\u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nThe object had vanished from Clef\u2019s hand, but he had it back in his grasp just a few seconds later. He made a point to break it in a different spot than the last two times, so he could check if there were two different scars.\n\n\n\nThere were.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to get fucking annoying,\u201d Kondraki said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least that\u2019s all it is,\u201d Clef said. \u201cSo far, it\u2019s not in the top one-thousand worst anomalies I\u2019ve dealt with.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll get worse,\u201d Kondraki said, \u201cespecially if it stops us from sleeping.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give it ideas!\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__//Incident 5//__\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cI WON\u2019T EVEN STAY AWAKE TO HEAR THOSE MAGIC RAINDEER CLICK\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s eyes tore open.\n\n\n\nKondraki was on the bed next to him, having also just been awoken by that fucking stick. Clef sprang to his feet and grabbed the damn thing off the ceiling. He snapped it into two pieces and threw them in opposite directions as forcefully as possible.\n\n\n\nKondraki looked up at him. Clef sat down.\n\n\n\n\u201cI guess we know, now.\u201d Kondraki said.\n\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Clef said.\n\n\n\n\u201cInteresting way of pronouncing \u2018you were right, Ben. You\u2019re always right, all the time. I should stop disagreeing with you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his right mind, Clef could\u2019ve come up with an equally witty retort to that, but right now he was too tired. After a moment, Kondraki read the room, and changed the subject.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we need to destroy it more thoroughly,\u201d Kondraki suggested. \u201cFurnace? Acid? Woodchipper, maybe?\u201d\n\n\n\nClef didn\u2019t reply, but he did get up from the bed and turn the light on. He gathered both pieces of the stick and set them in the ash tray on his bedside table. Next, he pulled some vodka out of the table next to his bed.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d Kondraki said, \u201cI could use\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nClef pulled the cork off the bottle and poured some of the liquid on the mistletoe, then he pulled a lighter out of a drawer and set the thing ablaze. Kondraki started to speak again, almost certainly to ask if he could still have some. Clef handed the bottle to Kondraki, who took a large swig.\n\n\n\nThe mistletoe only took a few minutes to burn. It left behind a vaguely stick-shaped clump of ash, which Clef promptly stomped on, scattering the ashes around the floor. He climbed back into bed. \u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s enough to end it for good.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d Kondraki agreed, the next time he finished swallowing his drink.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**__//Incident 6//__**\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201c\u2018CAUSE I JUST WANT YOU HERE TONIGHT\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cHOLDING ON TO ME SO TIGHT\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s eyes popped open again. \u201cGod fucking damn it!\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**__//Incident 12//__**\n\n\n\nClef and Kondraki fought to drag their half-awake asses into the break room. Every step was a trial. They wanted, with everything they had, to lie back down, but they also knew there was no point. Just because it was daytime now didn\u2019t mean that thing would suddenly start letting them sleep.\n\n\n\nHow much sleep had Clef gotten last night? He wasn\u2019t sure. Maybe two hours, total? The branch had manifested over them every hour or so, seven times total throughout the course of the night.\n\n\n\nStill, if the couple could pull themselves to the break room, they\u2019d find something better than sleep: //coffee//, that sweet nectar of wakefulness that would make this unbearable fatigue tolerable.\n\n\n\nAs Clef rounded the corner and entered the break room, his eyes snapped straight to the coffee pot. Gears was there, holding it. A surge of anxiety hit Clef, but it was followed quickly by relief. The pot was nearly full. There would be plenty left for both of them after Gears filled his mug.\n\n\n\nGears replaced the pot in the machine as he turned around. He smiled politely once he noticed Clef. \u201cGood morning, Alto.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Clef said.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you two get enough sleep?\u201d Gears asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef had to take a moment to steady himself. \u201cWe\u2026 didn\u2019t have a great night\u2019s sleep last night, no.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Gears said. \u201cIs it anything I could assist you with?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Kondraki said.\n\n\n\nClef spent a minute deciding whether to elaborate. There was a chance Gears already knew about it. Its first few appearances had been in public, after all. However, that didn\u2019t mean it was easy or comfortable for Clef to acknowledge that he\u2019d tried and failed to deal with the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Gears said before walking out of the room with his cup of coffee.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Gears was clear of the pot, Kondraki dashed over to it. He grabbed the largest mug in the cabinet\u2014which didn\u2019t belong to him or Clef\u2014and filled it. Clef took the next largest, a yellow, almost spherical mug with a large smiley face on one side. Both of them started chugging the mouth-scalding liquid like it was a cold one at happy hour.\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cWHAT MORE CAN I DO?\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cOH BABY ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nThe sudden noise made Clef jump, falling backward and spilling the scalding hot liquid all over his shirt. The mug landed on top of him, without another drop of coffee in it.\n\n\n\nClef glanced up at the pot. That was the last of it. He\u2019d have to wait for the pot to brew more.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least the mug didn\u2019t bre\u2014\u201d Kondraki began.\n\n\n\nClef grabbed the mug and hurled it across the room. It shattered against the far wall.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**__//Incident 42//__**\n\n\n\nClef sat at a round table in one of the site\u2019s meeting rooms, trying to remember which group of anomalous religious weirdos he was sitting across from. Were these sarkites? Clef hoped not, because he was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t supposed to call them \u2018sarkites\u2019 anymore, and he had completely forgotten what he was supposed to call them instead.\n\n\n\nKondraki was next to him, not doing much better. Thank fuck Light was there to do the talking.\n\n\n\nIf Clef was operating on a normal night\u2019s sleep, he\u2019d at least be able to force himself to pay attention to whatever the hell they were saying, but as things were, well, the best he\u2019d gathered was that the religious types were begging the Foundation to renew some kind of non-aggression pact.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe understand your concerns,\u201d said the old woman representing whichever GoI it was. \u201cOur organization has worked around the Veil for over a century. We\u2019ve never //not// worked around it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Light said. \u201cThe degree to which you are able to police yourselves is certainly impressive. We particularly appreciate how adept you are at suppressing violent offshoots of your faith. However, we no longer feel that the current terms of our agreement adequately account for the fact that there\u2019s significant overlap between your church\u2019s membership and that of several more hostile organizations.\u201d\n\n\n\nWas it the broken god people? No, those guys usually had some kind of weird metal sticking out of them. The hytoth weirdos? Clef tried to get a glimpse at the lady\u2019s hands. Were those scars? They looked like stars.\n\n\n\nPart of Clef almost felt bad for them. It was a bit cruel to bring this woman here just so they could check a box saying they\u2019d tried to negotiate. If the Foundation had any intention of leaving these people alone, it would have renewed whatever pact it had before without having a new meeting about it.\n\n\n\nThen again, Light was here. If anyone could weave some magic church\u2019s pathetic pleas for mercy into a working non-aggression pact, it was\u2014\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cOH OH\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cALL THE LIGHTS ARE SHINING SO BRIGHTLY EVERYWHERE\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nIn a single fluid motion, Clef tore his sidearm from its holster and fired three shots directly into the stick of mistletoe above them.

There wasn\u2019t a hint of amusement or satisfaction on his face.\n\n\n\nThis kid genuinely had no idea what was going on.

Even a modest sample could give meaningful data.\n\n\n\n\u201cNotice anything?\u201d Clef asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cIt shows up in staff areas, but of course it does.

Not once.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat got Kondraki studying the map again. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be a coincidence, though, just a function of the fact that we spend less time there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis thing has appeared dozens of times,\u201d Clef said, \u201cand it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re never in those areas.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you basically a living reality anchor anyway?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot as strong as our machines, especially when something\u2019s not trying to directly affect me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay. So, maybe this thing can\u2019t show up in the range of an anchor. How are we going to use that? We can\u2019t get the whole site anchored.

Maybe we can use that to trap it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI\u2019ll take it into light-containment. There\u2019s an anchor covering that.\u201d Kondraki reached into his coat pocket, searching for the stick.

Maybe we can set a trap for it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Kondraki thought for a moment. \u201cActually,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is one thing we\u2019ve done that seemed to make it appear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, remember?

Now, the last time this thing showed up was only half an hour ago. It\u2019s not due to come back for another ten minutes, at least. If we try to kiss right now, and it shows up\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen we probably have a way to make it show up where we want it to,\u201d Clef said, \u201cmeaning we can turn off a reality anchor, kiss in its range, and turn the anchor back on when the thing shows up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be certain it\u2019ll be trapped, but it\u2019s definitely worth a try.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey glanced at each other for a moment. \u201cWell then,\u201d Clef said, \u201cyour breath presentable?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask stupid questions,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like yours is any better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, too,\u201d Clef said. \u201cIt\u2019s not //good//, but it is better.\u201d\n\n\n\nKondraki sighed. \u201cWhatever.

I\u2019ll give you that, but it\u2019s still a risk, undertaken for the sake a problem that might have other, simpler solutions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Clef asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve ruled out your proposals,\u201d Kondraki said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re too stubborn to try something does not make it \u2018ruled out.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe unacceptability of a cost is always subjective,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI, for one, think moving a few dozen humanoids to another area of the site for an hour is a smaller risk than doing what this thing wants. For all we know, kissing underneath it is just what it needs to be able to create some kind of horrible disaster, or fuse our lips together, or turn us to stone. Much better to shuffle a bunch of well-understood humanoids around the site than take a big risk with one we don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nLight took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll grant you the possibility that kissing under this thing will activate some kind of trap, but moving a lot of prisoners at once can also go wrong in a lot of ways. It\u2019s not a risk-free solu\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cISSSSSSSSS YOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABYYYYYYYYY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Light said. She reached up to try to pull the thing off the ceiling but was just a hair too short to reach it. Clef and Kondraki both could have, but, for once, they didn\u2019t. They just stood there.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Clef asked, having to raise his voice to be audible over the music. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think it just might be worth the risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABYYYYYYYYY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d Light said with a long, seething breath.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**__//Incident 100//__**\n\n\n\nThe couple stood in a containment chamber. At any other time, this cell belonged to some two-bit reality bender and was covered by a reality anchor. Right now, though, the usual occupant of this cell was off enjoying extra socialization time in another wing of the site, and the two doctors were sitting on its bed, waiting for Gears to give them the signal.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cThis is going to work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWho the hell said I was worried? Why would I be worried?\u201d\n\n\n\nKonni shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\n\nClef sighed. \u201cI admit, I\u2019m looking forward to a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Gears said from the site\u2019s control room.\n\n\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for a signal. Do it as soon as the thing shows up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember the plan, Benjamin.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe two looked at each other. No time like the present. Slowly, so as to give the damn thing plenty of time to show up, they moved their lips together. Just before they met\u2026\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BABYYYYYYYYY\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**//\u266b \u201cYOUUUUUU, BA\u2014\u201d \u266b//**[[/size]]\n\n\n\nGears turned the anchor back on. Instantly, mercifully, the music stopped, and the item fell to the ground without them needing to touch it.\n\n\n\nThe doctors looked at each other. They were both beaming, savoring the peaceful silence. They wrapped their arms around each other, and, for the first time in a month, kissed. Kondraki\u2019s mouth tasted just as bad as Clef remembered, and he didn\u2019t give a single fuck. Right now, it was his favorite taste in the world.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__//Incident 101//__\n\n\n\nClef and Kondraki sat next to each other the following Christmas Morning.\n\n\n\nOkay, \u201cmorning\u201d might have been a bit of a stretch. It was 6:37 PM. However, they\u2019d only been up for half an hour or so, and that made it Christmas morning.\n\n\n\nNormally, someone would get on their case for oversleeping that badly, but everyone in the site knew they hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in months, so it seemed none of them felt the need to chastise them for their laziness.\n\n\n\nThey sat in front of the small Christmas tree in their quarters. There were a handful of gifts under it, from various friends and family. Next, it was time for Kondraki\u2019s kid.\n\n\n\nDraven\u2019s gift was in a large box, with a large, thick Christmas card on top of it. Kondraki pulled the card off of it. He ripped open the envelope and pulled the card out.\n\n\n\nIt was made of something plasticy rather than simple paper, and about twice as thick as a greeting card would normally be. There was no text on the outside, just a bright green, heart-shaped wreath on a red background. Honestly, it was a strange choice. Its vibe was more romantic than familial.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Clef wondered why Draven had picked it. After a moment of thought, the answer dawned on him, just as Kondraki was about to open the card.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t open that!\u201d Clef shouted, but it was too late. Kondraki held the now-open card in his hand. From a cheap, tiny speaker inside it, music rang out.\n\n\n\n//\u266b \u201cAnd IIIIIII\u201d \u266b//\n\n//\u266b \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep on waiting\u201d \u266b//\n\n//\u266b \u201cUnderneath the mistletoe\u201d \u266b//\n\n\n\nClef grabbed the card out of Kondraki\u2019s hand and threw it across the room. Its music was much quieter than the anomalous mistletoe\u2019s had been, but Clef didn\u2019t care. \u201cThat little shit!\u201d\n\n\n\nKondraki was laughing his ass of.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter what we\u2019ve been through for the past few days\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know, right? I\u2019m so proud.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef looked over at Kondraki.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdmit it,\u201d Konni said, \u201cif all of this had happened to Gears, we\u2019d have sent the exact same card.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow that he heard the words spoken aloud, it was impossible for Clef to deny them. There was another ten seconds of laughter before Kondraki calmed down with a final, long exhale. Clef also took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get him back, though, yeah?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cI already have something in mind.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n,,[[[xhawk77x|More by this Author]]],,\n\n[[/=]]\n", "references": ["xhawk77x", "second-hytoth-hub", "gamers-against-weed-hub"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "christmas", "comedy", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-kondraki", "doctor-light", "draven-kondraki", "gamers-against-weed", "lgbtq", "romance", "second-hytoth", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Underneath the Mistletoe - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/underneath-the-mistletoe", "year": 2026}}
