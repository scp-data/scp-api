Her arms are crossed, and there is a desperation to her as she kicks her feet back and forth, expectantly. \"Come on,\" I hear her say. \"Hurry up.\"</p>\n<p>{Patience,} I write, using a very light charcoal pencil. {Don't rush an artist.}</p>\n<p>She doesn't respond much to that, except to sigh and lean against the bench, sighing. She scratches an itch, pulling up her ultramarine dress a bit, and I see a slight flash of white panty. I wonder whether I should tell her about that. Probably best not to mention it.</p>\n<p>My paints are ready, my palette prepared, my brushes are all arranged. I pin up the photograph of the lakeside view next to the canvas, and spend a moment just drinking in the sight of that beautiful mountain view. It was a photograph I'd taken ten years ago, as a teenager, on a camping trip up in the Sierra Nevadas. I'd been with Rachael back then: lovely Rachael with the girl-next-door eyes and the face of an angel, lovely Rachael who had crept into my tent while the others were asleep and put her finger to my lips, kissing me softly as she crept into my sleeping bag, lovely Rachael who now lived somewhere in Sacramento, a lobbyist for Greenpeace now, and I wonder, as I sketch the outlines of the mountains and trees, whether or not she sometimes looks out at the forests that she fights so hard to protect and remembers, with a smile, the night when she crept into the tent of her classmate wearing a t-shirt and panties and made love to him to the sound of chirping crickets and falling water.</p>\n<p>Memories. My pencil dances across the canvas with reckless abandon, as it always does when my muse strikes, when the left-side brain shuts down and lets my right-side brain flow freely, when eye and hand and pencil work in perfect harmony. Memories of the time that the man in the black tie had come to me and told me that he'd read my paper on folklore and myth, being told that I had the opportunity to save the world. Memories of the first missions I went on, the first times I was asked to handle a containment situation. The hands that now held pencil and eraser had once been red with the blood of a close friend, Maggie Lyndon, Dr. Maggie Lyndon, torn in half due to a single moment's indiscretion with Six-Eighty Two, the red of her blood deeper and darker than any cadmium red that my paints could mix. It is not sadness that I feel, but regret, regret for the diamond ring that still stays in my safe deposit box, that I never got to give to her.</p>\n<p>If only I were as cold and hard-hearted as some of my colleagues. I cannot drink away my problems, nor can I effect the same cold-hearted dismissal of death that Dr. Clef or Kondraki can. My mother had always told me that, as the youngest, I was the most sensitive of her children. Indeed, although my career was found in science, I had always found solace in art, and it was in art that the Overseers decided that I should find my solace now. Removed from the Keter-level projects, I was told that there was another SCP that had need of my unique talents.</p>\n<p>I don't know what I expected, but I did not expect this.</p>\n<p>As always, the time passes quickly, and by the time I am finished with the sketch, an hour has passed without my knowing. Cassy is rapt with attention, smiling with delight at the faint outlines of the mountains, the lake, the dock and the small cabin. \"It looks wonderful,\" she gasps. \"Can I\u2026 ?\"</p>\n<p>{Not yet,} I write. I put down my pencil now and take up my palette and brushes. With broad strokes of my widest brush, I lay down my base colors: deep, dark blue for the water, brown for the mountains, pale cerulean for the sky. I move quickly, for Cassy is impatient, but I am careful to pace myself, to slow myself down and really see what is there before I place it on the canvas. Under my brush, the mountains slowly come alive, the flat browns giving way to deep, craggy peaks capped with snow, then bursting forth in greenery as the pine trees explode over their craggy sides. Down low, I take some time to paint out some more details on the closer trees: the broken branch on one, the bent trunk on another, the slight hint of wood rot in a third. Closer in, closer to Cassie, I take some time to paint in the slightly dry grass in darker greens, dabbing in a little bright yellow to form the budding flowers of mustard.</p>\n<p>Even as I begin to start on the lake, the painting begins to come alive. A soft wind rustles the high branches of the pine trees, causing dried needles to come drifting to earth, thickening the dark carpet of pine needles under Cassy's bare feet. The lake, which had begun as a deep, blue blotch of paint, quickly takes form under layers of lighter and lighter hues, then under highlights of pure white mixed with a hint of cerulean, to reflect the sky. Little wavelets, like the ones that had lapped at the sides of the rowboat that Rachael and I had drifted in for hours, form on the surface of the water, and begin to move, to ebb and flow.</p>\n<p>I lift my paintbrush up, and I step back from the painting. Something is missing here\u2026 something that is not in the photograph, nor in the painting, something to make it complete\u2026</p>\n<p>Cassy knows. \"Can you paint me a dock?\" she asks. \"I want to dive into the water.\"</p>\n<p>I can't talk to her now, for writing anything to her would ruin the painting, so I respond by laying down four quick lines of black, then layering over it with brown and walnut. The dock is a bit rickety, and the piles appear to be a bit old, but that is part of its charm as well. I am tempted to add a mallard duck to the scene, but that would only remind Cassy of her loneliness. I settle for a leaf on the water, drifting across the lake, casting small ripples on the surface of the dark water.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Cassy says, turning towards me and smiling. \"It's beautiful.\"</p>\n<p>I sign my name in the corner in white paint, and add a small, \"You're Welcome\" and a smiling face to my signature. Cassy gets up from the park bench and walks towards the lake, her bare feet crunching over the pine needles, seeming not to care about the rough ground, and I wonder whether it is because she has never felt the true feeling of pine needles against bare skin that she does not know that it should hurt.</p>\n<p>It's a mistake to get distracted like that\u2026 in my philosophical haze, I trip over my tray of paints, and my little tubes of Burnt Umber and Vermillion scatter across the containment room. \"Fuck!\" I sigh. Getting down to my knees, I start rooting under the piles of canvases and papers, trying to gather up my various paints and supplies.</p>\n<p>I've finally gathered up my last tube of Cadmium Red and am arranging them in my box when I notice a flash of pale flesh on the painting. I turn and immediately turn away, blushing, as Cassy pulls off her blue dress and lets it fall, carelessly, onto the dock. Her bare back is pale, and slender, and her loveliness is that of an Aphrodite rising from the sea foam as she takes the ribbon out of her hair and lays it atop her dress. She dives into the water with a bright splash, emerges in a shower of sparkling water droplets, and slowly begins to swim across the lake, reveling in the coolness of the water.</p>\n<p>Some mad impulse in me wishes she'd choose a backstroke.</p>\n<p>I manage to fight back my mad libido and close my artist's case slowly, quietly. Stupid. She can't hear me, or see me, but it seems somehow\u2026 intrusive\u2026 when she is swimming bare naked through the lake, uncaring of what I might see. I am putting my palette away when I hesitate, realizing something that I had forgotten.</p>\n<p>I have just enough white left. I put my brush to paint and quickly add the missing element to the pile of clothing on the dock.</p>\n<p>Closing up my case, I leave the containment facility, swiping my card through the reader and turning out the lights as I go. Cassy will not mind: to her, the sun will stay bright and shining, the wind will always be cool, and the water will always be crisp and clean, until she is ready to go back home, to the sketchpad left duct-taped to one corner, to her usual world of monochrome blacks and whites.</p>\n<p>I wonder, as I head back to my office, why I did that last bit. Perhaps it would have been better just to leave her be, so that she would never know that I had seen her dive, naked, into the lake? Maybe. Maybe it was just that it seemed unfair that I could see her and she could not see me, or maybe it was just my way of teasing her.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, as a gentleman, I just didn't feel like leaving a lady to swim without a towel.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span>Interlude 1</span></h3>\n<p><em>\"Agent Lassiter's performance, given his recent emotional troubles, has been exemplary.

As such, it is the time for joy, happyiness, good will towards all men, that sort of thing. And the reason I'm writing this: gifts. I've noticed from the papers I've gotten recently that you have a lot of paperwork you have to go through after that accident. So, I took the liberty to break into your office while you were busy with the <a href=\"/olympia-project\">Olympia Project</a> and went through and dealt with 55% of your paperwork. Don't worry about it though, you don't need to feel pressured to get me a gift also. Though I could deal with a good look at <a href=\"/scp-244-arc\">244</a> sometime.<br/>\nYour fellow researcher,<br/>\n<a href=\"/iceberg-personnel-file\">Dr. Iceberg</a><br/>\n<em>PS- When you go over your personnal finances, you may notice a slight discrepancy in the form of 550 missing dollars. Don't worry about it. Merry Christmas!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found this note on my desk after coming back to my office this evening. I'm not sure whether to feel outraged that he broke in, rifled through my things, and then took five hundred and fifty dollars from my <em>private</em> bank account, or overjoyed that someone did half of my paperwork for such a small amount of cash. I've had professionals ask for three grand for half this amount. So, in the end, I think I'll respond to this the way I do to all social incidents I'm unsure about. I'm going to ignore it, and forget it ever happened.</p>\n<p>Unless he does it again.</p>\n<p>The experiments with <a href=\"/scp-040\">Emma</a> got off to a rough start today. We got a little progress done, but mostly we're just breaking the ice. This ability of hers has gotten her ostracized and treated like she's some kind of freak, monster or deity throughout her entire short life. Created one hell of a roadblock in her head. She really just lets go when she uses her power, letting them control her when she does it. We need to get to the point where she controls them. But that might take some more time, and I am prone to rushing things at times. This one, however, we'll definitely have to take slowly, as I'd rather not have any mistakes to either the staff, myself, or her.</p>\n<p>The R&amp;D department have finally gotten a look at the bio-tech, it having finally been released from quarantine. They had countless scans with countless numbers of equipment, at least twenty nine different \"certified\" experts, and three SCP examine the whole lot of it from top to bottom, several times. Didn't find anything too malicious beyond the norm, and nothing that would spell doom for the staff, so they finally said \"uncle\" and let it go. Not that I'm complaining. I've seen how dangerous those things are, and I'm thankful that they performed as fast as they did, but still\u2026 The little researcher in my head laments the loss of time. I'll have to take over part of the project, and work with the guys if I want to lay some part of a claim on it, and reinstate the excavation. It would be near a crime to let something like that go to waste.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/experiment-log-158-ag\">Subject Zero</a> is still waiting for it (<em>her</em>) body to be finished, and it's getting a little difficult to dissuade it (<em>her</em>). In the end, I had to tell her it'll probably wind up being a Christmas present to her. It's sometimes rather hard to give a vague answer to an entity that can read your thoughts, and can tell when you're lying.</p>\n<p>As for the Christmas party itself, I've gotten some more planned, but no actual preparations yet. Still at the drawing board stage, so to speak, although I better get a move on soon. things like this tend to creep up on you rather quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>15/12/2008</strong><br/>\nEmma is still <a href=\"/experiment-log-040\">struggling with her powers</a>. I can understand why this would happen, the girl really has been over some serious emotional roadblocks, but the problem is that we need to either break the block or fix her before it becomes a problem. And I'd much rather not have her <em>become</em> the problem. Because when that happens, the higher ups tend to <em>snuff out</em> the problem.</p>\n<p>I'm rethinking some of the things I was going to do on the Olympia Project. Instead of using Emma to alter individual parts of various D-Class, I'm simply going to have her very barely alter and fine tune the host body itself. After all, I've seen some of the things she produces. I'm not sure if the <a href=\"/scp-291\">dissembler</a> even has cubbyholes for those kind of things. And if it comes down to that, I'd rather not have to resort to invasive surgery. I've never had a fondness for that. It's always so messy and I dislike getting blood on the <a href=\"/scp-244-arc\">walker</a>. Of course, that brings us back to problem one\u2026</p>\n<p>I'm going to have to go down to the area of the excavation incident tomorrow, to examine the residual tech, bio-matter and to examine the work done. This will be the first time that I'll have ventured down to the site since before I got the walker. I dislike going there. It always gives me a headache, and a weird paranoid feeling, and I know from personal experience that you listen to those feelings.</p>\n<p>I've actually gotten some of the Christmas preparations done! Well, mainly its the importing of a tree and some decorations, and through the usual black market routes. Now, the problem is where am I going to set it up, and what am I going to get for who?</p>\n<p><strong>16/12/2008</strong><br/>\nSubject Zero had an\u2026 episode today, and oddly enough, I think so did I. It (she) had followed me to the excavation area, and once we reached roughly around fifty feet of the main body, right where I get that weird feeling and begin feeling the twinges of a headache coming on, it (she) got incredibly afraid, saying something about \"it\" and how it was watching her, before firmly and fully taking residence inside my head. It wasn't quite a possession mind you, but more of it (her) hiding inside of me. Needless to say, all that information and excess soul/ectoplasm/personality began to give me a splitting headache, not to mention Zero constantly whispering to me about that \"thing\". But the worst part of it was, was that I could see what it (she) saw, and hear what it (she) heard.</p>\n<p>My memory gets a bit jumbled at that point, but personnel that were there say that they saw me screaming at the top of my lungs, taking the walker at near full speed out of that entire section of the building, often at the expense of walls. All I have to say about the experience is that I need a rather large glass of scotch. Or a bottle. And that all other personnel working in the area are to wear <a href=\"/scp-148\">telekill</a> helmets.</p>\n<p>Zero still won't say anything about it, remaining tight lipped about the entire thing. It (she) also says that it (she) won't accompany me down there ever again without a host, but the only thing it (she) would say about that is that \"<em>it tried to grab me</em>\". What \"it\" was remains a mystery, as well as how it could \"grab\" it (her).</p>\n<p>Still, the things I saw, that I heard\u2026 They fill me with a dread I did not think possible, but then again, they also stir up that researcher part of me, that part that fights the unknown with knowledge, the part most reminiscent of my childhood, fighting imaginary monsters with imaginary swords, secure in the knowledge that <em>they weren't real</em>. Because knowledge is power they say. But then again, they say that ignorance is bliss\u2026 And when I think back to those images\u2026 I can't help but think of the opening paragraph of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hp_lovecraft\">H.P. Lovecraft</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_cthulhu\">Call of Cthulhu</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of disassociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I can't help but think he might be right.</p>\n<p><strong>17/12/2008</strong><br/>\nWe finally got back Emma's results for her <a href=\"/experiment-log-040\">psych test</a>. the results are a little distressing, at least to me. I have to wonder, why someone would take a child as wonderful as her, and hurt her in such a way that the only way to deal with the pain is to try and permanently seal away part of herself? But then again, that sentiment goes the world over, for all abused and mistreated children.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm just an overly sentimental fool, disregarding security procedures for the sake of a child. And I can almost hear <a href=\"/drclef-member-page\">Clef</a> laughing at me. Bastard. I hate it when he's right about things like this. Still, if it ever came down to it, I'd protect her over him, but then again, I've seen him survive things that should have killed a <strong>normal</strong> person in instants.</p>\n<p>I've decided to implement the integration stage of the Olympia Project, and \"fine tune\" the host body when Emma is capable of doing so. Which looks like it might not be for a long time. Still, Zero seems to be happy about this, forgetting all about the terror of yesterday, and says that it (she) even has a name all planned out for the occasion. I've asked it (her), but it (she) says that it's a surprise for the day. I've tried explaining that it might take a few days for its (her) body to fully adapt to all its extraordinary physiology, but it (she) is having none of it. I guess I'll have to wait for it.</p>\n<p>And regarding yesterday, I'm going to have the main excavation area investigated by the strange round trinket from the <a href=\"/experiment-log-914-theta\">experiments with the clockworks</a>, the one that allows sight into other plains of existence. I'm also going to have on several psychologists as well, just in case. But judging from what Zero said and did yesterday, I don't think it has any extra effects on those who have corporeal forms, although there might be other things regarding the mental health of those in close quarters to the thing.</p>\n<p>Also, tests following examination of the bio-matter have come back. Apparently the bio-matter contains traces of mutated human cells, but primarily, its just excrement, like silk or webbing in the animal kingdom. Not only that, but it also all came from a single human donor. I'll have to have the bodies of the infected examined, as well as the surveillance tapes reviewed as well, for any other clues that we may have missed. This \"thing\" residing in the center may have something to do with this\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>18/12/2008</strong><br/>\nI've sent through the clearance and paperwork required to initiate the next phase of the Olympia Project. The integration of the composite materials. Zero is rather excited about the prospect. Her joy is washing into my own consciousness, making me feel almost giddy, despite the certain moral dilemmas I'm facing now. It's rather disconcerting.</p>\n<p>I'll be looking at the bodies of the infected tomorrow. I would have done it today, but I was finishing off the last of the paperwork from the incident, as well as that of the clearance papers for the other things I'm planning took longer than I expected. But it's not as if I mind. I never did like looking at the dead mutated bodies of former colleagues. Only in this line of work would I ever be forced to say that on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what to do about Emma. Although she doesn't say it, she still thinks there's something wrong with her, and I admit, that this is not the best environment for a child to try and prove that there <em>is</em> nothing wrong with them. That they're not freaks, or abominations, but the rest of the world will treat them like they are, or worse, something to be manipulated and used. (<em>Though I suppose I'm not one to talk there, but at least I am putting her mental health first</em>). So we have to lock them up, to either protect them from the world or themselves.</p>\n<p>You know, I've been doing this job for so many years now, and I've helped \"contain\" a lot of people. Helped \"terminate\" a lot more. Never once batted an eye at any of it. Not a single time. I had always assumed it was for the good of the world. Even now, I use live people (<em>bad people, mind you</em>), as the fodder in certain experiments. Not anything sadistic, but the fact of the matter is that I'm ending their lives, and still, I feel no great remorse. It's just something I've always done.</p>\n<p>Except when it came to children. In the time that I've been here, we've only had to terminate three children, and each time it was the absolute last resort, something that was needed for the sake of humanity's continued existence. And each time, I could do nothing to help them. It tore me up inside. But it had to be done.</p>\n<p>Bah, enough of this sentimental thinking. Been doing too much of that lately. Tonight, I'm going to relax. And most likely get drunk.</p>\n<p><strong>21/12/2008</strong><br/>\nBetween waking up yesterday with a severe hangover (<em>too much scotch</em>), overseeing the transfer of a certain <a href=\"/scp-542\">Herr Chirurg</a>, finalizing several approval forms for this Christmas bash, and actually organizing and setting up the decorations, and *finally* getting around to integrating Zero's physical body, I've been a little late on my log. But I've been a little busy, so excuse me.</p>\n<p>Emma is doing well. She seems to be finally respond to the treatment with some sort of positive effect, and that all by itself brightens my day considerably. Maybe someday soon she'll be able to control her abilities to the point where she can help me put the finishing touches on the Olympia Project.</p>\n<p>Actually, speaking of the Olympia Project, I got some help for that from a rather unusual source. The good doctor, Herr Chirurg, has been sent here ever since some roughness involving <a href=\"/dr-rights-personnel-file\">Agatha</a>. He wouldn't tell me exactly what, but he did mention that he quite liked her eyes.</p>\n<p>Still, once you get past his appearance and \"mild\" dementia, he's quite a likable character. A wealth of knowledge in fact. He's actually aided me in several little asides in regard to the project. He was quite interested in the whole thing. He see's me somewhat as a kindred spirit, and while he does find my physiology interesting, he told me that he's \"<em>skilled with the biology of humans\u2026not hounds</em>\", and so <em>won't</em> be cutting me open to find out how I work.</p>\n<p>So I see it as a fair trade. He helped me with my project, I taught him a little of what we know about the disassembler, despite the fact I'm not allowed to. Let's just not tell the higher ups about that, shall we? As a sort of an extra \"thank you\" present to the man for his help, and for not eviscerating any of my staff, I'll be getting him a bottle of peppermint schnapps, which Agatha said he quite enjoyed.</p>\n<p>And yes, the Olympia Project. Finally, I have begun the <a href=\"/olympia-integration-experiment-alpha\">integration phase</a>. And to see her there, in the flesh, to hear her twin hearts beating\u2026 It was breath taking. I'd liken the experience to becoming a father, although I've never procreated unfortunately, so I wouldn't truly know.</p>\n<p>That little hiccup at the end there though, that made me worried. For a few moments I was afraid she was going to die before she had truly lived. It was horrifying. I'm still not exactly certain as to what caused it, but it was worrying nonetheless, despite the fact none of us have seen a resurgence of the event. Still, her body is going through some changes, adapting to its new organs. It'll be a few days before she fully stabilizes enough for us to risk implanting Zero herself.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/13th-23rd-december-2008\">13th-23rd December 2008</a>\" by Kain Pathos Crow, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Lovecraft]'s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_cthulhu Call of Cthulhu].\n\n\n\n> //The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of disassociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.//\n\n\n\nAnd I can't help but think he might be right.\n\n\n\n**17/12/2008**\n\nWe finally got back Emma's results for her [[[experiment log 040 |psych test]]]. the results are a little distressing, at least to me. I have to wonder, why someone would take a child as wonderful as her, and hurt her in such a way that the only way to deal with the pain is to try and permanently seal away part of herself? But then again, that sentiment goes the world over, for all abused and mistreated children.\n\n\n\nI guess I'm just an overly sentimental fool, disregarding security procedures for the sake of a child. And I can almost hear [[[drclef member page |Clef]]] laughing at me. Bastard. I hate it when he's right about things like this. Still, if it ever came down to it, I'd protect her over him, but then again, I've seen him survive things that should have killed a **normal** person in instants.\n\n\n\nI've decided to implement the integration stage of the Olympia Project, and \"fine tune\" the host body when Emma is capable of doing so. Which looks like it might not be for a long time. Still, Zero seems to be happy about this, forgetting all about the terror of yesterday, and says that it (she) even has a name all planned out for the occasion. I've asked it (her), but it (she) says that it's a surprise for the day. I've tried explaining that it might take a few days for its (her) body to fully adapt to all its extraordinary physiology, but it (she) is having none of it. I guess I'll have to wait for it.\n\n\n\nAnd regarding yesterday, I'm going to have the main excavation area investigated by the strange round trinket from the [[[experiment log 914 theta |experiments with the clockworks]]], the one that allows sight into other plains of existence. I'm also going to have on several psychologists as well, just in case. But judging from what Zero said and did yesterday, I don't think it has any extra effects on those who have corporeal forms, although there might be other things regarding the mental health of those in close quarters to the thing.\n\n\n\nAlso, tests following examination of the bio-matter have come back. Apparently the bio-matter contains traces of mutated human cells, but primarily, its just excrement, like silk or webbing in the animal kingdom. Not only that, but it also all came from a single human donor. I'll have to have the bodies of the infected examined, as well as the surveillance tapes reviewed as well, for any other clues that we may have missed. This \"thing\" residing in the center may have something to do with this...\n\n\n\n**18/12/2008**\n\nI've sent through the clearance and paperwork required to initiate the next phase of the Olympia Project. The integration of the composite materials. Zero is rather excited about the prospect. Her joy is washing into my own consciousness, making me feel almost giddy, despite the certain moral dilemmas I'm facing now. It's rather disconcerting.\n\n\n\nI'll be looking at the bodies of the infected tomorrow. I would have done it today, but I was finishing off the last of the paperwork from the incident, as well as that of the clearance papers for the other things I'm planning took longer than I expected. But it's not as if I mind. I never did like looking at the dead mutated bodies of former colleagues. Only in this line of work would I ever be forced to say that on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what to do about Emma. Although she doesn't say it, she still thinks there's something wrong with her, and I admit, that this is not the best environment for a child to try and prove that there //is// nothing wrong with them. That they're not freaks, or abominations, but the rest of the world will treat them like they are, or worse, something to be manipulated and used. (//Though I suppose I'm not one to talk there, but at least I am putting her mental health first//). So we have to lock them up, to either protect them from the world or themselves. \n\n\n\nYou know, I've been doing this job for so many years now, and I've helped \"contain\" a lot of people. Helped \"terminate\" a lot more. Never once batted an eye at any of it. Not a single time. I had always assumed it was for the good of the world. Even now, I use live people (//bad people, mind you//), as the fodder in certain experiments. Not anything sadistic, but the fact of the matter is that I'm ending their lives, and still, I feel no great remorse. It's just something I've always done.\n\n\n\nExcept when it came to children. In the time that I've been here, we've only had to terminate three children, and each time it was the absolute last resort, something that was needed for the sake of humanity's continued existence. And each time, I could do nothing to help them. It tore me up inside. But it had to be done. \n\n\n\nBah, enough of this sentimental thinking. Been doing too much of that lately. Tonight, I'm going to relax. And most likely get drunk.\n\n\n\n**21/12/2008**\n\nBetween waking up yesterday with a severe hangover (//too much scotch//), overseeing the transfer of a certain [[[scp 542|Herr Chirurg]]], finalizing several approval forms for this Christmas bash, and actually organizing and setting up the decorations, and *finally* getting around to integrating Zero's physical body, I've been a little late on my log. But I've been a little busy, so excuse me.\n\n\n\nEmma is doing well. She seems to be finally respond to the treatment with some sort of positive effect, and that all by itself brightens my day considerably. Maybe someday soon she'll be able to control her abilities to the point where she can help me put the finishing touches on the Olympia Project.\n\n\n\nActually, speaking of the Olympia Project, I got some help for that from a rather unusual source. The good doctor, Herr Chirurg, has been sent here ever since some roughness involving [[[dr rights personnel file|Agatha]]]. He wouldn't tell me exactly what, but he did mention that he quite liked her eyes.\n\n\n\nStill, once you get past his appearance and \"mild\" dementia, he's quite a likable character. A wealth of knowledge in fact. He's actually aided me in several little asides in regard to the project. He was quite interested in the whole thing. He see's me somewhat as a kindred spirit, and while he does find my physiology interesting, he told me that he's \"//skilled with the biology of humans...not hounds//\", and so //won't// be cutting me open to find out how I work.\n\n\n\nSo I see it as a fair trade. He helped me with my project, I taught him a little of what we know about the disassembler, despite the fact I'm not allowed to. Let's just not tell the higher ups about that, shall we? As a sort of an extra \"thank you\" present to the man for his help, and for not eviscerating any of my staff, I'll be getting him a bottle of peppermint schnapps, which Agatha said he quite enjoyed.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, the Olympia Project. Finally, I have begun the [[[olympia integration experiment alpha|integration phase]]]. And to see her there, in the flesh, to hear her twin hearts beating... It was breath taking. I'd liken the experience to becoming a father, although I've never procreated unfortunately, so I wouldn't truly know. \n\n\n\nThat little hiccup at the end there though, that made me worried. For a few moments I was afraid she was going to die before she had truly lived. It was horrifying. I'm still not exactly certain as to what caused it, but it was worrying nonetheless, despite the fact none of us have seen a resurgence of the event. Still, her body is going through some changes, adapting to its new organs. It'll be a few days before she fully stabilizes enough for us to risk implanting Zero herself.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["olympia-project", "scp-244-arc", "iceberg-personnel-file", "scp-040", "experiment-log-158-ag", "experiment-log-040", "scp-291", "scp-148", "drclef-member-page", "experiment-log-914-theta", "scp-542", "dr-rights-personnel-file", "olympia-integration-experiment-alpha", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "first-person", "journal", "kain-pathos-crow", "olympia", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "13th-23rd December 2008 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/13th-23rd-december-2008", "year": 2008}, "1st-12th-december-2008": {"created_at": "2008-12-13T23:48:00", "creator": "Kain Pathos Crow", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-13T23:48:00"}, {"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-13T23:51:00"}, {"author": "ALC_POLECAT", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/alc-polecat", "comment": "fixed link to 4444-j", "date": "2010-11-25T00:40:00"}, {"author": "Bland", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bland", "comment": "Brought Santa back into our lives.", "date": "2011-10-23T18:06:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: olympia, tale.

I was so consumed with the <a href=\"/scp-158\">extractor</a> that all my previous appointments I either forgot, or simply blew off. Unprofessional and immature, I know, but I couldn't tear myself away from it. Now that I've exhausted myself and managed to break away, I now see what else I have to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-040\">Emma</a> was a little upset that I had \"flaked\" on our little lunch, but I've promised her that I'll drop by either today or tomorrow to talk to her, and that I'd bring her even more little snacks. I realise this is spoiling her a little, but the girl has been through figurative firestorms, not to mention what she was like when we found her. She deserves a little spoiling every now and then. Of course, ever since <a href=\"/drclef-member-page\">Clef</a> went on his little <a href=\"/incident-239-b-clef-kondraki\">rampage</a> I've been a little nervous about her safety. Granted, she's a maelstrom of energy, capable of warping life to degrees we cannot even fathom, but beneath that, is a small, lonely little girl, who really just wanted some friends. It's just I feel kind of bad for her. I know that's not very unbiased, but I have a soft spot for children. Besides, I think I made very clear to Clef exactly what I thought of his little \"outburst\".</p>\n<p>I've received a clear estimation of when those new tools will be ready for the excavation. They've told me Friday, but that's if they push it to the limit. I've agreed with that, and added a bonus to their fee for being gracious about my demands. Still\u2026 I hate to leave this project alone for that long. But, at the very least, no accidents can happen there till then, so I guess some good can come of it.</p>\n<p>I had put the dispersal of D-Class personnel here on hold for the past two days, until I choose the ones I want, making the rest of the site coordinators rather snippy with me. I had forgotten completely about it, due to aforementioned reasons, but I'll try and get down to it later today or tomorrow, before I speak with Emma.</p>\n<p>I've applied for official project status regarding my working for an assistant, it being christened the \"<a href=\"/olympia-project\">Olympia Project</a>\". I was actually hoping for it to be named after the Chimera, but I guess being named after Olimpia from E.T. Hoffman's \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Sandmann\" target=\"_blank\">Der Sandmann</a>\" isn't so bad either. High Command aren't exactly entirely sure about exactly what I'm doing in this project but as long as I'm getting all this research done, they don't seem to care, unless I blow this place up.</p>\n<p><strong>03/12/2008</strong><br/>\nMy interaction today with the extractor is something that was\u2026 unnerving to say the least. I still cannot believe what has happened. The composite soul\u2026 <a href=\"/experiment-log-158-ag\">Subject Zero</a>\u2026 despite that it does not want to be called that, I have nothing else to call it until it chooses a new moniker. I had never even once thought that something like this would occur when I started even that part of the project. I may have fostered something that will have an effect on the course of history far beyond what I can expect. I may have gone a little bit too far just for an assistant.</p>\n<p>I had lunch with Emma today. Well, make believe tea, with plastic cutlery and several of her creations rather than dolls. I had to explain to her in her own terms what I was trying to do. I was trying to make <em>myself</em> a friend, although I didn't have the abilities that she did to make one, so I'd need her help. She was a little apprehensive when I told her exactly what she'd be doing in order to help me, but a few more bribes of chocolate and she was more than willing to go on with me. Sometimes I'm grateful that she's just a child and has no real concept of what she's doing to other human beings, or what will happen to them afterward. But it does make me feel the slightest bad inside, for having manipulated her, and for leaving this stain on her consciousness for the day she realises what she's done. Bah, if only Clef could hear me now. I hate being like this. I hate thinking he's right.</p>\n<p>I still haven't made my selection of D-Class Personnel, and the coordinators of the site are really breathing down my neck. I've held up the entire experiment process for the rest of the site for the past three days, and they're getting more behind schedule than normal. I heard some mentions of \"tarring and feathering\" so I've resolved to make absolutely sure that I select them tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I've been going over the makeshift instructions for the <a href=\"/scp-291\">disassembler</a> that <a href=\"/dr-rights-personnel-file\">Agatha</a> had written after her experiments with it. I must say, it really does seem to be capable of some interesting things, although it seems almost as if she omitted certain things. I'll have to talk to her about it at length. Pick her brain about it, so to speak.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, I really must speak to <a href=\"/dr-gears-s-personnel-file\">Gears</a> about the <a href=\"/scp-914\">clockworks</a> when I next see him. It really does factor in heavily with my little project, and there really isn't an instruction manual besides the experiment logs. I doubt if there's anyone in the world who knows more about that thing than he does.</p>\n<p>Maybe the three of us could have lunch at some point\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>04/12/2008</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"/experiment-log-158-ag\">Subject Zero</a> has taken to following me around. I can't see it, and it doesn't register on any scanners or anything, but I can feel it in a similar way to the way I feel the <a href=\"/scp-244-arc\">walker</a> in my head. Its strange, because I can feel it observing my thoughts, my feelings, the inner workings of my mind. I'm naked beneath its mental stare, and not just because my hair is only just starting to grow back. I don't like being this vulnerable to anyone, ever, so I've tried to explain to it the idea of personal privacy, but considering its an entity that almost literally has its heart on its sleeve, it's been slow going.</p>\n<p>I chose the subjects today for the project. One of them, who probably had a rough idea of what was going to happen, spat in the face of guard escorting them, calling him a freak, a monster for doing this to them, that the only difference between us and them is that they were caught. While it was physically directed at the guard, I can't help but feel that it was truly directed towards me. It's another one of those small reminders that I'm using people, rather than lab animals. Just another damn thing I have to repress.</p>\n<p>I managed to have a sit down with Gears today. He was in Bio-Research Area-12 for some reason or the other, I'm not exactly sure why, but the point of the matter is that we got talking. I told him about the project I would be doing, and he clarified how I'd have to use the clockworks. I won't be able to use it in the way I planned. Instead of using each singular organ, I'm going to have to alter the entire subject, then hope I get the result I was looking for\u2026 This seems like it might be a little tedious. And expensive in terms of test subjects.</p>\n<p>The tools are almost done. I'm not sure if it's loyalty, fear, or the fact I paid them extra, but they're really going at it, working flat out to try and get them done by tomorrow. Which is good. Very good. I want this excavation to go as fast and as smoothly as possible. And that should be possible with these tools.</p>\n<p>I'll be utilizing Emma tomorrow if the excavation doesn't get in the way, and the reassembly during the weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>09/12/2008</strong><br/>\nThere was an accident.</p>\n<p>We never realized how brittle the outer shell was, only noting its hardness. When we started using the advanced tools, a large fragment of it shattered, very violently. Up to four men were hit with it. The system locked down instantly once the alarms went off.</p>\n<p>Within five minutes, the infection had spread throughout the entirety of the staff interred within the area. Within two hours they had utilized all technology inside for their own purposes. Within five hours they had broken containment and attempted to infect everyone else on site.</p>\n<p>We had to evacuate the entire site in three hours. That included all SCP. And the infected\u2026</p>\n<p>It took us three days to lay them down. Three days. Three WHOLE days in which there was no research done, another twenty five people were killed or infected and cost over four million in damages. We're still cleaning up the biomass.</p>\n<p>To say this was catastrophic is an understatement.</p>\n<p>So now, because of all this, I have three O5's on my ass, laying the blame for this at <em>my</em> feet having lobbied for excavation so much. Not to mention the paperwork for the thing has amassed into a pile so large, it's in danger of becoming its own sub space dimension.</p>\n<p>Everything I've had going has been put on hold. The projects for the entire site have been set back for months, some of them years. The only good thing is the amount of strange bio-tech the infected engineered. If we're lucky, and if I campaign it correctly, I might just get out of this mess better than I started.</p>\n<p><strong>11/12/2008</strong></p>\n<p>Gah\u2026 Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork\u2026 I'm drowning in the goddamn stuff, even with the <a href=\"/scp-244-arc\">walker</a> working around the clock when I sleep. Evaluation reports, incident reports, repair reports, eyewitness interviews, budgets for the Site, letters to employees families, files for possible new employees, the list goes on and on and on. Makes me wish the fellow who invented bureaucracy is burning in hell. Bastard.</p>\n<p>On top of that I've received word of a <a href=\"/scp-4444-j\">crazy freak dimension</a> that's opened up to some weird alternate version of this world with the Foundation, only that everything is hideously wrong, and the Foundation is populated by idiots and assholes, where even the D-Class personnel are given guns, and SCPs run rampant. Apparently doctors <a href=\"/drclef-member-page\">Clef</a> and <a href=\"/dr-kondraki-s-personnel-file\">Kondraki</a> are exploring it, and the <a href=\"/investigation-log-of-scp-4444\">reports</a> they're sending back are both bizarre and frightening.</p>\n<p>I've almost completed the <a href=\"/scp-914\">clockworks</a> area of the <a href=\"/olympia-project\">Olympia Project</a>, much to the joy of <a href=\"/experiment-log-158-ag\">Subject Zero</a>, (<em>Who still hasn't chosen a name I might add</em>). Still, the <a href=\"/experiment-log-914-theta\">processing of raw materials</a> with the clockworks is hard and grueling, involving much time and effort on my part, and the expenditure of more and more, subjects and pieces of equipment. I never thought I'd say this about an experiment session, but I want to finish this one as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-040\">Emily</a> is absolutely in fits at me repeatedly \"blowing her off\". I've tried to explain the complexity of the situation, but you know how children sometimes are. So, in order to appease her (<em>as well as several other SCPs, raise morale, and just generally lower the number of escape attempts</em>) I've told her that we would be celebrating Christmas in the facility. Since this is her first year here, and she's never been\u2026 <em>able</em> to celebrate Christmas in her previous life, and so I told her that this would be a good one. I even told her about <a href=\"/scp-2412-j\">Santa Claus</a>.</p>\n<p>In reality, I was planning to do this thing anyway, but why not use it to calm a force of nature while I'm at it too, huh?</p>\n<p>The biomass has <em>finally</em> been fully collected from the excavation incident and, although they're trying not to appear it, the higher ups are rather interested in the tech that was recovered. Of course, inter site politics being what they are, I'm going to make it cost them. For the good of humanity of course. Not that some of them would understand what <strong>that</strong> was, even if it bit them on the ass\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>12/12/2008</strong><br/>\nStill on the paperwork. Still no end in sight.</p>\n<p>At least I got most of the experimentation with the clockworks finished. The machine is interesting, but working with it does take lot out of you. You have to be prepared for everything. That includes running tests for everything. Because sometimes, it'll give you one thing that turns out to be <em>another</em>, such as the time one researcher believed he had a device that could reverse time. Instead, it somehow sucked it from the <em>air</em>. At least, that's what we think happened, as deduced from the notes we found. Ashes aren't exactly talkative.</p>\n<p>I'm going to start work with Emily tomorrow. She seems happy about it.</p>\n<p>Started making the preparations for whole \"Christmas\" thing, but with between the mass of paperwork and the Olympia Project eating all my time, I really only got to devise a gameplan, and even then, it was sketchy at best.</p>\n<p>Subject Zero has been around me twenty four seven, and I have to say, now that I'm getting kinda used to its (<em>her?</em>) presence, its not actually that bad. Like having an imaginary friend that's actually real. Apparently it (she?) can feel the thoughts of those around it (her?). Fun stuff, although I think it (she?) may be a bit of a gossip. I've never heard so many things I didn't want to know about my colleagues. Especially those ones about the bread. Coincidentally, I'm not eating in the cafeteria again.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/1st-12th-december-2008\">1st - 12th December 2008</a>\" by Kain Pathos Crow, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I was so consumed with the [[[scp 158 |extractor]]] that all my previous appointments I either forgot, or simply blew off. Unprofessional and immature, I know, but I couldn't tear myself away from it. Now that I've exhausted myself and managed to break away, I now see what else I have to do. \n\n\n\n[[[scp-040 |Emma]]] was a little upset that I had \"flaked\" on our little lunch, but I've promised her that I'll drop by either today or tomorrow to talk to her, and that I'd bring her even more little snacks. I realise this is spoiling her a little, but the girl has been through figurative firestorms, not to mention what she was like when we found her. She deserves a little spoiling every now and then. Of course, ever since [[[drclef member page |Clef]]] went on his little [[[incident 239 b (clef kondraki) |rampage]]] I've been a little nervous about her safety. Granted, she's a maelstrom of energy, capable of warping life to degrees we cannot even fathom, but beneath that, is a small, lonely little girl, who really just wanted some friends. It's just I feel kind of bad for her. I know that's not very unbiased, but I have a soft spot for children. Besides, I think I made very clear to Clef exactly what I thought of his little \"outburst\".\n\n\n\nI've received a clear estimation of when those new tools will be ready for the excavation. They've told me Friday, but that's if they push it to the limit. I've agreed with that, and added a bonus to their fee for being gracious about my demands. Still... I hate to leave this project alone for that long. But, at the very least, no accidents can happen there till then, so I guess some good can come of it.\n\n\n\nI had put the dispersal of D-Class personnel here on hold for the past two days, until I choose the ones I want, making the rest of the site coordinators rather snippy with me. I had forgotten completely about it, due to aforementioned reasons, but I'll try and get down to it later today or tomorrow, before I speak with Emma.\n\n\n\nI've applied for official project status regarding my working for an assistant, it being christened the \"[[[Olympia Project]]]\". I was actually hoping for it to be named after the Chimera, but I guess being named after Olimpia from E.T. Hoffman's \"[*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Sandmann Der Sandmann]\" isn't so bad either. High Command aren't exactly entirely sure about exactly what I'm doing in this project but as long as I'm getting all this research done, they don't seem to care, unless I blow this place up.\n\n\n\n**03/12/2008**\n\nMy interaction today with the extractor is something that was... unnerving to say the least. I still cannot believe what has happened. The composite soul... [[[experiment log 158 ag |Subject Zero]]]... despite that it does not want to be called that, I have nothing else to call it until it chooses a new moniker. I had never even once thought that something like this would occur when I started even that part of the project. I may have fostered something that will have an effect on the course of history far beyond what I can expect. I may have gone a little bit too far just for an assistant.\n\n\n\nI had lunch with Emma today. Well, make believe tea, with plastic cutlery and several of her creations rather than dolls. I had to explain to her in her own terms what I was trying to do. I was trying to make //myself// a friend, although I didn't have the abilities that she did to make one, so I'd need her help. She was a little apprehensive when I told her exactly what she'd be doing in order to help me, but a few more bribes of chocolate and she was more than willing to go on with me. Sometimes I'm grateful that she's just a child and has no real concept of what she's doing to other human beings, or what will happen to them afterward. But it does make me feel the slightest bad inside, for having manipulated her, and for leaving this stain on her consciousness for the day she realises what she's done. Bah, if only Clef could hear me now. I hate being like this. I hate thinking he's right.\n\n\n\nI still haven't made my selection of D-Class Personnel, and the coordinators of the site are really breathing down my neck. I've held up the entire experiment process for the rest of the site for the past three days, and they're getting more behind schedule than normal. I heard some mentions of \"tarring and feathering\" so I've resolved to make absolutely sure that I select them tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI've been going over the makeshift instructions for the [[[scp-291 |disassembler]]] that [[[dr rights personnel file |Agatha]]] had written after her experiments with it. I must say, it really does seem to be capable of some interesting things, although it seems almost as if she omitted certain things. I'll have to talk to her about it at length. Pick her brain about it, so to speak.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of which, I really must speak to [[[dr gears s personnel file |Gears]]] about the [[[scp-914 |clockworks]]] when I next see him. It really does factor in heavily with my little project, and there really isn't an instruction manual besides the experiment logs. I doubt if there's anyone in the world who knows more about that thing than he does.\n\n\n\nMaybe the three of us could have lunch at some point...\n\n\n\n**04/12/2008**\n\n[[[experiment log 158 ag |Subject Zero]]] has taken to following me around. I can't see it, and it doesn't register on any scanners or anything, but I can feel it in a similar way to the way I feel the [[[scp-244-arc |walker]]] in my head. Its strange, because I can feel it observing my thoughts, my feelings, the inner workings of my mind. I'm naked beneath its mental stare, and not just because my hair is only just starting to grow back. I don't like being this vulnerable to anyone, ever, so I've tried to explain to it the idea of personal privacy, but considering its an entity that almost literally has its heart on its sleeve, it's been slow going.\n\n\n\nI chose the subjects today for the project. One of them, who probably had a rough idea of what was going to happen, spat in the face of guard escorting them, calling him a freak, a monster for doing this to them, that the only difference between us and them is that they were caught. While it was physically directed at the guard, I can't help but feel that it was truly directed towards me. It's another one of those small reminders that I'm using people, rather than lab animals. Just another damn thing I have to repress.\n\n\n\nI managed to have a sit down with Gears today. He was in Bio-Research Area-12 for some reason or the other, I'm not exactly sure why, but the point of the matter is that we got talking. I told him about the project I would be doing, and he clarified how I'd have to use the clockworks. I won't be able to use it in the way I planned. Instead of using each singular organ, I'm going to have to alter the entire subject, then hope I get the result I was looking for... This seems like it might be a little tedious. And expensive in terms of test subjects.\n\n\n\nThe tools are almost done. I'm not sure if it's loyalty, fear, or the fact I paid them extra, but they're really going at it, working flat out to try and get them done by tomorrow. Which is good. Very good. I want this excavation to go as fast and as smoothly as possible. And that should be possible with these tools.\n\n\n\nI'll be utilizing Emma tomorrow if the excavation doesn't get in the way, and the reassembly during the weekend.\n\n\n\n**09/12/2008**\n\nThere was an accident.\n\n\n\nWe never realized how brittle the outer shell was, only noting its hardness. When we started using the advanced tools, a large fragment of it shattered, very violently. Up to four men were hit with it. The system locked down instantly once the alarms went off. \n\n\n\nWithin five minutes, the infection had spread throughout the entirety of the staff interred within the area. Within two hours they had utilized all technology inside for their own purposes. Within five hours they had broken containment and attempted to infect everyone else on site.\n\n\n\nWe had to evacuate the entire site in three hours. That included all SCP. And the infected...\n\n\n\nIt took us three days to lay them down. Three days. Three WHOLE days in which there was no research done, another twenty five people were killed or infected and cost over four million in damages. We're still cleaning up the biomass.\n\n\n\nTo say this was catastrophic is an understatement.\n\n\n\nSo now, because of all this, I have three O5's on my ass, laying the blame for this at //my// feet having lobbied for excavation so much. Not to mention the paperwork for the thing has amassed into a pile so large, it's in danger of becoming its own sub space dimension.\n\n\n\nEverything I've had going has been put on hold. The projects for the entire site have been set back for months, some of them years. The only good thing is the amount of strange bio-tech the infected engineered. If we're lucky, and if I campaign it correctly, I might just get out of this mess better than I started.\n\n\n\n**11/12/2008**\n\n\n\nGah... Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork... I'm drowning in the goddamn stuff, even with the [[[scp-244-arc |walker]]] working around the clock when I sleep. Evaluation reports, incident reports, repair reports, eyewitness interviews, budgets for the Site, letters to employees families, files for possible new employees, the list goes on and on and on. Makes me wish the fellow who invented bureaucracy is burning in hell. Bastard.\n\n\n\nOn top of that I've received word of a [[[scp-4444-j |crazy freak dimension]]] that's opened up to some weird alternate version of this world with the Foundation, only that everything is hideously wrong, and the Foundation is populated by idiots and assholes, where even the D-Class personnel are given guns, and SCPs run rampant. Apparently doctors [[[drclef member page |Clef]]] and [[[dr kondraki s personnel file |Kondraki]]] are exploring it, and the [[[investigation-log-of-scp-4444 |reports]]] they're sending back are both bizarre and frightening.\n\n\n\nI've almost completed the [[[scp 914 |clockworks]]] area of the [[[Olympia Project]]], much to the joy of [[[experiment log 158 ag |Subject Zero]]], (//Who still hasn't chosen a name I might add//). Still, the [[[experiment log 914 theta |processing of raw materials]]] with the clockworks is hard and grueling, involving much time and effort on my part, and the expenditure of more and more, subjects and pieces of equipment. I never thought I'd say this about an experiment session, but I want to finish this one as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n[[[scp 040 |Emily]]] is absolutely in fits at me repeatedly \"blowing her off\". I've tried to explain the complexity of the situation, but you know how children sometimes are. So, in order to appease her (//as well as several other SCPs, raise morale, and just generally lower the number of escape attempts//) I've told her that we would be celebrating Christmas in the facility. Since this is her first year here, and she's never been... //able// to celebrate Christmas in her previous life, and so I told her that this would be a good one. I even told her about [[[scp-2412-j |Santa Claus]]].\n\n\n\nIn reality, I was planning to do this thing anyway, but why not use it to calm a force of nature while I'm at it too, huh?\n\n\n\nThe biomass has //finally// been fully collected from the excavation incident and, although they're trying not to appear it, the higher ups are rather interested in the tech that was recovered. Of course, inter site politics being what they are, I'm going to make it cost them. For the good of humanity of course. Not that some of them would understand what **that** was, even if it bit them on the ass...\n\n\n\n**12/12/2008**\n\nStill on the paperwork. Still no end in sight.\n\n\n\nAt least I got most of the experimentation with the clockworks finished. The machine is interesting, but working with it does take lot out of you. You have to be prepared for everything. That includes running tests for everything. Because sometimes, it'll give you one thing that turns out to be //another//, such as the time one researcher believed he had a device that could reverse time. Instead, it somehow sucked it from the //air//. At least, that's what we think happened, as deduced from the notes we found. Ashes aren't exactly talkative.\n\n\n\nI'm going to start work with Emily tomorrow. She seems happy about it.\n\n\n\nStarted making the preparations for whole \"Christmas\" thing, but with between the mass of paperwork\u00a0\u00a0and the Olympia Project eating all my time, I really only got to devise a gameplan, and even then, it was sketchy at best.\n\n\n\nSubject Zero has been around me twenty four seven, and I have to say, now that I'm getting kinda used to its (//her?//) presence, its not actually that bad. Like having an imaginary friend that's actually real. Apparently it (she?) can feel the thoughts of those around it (her?). Fun stuff, although I think it (she?) may be a bit of a gossip. I've never heard so many things I didn't want to know about my colleagues. Especially those ones about the bread. Coincidentally, I'm not eating in the cafeteria again.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-158", "scp-040", "drclef-member-page", "incident-239-b-clef-kondraki", "olympia-project", "experiment-log-158-ag", "scp-291", "dr-rights-personnel-file", "dr-gears-s-personnel-file", "scp-914", "scp-244-arc", "scp-4444-j", "dr-kondraki-s-personnel-file", "investigation-log-of-scp-4444", "experiment-log-914-theta", "scp-2412-j", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "first-person", "journal", "kain-pathos-crow", "no-dialogue", "olympia", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "1st - 12th December 2008 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/1st-12th-december-2008", "year": 2008}, "agent-ukelele": {"created_at": "2008-12-05T22:57:00", "creator": "DrClef", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-05T22:57:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "Uploaded file \"TRENCH\".", "date": "2008-12-05T22:58:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-05T23:00:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-05T23:01:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-05T23:02:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-05T23:05:00"}, {"author": "Iceberg 7", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iceberg-7", "comment": "Pandora's box is Omega seven, not nine.", "date": "2008-12-06T00:53:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "sp", "date": "2010-05-23T00:12:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

She wasn't happy about that.</em></p>\n<p><em>But she improved towards the end of the session, although she still couldn't firmly nail down the process, often becoming incoherent and unstable while she performed. Still, it's not a worst case scenario. She's performing well for a first try under supervision. Still be a little while before she's able to do anything on the scale I'm hoping. She just needs more practice.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>14/12/2008</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pre-Experiment Note:</strong><br/>\n<em>I think 040 is a little more prepared today, but she still seemed a little anxious.

But for the moment, we'll simply stick to small things.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Post-Experiment Note:</strong><br/>\n<em>Today did go better than yesterday, considerably better than yesterday in fact, but not good enough to progress to the next level of testing. 040 still has trouble with control. Out of the twenty-five times we had her use her abilities, she was only able to give us the results we wanted three times, and it seems that even then, it was more of a fluke than anything else.

It has developed to the point of being a conditioned response. There's also the large amount of repressed memories she has regarding why she feels this anxiety when using these abilities. Apparently, the only lead we have regarding this is either her former guardians or her parents, both of which are now deceased. So, while we figure out how to break that block, we'll try and remove the stigma of using her powers <strong>within limits</strong>, by increasing the windows in which she's allowed to use them.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Post-Experiment Note:</strong><br/>\n<em>The block is still there, which is pretty much making this route of experimentation and training useless. But still, if we break it off so suddenly after her psych test, being as young and emotionally inexperienced as she is, she might think that the reason we stopped was because there was something wrong with her, leading to loss of self-esteem, loneliness, and in general, more emotional baggage, which in turn, lead to more incidents regarding her and her abilities, more stigma, and more to the detriment of everyone involved. So, the experiments are to continue for the time being, but we're going to have to have more psychological probing, and discover what caused this repression.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>18/12/2008</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pre-Experiment Note:</strong><br/>\n<em>Trying to fix the damage to her mind is proving to be difficult.

There were no extreme ill effects aside from increasingly severe headaches from prolonged exposure, although this is merited to the inability of the human mind to comprehend such things.</p>\n<p>When asked what exactly the subject meant by its previous statement, the subject went on to say that it was possible to \"see\" thoughts and the \"lifeforce\" of living organisms. The subject went on to say that he had seen other things which were impossible to explain with words, and that even thinking about them gave him a headache.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Again, interesting, but again, utterly useless to what I'm trying to do.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>Test-5</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caucasian female, twenty-five (25) years of age, five (5) foot three (3) inches in height and one hundred and thirty-seven (137) pounds in weight.

It primarily speaks several cryptic phrases regarding the future of the one who put it together, or in the case of multiple persons, the one who did the majority of the work. The phrases are often so vague, that it is impossible to determine whether or not the suggested future will, or even has already taken place. However, occasionally, it will speak plainly with no doubt as to what it is referring to. In these cases, the action always comes to pass, sometimes as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>\n<p>Once it is done speaking, it will fall apart into the original eighty-one (81) pieces that comprise it.

Subject appeared to be normal until approached by staff. Subject then proceeded to open its thoracic cavity, wrap a large, sinuous tongue around the closest researcher and attempted to pull him inside the cavity, most likely to consume him.</p>\n<p>However, personnel on call in the room were prepared for such an event, and fired several high-dosage tranquilizer darts at the subject, effectively knocking it out. The researcher survived, with no wounds, although it is recommended he see an on site psychologist for counseling.</p>\n<p>Closer examination of the subject revealed that the entire thoracic cavity functioned as one large mouth, with no sign of the internal organs that would normally reside within, with the exception of the alimentary canal, which was capable of expanding several dozen times its original size. The stomach also produced an acid much stronger than anything found in nature.</p>\n<p>The tongue secreted a type of neurotoxin that acted through skin contact, leading to a brief euphoric state, then unconsciousness in the infected.</p>\n<p>The pelvic bones also appeared to be capable of unhinging, most likely to allow excretion to happen easier, due to the possible large size of the subject's intended prey, and to the fact that no facilities for mastication were found within the subject's biology.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Kenneth got off lightly there, but he still freaks out mildly every time he sees a woman with her arms outstretched.

However, preliminary tests revealed that the subject's lymphatic system had been altered greatly.</p>\n<p>The lymph nodes produced a liquid with a much higher cell count than lymph found in normal humans, and contained numerous types of cells not normally seen in nature, let alone humans. These cells appear to be a hybrid of the various defense cells around the body as well as stem cells, with a startlingly high metabolism and motility.</p>\n<p>These cells replace other damaged cells very quickly, leading to highly advanced regeneration, with serious wounds possibly taking days or even hours. This system could possibly slow or even stop the aging process.</p>\n<p>However, as was stated before, these cells have a very high metabolism, leading to a much higher appetite in the subject.

Crow:</strong></p>\n<p>After review of the current testing situation, the following observations may be helpful to your endeavors.</p>\n<p>After extended time spent in research on and with SCP-914, the following proposal regarding its nature may be made with a significant degree of certainty: SCP-914 was not designed as an industrial device. Nor was it primarily a scientific device. Its primary function appears to be as a form of entertainment. After review of the recovery notes, and evaluation of the test logs, it appears that SCP-914 was designed to create the most \u201cnovel\u201d items possible, with no regard for practicality or function.</p>\n<p>Judging by this, it appears the best way to achieve a desired result is to try and exclude as many possible outcomes as possible. When entering a small pile of parts for a clock on a 1:1 setting, you will most likely get a clock. If you enter blocks of wood, glass, and metal, it leaves a wide degree of room for \u201cinterpretation\u201d by SCP-914, with a clock only one of many possible outcomes. If you desire to create a human being with, say, metallic skin, then the best plan would be to create a \u201csuit\u201d of the metal in the exact dimensions of the intended subject, and the same thickness as the subject\u2019s skin. At that point, a setting of 1:1 or Fine may achieve the desired result.</p>\n<p>However, there is a high degree of randomness still associated with SCP-914. Patience must be maintained, as it is not being used for its intended purpose, and thus may frustrate attempts to achieve a desired result. A short review of settings, as well:</p>\n<p><strong>Rough:</strong> Destruction of the item, often by pressure, heat, or cutting.<br/>\n<strong>Coarse:</strong> Disassembly of the item into component parts.<br/>\n<strong>1:1:</strong> Direct integration of multiple items, or \u201cre-interpretation\u201d of singular items.<br/>\n<strong>Fine:</strong> Refinement of items, often with a blending or \u201cre-interpretation\u201d of base states.<br/>\n<strong>Very Fine:</strong> Total \u201cre-interpretation\u201d, often times using only the base compounds of items.</p>\n<p>I hope these notes are useful in your continued research.</p>\n<p>Dr. Gears</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/experiment-log-914-theta\">Experiment Log 914 Theta</a>\" by Kain Pathos Crow, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

P. Crow]]], utilizing [[[SCP-914]]] in obtaining base materials for the \"[[[Olympia Project]]]\".\n\n\n\n**Date:** 05/12/2008\n\n\n\n**Pre-Experiment Note:**\n\n//This is to produce the base materials I need for the project. I had to reassemble the subject that I was originally going to use, because after having a talk with [[[dr gears s personnel file |Dr. Gears]]], I discovered that I would be unable to use the composite part as I had originally intended, and am instead forced to use the entire subject.// - Professor Crow\n\n\n\n+++ Test-1\n\n\n\n**Input:** \n\n* Caucasian female, thirty-six (36) years of age, five (5) foot, ten (10) inches in height, one hundred and forty-nine (149) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health, although there is some mild liver damage from excessive drinking.\n\n\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].\n\n\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nAn organism that appeared to be a young tree sapling weighing one hundred and fifty-nine (159) pounds, the bark being a pale gray color, and the leaves dark brown. Organism maintained an average constant external temperature of thirty seven (37) degrees.\n\n\n\nOrganism has a limited motor nervous system, although there appears to be no true central nervous system. Tissue samples extracted from the main trunk, branches and leaves show that the internal tissue of the trunk is similar to brain tissue, only restructured to be much more durable, and with a higher level of conductivity, whereas branches had traces similar to muscle tissue. The leaves contained a high amount of trichome hairs, which were much longer and thicker than average, being near an inch in length, and a light brown in color. Further examination showed them to be composed primarily of keratin. \n\n\n\nOrganism responded much more slowly to external stimuli than most organisms, taking three hours to register the tissue harvesting done to its main trunk.\n\n\n\nSubject has also shown limited signs of sentience, although communication is difficult, due to the slow reaction and movement times of the subject.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //While the subject is indeed interesting, and does warrant further examination, it's not what I was looking for. Inter her outside, near the grove, and make sure she's well looked after.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-2\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Asian female, twenty-nine (29) years in age, five (5) foot, three (3) inches in height, one hundred and twenty-seven (127) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\n* A solid ten (10) pound block of various compounds that are mainly found within the human body.\n\n\n\n* Human female with vaguely Asian features, with the same proportions and weight as the input subject. Skin is light gray, and hair has changed to a slightly translucent pink, similar to the leaves of SCP-143.\n\n\n\nPhysiology remains mostly the same, although subjects skin has displayed distinct photosynthetic qualities, and tissue has the same basic material properties as SCP-143.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //This is more along the lines of what I was looking for. Hopefully, the rest of the tests will go similarly to this one.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-3\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Black female, thirty-two (32) years of age, six (6) foot in height, one hundred and seventy-one (171) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]].\n\n\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nA solid statue of the subject composed of a combination of SCP-148 and a variety of compounds found in the human body, weighing one hundred and eighty-one (181) pounds and having the same dimensions as the subject before hand. No life signs.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** //Great,// another //lawn ornament. Complete, and total, failure.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-4\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, thirty-three (33) years of age, five (5) foot, four (4) inches in height, one hundred and thirty-five (135) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. Mild damage to lungs due to excessive smoking.\n\n\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]]\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nA large spherical object weighing one hundred and forty-five (145) pounds in weight, and one (1) foot in diameter. Object is highly ornate, with raised patterns on the surface, which through further investigation appear to be made of bone. The rest of the exterior is a compound composed partially of SCP-148 and iron, with trace samples of other elements found within the human body.\n\n\n\nObject is slightly warm, being twenty-five (25) degrees Celsius on the surface. When a subject is in close physical proximity to the object, subject is capable of seeing \"beyond the normal human spectrum of reality\" as stated by one subject. This ability increases exponentially when in physical contact with the object. There were no extreme ill effects aside from increasingly severe headaches from prolonged exposure, although this is merited to the inability of the human mind to comprehend such things.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what exactly the subject meant by its previous statement, the subject went on to say that it was possible to \"see\" thoughts and the \"lifeforce\" of living organisms. The subject went on to say that he had seen other things which were impossible to explain with words, and that even thinking about them gave him a headache.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //Again, interesting, but again, utterly useless to what I'm trying to do.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-5\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, twenty-five (25) years of age, five (5) foot three (3) inches in height and one hundred and thirty-seven (137) pounds in weight. Subject is in exceptionally good health. The subject had been a long distance runner before her incarceration.\n\n\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]].\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nHuman female, one hundred and forty-seven (147) pounds in weight, with the same dimensions as the original subject. Skin has taken on a lightly greenish pallor and has hardened considerably, yet remains somewhat malleable. Tissue has become denser, leading to an increase in physical resilience. It is expected that subject will be resilient to mental attacks and probing as well.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** //That's better. That's more along the lines of what I'm looking for.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-6\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Asian female, twenty (20) years of age, five (5) foot six (6) inches and one hundred and forty-two (142) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nSixty-four (64) arthropods, one (1) foot in size, similar to beetles in appearance. Subjects all possessed a molded metal human face on their underside, which resembled the original subject. Subjects' shells appeared to be made of a substance similar to glass, allowing their internal workings to be viewed easily. Close examination of the subjects revealed that they were composed of a hybrid of powerful circuitry and high-density crystal.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //That... was just kinda weird.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-7\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, thirty-five (35) years of age, five (5) foot nine (9) inches in height and one hundred and fifty-three (153) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. Subject has had a hysterectomy, though that has no effect on her overall health.\n\n\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nEighty-one (81) various objects primarily composed of metal and glass, all capable of fitting together to form a large statue or mannequin of a human female of the same dimensions and features as the original subject.\n\n\n\nWhen the subject is completely and correctly put together, it will take on a limited semblance of life and begin to speak. It primarily speaks several cryptic phrases regarding the future of the one who put it together, or in the case of multiple persons, the one who did the majority of the work. The phrases are often so vague, that it is impossible to determine whether or not the suggested future will, or even has already taken place. However, occasionally, it will speak plainly with no doubt as to what it is referring to. In these cases, the action always comes to pass, sometimes as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\n\nOnce it is done speaking, it will fall apart into the original eighty-one (81) pieces that comprise it. This can be done a limitless amount of times, with no unforeseen side effects, nor does the device ever repeat itself.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** //A giant jigsaw puzzle that tells the future... Well that's a new one.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-8\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, forty-eight (48) years of age, four (4) foot ten (10) and one hundred and thirteen (113) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nA large, electronic device in the shape of the original subject. It appears to be a multicore supercomputer, although this needs to be confirmed. There are several dozen entry points on the back, corresponding to most cables that could or would need to be attached to a computer of this magnitude, as well as several that do not correspond to anything on record. Further research on object is pending.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //Hmmm.... Close, but wrong side of the line.//\n\n\n\n**11/12/2008**\n\n\n\n+++ Test-9\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Black female, thirty-seven (37) years of age, five (5) foot seven (7) inches and one hundred and fifty-one (151) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\n* A large block of \"waste\" material, weighing six thousand, four hundred and twenty-eight (6,428) pounds, and composed primarily of metal, glass, plastic, rubber and traces of human tissue.\n\n\n\n* Human female, with exact same dimensions as the original subject. However, x-rays and scans of subjects skull has revealed that the brain has now been hybridized with a large amount of electronics on a cellular level, leading to a startling jump in intelligence, multitasking, logic, and memorization capabilities, as well as leading to a higher level of coordination in regards to movement.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** //Ha ha! It worked this time!//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-10\n\n\n\n**Input:** \n\n* Caucasian female, twenty-five (25) years of age, five (5) foot, seven (7) inches in height, and one hundred and thirty-nine (139) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n\n\n* One (1) pill of [[[SCP-500]]]\n\n\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nOne human female of the same dimensions as the original subject. Subject appeared to be normal until approached by staff. Subject then proceeded to open its thoracic cavity, wrap a large, sinuous tongue around the closest researcher and attempted to pull him inside the cavity, most likely to consume him. \n\n\n\nHowever, personnel on call in the room were prepared for such an event, and fired several high-dosage tranquilizer darts at the subject, effectively knocking it out. The researcher survived, with no wounds, although it is recommended he see an on site psychologist for counseling.\n\n\n\nCloser examination of the subject revealed that the entire thoracic cavity functioned as one large mouth, with no sign of the internal organs that would normally reside within, with the exception of the alimentary canal, which was capable of expanding several dozen times its original size. The stomach also produced an acid much stronger than anything found in nature.\n\n\n\nThe tongue secreted a type of neurotoxin that acted through skin contact, leading to a brief euphoric state, then unconsciousness in the infected.\n\n\n\nThe pelvic bones also appeared to be capable of unhinging, most likely to allow excretion to happen easier, due to the possible large size of the subject's intended prey, and to the fact that no facilities for mastication were found within the subject's biology.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //Kenneth got off lightly there, but he still freaks out mildly every time he sees a woman with her arms outstretched. We'll keep the specimen for research. Although... this is not what I was originally hoping for, I think I may use the canal...//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-11\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, thirty (30) years of age, five (5) foot eleven (11) inches in height, and one hundred and fifty (150) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. Mild damage to lungs through excessive smoking.\n\n\n\n* One (1) pill of [[[SCP-500]]]\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nHuman female with the exact same dimensions as the original subject. Subject appeared to be exactly the same as before. However, preliminary tests revealed that the subject's lymphatic system had been altered greatly.\n\n\n\nThe lymph nodes produced a liquid with a much higher cell count than lymph found in normal humans, and contained numerous types of cells not normally seen in nature, let alone humans. These cells appear to be a hybrid of the various defense cells around the body as well as stem cells, with a startlingly high metabolism and motility.\n\n\n\nThese cells replace other damaged cells very quickly, leading to highly advanced regeneration, with serious wounds possibly taking days or even hours. This system could possibly slow or even stop the aging process.\n\n\n\nHowever, as was stated before, these cells have a very high metabolism, leading to a much higher appetite in the subject. After damage, this could increase exponentially.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** //Wow. Well that one went very good. Very good indeed. Makes me almost want one of those for myself...//\n\n\n\n**12/12/2008**\n\n\n\n+++ Test-12\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, twenty-eight (28) years of age, six (6) foot, one (1) inch in height, and one hundred and fifty-five (155) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major health issues.\n\n\n\n* One (1) BASLER L304KC 4080 pixel Trilinear line scan camera.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\n* A large block of \"waste\" material, composed primarily of human tissue, with trace amounts of metal, plastic, rubber and glass, weighing two hundred and three (203) pounds.\n\n\n\n* A small, silver ring, highly ornate, with a large group of miniature human-like eyes clumped together in an ornate clasp on one side of the band. Eyes capable of rotating within clasp to \"look\" around.\n\n\n\nWearing the ring allows the wearer to view everything around themselves, including behind themselves, behind objects around them, and inside objects, including themselves, for the range of their line of sight. However, it has the notable side effect of giving the wearer a severe pain behind the eyes, similar to an extreme case of eyestrain.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** //If it weren't for the pain, this thing could be quite useful. Also, it was interesting to note that the ring didn't actually increase eyesight. When Jim had his glasses off while wearing the thing, everything was still all blurry. Good to know.//\n\n\n\n+++ Test-13\n\n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Caucasian female, twenty-one (21) years of age, five (5) foot three (3) inches in height, and one hundred and forty-four (144) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major health issues.\n\n\n\n* One (1) BASLER L304KC 4080 pixel Trilinear line scan camera.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n\nAn organism that resembles a large tripod-mounted video camera, with electronic output leads and monitor at the rear. Object is alive, and made primarily of organic compounds, even the monitor, which appears to be made of tissue similar to ocular tissue, only saturated with highly advanced chromatophore pigmentation cells. The picture it displays is very clear and smooth, on par with many high-definition screens available on market now. The \"lens\" of the \"camera\" is a human eye, although shows hybridization with various mechanical elements.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that it possesses the needed skeletal and muscular structure for locomotion, it does not appear to be sentient in any way. Scans of the torso/main body have shown that there is no brain, with the exception of a highly developed brain stem at the base of the neck/tripod.\n\n\n\n**Note:** //You know, I think that's enough of these for the moment. But I can use that eye.//\n\n------\n\n**Memo to Prof. K. P.

Clef</a> made the following recommendation on the log re: <a href=\"/scp-239\">SCP-239</a></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>My analysis of the situation has led me to the conclusion that SCP-239 is an unacceptable containment and security risk. Although several proposals have been made re: using her for containing other SCPs, the example of <a href=\"/scp-953\">SCP-953</a> and others must serve as a stark reminder of the risks of overestimating the Foundation's ability to control SCPs with reality-altering powers.</em></p>\n<p><em>I would therefore like to make the following proposal: a dagger will be constructed of <a href=\"/scp-148\">SCP-148</a>, capable of penetrating SCP-239's otherwise invincible skin. This weapon will be used to terminate SCP-239 while she is asleep and her powers are neutralized. Because of the danger of SCP-239 awakening and resisting termination, it is my recommendation that the selected operative carry <a href=\"/scp-668\">SCP-668</a> as well, in order to minimize complications.</em></p>\n<p><em>One of the dangers of this procedure is the possibility that SCP-239 will awaken and perceive the operative as a friend or \"good person,\" thus changing reality to match. It is for this reason that I would like to volunteer to carry out the procedure personally. A review of my personnel file should indicate that my [DATA EXPUNGED] should allow me to carry out the operation even after a reality shift of this nature.</em></p>\n<p><em>- Clef</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Unfortunately, Dr. Clef made the error of transmitting his proposal</em> en clair <em>instead of through secured channels. Knowledge of his plan of action reached several staff members at Site-17. As documented under Incident Report 239-A, SCP-239 had formed bonds with several staff members at Site-17. Whether motivated by ordinary sympathy or, as Clef predicted, due to SCP-239's reality-altering abilities causing those on site to be perceived as friends, several staff members were motivated to take action to prevent Dr. Clef from carrying out his proposed plan of action: in particular, <a href=\"/dr-kondraki-s-personnel-file\">Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Kondraki</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Evidence relating to the resulting incident is, unfortunately, incomplete and unclear at best.

I also declare that I am a liar. Which part of my prior statement is a lie I will leave for the historians and you post-incident investigators to puzzle over. Perhaps I was lying that I am a liar. There's an infinite feedback loop to crash your brains.</p>\n<p>I believe that I have tipped my hand too far, and the time to act is now. If my suspicions are confirmed, and the staff of Site-17 have been compromised, it is only a matter of time before someone there informs 239 of my plan of action. After that, it's impossible to tell what may result. My unique character flaws may help to protect me from any resulting reality shifts, but a CK-Class restructuring is still a CK-Class restructuring. All things considered, I like the world as it is.</p>\n<p>I have constructed several weapons out of telekill alloy in the short time I had to prepare: they should provide me with a variety of kill options at varying ranges. Incidentally, I am disappointed in the other members of the Foundation at their lack of initiative: knowing of a highly dangerous Keter-class SCP's vulnerability, they nonetheless refused to neutralize it. Perhaps this is a result of the SCP's reality-altering powers, or perhaps it is simple sentimentality towards a dangerous weapon that takes the form of a small child. Probably the latter. My \"colleagues\" do have a distressing tendency to show unwarranted leniency towards highly destructive humanoid Keter-class SCPs.</p>\n<p>Hypothesis: if an enemy wished to destroy the Foundation, all they would need is ten nuclear weapons in the kiloton range, disguised as Girl Scouts.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in securing the Genovese Blade before leaving Site-19, which means that I will be unable to use it to bypass base security. However, my outside contacts have provided me with a variety of technological surrogates which may suffice. In addition, my personal digital assistant has been linked to my ocular and aural implants. In the event of a mission abort or failure, all data regarding this mission shall be immediately transmitted to the GOC, all O5-level Foundation personnel, the FBI's Unusual Incidents Unit, and \u2588\u2588\u2588. In the event of personal life sign termination, the Clef unit at the GOC (Treble) is to execute Procedure Pizzicato (Planetary Sterilization).</p>\n<p>By the way, I'd like to remind everyone reading this log at Post-Incident Investigation (Hi there, Mel!) that I am a liar and there is no Clef unit at the GOC, no Procedure Pizzicato, and no data dump to be carried out in the event of my death. Probably not. Maybe. There's a good chance of it.</p>\n<p>Arrival in ten minutes.

I walk down a hallway and it turns into a dead end, which explodes into a shower of light. None of the signs lead where they should. None of the walls point where they should go.

Never take the initiative.</p>\n<p>Even when death is staring you straight in the face.</p>\n<p>But I can act, Konny. I can always act. That's why your silly little game can't stop me. Why your silly little butterflies and illusions and parlor tricks will never suffice. Because Gautama was wrong. Not everything is an illusion, and not all illusions are indistinguishable from reality.</p>\n<p>For instance, what will happen when I release an elemental spirit of wood from its containment? Well, of course, the entire facility will go into biohazard lockdown. No one gets out. So that little monster is going to be trapped in here with me.

We had determined that several sections could be retrofitted to be modular.

We had heard an alarm go off, but no \u201cblack alert\u201d breach warning, so we had continued work. More, I worked while Professor Kain was providing feedback. The P.A. system came on in the lab, and site command said Dr. Clef was attempting to terminate <a href=\"/scp-239\">SCP-239</a> without approval, and had caused several containment breaches, in addition to harming other personnel, notably Dr. Kondraki.

The new module was still attached, and the professor expressed anticipation in regards to using the cannon to disable Dr. Clef. I advised caution; however Professor Kain was already leaving, and may not have heard me.</p>\n<p>&lt;O5-\u2588&gt;: You didn\u2019t go with him?</p>\n<p>&lt;Dr. Gears&gt;: I doubt I would have been able to render much help. Professor Kain is a brilliant man, in the body of a dog, in a large mechanical combat device derived from several SCP.

Although several proposals have been made re: using her for containing other SCPs, the example of [[[SCP-953]]] and others must serve as a stark reminder of the risks of overestimating the Foundation's ability to control SCPs with reality-altering powers.//\n\n> \n\n> //I would therefore like to make the following proposal: a dagger will be constructed of [[[SCP-148]]], capable of penetrating SCP-239's otherwise invincible skin. This weapon will be used to terminate SCP-239 while she is asleep and her powers are neutralized. Because of the danger of SCP-239 awakening and resisting termination, it is my recommendation that the selected operative carry [[[SCP-668]]] as well, in order to minimize complications.//\n\n> \n\n> //One of the dangers of this procedure is the possibility that SCP-239 will awaken and perceive the operative as a friend or \"good person,\" thus changing reality to match. It is for this reason that I would like to volunteer to carry out the procedure personally.

Knowledge of his plan of action reached several staff members at Site-17. As documented under Incident Report 239-A, SCP-239 had formed bonds with several staff members at Site-17. Whether motivated by ordinary sympathy or, as Clef predicted, due to SCP-239's reality-altering abilities causing those on site to be perceived as friends, several staff members were motivated to take action to prevent Dr. Clef from carrying out his proposed plan of action: in particular, [[[dr-kondraki-s-personnel-file|Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Kondraki]]].//\n\n\n\n//Evidence relating to the resulting incident is, unfortunately, incomplete and unclear at best.

Clef, SL\u2588**\n\n\n\nI, A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 C\u2588\u2588\u2588, being of sound mind and body, hereby declare that the actions I am about to take are mine and mine alone, and that I am not acting on the orders of any outside body or official Foundation representative. I also declare that I am a liar. Which part of my prior statement is a lie I will leave for the historians and you post-incident investigators to puzzle over. Perhaps I was lying that I am a liar. There's an infinite feedback loop to crash your brains.\n\n\n\nI believe that I have tipped my hand too far, and the time to act is now. If my suspicions are confirmed, and the staff of Site-17 have been compromised, it is only a matter of time before someone there informs 239 of my plan of action. After that, it's impossible to tell what may result. My unique character flaws may help to protect me from any resulting reality shifts, but a CK-Class restructuring is still a CK-Class restructuring. All things considered, I like the world as it is.\n\n\n\nI have constructed several weapons out of telekill alloy in the short time I had to prepare: they should provide me with a variety of kill options at varying ranges. Incidentally, I am disappointed in the other members of the Foundation at their lack of initiative: knowing of a highly dangerous Keter-class SCP's vulnerability, they nonetheless refused to neutralize it. Perhaps this is a result of the SCP's reality-altering powers, or perhaps it is simple sentimentality towards a dangerous weapon that takes the form of a small child. Probably the latter. My \"colleagues\" do have a distressing tendency to show unwarranted leniency towards highly destructive humanoid Keter-class SCPs.\n\n\n\nHypothesis: if an enemy wished to destroy the Foundation, all they would need is ten nuclear weapons in the kiloton range, disguised as Girl Scouts.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I was unsuccessful in securing the Genovese Blade before leaving Site-19, which means that I will be unable to use it to bypass base security.

That nothing that exists is real.\u00a0\u00a0You've driven it home for me.\n\n\n\nDamn butterflies all over the place. Nothing is real, nothing exists. All is illusion. I walk down a hallway and it turns into a dead end, which explodes into a shower of light. None of the signs lead where they should. None of the walls point where they should go. For all I know, you've gotten the little monster out of the facility already.\n\n\n\nExcept for one very interesting fact.\n\n\n\nHave you ever wondered why women instinctively recoil from me, Konny? Have you ever wondered why I was able to get into 91's pen and let her out, or why 166 and I get along so well? Have you ever wondered why I never talk to 105?\n\n\n\nIf you knew who I was, you'd understand.\n\n\n\nBut then, if you bastards knew who I was, I'd be another specimen in your collection. Another number to catalogue and store and contain.\n\n\n\nBecause that's what you do, right? You catalogue, store, and contain, and watch and watch and watch. Never act. Never move. Never take the initiative.\n\n\n\nEven when death is staring you straight in the face.\n\n\n\nBut I can act, Konny. I can always act. That's why your silly little game can't stop me. Why your silly little butterflies and illusions and parlor tricks will never suffice. Because Gautama was wrong. Not everything is an illusion, and not all illusions are indistinguishable from reality.\n\n\n\nFor instance, what will happen when I release an elemental spirit of wood from its containment? Well, of course, the entire facility will go into biohazard lockdown. No one gets out. So that little monster is going to be trapped in here with me. No way for you quislings to let her out into the world to destroy us all. Perhaps you think that's all I'm going for.\n\n\n\nHere's a little hint, buddy.

We had determined that several sections could be retrofitted to be modular. We were working on a new crystal-powered cannon module when site command gave us the order to respond.\n\n\n\n<O5-\u2588>: Did you have any prior knowledge of what was going on?\n\n\n\n<Dr. Gears>: Somewhat. We had heard an alarm go off, but no \u201cblack alert\u201d breach warning, so we had continued work. More, I worked while Professor Kain was providing feedback. The P.A. system came on in the lab, and site command said Dr. Clef was attempting to terminate [[[SCP-239]]] without approval, and had caused several containment breaches, in addition to harming other personnel, notably Dr. Kondraki.

The new module was still attached, and the professor expressed anticipation in regards to using the cannon to disable Dr. Clef.

When unscrewed and detached from the main apparatus, the mono-pod of the device acted as a sheath for a straight blade saber of exceptional quality. The make and composition of the blade is still under investigation, but unlike [[[scp-515-arc | SCP-515-ARC]]], this one doesn't require SCP classification. At first, a connection to [[[SCP-108]]] had been presumed, due to the skill with which Dr. Kondraki wielded the blade, but further investigation has revealed that he has more than a simple passing interest in fencing.

I caused the breach of SCP for 239; however I did so in a way allowing for the re-instatement of SCP. I did not just tell her to do what I asked, thereby calling into question the current \u201cWitch-child\u201d control strategy. I used what resources I had available to extend the control strategy, and affect the end of hostilities initiated by Dr. Clef. SCP-239 remains unaware of the full extent of her abilities, only that they may be augmented by \u201cOver Counsel Wizards\u201d and their \u201cemergency spell books\u201d.\n\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588>: \u2026what the hell are you talking about?\n\n\n\n<Dr. Gears>: Dr. Clef had been attacked by the Great Darkness, a mass of formless evil that reached into our world. It had taken over Dr. Clef, and left only a few witches and wizards with any magic left. I, as an Over Council Wizard, was dispatched, along with the swordsman Kondraki, to subdue Clef and drive the evil from him. Working together, SCP-239 and I would be able to use an Emergency Spell book, which can only be used by two wizards at the same time, and only when the Great Darkness is around.\n\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588>: \u2026And she believed you?\n\n\n\n<Dr. Gears>: Sir, with all due respect, she\u2019s eight.

I never expected\u2026 well, this.</p>\n<p>This job is a nightmare. I haven't seen my family in months. I sleep down the hall from a field agent who has a giant gear sticking out of his neck after a bad run-in with some nano-agent. Thirty minutes ago, a guy ran in and told me to grab a mop: someone decided to feed the seven-legged dog a bit of cheese, and the stink is horrific. Sometimes I wonder whether I'm dead and in hell.</p>\n<p>No, hell would be too sane compared to this madness.</p>\n<p>At least I don't have to deal directly with any of the SCPs: my job is monitoring staff on site for signs of fatigue and PTSD, and I'm telling you, that's a full-time job. When your nine-to-five is trying to keep Things That Should Not Be from getting out and killing everyone with some mind-bending bizarro power, you tend to get a bit edgy. Had a patient the other day tried to put a knife through the back of his own hand: he'd been working around some thing that apparently gets into your bloodstream and eats you from the inside. He'd been getting less than four hours of sleep a night, and apparently got so messed up he got hallucinations, started thinking he'd been infected even though he checked out clean. Had to knock him out and keep him strapped to a bed overnight while he finally got some rest. Then he jumped back in and went back to his job like nothing happened. Insane.</p>\n<p>It's better than what \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has to do, though. He's trying to build a psychological profile of some freak bastard who apparently can't die and can make swords out of thin air. Yeah, just like that. Seriously, what is with this place? It's like some sort of insane story dreamed up by a fevered madman. My god.</p>\n<p>Gonna try and get some sleep now. Hopefully I'll manage to do so without those freaky rolling eye things running in and staring at me all night.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 11, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>So I walk in this morning, and Dr. Franks tells me that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is dead, and now I'm in charge of his project. Joy.</p>\n<p>Spent the day going over the file on this <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a>. My god, it's worse than I thought. This guy is not only a complete psychopath, he's got all the powers of some freakish adolescent fantasy. How the hell am I supposed to analyze someone who doesn't like to be analyzed and can kill an elephant with his bare hands?</p>\n<p>This is gonna take a little finessing. I've got an idea, though.</p>\n<p>I met Josie the Half-Cat today. I petted her and she rubbed up against my leg. Weirdest feeling having a cat rub hindquarters that aren't there against your shin.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 12, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>My idea worked. TOO well.</p>\n<p>I thought I'd gain some rapport with 076 by chatting with him over a game or something, something to break the ice. As a warrior type, I thought he might enjoy a board game, something that needs strategy. I chose Stratego, since I've never been a fan of chess, and I've never really enjoyed Go or checkers. He seemed amiable enough, although he kept staring at me hard the whole time I was explaining the rules.</p>\n<p>Tried to break the ice and get him to talk more about himself between turns. Didn't work. He was totally engrossed in the game, trying to break apart my strategy. After a while, he got me doing it too. I'd intended to let him win, but about nine turns in, I realized that he was using a really simple tactic: he'd taken his Marshal and was using it to beat down everything by itself, carving a giant swath of destruction in my ranks. I managed to lure him into attacking my Bomb, blew up his Marshal. He then sent his Miners in to take out my Flag, but it wasn't there: I'd used the Bombs as a lure to draw him away from my left, where my Scouts and Miners were. His Flag wasn't too hard to find, and then my Scout ran in and captured it for the win, behind a screen of Miners who disabled his Bombs.</p>\n<p>He got really quiet, and I thought he was going to get mad, but then he smiled. \"Congratulations,\" he said, shaking my hand (my fingers still hurt even two hours later). \"You are in.\"</p>\n<p>\"In what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Task Force Omega-7. You defeated me in a battle of wits and honor, and now you are one of my chosen elite.\"</p>\n<p>That wasn't what I'd planned at all. \"I hadn't intended to join your group. I'm a scholar, not a warrior.\"</p>\n<p>\"Now you are both.\" He clapped my shoulder so hard it bruised and walked away.</p>\n<p>I tried to get out of it with the section chief. He refused to allow it. \"You've got a perfect chance to do a psych profile on Seventy Six,\" he said. \"You'll be around him day and night. A perfect chance for long-term observation.\"</p>\n<p>So ummmm\u2026 yeah. Tomorrow I'm checking in for basic training with a bunch of freaks and maniacs who hang around with a completely indestructable killing machine and go straight into the most dangerous situations the Foundation encounters with the intent of kicking its ass. Me, a desk jockey geek with a Masters in Psychology. I guess I could transfer out, but given SCP-076's history of behavior around people he considers weak, that might be career suicide. Or even actual suicide.</p>\n<p>I'm so gonna die.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 27, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>I'm not dead yet.</p>\n<p>My first day of training, however, I wished I was. I shoulda known something was wrong when I showed up and saw about \u2588\u2588 guys (and a few girls) standing around wearing tiny shorts and tank tops: none of them seemed to have an ounce of fat on their bodies, and a couple looked like they could beat the fuck out of Arnold Schwartze\u2026 shwan\u2026 the Governator\u2026 in a no-holds barred brawl. And that's when I show up with my slight beer belly and wire-frame glasses and milquetoast smile, and everyone turns and looks at me like I'm something rather nasty that the dog just did on the carpet.</p>\n<p>Seventy Six started them off with a five mile run, ran along next to the group\u2026 I should say jogged along\u2026 hitting the slowest guy with a rattan stick the whole time to encourage him to run faster. I've still got the welts. By the time it was over, I was nearly passed out on my feet, and then Seventy Six started having us do pushups and pullups and other exercises that I'm convinced were originally developed by the Spanish Inquisition to deal with particularly stubborn heretics.</p>\n<p>So I went to bed hurting in places I didn't know I hurt, but if I thought that was pain, I was in for a treat. The next day, Seventy Six started me on some Israeli martial art called \"Krav Maga,\" which I'm convinced is Hebrew for \"Kill the Fucking Goyim,\" no matter what Wikipedia tells me. The highlight of that day's training was running the fuck away after B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 decided to pick up a fucking ROCK and chase me with it. I think I actually pissed myself.</p>\n<p>The next day was actually worse.</p>\n<p>This is the first chance I've had to write in my diary for a long time: I've just been too exhausted to do more than pass out every chance I get. But Seventy Six told me to take the weekend off. I slept the first thirty hours of it, and god, was it worth it.</p>\n<p>He tells me that tomorrow is my final exam. I don't know what that's gonna be like. I'm not looking forward to it at all.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 28, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>I wash and I wash, but I can't seem to get it out.</p>\n<p>Seventy Six met me alone outside the testing chamber. I was a bit surprised to find any of the members of Omega Seven weren't there. \"The last test you take alone,\" Seventy Six said.</p>\n<p>He walked me into the room, and there was a guy tied to a chair: Class D Personnel from the looks of his jumpsuit. The entire room was very clean. Tiled floor, tiled walls, sprinklers in the ceiling, a big drain in the center. There was a tray of surgical instruments next to him.</p>\n<p>\"Pick up one of the blades, any one,\" Seventy Six told me, \"and start cutting.\"</p>\n<p>I started cutting the ropes. Seventy Six hit me in the face. \"No. Start CUTTING.\"</p>\n<p>I dropped the scalpel. \"I can't.\"</p>\n<p>He reached into his shadows and pulled out\u2026 it was long, and it had a lot of hooks and saw edges and ripping blades to it, whatever it was. \"You will. Or I will tire of this entertainment and find some elsewhere. Probably by killing as many of your people as possible, saving you for last, so that you will see them all die.\"</p>\n<p>I didn't answer. He looked at me for a long long while. Then he went to the door.</p>\n<p>I think I screamed when I grabbed the knife and stabbed it into the guy. I'm pretty sure I did, because I tasted pennies, which means I'm pretty sure that some of the poor bastard's blood got in my mouth\u2026 Seventy Six smiled at that and turned around. \"Good,\" he said. \"Now use the hook to pull out his eyes.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026 I don't think I can say any more, but\u2026 he screamed the whole time, and by the time it was done, I was gone. Stupid of me, I should have seen it coming. Break down my defenses, make me pliable to commands, classic example of mental reprogramming. I learned this in freshman year at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for crying out loud, but I fell for it.</p>\n<p>He didn't seem pleased. He told me that I needed to get used to killing. He told me to go down to the labs every day, choose a cat or a monkey or a dog - no rats or mice - and kill one every day. Vivisect it alive. Really let myself feel the blood spurt. Said I needed to put aside my weaknesses. Learn to become harder. Stronger.</p>\n<p>A monster, that's what he wants me to become. A sociopath. Just like him. No empathy, no guilt, no feelings other than fear and anger. A monster.</p>\n<p>I won't let him beat me.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 31, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Happy Halloween.</p>\n<p>I was in the lab doing a live dissection of a rhesus monkey when B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 knocked on the door. \"Meet up in the deployment bay in fifteen,\" she said. \"We've got a mission.\"</p>\n<p>I gave the screaming monkey a lethal injection of adrenaline into its heart: it wasn't hard, given the fact that I'd already cracked the ribcage and laid the organ open. B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 seemed a bit sympathetic as she waited for me to wash the blood off my apron. \"We've got an active SCP somewhere in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 area,\" she said. \"Seems dormant, but Command believes it could go active at any moment. Keter-class.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's our cover story?\" I asked.</p>\n<p>\"We don't need one,\" she said, tossing me a towel. \"It's Halloween.\"</p>\n<p>The others were suited up by the time I reached the staging area, and we really did look like freaks.

End result is it makes you look like a super-soldier out of some videogame, all bulked up and scary-looking with a giant gun that M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wouldn't mind using against some L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Seventy Six just wore his usual outfit, of course, which was scary enough.</p>\n<p>That was the first time I met Iris, too: She was the only other one who wasn't wearing a uniform, was in fact dressed up like a video game character (whom I later found out was J\u2588\u2588\u2588 from \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\") She had this big camera around her neck and she was wearing a very sensible leather jacket and pants. When I saw her, she was arranging some polaroid pictures in various pockets around her vest and pants. \"In case I need them\" she said.</p>\n<p>We piled into two vans and drove down to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Fun times. A lot of young people standing around wearing fancy costumes and generally having a great time in a giant three-block outdoor party. We got a lot of attention, and even posed for a few pictures <em>[REVIEWER'S NOTE: Upon Covert insertion and review of photographs, it has been determined that no essential data has leaked. Termination order for civilian bystanders cancelled]</em>. We moved fast, though: our guy on-site was waiting for us, and Seventy Six looked like he was going to snap and kill some poor drunk valley-girl dressed up like L\u2588\u2588\u2588 C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who wouldn't stop trying to hit on the tall, brooding, strong goth guy with the realistic-looking prop sword.</p>\n<p>The target was in the sewers underneath the party: SCP operatives had managed to trap it in a section of the tunnels, but eventually it was going to make a break for it. We met up with our guy on-site, who was guarding the only exit door. Two operatives set up claymore mines while Iris snapped a picture of the trigger mechanisms. \"If it tries to open the door without me reaching through the photo and flipping the switches, it'll blow itself up,\" she said, sliding the photo into a waterproof bag and slipping it safely into a breast pocket.</p>\n<p>Seventy-Six led one team, the other two were led by W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Iris and I were with Seventy Six in the \"Special Elements\" squad. I stuck close to Seventy-Six before Iris waved me back. \"Don't get too close,\" she said, making a gesture like swinging a sword. \"Sometimes, he swings without checking his blood circle first.\" I took a couple of steps back after that.</p>\n<p>Seventy Six seemed to change the moment we went into the danger area: he leaned forward, like a panther, sniffing the air and smiling as he ran a finger along the slick, moldy brick wall. I wasn't so happy. I was in a big, bulky suit that cut down my vision to the sides and back, hearing the sound of my own breathing and the pounding of my own heart. The flashlight didn't light up the darkness enough, and my night vision didn't help either: just made things even spookier with its grainy green appearance.</p>\n<p>So when it grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down into the sewage, all I could really do was scream a lot. My helmet was sealed, and I had my own O2 supply that kicked in the moment I got dragged under, so I wasn't in danger of drowning. Choking, yes, the thing's tentacles were grabbing me around the neck and squeezing the life out of me. I had barely enough time to pull the trigger of my gun, feel nothing go off, and realize that I'd forgotten to take it off safety before I blacked out.</p>\n<p>I came to in the van, surrounded by a bunch of guys who were looking really tired and beat-up. There was something huge covered in a tarp and strapped down by bungie cords in the middle of the vehicle, something that looked like a cross between a squid, a bicycle, and an MC Escher painting. Seventy Six was nowhere to be found. \"What happened?\" I managed to croak out.</p>\n<p>\"You got grabbed,\" W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 said. \"Able killed it. He's still down there supervising the burning of the eggs and looking for more of them.\"</p>\n<p>\"I guess I screwed up, huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nah, you did fine.\" He put a cigarette between my lips and lit it with his zippo. \"You lived. That's all we can really ask out of a first-timer.\"</p>\n<p>Cleaning my suit afterwards was a pain: they look kinda like space suits, but they don't put elimination tubes in them, and my bowels did what bowels will do when you get the shit scared out of you (Note to self: consider wearing Depends the next time I go into the field). Seventy Six didn't say a word to me afterwards. No one did. But everyone's thinking it: what the hell am I doing in this group? I'm not a soldier. I can't shoot, I can't fight, all I can do is write stupid papers trying to psychoanalyze that which can't be analyzed by mere psychology.</p>\n<p>So what the hell am I doing here?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 19, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Killed three cats today in the lab. The process seems to be getting easier, which kinda scares me: the screaming and mewling doesn't bother me as much as it used to. Maybe I should try burning them alive, next time. Trying to make myself feel something. Revulsion. Fear. Anger. Self-Loathing. Anything's better than just\u2026 emptiness.</p>\n<p>We did a mission in a quiet little town today. Mining town outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. By the time we got there, though, about half the town was infected: they all had these things growing out of their eye sockets that made them look like they were weeping blood. We tried shooting them, but they just regenerated the damaged parts. We tried using fire, but it just seemed to make the stuff grow faster, made the infected people explode with the force of a hand grenade, scattering spores all over the place: that's how we lost Y\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Tried a few other things: [DATA EXPUNGED] We eventually switched tactics after L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 rolled a VX grenade into an infected house: she'd confused it for an incendiary, as it turned out, but it worked. The nerve gas seemed to react to the infection somehow, kill it cleanly, but it also killed the host as well, made them violently reject the infected body parts: heart, eyes, lungs, liver.</p>\n<p>Able ordered a resupply and regroup. We traded our incendiaries for nerve gas bombs, kind of like roach foggers. The procedure was to cover the buildings with plastic isolation sheets to seal them up, toss in a half-dozen bombs, wait about an hour for the stuff to really permeate, then move in and mop up the leftovers as needed. At least half the casualties were clearly uninfected: civilians who'd holed up in their rooms and apartments waiting to be rescued.</p>\n<p>The elementary school was the worst. There was this one teacher who'd barricaded the doors against the infected, had kept her kindergarten class blissfully ignorant and safe, playing games and listening to music while the monsters roamed around outside. I saw her through the second-story window as I started setting up the covers: she met my eyes, and the look on her face told me she knew what was gonna happen next. I saw her tell her class something, I couldn't tell what, then she walked away from the window.</p>\n<p>I was the first one through that door. There were a dozen five-year olds laying on their little beds, blissfully sleeping: the nerve gas had killed them cleanly and instantly while they napped. The teacher was seated at her desk, sitting upright with her head bowed as if she were just taking a rest. She had a mug in her hand, said something like \"World's Greatest Teacher,\" had a crayon-style drawing of a little girl hugging an older lady in a blue dress. There were tears in her eyes. Could have been condensation from the nerve gas.</p>\n<p>There was an infected on the roof: the gas must not have permeated high enough to completely kill him. He was hacking up his lungs and twitching a bit, but he wasn't dead, could still walk, and he lunged towards me as I moved towards him. I think he might have been a janitor, he was wearing a blue jumpsuit, and his left wrist had a compound fracture with the bone sticking out. I shot him in the head. Then I kicked the hell out of him with my steel-toed boot. His eye fell out after the fifth kick, so I stomped on it. It popped like a grape.</p>\n<p>We were all really quiet coming back, except Able. Seventy Six was his usual cheerful self (sarcasm sarcasm). The rest of us\u2026 well, we're just soldiers, not monsters. Wiping out the town had to be done, and an airstrike would have had too much risk of letting the gas fly downwind, hit \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and kill another ten thousand poor souls. Explosives could have set off a giant chain reaction, spread spores all across half the continent. We did what needed to be done, but we're not required to feel good about it.</p>\n<p>B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 came into the lab a few minutes ago just as I'd started cremating the remains. She looked tired. Asked me if I couldn't sleep either. I realized it was almost 2am. She offered to stay up with me in my room. As soon as I wash the blood off my hands, I might take her up on that.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 24, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Happy Thanksgiving! Back when I lived in the Real World, the most annoying thing about Turkey Day was hearing my dad demand that we all say at least one thing we were thankful for this year. Well. I've got a few things to be thankful for. I'm thankful that I'm not dead. I'm thankful that the world didn't end. I'm thankful that Able didn't decide to kill us all and use our skins to make drum heads. I'm thankful that no one decided to expose the Slime from Hell to any dead bodies. And mostly, I'm thankful for B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the most wonderful girl in the world, who can not only [DATA EXPUNGED], but can also cook a damn fine turkey.</p>\n<p>Bit of a small Thanksgiving, though. Able and Squad One had to deploy at the last minute and were out in the field chasing some giant rust monster that apparently was rampaging around this sugar factory, so it was mostly just me, B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Iris, and whoever else wanted to drop by for a real Thanksgiving dinner instead of the mass-produced stuff the cafeteria prepared. I went around the facility asking if anyone else wanted to drop by and get some turkey. Gathered up a few folks along the way, then headed over to Dr. Franks' office to see if my old boss wanted some food too.</p>\n<p>He was chatting with a rather nice looking guy: possibly Indian or Arabic, was going over the newest field reports from our Mobile Task forces. The guy was just listening and nodding the whole time, stroking the tattoo on his forehead. I asked him if he wanted to come too. \"That's fine,\" he said, smiling. \"We'll be busy for a while. If you would like, however, please bring me a turkey leg later.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a good idea,\" Dr. Franks said. \"And save me a plate. I'll drop by to pick it up once we're finished.\"</p>\n<p>Figured the guy was busy, so after dinner, I made two plates with all the fixings, headed over to Dr. Franks' office. As I got closer, though, I started noticing something funny: the cornbread stuffing was starting to smell bad. By the time I got outside the door, it had rotted through so badly that the mold was starting to spread to the meat as well. I dropped the plates and yelled in surprise, and almost hit the \"Containment Breach\" alarm, before the door opened and the stranger walked out.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, hell,\" he sighed. \"Not again.\"</p>\n<p>So that's how I first met Cain. Decent guy, even if he isn't much of a gardener. Turns out he was just in town for the day to help Dr. Franks back up some files. \"It's best if I'm not around here when Able comes back,\" he said, before he headed back into the helicopter a few hours later. Then he gave me a funny look. \"When the time comes,\" he said, \"Don't hesitate. Do what you must. I'll be fine.\" I'm really not sure what that's supposed to mean.</p>\n<p>Note to self: Whatever \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand cranberry sauce is, it's apparently not made of cranberries: the stuff didn't break down one bit around Cain. Remind me to choose a different brand next year.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 19, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>No, the date is not a typo. Yes, it is four days before my last entry. Damn temporal SCPs.</p>\n<p>I'm spending the next four days in confinement with the rest of my team to make sure that we don't accidentally pollute the timeline. I'm arguing with the security staff that it would be okay to let us out because, you know, time being an infinite loop and all, if I was going to meet with my past self, I would have done it anyway, and the fact that I didn't means that I'm not gonna. They tell me that the fact that I don't remember ever meeting my future self means that I'm gonna stay in confinement, so there's no point arguing about it. Is it too much to ask for just to get a moment's walk out in the sunlight? The damn padded walls are starting to move in on me.</p>\n<p>I don't like this one bit.</p>\n<p>The mission was a success, relatively speaking, I guess. We went into the facility with isolation suits on, to retrieve the artifact. Joint mission with MTF \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\" They took the lead, given that they've had more experience underground than we have. We were just there to lay down the pressure once they met up with the artifact.</p>\n<p>We lost Squad three two minutes later: the members of that squad just suddenly up and died of old age within three minutes of coming into contact with the artifact's holder. Squad two managed to get out a distress signal before dying. Able closed in on the target shortly afterwards: weirdest thing, watching other people growing old and dying around him while he just kept aging away, hair growing longer, fingernails growing longer, but his body just not aging at all\u2026</p>\n<p>&lt;DATA EXPUNGED&gt; had him pinned down under an I-beam, but couldn't reach the artifact because his arm was cut off, and he needed the other one to pin down the monster. I was the closest. Popped open my emergency dose of double-oh six and downed it in one go before running in.</p>\n<p>My hand instantly withered the moment I touched the item. I screamed a bit as the insulation suit rotted around me, but managed to yank it away from Abel and the Morphophage and toss it into the Box. B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 slammed the lid shut and hit the locks, and the entire thing &lt;DATA EXPUNGED&gt;</p>\n<p>So yeah, that's how we wound up here four days before we left. I managed to convince them to let me keep my journal, since it's not really gonna have too many temporal effects once I leave. Also convinced them to issue my past self an emergency ration of double-oh six before he goes. I'm sure he'll be confused about why he needs it. I sure was.</p>\n<p>Iris seems\u2026 I dunno. She's not doing well recently. I'm thinking the stress of the job might be getting to her. Being one of the youngest members of the team can't be easy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 came into the room today and told me that she's been given TDY away from Omega-7. \"Something bad happened to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\" she said. \"I've been asked to talk to her.\"</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

She didn't think so. \"I've never been raped before, A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\" she pointed out. \"How am I supposed to talk to someone who has?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just\u2026 listen. Don't let her blame herself. Let her know no one blames her. And don't let her depersonalize. She might be suffering from some post-traumatic stress. I can find a pamphlet for you on that.\"</p>\n<p>\"How the hell do you know all this stuff?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was a psych before I was a soldier, remember? This used to be my job.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah,\" she said, smiling. \"I forget that sometimes.\"</p>\n<p>\"I do too,\" I said.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Retrieval Mission.

I never expected. . . well, this. \n\n\n\nThis job is a nightmare. I haven't seen my family in months. I sleep down the hall from a field agent who has a giant gear sticking out of his neck after a bad run-in with some nano-agent. Thirty minutes ago, a guy ran in and told me to grab a mop: someone decided to feed the seven-legged dog a bit of cheese, and the stink is horrific. Sometimes I wonder whether I'm dead and in hell.\n\n\n\nNo, hell would be too sane compared to this madness.\n\n\n\nAt least I don't have to deal directly with any of the SCPs: my job is monitoring staff on site for signs of fatigue and PTSD, and I'm telling you, that's a full-time job. When your nine-to-five is trying to keep Things That Should Not Be from getting out and killing everyone with some mind-bending bizarro power, you tend to get a bit edgy. Had a patient the other day tried to put a knife through the back of his own hand: he'd been working around some thing that apparently gets into your bloodstream and eats you from the inside. He'd been getting less than four hours of sleep a night, and apparently got so messed up he got hallucinations, started thinking he'd been infected even though he checked out clean. Had to knock him out and keep him strapped to a bed overnight while he finally got some rest. Then he jumped back in and went back to his job like nothing happened. Insane.\n\n\n\nIt's better than what \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has to do, though. He's trying to build a psychological profile of some freak bastard who apparently can't die and can make swords out of thin air. Yeah, just like that. Seriously, what is with this place? It's like some sort of insane story dreamed up by a fevered madman. My god.\n\n\n\nGonna try and get some sleep now. Hopefully I'll manage to do so without those freaky rolling eye things running in and staring at me all night.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** October 11, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nSo I walk in this morning, and Dr. Franks tells me that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is dead, and now I'm in charge of his project. Joy.\n\n\n\nSpent the day going over the file on this [[[SCP-076]]]. My god, it's worse than I thought. This guy is not only a complete psychopath, he's got all the powers of some freakish adolescent fantasy. How the hell am I supposed to analyze someone who doesn't like to be analyzed and can kill an elephant with his bare hands?\n\n\n\nThis is gonna take a little finessing. I've got an idea, though.\n\n\n\nI met Josie the Half-Cat today. I petted her and she rubbed up against my leg. Weirdest feeling having a cat rub hindquarters that aren't there against your shin.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** October 12, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nMy idea worked. TOO well.\n\n\n\nI thought I'd gain some rapport with 076 by chatting with him over a game or something, something to break the ice. As a warrior type, I thought he might enjoy a board game, something that needs strategy. I chose Stratego, since I've never been a fan of chess, and I've never really enjoyed Go or checkers. He seemed amiable enough, although he kept staring at me hard the whole time I was explaining the rules.\n\n\n\nTried to break the ice and get him to talk more about himself between turns. Didn't work. He was totally engrossed in the game, trying to break apart my strategy. After a while, he got me doing it too. I'd intended to let him win, but about nine turns in, I realized that he was using a really simple tactic: he'd taken his Marshal and was using it to beat down everything by itself, carving a giant swath of destruction in my ranks. I managed to lure him into attacking my Bomb, blew up his Marshal. He then sent his Miners in to take out my Flag, but it wasn't there: I'd used the Bombs as a lure to draw him away from my left, where my Scouts and Miners were. His Flag wasn't too hard to find, and then my Scout ran in and captured it for the win, behind a screen of Miners who disabled his Bombs.\n\n\n\nHe got really quiet, and I thought he was going to get mad, but then he smiled. \"Congratulations,\" he said, shaking my hand (my fingers still hurt even two hours later). \"You are in.\"\n\n\n\n\"In what?\"\n\n\n\n\"Task Force Omega-7. You defeated me in a battle of wits and honor, and now you are one of my chosen elite.\"\n\n\n\nThat wasn't what I'd planned at all. \"I hadn't intended to join your group. I'm a scholar, not a warrior.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now you are both.\" He clapped my shoulder so hard it bruised and walked away.\n\n\n\nI tried to get out of it with the section chief. He refused to allow it. \"You've got a perfect chance to do a psych profile on Seventy Six,\" he said. \"You'll be around him day and night. A perfect chance for long-term observation.\"\n\n\n\nSo ummmm. . . yeah. Tomorrow I'm checking in for basic training with a bunch of freaks and maniacs who hang around with a completely indestructable killing machine and go straight into the most dangerous situations the Foundation encounters with the intent of kicking its ass. Me, a desk jockey geek with a Masters in Psychology. I guess I could transfer out, but given SCP-076's history of behavior around people he considers weak, that might be career suicide. Or even actual suicide.\n\n\n\nI'm so gonna die.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** October 27, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nI'm not dead yet.\n\n\n\nMy first day of training, however, I wished I was. I shoulda known something was wrong when I showed up and saw about \u2588\u2588 guys (and a few girls) standing around wearing tiny shorts and tank tops: none of them seemed to have an ounce of fat on their bodies, and a couple looked like they could beat the fuck out of Arnold Schwartze. . . shwan. . . the Governator. . . in a no-holds barred brawl. And that's when I show up with my slight beer belly and wire-frame glasses and milquetoast smile, and everyone turns and looks at me like I'm something rather nasty that the dog just did on the carpet.\n\n\n\nSeventy Six started them off with a five mile run, ran along next to the group. . . I should say jogged along. . . hitting the slowest guy with a rattan stick the whole time to encourage him to run faster. I've still got the welts. By the time it was over, I was nearly passed out on my feet, and then Seventy Six started having us do pushups and pullups and other exercises that I'm convinced were originally developed by the Spanish Inquisition to deal with particularly stubborn heretics.\n\n\n\nSo I went to bed hurting in places I didn't know I hurt, but if I thought that was pain, I was in for a treat. The next day, Seventy Six started me on some Israeli martial art called \"Krav Maga,\" which I'm convinced is Hebrew for \"Kill the Fucking Goyim,\" no matter what Wikipedia tells me. The highlight of that day's training was running the fuck away after B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 decided to pick up a fucking ROCK and chase me with it. I think I actually pissed myself.\n\n\n\nThe next day was actually worse.\n\n\n\nThis is the first chance I've had to write in my diary for a long time: I've just been too exhausted to do more than pass out every chance I get. But Seventy Six told me to take the weekend off. I slept the first thirty hours of it, and god, was it worth it.\n\n\n\nHe tells me that tomorrow is my final exam. I don't know what that's gonna be like. I'm not looking forward to it at all.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** October 28, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nI wash and I wash, but I can't seem to get it out.\n\n\n\nSeventy Six met me alone outside the testing chamber. I was a bit surprised to find any of the members of Omega Seven weren't there. \"The last test you take alone,\" Seventy Six said.\n\n\n\nHe walked me into the room, and there was a guy tied to a chair: Class D Personnel from the looks of his jumpsuit. The entire room was very clean. Tiled floor, tiled walls, sprinklers in the ceiling, a big drain in the center. There was a tray of surgical instruments next to him.\n\n\n\n\"Pick up one of the blades, any one,\" Seventy Six told me, \"and start cutting.\"\n\n\n\nI started cutting the ropes. Seventy Six hit me in the face. \"No. Start CUTTING.\"\n\n\n\nI dropped the scalpel. \"I can't.\"\n\n\n\nHe reached into his shadows and pulled out. . . it was long, and it had a lot of hooks and saw edges and ripping blades to it, whatever it was. \"You will. Or I will tire of this entertainment and find some elsewhere. Probably by killing as many of your people as possible, saving you for last, so that you will see them all die.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't answer. He looked at me for a long long while. Then he went to the door.\n\n\n\nI think I screamed when I grabbed the knife and stabbed it into the guy. I'm pretty sure I did, because I tasted pennies, which means I'm pretty sure that some of the poor bastard's blood got in my mouth. . . Seventy Six smiled at that and turned around. \"Good,\" he said. \"Now use the hook to pull out his eyes.\"\n\n\n\n. . . I don't think I can say any more, but. . . he screamed the whole time, and by the time it was done, I was gone. Stupid of me, I should have seen it coming. Break down my defenses, make me pliable to commands, classic example of mental reprogramming. I learned this in freshman year at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for crying out loud, but I fell for it.\n\n\n\nHe didn't seem pleased. He told me that I needed to get used to killing. He told me to go down to the labs every day, choose a cat or a monkey or a dog - no rats or mice - and kill one every day. Vivisect it alive. Really let myself feel the blood spurt. Said I needed to put aside my weaknesses. Learn to become harder. Stronger.\n\n\n\nA monster, that's what he wants me to become. A sociopath. Just like him. No empathy, no guilt, no feelings other than fear and anger. A monster.\n\n\n\nI won't let him beat me.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** October 31, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nHappy Halloween.\n\n\n\nI was in the lab doing a live dissection of a rhesus monkey when B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 knocked on the door. \"Meet up in the deployment bay in fifteen,\" she said. \"We've got a mission.\"\n\n\n\nI gave the screaming monkey a lethal injection of adrenaline into its heart: it wasn't hard, given the fact that I'd already cracked the ribcage and laid the organ open. B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 seemed a bit sympathetic as she waited for me to wash the blood off my apron. \"We've got an active SCP somewhere in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 area,\" she said. \"Seems dormant, but Command believes it could go active at any moment. Keter-class.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's our cover story?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"We don't need one,\" she said, tossing me a towel. \"It's Halloween.\"\n\n\n\nThe others were suited up by the time I reached the staging area, and we really did look like freaks. The Hostile Environment Protective Isolation Suits (HEPIS) are designed to give you complete protection from all threats biological, chemical, and to also do a decent job against telepathic and mundane threats as well. In addition to the standard kevlar weave and biohazard suits, they contain a Telekill Alloy lined helmet and [DATA EXPUNGED]. End result is it makes you look like a super-soldier out of some videogame, all bulked up and scary-looking with a giant gun that M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wouldn't mind using against some L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Seventy Six just wore his usual outfit, of course, which was scary enough.\n\n\n\nThat was the first time I met Iris, too: She was the only other one who wasn't wearing a uniform, was in fact dressed up like a video game character (whom I later found out was J\u2588\u2588\u2588 from \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\") She had this big camera around her neck and she was wearing a very sensible leather jacket and pants. When I saw her, she was arranging some polaroid pictures in various pockets around her vest and pants. \"In case I need them\" she said.\n\n\n\nWe piled into two vans and drove down to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Fun times. A lot of young people standing around wearing fancy costumes and generally having a great time in a giant three-block outdoor party. We got a lot of attention, and even posed for a few pictures //[REVIEWER'S NOTE: Upon Covert insertion and review of photographs, it has been determined that no essential data has leaked. Termination order for civilian bystanders cancelled]//. We moved fast, though: our guy on-site was waiting for us, and Seventy Six looked like he was going to snap and kill some poor drunk valley-girl dressed up like L\u2588\u2588\u2588 C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who wouldn't stop trying to hit on the tall, brooding, strong goth guy with the realistic-looking prop sword.\n\n\n\nThe target was in the sewers underneath the party: SCP operatives had managed to trap it in a section of the tunnels, but eventually it was going to make a break for it. We met up with our guy on-site, who was guarding the only exit door. Two operatives set up claymore mines while Iris snapped a picture of the trigger mechanisms. \"If it tries to open the door without me reaching through the photo and flipping the switches, it'll blow itself up,\" she said, sliding the photo into a waterproof bag and slipping it safely into a breast pocket.\n\n\n\nSeventy-Six led one team, the other two were led by W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Iris and I were with Seventy Six in the \"Special Elements\" squad. I stuck close to Seventy-Six before Iris waved me back. \"Don't get too close,\" she said, making a gesture like swinging a sword. \"Sometimes, he swings without checking his blood circle first.\" I took a couple of steps back after that.\n\n\n\nSeventy Six seemed to change the moment we went into the danger area: he leaned forward, like a panther, sniffing the air and smiling as he ran a finger along the slick, moldy brick wall. I wasn't so happy. I was in a big, bulky suit that cut down my vision to the sides and back, hearing the sound of my own breathing and the pounding of my own heart. The flashlight didn't light up the darkness enough, and my night vision didn't help either: just made things even spookier with its grainy green appearance.\n\n\n\nSo when it grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down into the sewage, all I could really do was scream a lot. My helmet was sealed, and I had my own O2 supply that kicked in the moment I got dragged under, so I wasn't in danger of drowning. Choking, yes, the thing's tentacles were grabbing me around the neck and squeezing the life out of me. I had barely enough time to pull the trigger of my gun, feel nothing go off, and realize that I'd forgotten to take it off safety before I blacked out.\n\n\n\nI came to in the van, surrounded by a bunch of guys who were looking really tired and beat-up. There was something huge covered in a tarp and strapped down by bungie cords in the middle of the vehicle, something that looked like a cross between a squid, a bicycle, and an MC Escher painting. Seventy Six was nowhere to be found. \"What happened?\" I managed to croak out.\n\n\n\n\"You got grabbed,\" W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 said. \"Able killed it. He's still down there supervising the burning of the eggs and looking for more of them.\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess I screwed up, huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nah, you did fine.\" He put a cigarette between my lips and lit it with his zippo. \"You lived. That's all we can really ask out of a first-timer.\"\n\n\n\nCleaning my suit afterwards was a pain: they look kinda like space suits, but they don't put elimination tubes in them, and my bowels did what bowels will do when you get the shit scared out of you (Note to self: consider wearing Depends the next time I go into the field). Seventy Six didn't say a word to me afterwards. No one did. But everyone's thinking it: what the hell am I doing in this group? I'm not a soldier. I can't shoot, I can't fight, all I can do is write stupid papers trying to psychoanalyze that which can't be analyzed by mere psychology. \n\n\n\nSo what the hell am I doing here?\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** November 19, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nKilled three cats today in the lab. The process seems to be getting easier, which kinda scares me: the screaming and mewling doesn't bother me as much as it used to. Maybe I should try burning them alive, next time. Trying to make myself feel something. Revulsion. Fear. Anger. Self-Loathing. Anything's better than just. . . emptiness.\n\n\n\nWe did a mission in a quiet little town today. Mining town outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. By the time we got there, though, about half the town was infected: they all had these things growing out of their eye sockets that made them look like they were weeping blood. We tried shooting them, but they just regenerated the damaged parts. We tried using fire, but it just seemed to make the stuff grow faster, made the infected people explode with the force of a hand grenade, scattering spores all over the place: that's how we lost Y\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Tried\u00a0\u00a0a few other things: [DATA EXPUNGED] We eventually switched tactics after L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 rolled a VX grenade into an infected house: she'd confused it for an incendiary, as it turned out, but it worked. The nerve gas seemed to react to the infection somehow, kill it cleanly, but it also killed the host as well, made them violently reject the infected body parts: heart, eyes, lungs, liver.\n\n\n\nAble ordered a resupply and regroup. We traded our incendiaries for nerve gas bombs, kind of like roach foggers. The procedure was to cover the buildings with plastic isolation sheets to seal them up, toss in a half-dozen bombs, wait about an hour for the stuff to really permeate, then move in and mop up the leftovers as needed. At least half the casualties were clearly uninfected: civilians who'd holed up in their rooms and apartments waiting to be rescued. \n\n\n\nThe elementary school was the worst. There was this one teacher who'd barricaded the doors against the infected, had kept her kindergarten class blissfully ignorant and safe, playing games and listening to music while the monsters roamed around outside. I saw her through the second-story window as I started setting up the covers: she met my eyes, and the look on her face told me she knew what was gonna happen next. I saw her tell her class something, I couldn't tell what, then she walked away from the window. \n\n\n\nI was the first one through that door. There were a dozen five-year olds laying on their little beds, blissfully sleeping: the nerve gas had killed them cleanly and instantly while they napped. The teacher was seated at her desk, sitting upright with her head bowed as if she were just taking a rest. She had a mug in her hand, said something like \"World's Greatest Teacher,\" had a crayon-style drawing of a little girl hugging an older lady in a blue dress. There were tears in her eyes. Could have been condensation from the nerve gas.\n\n\n\nThere was an infected on the roof: the gas must not have permeated high enough to completely kill him. He was hacking up his lungs and twitching a bit, but he wasn't dead, could still walk, and he lunged towards me as I moved towards him. I think he might have been a janitor, he was wearing a blue jumpsuit, and his left wrist had a compound fracture with the bone sticking out. I shot him in the head. Then I kicked the hell out of him with my steel-toed boot. His eye fell out after the fifth kick, so I stomped on it. It popped like a grape.\n\n\n\nWe were all really quiet coming back, except Able. Seventy Six was his usual cheerful self (sarcasm sarcasm). The rest of us. . . well, we're just soldiers, not monsters. Wiping out the town had to be done, and an airstrike would have had too much risk of letting the gas fly downwind, hit \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and kill another ten thousand poor souls. Explosives could have set off a giant chain reaction, spread spores all across half the continent. We did what needed to be done, but we're not required to feel good about it.\n\n\n\nB\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 came into the lab a few minutes ago just as I'd started cremating the remains. She looked tired. Asked me if I couldn't sleep either. I realized it was almost 2am. She offered to stay up with me in my room. As soon as I wash the blood off my hands, I might take her up on that.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** November 24, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nHappy Thanksgiving! Back when I lived in the Real World, the most annoying thing about Turkey Day was hearing my dad demand that we all say at least one thing we were thankful for this year. Well. I've got a few things to be thankful for. I'm thankful that I'm not dead. I'm thankful that the world didn't end. I'm thankful that Able didn't decide to kill us all and use our skins to make drum heads. I'm thankful that no one decided to expose the Slime from Hell to any dead bodies. And mostly, I'm thankful for B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the most wonderful girl in the world, who can not only [DATA EXPUNGED], but can also cook a damn fine turkey.\n\n\n\nBit of a small Thanksgiving, though. Able and Squad One had to deploy at the last minute and were out in the field chasing some giant rust monster that apparently was rampaging around this sugar factory, so it was mostly just me, B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Iris, and whoever else wanted to drop by for a real Thanksgiving dinner instead of the mass-produced stuff the cafeteria prepared. I went around the facility asking if anyone else wanted to drop by and get some turkey. Gathered up a few folks along the way, then headed over to Dr. Franks' office to see if my old boss wanted some food too.\n\n\n\nHe was chatting with a rather nice looking guy: possibly Indian or Arabic, was going over the newest field reports from our Mobile Task forces. The guy was just listening and nodding the whole time, stroking the tattoo on his forehead. I asked him if he wanted to come too. \"That's fine,\" he said, smiling. \"We'll be busy for a while. If you would like, however, please bring me a turkey leg later.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" Dr. Franks said. \"And save me a plate. I'll drop by to pick it up once we're finished.\"\n\n\n\nFigured the guy was busy, so after dinner, I made two plates with all the fixings, headed over to Dr. Franks' office. As I got closer, though, I started noticing something funny: the cornbread stuffing was starting to smell bad. By the time I got outside the door, it had rotted through so badly that the mold was starting to spread to the meat as well. I dropped the plates and yelled in surprise, and almost hit the \"Containment Breach\" alarm, before the door opened and the stranger walked out.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" he sighed. \"Not again.\"\n\n\n\nSo that's how I first met Cain. Decent guy, even if he isn't much of a gardener. Turns out he was just in town for the day to help Dr. Franks back up some files. \"It's best if I'm not around here when Able comes back,\" he said, before he headed back into the helicopter a few hours later. Then he gave me a funny look. \"When the time comes,\" he said, \"Don't hesitate. Do what you must. I'll be fine.\" I'm really not sure what that's supposed to mean.\n\n\n\nNote to self: Whatever \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand cranberry sauce is, it's apparently not made of cranberries: the stuff didn't break down one bit around Cain. Remind me to choose a different brand next year.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** November 19, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nNo, the date is not a typo. Yes, it is four days before my last entry. Damn temporal SCPs.\n\n\n\nI'm spending the next four days in confinement with the rest of my team to make sure that we don't accidentally pollute the timeline. I'm arguing with the security staff that it would be okay to let us out because, you know, time being an infinite loop and all, if I was going to meet with my past self, I would have done it anyway, and the fact that I didn't means that I'm not gonna. They tell me that the fact that I don't remember ever meeting my future self means that I'm gonna stay in confinement, so there's no point arguing about it. Is it too much to ask for just to get a moment's walk out in the sunlight? The damn padded walls are starting to move in on me.\n\n\n\nI don't like this one bit.\n\n\n\nThe mission was a success, relatively speaking, I guess. We went into the facility with isolation suits on, to retrieve the artifact. Joint mission with MTF \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\" They took the lead, given that they've had more experience underground than we have. We were just there to lay down the pressure once they met up with the artifact.\n\n\n\nWe lost Squad three two minutes later: the members of that squad just suddenly up and died of old age within three minutes of coming into contact with the artifact's holder. Squad two managed to get out a distress signal before dying. Able closed in on the target shortly afterwards: weirdest thing, watching other people growing old and dying around him while he just kept aging away, hair growing longer, fingernails growing longer, but his body just not aging at all. . . \n\n\n\n<DATA EXPUNGED> had him pinned down under an I-beam, but couldn't reach the artifact because his arm was cut off, and he needed the other one to pin down the monster. I was the closest. Popped open my emergency dose of double-oh six and downed it in one go before running in.\n\n\n\nMy hand instantly withered the moment I touched the item. I screamed a bit as the insulation suit rotted around me, but managed to yank it away from Abel and the Morphophage and toss it into the Box. B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 slammed the lid shut and hit the locks, and the entire thing <DATA EXPUNGED>\n\n\n\nSo yeah, that's how we wound up here four days before we left. I managed to convince them to let me keep my journal, since it's not really gonna have too many temporal effects once I leave. Also convinced them to issue my past self an emergency ration of double-oh six before he goes. I'm sure he'll be confused about why he needs it. I sure was.\n\n\n\nIris seems. . . I dunno. She's not doing well recently. I'm thinking the stress of the job might be getting to her. Being one of the youngest members of the team can't be easy.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nB\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 came into the room today and told me that she's been given TDY away from Omega-7. \"Something bad happened to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\" she said. \"I've been asked to talk to her.\"\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. That would be SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.

She didn't think so. \"I've never been raped before, A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\" she pointed out. \"How am I supposed to talk to someone who has?\"\n\n\n\n\"Just. . . listen. Don't let her blame herself. Let her know no one blames her. And don't let her depersonalize. She might be suffering from some post-traumatic stress. I can find a pamphlet for you on that.\"\n\n\n\n\"How the hell do you know all this stuff?\"\n\n\n\n\"I was a psych before I was a soldier, remember? This used to be my job.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" she said, smiling. \"I forget that sometimes.\"\n\n\n\n\"I do too,\" I said.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nRetrieval Mission.

I'm listing it as, \"Recovered under pain of death from SCP-173.\" That'll sound good on the report.\n\n\n\nWe caught up to Iris at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 airport, waiting for a flight home. She burst into tears the moment she saw B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and I approaching. \"Can't you guys just leave me alone?\"\n\n\n\n<DATA EXPUNGED> put the gun to my head and handed her the polaroid of the internal workings. \"You can stop me from killing myself,\" I said. \"All you have to do is reach into the photo and pull out the firing pin.\"\n\n\n\n\"You wouldn't dare,\" she whispered.\n\n\n\n\"I managed to bring a loaded handgun through airport security, I can and will. And if you can still do what you can do, you won't let me die, because you're too good of a person to let that happen.\"\n\n\n\nI pulled the trigger, and there was a click. She was standing there with the polaroid in one hand and the firing pin in the other. Then she fell down and started crying.\n\n\n\nI let B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 take care of the rest.

It tugged at his ragged clothing, sucking what little warmth left in him through his armour. His breath crystallized in front of his face like smoke from the maw of a dragon. His hair whipped around his face like a thing alive, beating senselessly against his cold cheeks and lips incessantly.</em>\n<p><em>Yet despite all this, he stood stock still, staring over his high perch on the snowy mountain, staring at the large flat plains in front of him, his eyes two shards of aged, dirty gray ice, far colder than anything that frigid peak could conjure up.</em></p>\n<p><em>Stray flakes stuck to his eyelashes, and he blinked them away, rolling down his face, tears that were not real. He tightened his grip on the leather wrapped hilt of his sword, the material groaning in protest, the flecks of dried blood cracking and falling away from his wiry fingers.</em></p>\n<p><em>He could not say how long he stood there, staring. The moments rolled into days, and the hours to seconds. He could have stood there for a thousand eternities, or for the scantest of instants.</em></p>\n<p><em>All he knew was that eventually, he would return once more.</em></p>\n<p><em>And he would fight.</em></p>\n<p>Able's eyes flickered open slowly, glancing towards the clock nailed unceremoniously to the wall with a butcher knife. He had slept for only a few hours.</p>\n<p>He did not truly need to sleep, and had not needed to for a very long time. But that was not to say that he did not enjoy the action from time to time. Still, it had been centuries since he had last dreamt, an action he thoroughly relished on the rare occasions that it transpired.</p>\n<p>He rose from the simple metal cot, his muscles and joints pliable and supple as if he had not spent several hours inert and motionless. He stalked over to the heavy blast door, a slab of gargantuan metal two feet thick and weighing three tons. He wrenched it aside with ease and a metallic screech of protest from its wheels, the weight of the barrier a more effective deterrent to invaders than any lock. No one but him could open it, as he had ripped the hydraulics out of the sides of it, the little people's fleeting strength no match for the sheer burden of his bedroom door.</p>\n<p>Still, they insisted on their inane rules and regulations, two heavily armed guards standing watch over the entrance. They did not move as he left, the tinted shields of their riot gear helms hiding their emotions from Able, had he cared to look.</p>\n<p>As he strode through the corridors, a young, almost mousy woman struggled to reach him, the clicking of her high heel shoes resounding from behind him.</p>\n<p>\"Seventy Six!\" she called out plaintively.</p>\n<p>\"Seventy Six! Please, wait for a moment. I have to talk to you,\"she gasped as she ran, nearly out of breath, her cheeks red from exertion.</p>\n<p>Able stopped, turning around to face her slowly.</p>\n<p>She caught up quickly, bending over double for a moment to catch her breath.</p>\n<p>Able studied her fastidiously as she did so.</p>\n<p>She was a young woman, in her mid twenties, her eyes almost hidden behind square, thin rimmed glasses, thick, curly, shoulder length, light brown hair framing her small features. She was thin, but not overly so, yet everything about her spoke of a certain petiteness, as if she really was a smaller than she appeared. Her clothes were formal, white blouse, black skirt and tights, and she clutched a old brown clipboard, a pen in her other hand.</p>\n<p>\"Yes?\" asked Able, drawing out the word as languorously as possible. It almost sounded like an insult to the woman, one that spoke of apathy and indifference.</p>\n<p>\"I have to talk to you,\" she responded plainly.</p>\n<p>\"About?\" Again, a range of insults in a single word.</p>\n<p>\"It's a psychological evaluation.\" she answered, now beginning to sound just a little haughty at his tone.</p>\n<p>He simply turned and began to walk away, but she quickly followed suit.</p>\n<p>\"The higher ups want another psych evaluation because of what you did to Professor Liham,\" she continued on, hurriedly trying to keep up with his merciless, distance eating strides.</p>\n<p>\"How is Liham?\" chuckled Able, flashing the woman a horrific smile. She nearly visibly recoiled in disgust upon seeing his teeth. They were thin and angular, the majority of the ones in the front filed to grim points, and they crowded his mouth, jostling for space, near bursting out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Still, she carried on, determined not to appear weak to this monstrosity that wore human form.</p>\n<p>\"He's still in the hospital. His doctors are amazed he's showing brain activity,\"</p>\n<p>Able muttered something unintelligible, and from the ugly expression he made, she could tell it was not pleasant.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Doctor Angela Langley, and I'll be evaluating you through your actions today. Would it be possible for me to ask you some questions?\"</p>\n<p>He looked at her coldly and began to talk animatedly in a tongue that certainly did not sound English. In fact, she had never heard anything like it before. While he spoke, he moved his clawlike hands in odd stratagems, speaking in a bizarre physical manner.</p>\n<p>He continued like this for several minutes, the gestures he made getting more and more strange, until at last, he stopped, a quick silence descending before he spoke again, this time in English.</p>\n<p>\"And that would be my entire history, from the point of when I was born, to right now. Granted I removed some of the unimportant things, but the majority of it was there,\" he told her calmly.</p>\n<p>\"But\u2026 But I couldn't understand it,\" she replied worriedly.</p>\n<p>\"No\u2026 You can't,\" he answered back, increasing his pace exponentially, and leaving her far behind.</p>\n<p>He continued that pace until he was at the stadium where he trained with Pandora's Box. They were all already there, waiting for him.

There were a small series of clicks, and he regained some of the mobility in the massacred digits, but not much.</p>\n<p>No matter, he thought, retrieving a thin barbed chain out of the darkness, spending several minutes wrapping it around his hand, clenched around the hilt of the buried sword.</p>\n<p>A few practice tugs to ensure that it was holding, unmindful of the way the chain tore into his already desecrated flesh, the lean man yanked the sword out of the wall, and set about <em>making</em> his own entertainment.</p>\n<p>Within twenty minutes, he had cleaved his way though an entire legion of panicked guards, arriving in one of the major containment areas.</p>\n<p>Within thirty minutes, there were hordes of skittering crab like creatures swarming across the area, shredding the flesh from anything in their path, leaving naught but gnawed piles of bone behind.

It tugged at his ragged clothing, sucking what little warmth left in him through his armour. His breath crystallized in front of his face like smoke from the maw of a dragon. His hair whipped around his face like a thing alive, beating senselessly against his cold cheeks and lips incessantly.//\n\n\n\n//Yet despite all this, he stood stock still, staring over his high perch on the snowy mountain, staring at the large flat plains in front of him, his eyes two shards of aged, dirty gray ice, far colder than anything that frigid peak could conjure up.//\n\n\n\n//Stray flakes stuck to his eyelashes, and he blinked them away, rolling down his face, tears that were not real. He tightened his grip on the leather wrapped hilt of his sword, the material groaning in protest, the flecks of dried blood cracking and falling away from his wiry fingers.//\n\n\n\n//He could not say how long he stood there, staring. The moments rolled into days, and the hours to seconds. He could have stood there for a thousand eternities, or for the scantest of instants.//\n\n\n\n//All he knew was that eventually, he would return once more.//\n\n\n\n//And he would fight.//\n\n\n\n\n\nAble's eyes flickered open slowly, glancing towards the clock nailed unceremoniously to the wall with a butcher knife. He had slept for only a few hours.\n\n\n\nHe did not truly need to sleep, and had not needed to for a very long time. But that was not to say that he did not enjoy the action from time to time. Still, it had been centuries since he had last dreamt, an action he thoroughly relished on the rare occasions that it transpired.\n\n\n\nHe rose from the simple metal cot, his muscles and joints pliable and supple as if he had not spent several hours inert and motionless. He stalked over to the heavy blast door, a slab of gargantuan metal two feet thick and weighing three tons. He wrenched it aside with ease and a metallic screech of protest from its wheels, the weight of the barrier a more effective deterrent to invaders than any lock. No one but him could open it, as he had ripped the hydraulics out of the sides of it, the little people's fleeting strength no match for the sheer burden of his bedroom door.\n\n\n\nStill, they insisted on their inane rules and regulations, two heavily armed guards standing watch over the entrance. They did not move as he left, the tinted shields of their riot gear helms hiding their emotions from Able, had he cared to look.\n\n\n\nAs he strode through the corridors, a young, almost mousy woman struggled to reach him, the clicking of her high heel shoes resounding from behind him.\n\n\n\n\"Seventy Six!\" she called out plaintively.\n\n\n\n\"Seventy Six! Please, wait for a moment. I have to talk to you,\"she gasped as she ran, nearly out of breath, her cheeks red from exertion.\n\n\n\nAble stopped, turning around to face her slowly.\n\n\n\nShe caught up quickly, bending over double for a moment to catch her breath.\n\n\n\nAble studied her fastidiously as she did so.\n\n\n\nShe was a young woman, in her mid twenties, her eyes almost hidden behind square, thin rimmed glasses, thick, curly, shoulder length, light brown hair framing her small features. She was thin, but not overly so, yet everything about her spoke of a certain petiteness, as if she really was a smaller than she appeared. Her clothes were formal, white blouse, black skirt and tights, and she clutched a old brown clipboard, a pen in her other hand.\n\n\n\n\"Yes?\" asked Able, drawing out the word as languorously as possible. It almost sounded like an insult to the woman, one that spoke of apathy and indifference.\n\n\n\n\"I have to talk to you,\" she responded plainly.\n\n\n\n\"About?\" Again, a range of insults in a single word.\n\n\n\n\"It's a psychological evaluation.\" she answered, now beginning to sound just a little haughty at his tone.\n\n\n\nHe simply turned and began to walk away, but she quickly followed suit.\n\n\n\n\"The higher ups want another psych evaluation because of what you did to Professor Liham,\" she continued on, hurriedly trying to keep up with his merciless, distance eating strides.\n\n\n\n\"How is Liham?\" chuckled Able, flashing the woman a horrific smile. She nearly visibly recoiled in disgust upon seeing his teeth. They were thin and angular, the majority of the ones in the front filed to grim points, and they crowded his mouth, jostling for space, near bursting out of his mouth.\n\n\n\nStill, she carried on, determined not to appear weak to this monstrosity that wore human form.\n\n\n\n\"He's still in the hospital. His doctors are amazed he's showing brain activity,\"\n\n\n\nAble muttered something unintelligible, and from the ugly expression he made, she could tell it was not pleasant.\n\n\n\n\"I'm Doctor Angela Langley, and I'll be evaluating you through your actions today. Would it be possible for me to ask you some questions?\"\n\n\n\nHe looked at her coldly and began to talk animatedly in a tongue that certainly did not sound English. In fact, she had never heard anything like it before. While he spoke, he moved his clawlike hands in odd stratagems, speaking in a bizarre physical manner.\n\n\n\nHe continued like this for several minutes, the gestures he made getting more and more strange, until at last, he stopped, a quick silence descending before he spoke again, this time in English.\n\n\n\n\"And that would be my entire history, from the point of when I was born, to right now. Granted I removed some of the unimportant things, but the majority of it was there,\" he told her calmly.\n\n\n\n\"But... But I couldn't understand it,\" she replied worriedly.\n\n\n\n\"No... You can't,\" he answered back, increasing his pace exponentially, and leaving her far behind.\n\n\n\nHe continued that pace until he was at the stadium where he trained with Pandora's Box. They were all already there, waiting for him. While Able set them a strict time to arrive there by, he often arrived there himself at arbitrary times, either several hours too early or late, expecting them to do the same, and woe betide those who were not, becoming his personal \"whipping boy\" for the rest of the session.\n\n\n\nThey began with simple exercises, an hour of hard physical labor and several sparring matches. He fought in none of them, instead opting to watch. Fighting such inferior opponents, especially when they were unarmed would only serve to raise his ire, and put him into a foul mood.\n\n\n\nTime passed, and soon he decreed they had strained their tiny bodies to their limits, dismissing them with an apathetic wave of his hand.\n\n\n\nHe trudged slowly through the facility, wallowing in his boredom. There was nothing to do.\n\n\n\nThere was never anything to do. The people here had proven that they were a mediocre challenge at best, and there was rarely anything that pressed him to his limits anymore. Not like when the world was young.... Back then there was-\n\n\n\n\"Seventy Six!\" came a plaintive call from behind him, causing Able to roll his eyes in annoyance.\n\n\n\n\"Seventy Six! Please!

A new Agent entered the containment area of <a href=\"/scp-236\">SCP-236</a>, and accidentally stepped on a unit. The resulting explosion almost set off a chain reaction, but was contained successfully. Unknown if Agent survived, but doubtful. Was approached by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the hall shortly after leaving my dormitory, in regards to a new subject being introduced to <a href=\"/scp-212\">SCP-212</a>. I am to supervise and document the proceedings, which will take place tomorrow. The last subject exposed did not survive, and expired in such a way as to require lockdown of the test area. It is hoped the current exposure will not repeat this outcome.</p>\n<p>Spent most of the morning preparing documents for transfer to Central Records. We are currently updating our database to an all-digital format. Concerns have been raised due to the sheer volume of data. Anyone could accidentally gain access to sensitive documents, copy them, and cause a security breach. This possibility is remote, but with my own work taking several weeks to compile thus far, I feel it could be valid.</p>\n<p>Lunch was eventful. Several members of Zeta-9 had returned from a mission, and proceeded to state their superiority to several other teams present in R-4 lunchroom, most notably Phi-1, who they stated \u201ckeep their pansy little asses hidden in the base, while we do all the damn Deep work!\u201d. A sizable altercation broke out, which was separated by Agent Dorlin. After his exposure <a href=\"/scp-212\">SCP-212</a>, he has shown remarkable aptitude with his improvements, notably the \u201cscythe-arms\u201d. The rest of the lunch period was uneventful, with the exception of <a href=\"/scp-529\">SCP-529</a> stealing a piece of ham from my plate. Reported it to Site Security, who told me \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, she does that sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Afternoon devoted to SCP review. Meeting scheduled for tomorrow with <a href=\"/scp-172\">SCP-172</a>. Have received information that a new assistant will be assigned to me within the week, the old one having been removed from active service due to exposure to <a href=\"/scp-008\">SCP-008</a>. The assistance will be helpful, as the massive amount of compiling and updating is starting to affect my other duties.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Morning uneventful, despite brief lockdown due to a false alarm. Met with new lab assistant after entering office. \"Iceberg\" is a newly-appointed assistant, and seems somewhat eager to prove himself. Assigned several stacks of reports to be compiled and sent to Central Records to him. I dislike handing off work, but I can not do both jobs at once. Received word that the subject set to be exposed to <a href=\"/scp-212\">SCP-212</a> has failed a drug screening, and will have to be postponed.</p>\n<p>Met with <a href=\"/scp-172\">SCP-172</a>. \u201cHe\u201d seemed very pleased today, and presented me with a blueprint for a non-lethal handgun. Explained that it uses a sequence of chimes and air pulses, controlled by a central mainspring and \u201ctiming drum\u201d to emit a series of tones and vibrations, causing instant loss of balance, partial blindness, and vomiting. Requested <a href=\"/scp-172\">SCP-172</a> to create a prototype, to which he replied \u201cYes comrade, consider it already done.\u201d <a href=\"/scp-172\">SCP-172</a> appears to be working on a new module as well. Inquired as to its function, to which <a href=\"/scp-172\">SCP-172</a> responded: \u201cYour Agents seem lazy, comrade. I will show them the proper way to drill and exercise.\u201d Will inquire with Site Supervision, about whether or not this should be allowed. Remainder of meeting uneventful, <a href=\"/scp-172\">SCP-172</a> commenting several times that he \u201cfelt tired\u201d. Appeared to be \u201cwinding down\u201d and returned to storage compartment after meeting conclusion.</p>\n<p>Ate lunch in office. Iceberg appears to have made a great deal of headway in the reports. I think I\u2019ll take him to assist with testing <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. We lack documentation as to the exact time required for <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> to regain animation, and the time needed to manifest the \u201cgrinding\u201d in subjects. It appears Iceberg has yet to encounter high-security SCP. This will be a valuable learning experience for him. We will be flying to the containment site at the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Minor security breech in the evening. <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a> exited containment area with extreme force, causing several injuries. Members of security were talking outside of <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a>s containment area. <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a> misheard a comment, and took offense. Situation resolved, and a new blast door has been ordered. Staff has been reminded not to remain in SCP containment areas when not actively working.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Long flight to the containment area. On our approach, was informed that a security breech had occurred. Agents moving <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> to the testing area had an accident, causing <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> to leave its secured transportation tank and strike a large metal blast door. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> immediately bonded with the door, and the entire area has been locked down. Eight Agents and several members of staff were sealed in with <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>.</p>\n<p>Landed in the evening, with snow starting to fall. Informed that a storm is coming, and we will be unable to leave for two weeks. Containment area was mostly unsealed, with the exception of several areas near the site of the accident. Lockdown is being maintained for the area until the full extent of the <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> \u201cinfection\u201d is contained. All areas connecting to the accident site have been disconnected from the main containment facility via explosives. It appears that several rooms and halls were \u201cinfected\u201d before physical separation could be achieved. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> \u201cspread\u201d via wiring and other metallic devices. Two Agents, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and three D-Class personnel are still sealed in the affected areas.</p>\n<p>Command has informed me that testing will continue as planned, with a new focus on the group dynamic when under extreme stress. Security cameras appear to be unaffected by the infection, and observation has begun. Assigned my assistant to the set-up of a central observation post with several CCTV and other monitoring devices. He has been very quiet. Several of those sealed in with <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> appear very upset. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> is now only 26% covered in rust, and has started to make small, jerky movements.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>The first 24 hours of exposure to <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> have yielded a great deal of data. Auditory effects begin after 18 hours of exposure, varying by one to two hours depending on proximity to <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. The closer a subject is, the quicker the effect. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> has started converting the door to which it is attached into more gears and cogs, current projections putting full conversion at 56 hours. Other metallic objects connected to the door have not yet begun to covert. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> is operating normally, no rust visible anywhere on any observable surface, and all components moving in ways consistent to their construction. As has been documented, no form of power is visible, and nothing can be detected to account for <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>s continued operation.</p>\n<p>One D-Class has died. All personnel isolated with <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> have started to report hearing \u201cnoises\u201d; however D-882/1 appears to have been more drastically affected. D-882/1 was observed to have spent long periods of time staring at <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>, attempting several times to touch it before being stopped by Agent P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent D\u2588\u2588. The staffs have created a dormitory in the isolated area, comprised of the break room and two adjoining offices. Two-way communication with the isolated staff is not possible, the PA system being damaged during the isolation procedure, but those isolated have been very vocal. Many requests have been made, most pertaining to time of rescue. D-882/1 was notably more quiet then the rest of staff, and seemed to have become extremely withdrawn.</p>\n<p>D-882/1 left the sleeping area at 4:46 a.m., walking out of the \u201cliving quarters\u201d and into the area containing <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. D-882/1 stared at <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>, and then put his hand into the main mass of <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. Iceberg, who was observing at the time, said D-882/1 appeared to be \u201csleepwalking\u201d. D-882/1 was immediately drawn into the main mass, screaming and attempting to remove himself from <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. D-882/1 was completely drawn into the main mass in fourteen seconds. The other isolated staff quickly awoke and ran to <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>, after hearing D-882/1 screaming. Both the remaining D-Class and Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 became notably upset, D-882/2 vomiting and fainting after seeing <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. Both Agents advanced on the observation cameras, asking repeatedly to be removed and showing a high degree of anger. D-882/2 and D-882/3 have also shown a strong dislike for Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>Today has been uneventful. The storm has come in, and we are unable to leave our current research area. My assistant was visibly upset by the actions of D-882/1, and requested an early observation rotation. The wind is very strong, and some observational equipment has been compromised, but no vital systems as of yet. The containment site command has informed me that we may lose the audio feed to the isolated section in the next few days, due to damage done during separation.</p>\n<p>The current site is still in an emergency situation, and the remaining facilities are somewhat cramped. My assistant and I have our research area, and one room for sleeping/eating. Rations are limited to Foundation Emergency Nutrition Rations until we can receive a supply drop, which may be some time. Iceberg has been withdrawn since the incident with <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> and D-882/1. His performance has not been impaired, but he appears distracted at times.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Received an emergency supply drop today, in the middle of a break in the storm. Weather reports show that this storm will continue for several more days, and no drop will be possible after this short lull. The drop missed its mark by only a few yards, and all the supplies were still intact, but Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was visibly upset when he was told that the container had impacted with his jeep.</p>\n<p>Unloading went quickly, and Iceberg assisted in installing much needed lab equipment. The storm began to pick up shortly before we finished unloading, and it appears a member of site staff has contracted frostbite in his hands and face. Amputation of the fingers may be needed. The additional medical and food supplies are a welcome boost, and many staff have shown a great deal of pleasure about moving off emergency rations.</p>\n<p>Subjects in the containment area have started to show signs of auditory hallucination. This appears to manifest after 32 hours of exposure to SCP-882. Agent P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has committed suicide. He used his service pistol to shoot himself through the temple last night. The remaining subjects were visibly upset by this, D-882-2 appearing to go into mild shock. Food supplies appear to be running low as well, however due to emergency protocols we are unable to re-supply the subjects at this time. Agent D\u2588\u2588 is extremely upset, and has spent several hours speaking to the cameras, mostly insults, threats, and sobbing. Agent D\u2588\u2588 has also tried several times to destroy the cameras, but has been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appears to be the most affected by SCP-882 and its auditory effect. He has already placed several metal objects on SCP-882 affected areas, lessening what he calls \u201cthat horrible screeching and grinding\u201d. These actions have angered the other subjects, who have instructed him \u201cnot to make things worse\u201d. This appears to run counter to action, as every subject in the containment area has, at some point over the last 24 hours, added metal to SCP-882. At the current rate, all metal in the containment area will be consumed and converted by SCP-882 within 48 hours.</p>\n<p>The storm has grown, and is now strong enough to cause some outside walls to creak and vibrate. I have expressed concern over the broadcast range of SCP-882, but local staff state that the effect is proportional to its size, and that we are still well out of range. My assistant and I currently work in an area lined with SCP-148, but the rest of staff may run the risk of exposure. I\u2019ve asked Iceberg to monitor staff, and note any aberrant behavior.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588<br/>\nUnable to make complete log entry. Broadcast range of SCP-882 drastically underrated. Several security breaches, with multiple members of site staff exposed to SCP-882. Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appears to have gone insane. Several members of site staff and security killed by Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and other members of staff exposed to SCP-882. Iceberg and I have barricaded ourselves in our shielded testing area. Foundation contacted, and Emergency Response Teams have been dispatched, but there is no set arrival time due to weather conditions.</p>\n<p>Several sections of the site have been damaged, and the heating system appears to be failing. SCP-882 has been allowed to breach emergency containment. Several subjects exposed to SCP-882 are attempting to gain access to our testing area. Temperature is steadily dropping.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Extraction from site was made at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 hours, approximately six days after distress beacon was issued to The Foundation in regards to the second security breach by SCP-882. Delay in response due to severe weather conditions. Currently in-route to Site \u2588\u2588 for debriefing.</p>\n<p>Response team found the entire site compromised, and a majority of the staff dead due to exposure to freezing temperatures, exposure to SCP-882, or murder. Remaining staff recovered and placed in quarantine with minimal injury. SCP-882 cut back to standard containment parameters, with the resulting metal disposed of quickly. Reconstruction of containment area will commence after judicial review and inquest into both containment failure incidents.</p>\n<p>Iceberg provided a great deal of the physical force needed to repel SCP-882 affected staff during the security break down. He has shown an aptitude for improvised hand-to-hand combat weapons, as well as hand-held explosives and incendiary devices, primarily \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and Molotov cocktails. The event appears to have altered his personality, observable in the excessive use of force against affected staff, far exceeding the amount needed in some cases. He has suffered several broken bones, frostbite in hands and feet, and may have had very mild SCP-882 exposure. He is being remanded to Medical for evaluation, then to Dr. Glass for psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p>I have suffered minimal physical damage, limited to moderate to severe frostbite in the hands and face. I am also being remanded for medical and psychological evaluation. After being cleared by medical staff, Iceberg will begin processing the data gathered from SCP-882, while I gather information on the status of current research projects.</p>\n<p>In light of the events of the containment breach, I plan to file a request for SCP-172 regarding a personal protection device.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/personal-log-of-dr-gears\">Personal Log Of Dr Gears</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

[[[SCP-076]]]s containment area.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-076]]] misheard a comment, and took offense.\u00a0\u00a0Situation resolved, and a new blast door has been ordered.\u00a0\u00a0Staff has been reminded not to remain in SCP containment areas when not actively working.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nLong flight to the containment area.\u00a0\u00a0On our approach, was informed that a security breech had occurred.\u00a0\u00a0Agents moving [[[SCP-882]]] to the testing area had an accident, causing [[[SCP-882]]] to leave its secured transportation tank and strike a large metal blast door.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-882]]] immediately bonded with the door, and the entire area has been locked down.\u00a0\u00a0Eight Agents and several members of staff were sealed in with [[[SCP-882]]].\n\n\n\nLanded in the evening, with snow starting to fall.\u00a0\u00a0Informed that a storm is coming, and we will be unable to leave for two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Containment area was mostly unsealed, with the exception of several areas near the site of the accident.\u00a0\u00a0Lockdown is being maintained for the area until the full extent of the [[[SCP-882]]] \u201cinfection\u201d is contained.\u00a0\u00a0All areas connecting to the accident site have been disconnected from the main containment facility via explosives.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that several rooms and halls were \u201cinfected\u201d before physical separation could be achieved.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-882]]] \u201cspread\u201d via wiring and other metallic devices.\u00a0\u00a0Two Agents, Dr.\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and three D-Class personnel are still sealed in the affected areas.\n\n\n\nCommand has informed me that testing will continue as planned, with a new focus on the group dynamic when under extreme stress.\u00a0\u00a0Security cameras appear to be unaffected by the infection, and observation has begun.\u00a0\u00a0Assigned my assistant to the set-up of a central observation post with several CCTV and other monitoring devices.\u00a0\u00a0He has been very quiet.\u00a0\u00a0Several of those sealed in with [[[SCP-882]]] appear very upset.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-882]]] is now only 26% covered in rust, and has started to make small, jerky movements.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nThe first 24 hours of exposure to [[[SCP-882]]] have yielded a great deal of data.\u00a0\u00a0Auditory effects begin after 18 hours of exposure, varying by one to two hours depending on proximity to [[[SCP-882]]].\u00a0\u00a0The closer a subject is, the quicker the effect.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-882]]] has started converting the door to which it is attached into more gears and cogs, current projections putting full conversion at 56 hours.\u00a0\u00a0Other metallic objects connected to the door have not yet begun to covert.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-882]]] is operating normally, no rust visible anywhere on any observable surface, and all components moving in ways consistent to their construction.\u00a0\u00a0As has been documented, no form of power is visible, and nothing can be detected to account for [[[SCP-882]]]s continued operation.\n\n\n\nOne D-Class has died.\u00a0\u00a0All personnel isolated with [[[SCP-882]]] have started to report hearing \u201cnoises\u201d; however D-882/1 appears to have been more drastically affected.\u00a0\u00a0D-882/1 was observed to have spent long periods of time staring at [[[SCP-882]]], attempting several times to touch it before being stopped by Agent P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent D\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0The staffs have created a dormitory in the isolated area, comprised of the break room and two adjoining offices.\u00a0\u00a0Two-way communication with the isolated staff is not possible, the PA system being damaged during the isolation procedure, but those isolated have been very vocal.\u00a0\u00a0Many requests have been made, most pertaining to time of rescue.\u00a0\u00a0D-882/1 was notably more quiet then the rest of staff, and seemed to have become extremely withdrawn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nD-882/1 left the sleeping area at 4:46 a.m., walking out of the \u201cliving quarters\u201d and into the area containing [[[SCP-882]]].\u00a0\u00a0D-882/1 stared at [[[SCP-882]]], and then put his hand into the main mass of [[[SCP-882]]].\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg, who was observing at the time, said D-882/1 appeared to be \u201csleepwalking\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0D-882/1 was immediately drawn into the main mass, screaming and attempting to remove himself from [[[SCP-882]]].\u00a0\u00a0D-882/1 was completely drawn into the main mass in fourteen seconds.\u00a0\u00a0The other isolated staff quickly awoke and ran to [[[SCP-882]]], after hearing D-882/1 screaming.\u00a0\u00a0Both the remaining D-Class and Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 became notably upset, D-882/2 vomiting and fainting after seeing [[[SCP-882]]].\u00a0\u00a0Both Agents advanced on the observation cameras, asking repeatedly to be removed and showing a high degree of anger.\u00a0\u00a0D-882/2 and D-882/3 have also shown a strong dislike for Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\nToday has been uneventful.\u00a0\u00a0The storm has come in, and we are unable to leave our current research area.\u00a0\u00a0My assistant was visibly upset by the actions of D-882/1, and requested an early observation rotation.\u00a0\u00a0The wind is very strong, and some observational equipment has been compromised, but no vital systems as of yet.\u00a0\u00a0The containment site command has informed me that we may lose the audio feed to the isolated section in the next few days, due to damage done during separation.\n\n\n\nThe current site is still in an emergency situation, and the remaining facilities are somewhat cramped.\u00a0\u00a0My assistant and I have our research area, and one room for sleeping/eating.\u00a0\u00a0Rations are limited to Foundation Emergency Nutrition Rations until we can receive a supply drop, which may be some time.\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg has been withdrawn since the incident with [[[SCP-882]]] and D-882/1.\u00a0\u00a0His performance has not been impaired, but he appears distracted at times.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nReceived an emergency supply drop today, in the middle of a break in the storm.\u00a0\u00a0Weather reports show that this storm will continue for several more days, and no drop will be possible after this short lull.\u00a0\u00a0The drop missed its mark by only a few yards, and all the supplies were still intact, but Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was visibly upset when he was told that the container had impacted with his jeep.\n\n\n\nUnloading went quickly, and Iceberg assisted in installing much needed lab equipment.\u00a0\u00a0The storm began to pick up shortly before we finished unloading, and it appears a member of site staff has contracted frostbite in his hands and face.\u00a0\u00a0Amputation of the fingers may be needed.\u00a0\u00a0The additional medical and food supplies are a welcome boost, and many staff have shown a great deal of pleasure about moving off emergency rations.\n\n\n\nSubjects in the containment area have started to show signs of auditory hallucination.\u00a0\u00a0This appears to manifest after 32 hours of exposure to SCP-882.\u00a0\u00a0Agent P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has committed suicide.\u00a0\u00a0He used his service pistol to shoot himself through the temple last night.\u00a0\u00a0The remaining subjects were visibly upset by this, D-882-2 appearing to go into mild shock.\u00a0\u00a0Food supplies appear to be running low as well, however due to emergency protocols we are unable to re-supply the subjects at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Agent D\u2588\u2588 is extremely upset, and has spent several hours speaking to the cameras, mostly insults, threats, and sobbing.\u00a0\u00a0Agent D\u2588\u2588 has also tried several times to destroy the cameras, but has been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\nDr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appears to be the most affected by SCP-882 and its auditory effect.\u00a0\u00a0He has already placed several metal objects on SCP-882 affected areas, lessening what he calls \u201cthat horrible screeching and grinding\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0These actions have angered the other subjects, who have instructed him \u201cnot to make things worse\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0This appears to run counter to action, as every subject in the containment area has, at some point over the last 24 hours, added metal to SCP-882.\u00a0\u00a0At the current rate, all metal in the containment area will be consumed and converted by SCP-882 within 48 hours.\n\n\n\nThe storm has grown, and is now strong enough to cause some outside walls to creak and vibrate.\u00a0\u00a0I have expressed concern over the broadcast range of SCP-882, but local staff state that the effect is proportional to its size, and that we are still well out of range.\u00a0\u00a0My assistant and I currently work in an area lined with SCP-148, but the rest of staff may run the risk of exposure.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve asked Iceberg to monitor staff, and note any aberrant behavior.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\n\nUnable to make complete log entry.\u00a0\u00a0Broadcast range of SCP-882 drastically underrated.\u00a0\u00a0Several security breaches, with multiple members of site staff exposed to SCP-882.\u00a0\u00a0Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appears to have gone insane.\u00a0\u00a0Several members of site staff and security killed by Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and other members of staff exposed to SCP-882.\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg and I have barricaded ourselves in our shielded testing area.\u00a0\u00a0Foundation contacted, and Emergency Response Teams have been dispatched, but there is no set arrival time due to weather conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSeveral sections of the site have been damaged, and the heating system appears to be failing.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-882 has been allowed to breach emergency containment.\u00a0\u00a0Several subjects exposed to SCP-882 are attempting to gain access to our testing area.\u00a0\u00a0Temperature is steadily dropping.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nExtraction from site was made at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 hours, approximately six days after distress beacon was issued to The Foundation in regards to the second security breach by SCP-882.\u00a0\u00a0Delay in response due to severe weather conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Currently in-route to Site \u2588\u2588 for debriefing.\n\n\n\nResponse team found the entire site compromised, and a majority of the staff dead due to exposure to freezing temperatures, exposure to SCP-882, or murder.\u00a0\u00a0Remaining staff recovered and placed in quarantine with minimal injury.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-882 cut back to standard containment parameters, with the resulting metal disposed of quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Reconstruction of containment area will commence after judicial review and inquest into both containment failure incidents.\n\n\n\nIceberg provided a great deal of the physical force needed to repel SCP-882 affected staff during the security break down.\u00a0\u00a0He has shown an aptitude for improvised hand-to-hand combat weapons, as well as hand-held explosives and incendiary devices, primarily \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and Molotov cocktails.\u00a0\u00a0The event appears to have altered his personality, observable in the excessive use of force against affected staff, far exceeding the amount needed in some cases.\u00a0\u00a0He has suffered several broken bones, frostbite in hands and feet, and may have had very mild SCP-882 exposure.\u00a0\u00a0He is being remanded to Medical for evaluation, then to Dr. Glass for psychological evaluation.\n\n\n\nI have suffered minimal physical damage, limited to moderate to severe frostbite in the hands and face.\u00a0\u00a0I am also being remanded for medical and psychological evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0After being cleared by medical staff, Iceberg will begin processing the data gathered from SCP-882, while I gather information on the status of current research projects.\n\n\n\nIn light of the events of the containment breach, I plan to file a request for SCP-172 regarding a personal protection device.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a

At least, I think it's a promotion. Only a lab assistant, but I'll have access to more SCPs than before (though, I've heard the rumors about some of the Keter class SCPs). And I've heard Dr. Gears is rather respected in this field. Well, I guess I'll just have to see how today turns out. I've heard dying on the first day on these sort of things rarely happens.</p>\n<p>Evening<br/>\nI spent most of the day compiling information. Everything we have has to be put into a digital format and sent down to Central Records. Dr. Gears himself was ok, though seemed to always keep things very professional. I wonder if he's always like that. Today was mostly compiling notes and reports by Dr. Gears. I found a lot of what was documented interesting, but the actual work of putting it on the computer was incredibly dull. And it turns out it's most of my work for the next few days. Oh joy. And I don't think I got a pay raise. I'm starting to wonder just what the Foundation means when they say \"promotion.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nMorning<br/>\nMorning was rather uneventful. Breakfast was about the same as always. More work with compiling papers today. Dr. Gears seems to be taking my nickname rather well. Most high-ups just call me Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>Evening<br/>\nLike I thought, more paper work. Seems I'll be heading to a containment site, recording data on <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>. One of what we'll be looking at is how long it takes people around it to start hearing things.

Working with us or not, it's never been too nice having an immortal super powered psychopath on base. At supper Carl, or <a href=\"/scp-530\">SCP-530</a>, tried to get some of my food. Had to push him away. Don't want to get reprimanded, not to mention I've heard how bad it smells.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nMorning<br/>\nHad to get up early today. We had to leave early for the flight to the containment area. I've been busy all week, so I just now got time to write. I should probably get some more sleep soon. It wouldn't be good to be tired when we get there.</p>\n<p>Scratch that. It definitely wouldn't be good. We just got word <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> breached containment. Despite this, we're still going on.</p>\n<p>Evening<br/>\nWhy oh why did I accept this new job? Not only do we keep going towards a containment breach, when we get there it's freezing, snow everywhere. Admittedly, I've never had much problem with cold weather. But because of this storm, we're stuck here for two whole weeks. It's nearly enough to make you wish you were back working on some of those small time SCPs.

I'm not sure I have a choice.</p>\n<p>Once we got there, Dr. Gears had me immediately begin setting up camp. Or as he put it, \"the central observation post.\" It turns out our new job is to watch the inside of the sealed off area, study group dynamic when under extreme stress. It's not really my area of expertise, but I guess that's why Dr. Gears is in charge here. Setting up the monitoring devices, I finally got a good look at it. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>, that is. For now it's still partially covered in rust, but it's begun to move. With all those gears on it, I guess they sent the right doctor for the job.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nMorning<br/>\nOh dear God. This morning, D-882/1 (what wonderful names we give) walked straight into it. <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a> that is. Just sort of sleepwalking, going down the hall. We have no way to talk to them, so there wasn't anything I could do besides watch and record. And hear him scream. When the beast has its fill of metal, it doth in its endless gluttony hunger after blood, flesh and bone. Maybe I should have tried going into writing. The others in there have been pretty vocal about wanting out. Without anyone coming in for a while, and how fast D-882/1 went, it doesn't seem too likely. I can handle it, I know I can. Doesn't make it any prettier.</p>\n<p>Evening<br/>\nI've been spending some of my spare time working on project ideas. I've got a nearly complete list of tests for <a href=\"/scp-914\">SCP-914</a>. I'm also going to give Dr. Gears an idea I have about feeding <a href=\"/scp-682\">SCP-682</a> some of <a href=\"/scp-236\">SCP-236</a>. Maybe followed by a loud bang to startle them after a while, like a grenade. A couple others I threw around in my head. It's been helpful really, just focusing on science.</p>\n<p>We're down to emergency rations. Doesn't taste too good, but apparently pound for pound it has more nutrients than you'll get from about anything else. Besides what's inside the containment area, it's been kind of boring really.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nMorning<br/>\nWe finally got a new supply drop. It slammed right into Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's jeep. Bad for him, but his outburst was kind of funny. We could use some more stuff to laugh at. One guy's got frostbite already, another subject went off the deep end and \"self-terminated\". The rest are running low on food. Not a cheery week. I've still got a bit more equipment to set up, so that should prove a healthy distraction for, oh, another hour.</p>\n<p>Evening<br/>\nAfter dealing with equipment and supplies, it was back to more watching. It's clear they are all being affected, and by quite a bit. You can tell from the way they walk around. Not only that but they're all adding to <a href=\"/scp-882\">SCP-882</a>, throwing in metal to make it lower the mental noise. While the camp is far away from where it is being contained, I'm still glad to get the <a href=\"/scp-148\">SCP-148</a> lined work area. Thank God we found that stuff, it's quite useful from what I've read. Anyway, Dr. Gears and myself are the only ones who really work in this area, so Dr. Gears has asked me to keep an eye on the rest of the team in case the range of 882 grows larger than the local researchers say it will. They seem fine for now, though when the supplies came in I noticed \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 took some pills that are for headaches. But hey, I'm sure it's fine. Jobs like this will give you headaches sometimes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nMorning<br/>\nDamn it. 882 has a longer range then we thought, it got everyone. Everyone but me and Gears, thanks to the shielded testing area. We had to barricade ourselves in. Not much time to write, just want a possible last entry. And- dang it, they took out the heating system. As if I wasn't cold enough already. Honestly, ever since the incident, it's just been a pa</p>\n<p>Evening<br/>\nGah, so little time to write. They don't give up, and the damn weather is stopping us from getting a Team down here. Man, these guys are really starting to piss me off. I need a gun. Maybe I'll get a personal one when we get back. Something nice.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nYes, I know. It's been a while since I could write an entry. Apparently a few broken bones will keep you in medical for a while. I don't see how having the psych doctor keep coming in and talk with me helps though. After the evaluation is done. I mean, Glass is an ok guy, I guess, but really? How many psych tests do you really need?</p>\n<p>Anyways, once they let me out, first thing first. Most of the equipment made it out, so lucky me, guess who has to process all the data? Did not know the camera was rolling when I beat the guy's face in. Huh. Or even earlier, when I cocktailed him to get him on the ground. Molotov cocktails, what can't they do?</p>\n<p>Also met some guy. Kondraki, something like that. Photographer, mainly. But he also got some research work. Kind of nuts, plenty of nasty rumors too. Jackass gave me his paperwork for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Speaking of paperwork, already have lots of it. These people really need to learn to go digital. Luckily, I've nearly got Gear's signature down, which will save time. Since I won't have to go ask for it every time.

At least, I think it's a promotion. Only a lab assistant, but I'll have access to more SCPs than before (though, I've heard the rumors about some of the Keter class SCPs). And I've heard Dr. Gears is rather respected in this field. Well, I guess I'll just have to see how today turns out. I've heard dying on the first day on these sort of things rarely happens. \n\n\n\n\n\nEvening\n\nI spent most of the day compiling information. Everything we have has to be put into a digital format and sent down to Central Records. Dr. Gears himself was ok, though seemed to always keep things very professional. I wonder if he's always like that. Today was mostly compiling notes and reports by Dr. Gears. I found a lot of what was documented interesting, but the actual work of putting it on the computer was incredibly dull. And it turns out it's most of my work for the next few days. Oh joy. And I don't think I got a pay raise. I'm starting to wonder just what the Foundation means when they say \"promotion.\" \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nMorning\n\nMorning was rather uneventful. Breakfast was about the same as always. More work with compiling papers today. Dr. Gears seems to be taking my nickname rather well. Most high-ups just call me Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\nEvening\n\nLike I thought, more paper work. Seems I'll be heading to a containment site, recording data on [[[SCP-882]]]. One of what we'll be looking at is how long it takes people around it to start hearing things. Grinding and clicking. So basically we'll see how long until it makes people go crazy. Well, //that\u2019s pleasant.// But guess it's what needs to be done. \n\n\n\n[[[SCP-076]]] caused another incident. Great.

It\u2019s nice having a roommate who is gone three quarters of the time, but he has a bad habit of just walking out with stuff. He never steals, but sometimes he\u2019s tossing stuff in a bag so he can fly out and to a shoot in some desert, and he just doesn\u2019t pay attention to what he\u2019s grabbing. So I get up, find a note saying he got a call to fly out at 6:30 a.m. and take pictures of some town that got bombed. Wonderful. So I go along, getting ready for work, and my damn shoes are gone. How the hell can you accidentally take a man\u2019s shoes, I ask you? They\u2019ll never fit him, so I hope he\u2019s got a spare set.</p>\n<p>Left a voice mail for him, told him to send them back if he\u2019s going to be a long time. I wouldn\u2019t mind normally, just those were brand new! Last time he took something of mine, I got back pants just coated in dirt and blood from some jungle in the middle of nowhere. I had to throw them out, they stank so bad.</p>\n<p>Work was ok, slow as hell. Didn\u2019t see Jim in the office today, apparently he\u2019s been out sick. I\u2019m so used to seeing him across the hall, the whole day felt off. His desk seemed really empty too\u2026god I hope we\u2019re not downsizing.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>August 23rd, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<p>Came home today to a message from Greg. Says he doesn\u2019t have my shoes, but he\u2019s still unpacking. I have to wear my old pair that\u2019s falling apart, so I was a little pissed. Left a message for him to just keep the damn things. I think I\u2019m still worked up from work today, I shouldn\u2019t take it out on him.</p>\n<p>I came in to work, all worried that someone would notice my feet, and I find the whole office buzzing. Apparently Jim\u2019s house blew up. I mean it freaking EXPLODED, just a crater left. It was all over the news, happened some time last night I guess. Nobody knows what happened to Jim, he might have been inside. The cops are apparently pretty tight-lipped over it, but the word is Jim had a meth lab in his basement, and something went wrong.</p>\n<p>What the hell? Jim? a METH LAB?? He could barely make coffee right! Still\u2026it\u2019s not like I knew him all that well, just \u201cthat guy\u201d at work\u2026he has been acting really weird lately. God\u2026you just never can tell, can you? They\u2019re still looking into it, but most people think Jim was in the house.</p>\n<p>They already cleared off his desk, can you believe it? Can\u2019t even let the dust settle, and the corporate gears just keep turning. I\u2019m going to bed, my feet hurt and I\u2019m still just shocked</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>August 24th, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<p>I found my damn shoes today. they were right in front of the door\u2026I mean right where I always leave them. How the hell did I miss them for two days? What the hell? I called Greg and apologized for snapping on him. Haven\u2019t heard from him yet. I just don\u2019t get how I didn\u2019t see them right freaking there!</p>\n<p>They found Jim, or at least they think they did. He was apparently in the house when it blew. The funeral is tomorrow, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll go. I didn\u2019t really know him that well\u2026still; I did work with him for years. I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m still getting my head around all this. Everyone at work is really quiet, it feels strange.</p>\n<p>I spend all that time looking for my shoes, and now I\u2019m having problems with them. They feel funny, too hard and they pinch a little. I bet it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been wearing my old blown-out pair, gotta get used to them again. I tore holes in my new socks, and my toes are kind of red\u2026that\u2019s all I need, some damn fungus.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>August 25th, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<p>This whole day has been weird. First, I couldn\u2019t find a bunch of my shirts. I swear I hung up a bunch of them yesterday, but they\u2019re all gone. I had to dig one out of the dirty clothes, and even that was weird. The first three I grabbed had holes all over them. If I have freaking moths or some kind of bug, I\u2019m going to kill Greg. He\u2019s done this before, brought home some kind of virus or critter by accident, and then we have to spend weeks getting rid of it. I can\u2019t think of what I did with my shirts though, how the hell could they all just be gone?</p>\n<p>Ok, so then I manage to get out the door, and I realize its trash day. So I go out back, and the freaking trash can is crawling with these bugs! I mean just covered with them, tiny little things, kinda brown and really fast. I walked up to try and see them closer, and they all just ran off the trash and off into the grass. Looked kinda like mites or something\u2026probably just some kind of ant or something I\u2019ve never seen. Anyway, I go to take the trash down, and these little bugs have freaking eaten out the bottom of the trash can! Tore open all the bags too, so it just dumped everywhere. Had to shovel it all into a spare can. If I see those things again, I\u2019m going to stomp them.</p>\n<p>Then, to top it off, I had a freaking bee sting me. At least I think it was a bee\u2026I was at lunch, and suddenly I had this sharp pain on my ankle. I jumped up and started shouting, and it just kept hurting worse and worse. I ripped off my shoe because I thought it was trapped or something. My skin was so raw, even bleeding a little bit, and my sock had a big hole around the heel\u2026and suddenly I realize everyone in the freaking restaurant is staring at me. I paid quick and got the hell out\u2026I feel like such an idiot. Hopefully tomorrow will be better\u2026I think I need to get out more, go relax.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t go to Jim\u2019s funeral. It was closed casket\u2026apparently he was in bad shape. I think I need to request a leave\u2026I just feel worn out. This whole day has been screwed up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>August 26th, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<p>To hell with this, I am cracking the hell up, and I am going on vacation. The damn stools are missing from the kitchen, all my shirts are gone, and my shoes were in the sink this morning. Either I am sleep-redecorating, going insane, or someone is messing with me. Whichever it is, I am not dealing with this anymore. I called in, and I am leaving today. Going to a hotel by the lake, and just relax a few days. Greg is back tomorrow, and I\u2019m letting him deal with this crap.</p>\n<p>I bought new shirts, pants, shoes, everything. Screw this place; see you when you\u2019re sane.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[NOTE: Text in the following section is nearly illegible. Interpretation and editing done by Central Records.

The Entry Zone is to be converted to a temporary holding facility, made of thin glass. The structure will be air-tight, but designed to shatter and expose all contents to vacuum in the event of any violence. All personnel are to be evacuated to a radius of 2 miles from the Entry Zone for their own safety in the event that <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/decomm:scp-531-d\">SCP-531</a> becomes violent.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>Dr. Clef will engage SCP-531 and make an initial assessment under cover from <a href=\"/scp-408\">SCP-408</a>, while two members of Task Force Sigma 6 (\"Puddlejumpers\") relocate the calibrated SCP-120 to a location within SCP-531's quarters. Once in place, Dr. Clef will begin the operation by changing the music to Elvis Presley's \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Hound Dog.\" The CD will have been previously altered with two subliminal tracks: the first, a recording of <a href=\"/scp-061\">SCP-061</a> to render the subject susceptible to suggestion. The second, a command to fall asleep immediately, allowing personnel to transport SCP-531 and Dr. Clef to Location 9, through SCP-120.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>Upon arriving at Location 9, Dr. Kondraki will continue, through SCP-408, to maintain the illusion that the subject is still in his quarters, while Dr. Clef continues his assessment. If Dr. Clef should determine that the subject must be terminated, he will indicate this by standing up and talking about the subject's XBox. This is SCP-408's cue to take over emulating Dr. Clef while said Dr. Clef proceeds out of the kill zone and to a safe distance. Once all personnel are outside the 2 mile kill zone, explosive charges will be detonated in the glass structure and expose SCP-531 to space, killing it. Should explosive decompression prove ineffective, snipers will be in position from a 2 mile distance to terminate SCP-531 by headshot.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>Note that a successful termination of SCP-531 will result in the loss of a significant portion of the 408 swarm: 300 gallons of sugar water will be provided to the surviving members to encourage regrowth and as payment for its cooperation. In addition, it is recommended that Dr. Clef utilize some means of distraction in order to keep SCP-531 off-balance while the kill zone is being established.</tt></p>\n<p>APPROVED by O5-7 on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>From the Global Occult Coalition's Pamphlet, \"Special Circumstances: Reality Benders.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any attempt to eliminate a Type Green must take into consideration the three factors for Dynamic Entry in close quarter battle.</p>\n<p>Speed: Type Greens are able to quickly react to any threat. In order to ensure a successful kill, the operation must take no longer than one second from initiation of hostilities to termination of subject.</p>\n<p>Surprise: Type Greens are able to quickly adapt to known threats. It is recommended that a bluff play be carried out: an overt threat is to be presented to the subject for them to fixate upon, while the actual kill is carried out from an unexpected direction.</p>\n<p>Violence of Action: Any means of eliminating a Type Green must ensure a successful kill in one shot. Sniper weapons must utilize .50 caliber rounds, preferably hollow-point for maximum expansion, or armor-piercing, as needed. Firearms are, of course, a secondary kill choice: explosives are recommended, but may not be usable due to collateral damage risks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Interesting how life goes.

The Type Green will attempt to rationalize away their abilities by various means. In some cases, the Type Green will end here: their ability will be self-suppressed, and they will not proceed. However, most then proceed to:\n\n> \n\n> **PHASE 2: Experimentation** The subject acknowledges their abilities and begins to test the limits of their powers. In general, Type Greens tend to experiment in one of two patterns: slowly, methodically, and carefully, advancing a small amount at a time, or in a small number of sudden jumps. In any case, the subject will generally remain in this mode for some time, before proceeding to:\n\n> \n\n> [MORE]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"So tell me about Michael Flaherty.\"\n\n\n\n\"Michael who?\"\n\n\n\n\"Angela's husband.

The Type Green achieves control over their reality shifts, and can manipulate them as necessary. More importantly, they can choose not to utilize their abilities, if needed.\n\n> \n\n> Phase 3 is characterized by attempts to live a \"normal\" life. The subject will continue in normal routines, and aside from necessary precautions to prevent losing control, will utilize their abilities only in private, and only in a manner that will not harm others. These Type Greens may be classified as Threat Level 1 (monitor, do not engage), but should be monitored closely, due to the risk of proceeding to Phase 4.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to just ask you one last question.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\n\n\"How did you feel when you raped Angela Flaherty?\"\n\n\n\n\"What?

During this phase, the reality bender becomes obsessed with the power it possesses and will attempt to utilize it for personal gain at the cost of others. This phase is marked by reduced empathy for other humans, inability to accept personal faults, and increased megalomania.\n\n> \n\n> Although warning signs are numerous, the key aspect of a Phase 4 is the use of their abilities to manipulate other humans. Teenage and young adult Type Greens will typically use their abilities for sexual purposes, while children will attempt to make strangers their \"friends.\" Older adults may attempt to manipulate others for love or financial gain. Although a few cases have resulted where the Type Green then reverts to Phase 3, 99% of them will remain at Phase 4 until eliminated. For this reason, Phase 4 Type Greens should be considered Threat Level 5 (Immediate Threat) and eliminated immediately.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n+++++ Operation: Spoil the Rod\n\n\n\n{{**Proposal:** [[[SCP-120]]] is to be dialed to Location 9.

Once in place, Dr. Clef will begin the operation by changing the music to Elvis Presley's \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Hound Dog.\" The CD will have been previously altered with two subliminal tracks: the first, a recording of [[[SCP-061]]] to render the subject susceptible to suggestion. The second, a command to fall asleep immediately, allowing personnel to transport SCP-531 and Dr. Clef to Location 9, through SCP-120.}}\n\n\n\n{{Upon arriving at Location 9, Dr. Kondraki will continue, through SCP-408, to maintain the illusion that the subject is still in his quarters, while Dr. Clef continues his assessment. If Dr. Clef should determine that the subject must be terminated, he will indicate this by standing up and talking about the subject's XBox. This is SCP-408's cue to take over emulating Dr. Clef while said Dr. Clef proceeds out of the kill zone and to a safe distance. Once all personnel are outside the 2 mile kill zone, explosive charges will be detonated in the glass structure and expose SCP-531 to space, killing it. Should explosive decompression prove ineffective, snipers will be in position from a 2 mile distance to terminate SCP-531 by headshot.}}\n\n\n\n{{Note that a successful termination of SCP-531 will result in the loss of a significant portion of the 408 swarm: 300 gallons of sugar water will be provided to the surviving members to encourage regrowth and as payment for its cooperation.

It is not believed to pose any risk to anyone, therefore can be kept in a secure locker rather than requiring its own chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a small rectangular device, approximately 4 x 2 x 0.5\u00a0cm. It appears to be a storage device of some kind, similar to a modern-day memory card, but much more advanced - our engineers have estimated its storage capacity to be approximately 200 terabytes. Based on the available data, we believe the device to have been constructed in or around the year 2074.</p>\n<p>It took several years to construct an interface to allow us to connect it to current computers, and several more to write the software necessary to read what is on it.</p>\n<p>The entire content of the device is a single file, a multimedia recording. Our software engineers have managed to recover and convert the file into a format usable on our current computers, but the video appears in monochrome, a single 'layer' of the recording. They say that there are at least 18 such layers, each from either a slightly different angle, or displaying a different colour, leading us to believe that the recording was intended to be viewed on some type of three-dimensional display that has yet to be invented.</p>\n<p>Device contents: The recording on the device appears to be a police interview, two detectives interviewing a murder suspect. Due to the missing segments, we don't currently know the names of either of the detectives, or the suspect, who is referred to only as 'Doctor'. We hope that eventually we will be able to recover the missing pieces of the recording and identify the men, the location, and the exact date the recording was made, so we can track the people involved in the years leading up to the events in the recording.</p>\n<p>Below is a complete transcript of the section we were able to recover. It begins mid-sentence with the detective nearest the camera, whom we have dubbed 'Detective 1'.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Begin transcript&gt;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Detective 1:</strong> \u2026your confession, we have multiple witnesses, and we have this\u2026<br/>\n<em>The detective presses a button on the table in front of him, and the wall in the rear of the picture blurs, then fades into what looks like a high-tech laboratory. The wall is a screen of some kind. On the screen, a man is standing in front of what can best be described as a blur, stretching from floor to ceiling. He seems to be shouting something at another, older man, who is aiming a shotgun at him. The man with the weapon, who is the man being interviewed, shouts something back. The younger man turns towards the blur and takes a step forward, at which point the older man fires the shotgun. The left-hand side of the younger man's head explodes, he spins round and falls backwards into the blur, and his entire body disappears.</em><br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> I HAD TO DO IT!<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Why?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Because of what he was about to do!<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Which was what?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> I don't know. Possibly destroy the universe.<br/>\n<em>Both detectives chuckle</em><br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Destroy the universe. Well, you stopped him, good job, Doctor.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> I'm serious! And I don't know if I stopped him, you saw yourself, his body fell through. The damage may already be done, it may be too late.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> What damage?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> That'll take some explaining.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> You're in some serious trouble, and we've got all the time in the world. Talk.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> OK, OK. I've been completely co-operative, I'll tell you everything. How much do you know about wormholes?<br/>\n<em>Detective 1 shrugs.</em><br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Only what I've seen in the movies. Bending space, that kind of thing.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes, exactly. I won't go too much into the science of it, but my team and I were working on developing stable wormholes. A way to instantly travel from one point to another. About 6 months ago, we had a breakthrough. We actually did it.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> You made a wormhole?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes. We managed to open one in the laboratory. We punched a hole in spacetime! An actual wormhole, right there in front of our eyes.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Okaaaaaay\u2026 and where did it go to?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Philadelphia.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Oh, spectacular. That would've been\u2026 May. Nice time of year for Philly, huh?<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> I dunno, I would've preferred Hawaii.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Please, let me continue.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Alright, go ahead.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Thank you. When we first opened it, we had no idea where it led to. We ran all the tests we could think of on it, but eventually, we knew we'd have to send something through it. So, we got a video camera and attached a locator device to it, and sent it through.<br/>\nWe left the complex, and activated the locator. It showed that the camera was 150\u00a0km away. We got there in 2 hours, and eventually found it halfway up a tree.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Is this going anywhere?<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Apart from Philadelphia?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes, yes, I'm getting there. It's crucial you know the full history before I explain why I had to kill him. May I continue?<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Please do.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> We retrieved the camera, only to find that the battery was dead. We thought that maybe the trip through the wormhole had somehow fried the electronics, drained the battery. We got it back to the lab, and connected it to a charger, hoping maybe it had recorded some footage before whatever it was had killed its battery.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> And had it?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes! But this was the part that shocked us. The first message that appeared on its display was \"Chip full\". And simultaneously, one of the technicians yelled over that there was nothing wrong with the battery - it had simply been used up, drained.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Meaning?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> A standard holochip will store 36 hours of recording. The battery for that camera model lasts for 48 hours. We retrieved the camera in 2 hours, detective, yet the battery was depleted and the storage device was full! We checked the contents of the chip. <em>It had a full 36 hours of footage on it</em>.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> So, the camera was damaged and wrote garbage to the chip?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> NO! It worked perfectly! The footage we pulled from it began in the lab showing me smiling into the lens, then going through the wormhole, then into a blinding light - sunshine! Then green, then blue sky. As near as we could tell, it exited the wormhole 35 metres in the air, had fallen, and landed in the tree. Luckily, it had ended up pointing up in the sky. We were able to determine, from weather conditions and the phases of the moon captured by the camera, that it had not only travelled 150\u00a0km through space, but it had also travelled 9 days <em>back in time</em>!<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Back in time.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Time travel.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> If you're gonna start jerking us around\u2026<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> I'm not, I swear it. The wormhole had not only bent space, but time too.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> So you built a time machine.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Unintentionally, but, yes, we had. We kept experimenting with it, over the following weeks and months, sending more and more objects through, as well as sterile biological samples, until we were able to accurately calibrate the exit point both spatially and temporally to a high degree of accuracy.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> What does that mean?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> We were able to create wormholes to within 1.5 metres of our intended destination <em>location</em>, and to within 12 minutes of our intended destination <em>time</em>.<br/>\n<em>Detective 2 sighs.</em><br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> What has this got to do with you killing Doctor Snow?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Everything.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Well how about you use that time machine of yours and skip forward to tonight. Say, when you arrived at the lab.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> OK. It was important you understood what the device was before I explained.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> You've explained. Now, talk.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Alright. This evening, I was at home, reading, when the lab's security system telephoned me. It told me that there had been an intrusion into the Restricted Materials compound. That's where we keep all the dangerous chemicals, biological agents, weapons tech, that kind of thing. It said that Doctor Snow had broken in, and removed 8 litres of Rx52.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Rx52?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> It's an engineered virus, a bio-weapon. It causes a severe rash within 10 minutes of exposure, followed by pustules erupting on the skin. It's non-lethal, and runs its course in about 4 hours, with no lasting effects.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> OK. Go on.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> While Rx52 is non-lethal, it is still very dangerous. Its intended use is to create mass chaos, panic, but not fatalities. That much of it is enough to infect tens of thousands of people. I jumped into to my car and drove to the lab. When I got there and entered the building, the lab's computer greeted me and announced that I had a new message from Doctor Snow. I got it to play the message for me, and that's when I realised what I had to do.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Which was\u2026<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> I had to stop him, whatever the cost.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> What was the message from Doctor Snow?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> It was a last will and testament, of sorts. He explained his plan, every detail of what he was going to do. In his own words, he was going to become a hero, legendary. He'd been planning it for some time, apparently. He was going to use the device to send himself back in time, along with a shotgun, 200 rounds of ammunition, and 8 litres of Rx5. He'd set the spatial co-ordinates to Manhattan, New York, and the temporal co-ordinates to 4 am on the 11th of September, 2001.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> WHAT?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes. He was going to send himself back in time 73 years, to the morning of the attacks. Are you familiar with what happened on September 11th 2001, detective?<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Of course, I learned about it in history class, we all did. What was he planning to do?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> 2,973 people died in those attacks, most of them in the old World Trade Center towers. He was going to stop them.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> WHAT? There was no way he could stop them, those planes came from completely different parts of the country.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> He wasn't going to physically stop the planes. He was going to have the two buildings evacuated. He was going to connect the canisters of Rx52, 4 litres in each tower, to the ventilation systems. He would then contact the authorities and announce that he was a terrorist who was about to release a large quantity of the smallpox virus into both buildings.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Smallpox?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> It was a deadly virus which was eliminated in the 20th century, but was believed, for a time, to have been held in stockpiles for biological warfare. His plan was two-fold - if the authorities acted as he'd hoped, they would have evacuated both buildings. If they didn't, he would have released the Rx52 by remote into the buildings' ventilation systems. The physical symptoms which Rx52 presents would make people believe that it truly was smallpox, and they would panic, fleeing the building, or at least try to leave, going down to the lower levels if the authorities enacted quarantine procedures.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> My god.<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes. Ingenious. The people behind the attacks would have had no way of knowing, but if his plan had succeeded, those planes would have collided with two empty buildings.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> What was the weapon for?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> That was in case he was discovered. He'd thought of everything. In case he was found planting the Rx52, his intention was to get into a gunfight, which would have caused the authorities to turn up and cordon off whichever tower he was found in. He would have told them, between shots, that they were 'too late, I've already done the other tower'. Again, this would have caused both buildings to be evacuated.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> OK, let me get this straight. Doctor Snow was going to use your device, a time machine, to stop one of the worst atrocities this country has ever experienced?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes.<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> And you <em>stopped him</em>?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> Yes, he had to be stopped! I couldn't let him interfere!<br/>\n<strong>Detective 2:</strong> Why not? He could have saved thousands of lives!<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> No, no, my god, no. He would have changed history! History is fragile, don't you get it? Had he succeeded, history as we know it would have been completely rewritten! He would have created a paradox! We have no idea what would have happened, it could have decimated the fabric of spacetime! Destroyed existence itself!<br/>\n<em>Both detectives are silent, staring at him</em><br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> DON'T YOU GET IT? HE COULD HAVE LITERALLY TORN THE UNIVERSE APART!<br/>\n<strong>Detective 1:</strong> Sit down please. Sit. Down. We'll get into the physics of it later. Continue with your story. What did you do when you'd listened to the message?<br/>\n<strong>Doctor:</strong> I ran as fast as I could to the wormhole chamber. When I got there, he'd already activated it. Beside the door were the canisters of Rx52, with the shotgun and ammunition on top. I screamed at him to stop. He turned to look at me, sneered, and told me I was too late. He was standing in front of the wormhole, there was no way I could have reached him in time to stop him going through. Even if he went through without his equipment, he could still create catastrophic damage to the timeline simply by his presence there. I had no choice, I could NOT let him step through. I grabbed the shotgun from where it was, and aimed it at him. I gave him one last</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>&lt;end transcript&gt;</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-recording\">The Recording</a>\" by far2, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Based on the available data, we believe the device to have been constructed in or around the year 2074.\n\n\n\nIt took several years to construct an interface to allow us to connect it to current computers, and several more to write the software necessary to read what is on it.\n\n\n\nThe entire content of the device is a single file, a multimedia recording. Our software engineers have managed to recover and convert the file into a format usable on our current computers, but the video appears in monochrome, a single 'layer' of the recording. They say that there are at least 18 such layers, each from either a slightly different angle, or displaying a different colour, leading us to believe that the recording was intended to be viewed on some type of three-dimensional display that has yet to be invented.\n\n\n\nDevice contents: The recording on the device appears to be a police interview, two detectives interviewing a murder suspect. Due to the missing segments, we don't currently know the names of either of the detectives, or the suspect, who is referred to only as 'Doctor'. We hope that eventually we will be able to recover the missing pieces of the recording and identify the men, the location, and the exact date the recording was made, so we can track the people involved in the years leading up to the events in the recording.\n\n\n\nBelow is a complete transcript of the section we were able to recover. It begins mid-sentence with the detective nearest the camera, whom we have dubbed 'Detective 1'.\n\n\n\n\n\n**<Begin transcript>**\n\n> **Detective 1:** ...your confession, we have multiple witnesses, and we have this...\n\n> //The detective presses a button on the table in front of him, and the wall in the rear of the picture blurs, then fades into what looks like a high-tech laboratory. The wall is a screen of some kind. On the screen, a man is standing in front of what can best be described as a blur, stretching from floor to ceiling. He seems to be shouting something at another, older man, who is aiming a shotgun at him. The man with the weapon, who is the man being interviewed, shouts something back. The younger man turns towards the blur and takes a step forward, at which point the older man fires the shotgun. The left-hand side of the younger man's head explodes, he spins round and falls backwards into the blur, and his entire body disappears.//\n\n> **Doctor:** I HAD TO DO IT!\n\n> **Detective 1:** Why?\n\n> **Doctor:** Because of what he was about to do!\n\n> **Detective 2:** Which was what?\n\n> **Doctor:** I don't know. Possibly destroy the universe.\n\n> //Both detectives chuckle//\n\n> **Detective 1:** Destroy the universe. Well, you stopped him, good job, Doctor.\n\n> **Doctor:** I'm serious! And I don't know if I stopped him, you saw yourself, his body fell through. The damage may already be done, it may be too late.\n\n> **Detective 1:** What damage?\n\n> **Doctor:** That'll take some explaining.\n\n> **Detective 1:** You're in some serious trouble, and we've got all the time in the world. Talk.\n\n> **Doctor:** OK, OK. I've been completely co-operative, I'll tell you everything. How much do you know about wormholes?\n\n> //Detective 1 shrugs.//\n\n> **Detective 2:** Only what I've seen in the movies. Bending space, that kind of thing.\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes, exactly. I won't go too much into the science of it, but my team and I were working on developing stable wormholes. A way to instantly travel from one point to another. About 6 months ago, we had a breakthrough. We actually did it.\n\n> **Detective 1:** You made a wormhole?\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes. We managed to open one in the laboratory. We punched a hole in spacetime! An actual wormhole, right there in front of our eyes.\n\n> **Detective 2:** Okaaaaaay... and where did it go to?\n\n> **Doctor:** Philadelphia.\n\n> **Detective 1:** Oh, spectacular. That would've been... May. Nice time of year for Philly, huh?\n\n> **Detective 2:** I dunno, I would've preferred Hawaii.\n\n> **Doctor:** Please, let me continue.\n\n> **Detective 1:** Alright, go ahead.\n\n> **Doctor:** Thank you. When we first opened it, we had no idea where it led to. We ran all the tests we could think of on it, but eventually, we knew we'd have to send something through it. So, we got a video camera and attached a locator device to it, and sent it through.\n\n> We left the complex, and activated the locator. It showed that the camera was 150 km away. We got there in 2 hours, and eventually found it halfway up a tree. \n\n> **Detective 2:** Is this going anywhere?\n\n> **Detective 1:** Apart from Philadelphia?\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes, yes, I'm getting there. It's crucial you know the full history before I explain why I had to kill him. May I continue?\n\n> **Detective 1:** Please do.\n\n> **Doctor:** We retrieved the camera, only to find that the battery was dead. We thought that maybe the trip through the wormhole had somehow fried the electronics, drained the battery. We got it back to the lab, and connected it to a charger, hoping maybe it had recorded some footage before whatever it was had killed its battery.\n\n> **Detective 2:** And had it?\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes! But this was the part that shocked us. The first message that appeared on its display was \"Chip full\". And simultaneously, one of the technicians yelled over that there was nothing wrong with the battery - it had simply been used up, drained.\n\n> **Detective 1:** Meaning?\n\n> **Doctor:** A standard holochip will store 36 hours of recording. The battery for that camera model lasts for 48 hours. We retrieved the camera in 2 hours, detective, yet the battery was depleted and the storage device was full! We checked the contents of the chip. //It had a full 36 hours of footage on it//.\n\n> **Detective 1:** So, the camera was damaged and wrote garbage to the chip?\n\n> **Doctor:** NO! It worked perfectly! The footage we pulled from it began in the lab showing me smiling into the lens, then going through the wormhole, then into a blinding light - sunshine! Then green, then blue sky. As near as we could tell, it exited the wormhole 35 metres in the air, had fallen, and landed in the tree. Luckily, it had ended up pointing up in the sky. We were able to determine, from weather conditions and the phases of the moon captured by the camera, that it had not only travelled 150 km through space, but it had also travelled 9 days //back in time//!\n\n> **Detective 1:** Back in time.\n\n> **Detective 2:** Time travel.\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes.\n\n> **Detective 1:** If you're gonna start jerking us around...\n\n> **Doctor:** I'm not, I swear it. The wormhole had not only bent space, but time too.\n\n> **Detective 1:** So you built a time machine.\n\n> **Doctor:** Unintentionally, but, yes, we had. We kept experimenting with it, over the following weeks and months, sending more and more objects through, as well as sterile biological samples, until we were able to accurately calibrate the exit point both spatially and temporally to a high degree of accuracy.\n\n> **Detective 1:** What does that mean?\n\n> **Doctor:** We were able to create wormholes to within 1.5 metres of our intended destination //location//, and to within 12 minutes of our intended destination //time//.\n\n> //Detective 2 sighs.//\n\n> **Detective 2:** What has this got to do with you killing Doctor Snow?\n\n> **Doctor:** Everything. \n\n> **Detective 1:** Well how about you use that time machine of yours and skip forward to tonight. Say, when you arrived at the lab.\n\n> **Doctor:** OK. It was important you understood what the device was before I explained.\n\n> **Detective 2:** You've explained. Now, talk.\n\n> **Doctor:** Alright. This evening, I was at home, reading, when the lab's security system telephoned me. It told me that there had been an intrusion into the Restricted Materials compound. That's where we keep all the dangerous chemicals, biological agents, weapons tech, that kind of thing. It said that Doctor Snow had broken in, and removed 8 litres of Rx52.\n\n> **Detective 1:** Rx52?\n\n> **Doctor:** It's an engineered virus, a bio-weapon. It causes a severe rash within 10 minutes of exposure, followed by pustules erupting on the skin. It's non-lethal, and runs its course in about 4 hours, with no lasting effects.\n\n> **Detective 1:** OK. Go on.\n\n> **Doctor:** While Rx52 is non-lethal, it is still very dangerous. Its intended use is to create mass chaos, panic, but not fatalities. That much of it is enough to infect tens of thousands of people. I jumped into to my car and drove to the lab. When I got there and entered the building, the lab's computer greeted me and announced that I had a new message from Doctor Snow. I got it to play the message for me, and that's when I realised what I had to do.\n\n> **Detective 2:** Which was...\n\n> **Doctor:** I had to stop him, whatever the cost.\n\n> **Detective 1:** What was the message from Doctor Snow?\n\n> **Doctor:** It was a last will and testament, of sorts. He explained his plan, every detail of what he was going to do. In his own words, he was going to become a hero, legendary. He'd been planning it for some time, apparently. He was going to use the device to send himself back in time, along with a shotgun, 200 rounds of ammunition, and 8 litres of Rx5. He'd set the spatial co-ordinates to Manhattan, New York, and the temporal co-ordinates to 4 am on the 11th of September, 2001.\n\n> **Detective 1:** WHAT?\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes. He was going to send himself back in time 73 years, to the morning of the attacks. Are you familiar with what happened on September 11th 2001, detective?\n\n> **Detective 1:** Of course, I learned about it in history class, we all did. What was he planning to do?\n\n> **Doctor:** 2,973 people died in those attacks, most of them in the old World Trade Center towers. He was going to stop them.\n\n> **Detective 2:** WHAT? There was no way he could stop them, those planes came from completely different parts of the country.\n\n> **Doctor:** He wasn't going to physically stop the planes. He was going to have the two buildings evacuated. He was going to connect the canisters of Rx52, 4 litres in each tower, to the ventilation systems. He would then contact the authorities and announce that he was a terrorist who was about to release a large quantity of the smallpox virus into both buildings. \n\n> **Detective 2:** Smallpox?\n\n> **Doctor:** It was a deadly virus which was eliminated in the 20th century, but was believed, for a time, to have been held in stockpiles for biological warfare. His plan was two-fold - if the authorities acted as he'd hoped, they would have evacuated both buildings. If they didn't, he would have released the Rx52 by remote into the buildings' ventilation systems. The physical symptoms which Rx52 presents would make people believe that it truly was smallpox, and they would panic, fleeing the building, or at least try to leave, going down to the lower levels if the authorities enacted quarantine procedures.\n\n> **Detective 1:** My god.\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes. Ingenious. The people behind the attacks would have had no way of knowing, but if his plan had succeeded, those planes would have collided with two empty buildings.\n\n> **Detective 2:** What was the weapon for?\n\n> **Doctor:** That was in case he was discovered. He'd thought of everything. In case he was found planting the Rx52, his intention was to get into a gunfight, which would have caused the authorities to turn up and cordon off whichever tower he was found in. He would have told them, between shots, that they were 'too late, I've already done the other tower'. Again, this would have caused both buildings to be evacuated.\n\n> **Detective 2:** OK, let me get this straight. Doctor Snow was going to use your device, a time machine, to stop one of the worst atrocities this country has ever experienced?\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes.\n\n> **Detective 2:** And you //stopped him//?\n\n> **Doctor:** Yes, he had to be stopped! I couldn't let him interfere!\n\n> **Detective 2:** Why not? He could have saved thousands of lives!\n\n> **Doctor:** No, no, my god, no. He would have changed history! History is fragile, don't you get it? Had he succeeded, history as we know it would have been completely rewritten! He would have created a paradox! We have no idea what would have happened, it could have decimated the fabric of spacetime! Destroyed existence itself!\n\n> //Both detectives are silent, staring at him//\n\n> **Doctor:** DON'T YOU GET IT? HE COULD HAVE LITERALLY TORN THE UNIVERSE APART!\n\n> **Detective 1:** Sit down please. Sit. Down. We'll get into the physics of it later. Continue with your story. What did you do when you'd listened to the message?\n\n> **Doctor:** I ran as fast as I could to the wormhole chamber. When I got there, he'd already activated it. Beside the door were the canisters of Rx52, with the shotgun and ammunition on top. I screamed at him to stop. He turned to look at me, sneered, and told me I was too late. He was standing in front of the wormhole, there was no way I could have reached him in time to stop him going through. Even if he went through without his equipment, he could still create catastrophic damage to the timeline simply by his presence there. I had no choice, I could NOT let him step through. I grabbed the shotgun from where it was, and aimed it at him. I gave him one last\n\n\n\n**<end transcript>**\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "alternate-history", "crime-fiction", "first-person", "foundation-format", "tale", "time-travel"], "title": "The Recording - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-recording", "year": 2008}, "the-warrior-and-the-dragon": {"created_at": "2008-10-25T13:21:00", "creator": "Kain Pathos Crow", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2008-10-25T13:21:00"}, {"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2008-10-26T12:17:00"}, {"author": "atomicthumbs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/atomicthumbs", "comment": "chakra > chakram", "date": "2009-03-28T00:49:00"}, {"author": "Zankou", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zankou", "comment": "just typos.", "date": "2010-06-03T01:58:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

A massive two-handed claymore was held in place over one of his shoulders, the whirring gears and saws that covered its surfaced trundling away noisily, while the many small blades that made up its jagged edge slowly slid across the rim contentedly, purring like a cat. The beast in front of him was a monolith in the sparse landscape, a monument of destruction, the waves of hatred and anger radiating off of its frame palpable, rivaling even Able\u2019s lust for bloodshed.</p>\n<p>It simply stood there, a mass of heavily plated carapace and flesh, small black eyes in its mammoth skull like holes into the void, resting malevolently above thick serrated fangs, slick with drool. Even as he approached it, it was steadily changing, its tissue warping, the plates and armour growing thicker, mounds of muscle and sinew and bone sliding over each other incessantly, all in a bid to reform into something that would better stand this coming assailant.</p>\n<p>Truly, this was a Godhead of annihilation, a being that embodied the primal destruction of existence. He could hardly contain his glee. After all this time, after the wait of centuries, he would actually meet a being that could surpass his capacity for violence. Maybe.</p>\n<p>He walked until he was mere feet from its colossal form, and, after a moment to savour this wondrous anticipation that he was feeling, he spoke up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have heard tales of creatures like you. Glorious beasts of scale and flesh, talon and fang, a prowess in battle even greater than the immense intellect hiding behind those bestial eyes. They said your kind once ruled the Earth from enormous stockpiles of treasure, killing and eating all who displeased you. But you were knocked from your throne, one by one, by the great warriors who walk this world no longer, until there were no more, and you became but mere myth,\u201d he whispered breathlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven I had thought you to be nothing but fairy tales, but yet, here you stand before me, a living dragon\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a rumble from the beast, and its mouth began to move, cracking open slowly, as a statue come suddenly to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cPathetic\u2026\u201d It grumbled, its voice thick and heavy, like a mountain collapsing into itself a thousand times over.</p>\n<p>\u201cA dragon? You simple little pile of rot. You understand nothing, as I would expect of a well-trained lapdog\u201d</p>\n<p>At this, Able\u2019s expression darkened, and the sound of the sword on his shoulder began to pick up as the blades twirled ever so faster.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026.What?\u201d he said slowly, in a low voice that spoke of rage barely contained.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is what you are, is it not? A trained and broke mutt, bound with a collar and all,\u201d it murmured, gesturing slightly towards the thick metal choker around his shoulders and neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cI chose this,\u201d he replied stiffly, his face contorted into scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhether you chose it or not, you are still a dog of those things. The only difference being that you eat from their hands, rather than a bowl,\u201d it sneered, the expression almost visible on its inhuman face.</p>\n<p>Able\u2019s face twitched, and he tightened his grip on the handle of his weapon, the revolving blades now turning at a considerable speed, protesting with a dull screech.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I can choose my fate,\u201d he roared angrily, launching his sword with a downwards swing at the beast\u2019s head like the almighty wrath of some obscene god.</p>\n<p>But\u2026.</p>\n<p>The creature responded in a way Able had never before seen in all his millennia of fighting.</p>\n<p>It head butted the weapon. The top of its skull and shell shattered into bulky fragments, its eyes bulging as the inside of its cranium was pulverised. One of its eyes burst with a wet pop, and torrents of thick, viscous fluid gushed from its mouth, chunks of meat and tissue pouring forth like a fountain of blood and gore.</p>\n<p>But in head butting the blade, Able was thrown off balance by the force of it, recoiling from the attack automatically, leaving his stomach wide open. In that split second of defencelessness, his sight was filled with the gargantuan fist of the monster, a boulder sized bulk of bony plate, ploughing into his entire torso, smashing into him with the force of a hurricane and knocking his sword from his hands. He was flung over ten metres away like a rag doll, demolishing innumerable obstacles in his way. His body skidded heavily against the ground, shredding the cloth and skin from his back, until he finally came to an abrupt stop, half embedded in a large boulder.</p>\n<p>He hung there limply, streams of blood pouring from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears, his face slack in a stunned expression of amazement.</p>\n<p>And then he laughed. He laughed long and hard, smiling and baring his pointed teeth in a bloody smirk that made it appear that he had just finished a gruesome meal.</p>\n<p>He spoke up in a language long dead, but the meaning of the words he said were unmistakable. He was issuing a challenge.</p>\n<p>But to his surprise, the lizard looked like it was having some kind of seizure. It was repeatedly sucking air in heavily through its nostrils, puffing itself up even bigger than it was normally, and consuming the viscera soaked dirt quickly, its huge claws scrabbling away at the ground, and stuffing clumps of it into its toothy maw.</p>\n<p>And then something amazing happened. The wound, which had warped the creature\u2019s skull into a shape reminiscent of an overripe tomato, began to undo itself, the beast\u2019s head shifting back into its regular shape, the broken plates buckling and falling off to be consumed once more, and revealing a shiny wet carapace formed under the old, even thicker than the last.</p>\n<p>\u201cFate? What would you understand of Fate? Fate is life, and you\u2026 You and all of this is death,\u201d the creature bellowed, beginning to charge towards him.</p>\n<p>At this, Able chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t argue with that,\u201d he replied gleefully, pulling an enormous mace out of the shadows of his ragged cloak, its handle well over six feet in length, its head nothing more than a mass of whirling spikes, screaming obscenely as they spun in an intricate pattern of death.</p>\n<p>The beast lumbered towards him quickly, its mighty footsteps causing the earth to shake, clods of dirt torn up in its wake, bearing down on him with the force and inevitability of an avalanche.</p>\n<p>Able pulled back, standing sideways, moving his arms back behind him and grinding his feet into the ground. He turned towards the impending disaster, swinging his weapon idly with a seasoned flair.</p>\n<p>And then, the beast was upon him, and he swung, time seeming to stop as his weapon once more collided with the creature's head. There was a deafening crunch as its head was crushed again, splattered into pieces, its spine impacting, the monster becoming visibly shorter as the unstoppable force propelling it met with the immovable force colliding with it.</p>\n<p>The sheer amount of chaos generated by those two immense forces meeting launched the reptile several dozen meters away, spinning like an errant missile, lumps of it flying off as it sailed through the air. It hit the earth with a boom, bits and pieces of its frame dotting the landscape around the impact crater like raindrops during spring showers.</p>\n<p>Able cracked his neck, ignoring the blood streaming down the thick gash in his leg, or the three along his chest, gained when his opponent slashed at him as he swung. Instead, he discarded the now bent and still mace behind him with an uncaring toss, popped his shoulders back into place with a jerky, awkward shrug, and started to reset his shattered elbow.</p>\n<p>The creature pushed itself up, eating everything around it, growing heavier, thicker and more rocklike in appearance. It shook off the excess blood from its form like a dog, droplets of the thick dark liquid spattering the earth around it, and began to clump out of the crater.</p>\n<p>It lumbered over the lip of the fissure it had created, only to be greeted with a large chakram shredding into its flesh, the ring digging in as the exterior saw blades spun and forced it ever deeper into the wound. Several more followed suit, flying from Able\u2019s hands as he drew them out of the shadows, running towards his opponent.</p>\n<p>He threw himself into the air, unleashing a monstrous axe from the folds of his cloak, and hammering down onto his opponent like a bomb.</p>\n<p>It shrugged off the attack as a horse does a gnat, trying to swat Able with its huge clawed hands. He dodged and weaved around its sailing fists, planting drill like daggers into its thick hide, leaving them to rip and tear into its flesh. Whenever an attack would come close to landing on him, he would pull himself aside using an embedded knife close at hand.</p>\n<p>Still, the creature showed no sign of slowing its attacks, or even that it felt any pain at all. It was single-minded in its assault, with only one objective in its sight.</p>\n<p>KILL.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a stray claw caught Able across the shoulder, causing him to stumble. He was rewarded for this action with another crushing fist to the gut, pinning him solidly to the ground. The beast lifted its other claw to deal the finishing blow, an executioner's axe raised for its unsightly purpose, then descending in a flash of light and shadow.</p>\n<p>It raised its hand again to crush whatever remained of Able, but was mildly surprised to find that its arm suddenly ended at the elbow, a river of molten blood flowing freely from the wound.</p>\n<p>The other arm quickly followed suit, snipped off at the joint by a gigantic mechanical pair of scissors held by Able, the inner blades spinning feverishly, fresh gore spraying from their moving teeth.</p>\n<p>The monster attempted to consume the fallen limbs and replace what it had lost, only to meet the bladed boot of Able, kicking it directly in the bottom of the jaw and knocking it onto its back.</p>\n<p>Able fell onto the prone creature like a jackal onto its prey, laying into the creature with an animalistic ferocity, screaming incoherently in his berserker blood rage. He kept pounding on the beast with his weapons, pulling out a fresh one each time another got too deeply lodged to pull out, or broken from the sheer strain.</p>\n<p>Eventually, he pulled back, his breathing heavy, drenched completely in vile smelling crimson liquid, a bloody, hellish apparition. He watched it still struggle to breath, its body still trying to reform itself.</p>\n<p>And that was when he saw it. A pulse emitted from the creature, a shockwave that forced aside the very fabric of reality, the world warping around the beast as a shock of electricity quickly ran across its mutilated body.</p>\n<p>But whatever it was, he did not care. It expected no quarter, and he would give it none.</p>\n<p>It looked at him weakly, blatant disgust and hatred still as strong, still as clear as it had always been. He pulled a last long sword out of his shredded cloak, and intended to deliver the final blow.</p>\n<p>The beast bared its fangs, and shot up as his sword descended. His blade buried itself in the roof of the creatures mouth, travelling straight through its brain and out the top of its head, the blades still spinning as they ripped through the pulsing grey matter.</p>\n<p>Still the monster lived, its toothy maw wrapped around Able\u2019s arm. It eyed him smugly, and gently, almost reverently, bit directly through his arm, ivory teeth effortlessly slicing through muscle and bone to meet together with a light click.</p>\n<p>Able staggered back in surprise, and the creature reared back, head butting him in the skull with a piercing crack, knocking him onto his ass.

A massive two-handed claymore was held in place over one of his shoulders, the whirring gears and saws that covered its surfaced trundling away noisily, while the many small blades that made up its jagged edge slowly slid across the rim contentedly, purring like a cat. The beast in front of him was a monolith in the sparse landscape, a monument of destruction, the waves of hatred and anger radiating off of its frame palpable, rivaling even Able\u2019s lust for bloodshed.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It simply stood there, a mass of heavily plated carapace and flesh, small black eyes in its mammoth skull like holes into the void, resting malevolently above thick serrated fangs, slick with drool. Even as he approached it, it was steadily changing, its tissue warping, the plates and armour growing thicker, mounds of muscle and sinew and bone sliding over each other incessantly, all in a bid to reform into something that would better stand this coming assailant.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Truly, this was a Godhead of annihilation, a being that embodied the primal destruction of existence. He could hardly contain his glee. After all this time, after the wait of centuries, he would actually meet a being that could surpass his capacity for violence. Maybe.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He walked until he was mere feet from its colossal form, and, after a moment to savour this wondrous anticipation that he was feeling, he spoke up.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI have heard tales of creatures like you. Glorious beasts of scale and flesh, talon and fang, a prowess in battle even greater than the immense intellect hiding behind those bestial eyes. They said your kind once ruled the Earth from enormous stockpiles of treasure, killing and eating all who displeased you. But you were knocked from your throne, one by one, by the great warriors who walk this world no longer, until there were no more, and you became but mere myth,\u201d he whispered breathlessly.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEven I had thought you to be nothing but fairy tales, but yet, here you stand before me, a living dragon\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a rumble from the beast, and its mouth began to move, cracking open slowly, as a statue come suddenly to life.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPathetic\u2026\u201d It grumbled, its voice thick and heavy, like a mountain collapsing into itself a thousand times over.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA dragon? You simple little pile of rot. You understand nothing, as I would expect of a well-trained lapdog\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this, Able\u2019s expression darkened, and the sound of the sword on his shoulder began to pick up as the blades twirled ever so faster.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026.What?\u201d he said slowly, in a low voice that spoke of rage barely contained.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat is what you are, is it not? A trained and broke mutt, bound with a collar and all,\u201d it murmured, gesturing slightly towards the thick metal choker around his shoulders and neck.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI chose this,\u201d he replied stiffly, his face contorted into scowl.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhether you chose it or not, you are still a dog of those things. The only difference being that you eat from their hands, rather than a bowl,\u201d it sneered, the expression almost visible on its inhuman face.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Able\u2019s face twitched, and he tightened his grip on the handle of his weapon, the revolving blades now turning at a considerable speed, protesting with a dull screech.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAt least I can choose my fate,\u201d he roared angrily, launching his sword with a downwards swing at the beast\u2019s head like the almighty wrath of some obscene god.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But\u2026.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The creature responded in a way Able had never before seen in all his millennia of fighting.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It head butted the weapon. The top of its skull and shell shattered into bulky fragments, its eyes bulging as the inside of its cranium was pulverised. One of its eyes burst with a wet pop, and torrents of thick, viscous fluid gushed from its mouth, chunks of meat and tissue pouring forth like a fountain of blood and gore.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in head butting the blade, Able was thrown off balance by the force of it, recoiling from the attack automatically, leaving his stomach wide open. In that split second of defencelessness, his sight was filled with the gargantuan fist of the monster, a boulder sized bulk of bony plate, ploughing into his entire torso, smashing into him with the force of a hurricane and knocking his sword from his hands. He was flung over ten metres away like a rag doll, demolishing innumerable obstacles in his way. His body skidded heavily against the ground, shredding the cloth and skin from his back, until he finally came to an abrupt stop, half embedded in a large boulder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He hung there limply, streams of blood pouring from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears, his face slack in a stunned expression of amazement.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then he laughed. He laughed long and hard, smiling and baring his pointed teeth in a bloody smirk that made it appear that he had just finished a gruesome meal.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoke up in a language long dead, but the meaning of the words he said were unmistakable. He was issuing a challenge.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to his surprise, the lizard looked like it was having some kind of seizure. It was repeatedly sucking air in heavily through its nostrils, puffing itself up even bigger than it was normally, and consuming the viscera soaked dirt quickly, its huge claws scrabbling away at the ground, and stuffing clumps of it into its toothy maw.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then something amazing happened. The wound, which had warped the creature\u2019s skull into a shape reminiscent of an overripe tomato, began to undo itself, the beast\u2019s head shifting back into its regular shape, the broken plates buckling and falling off to be consumed once more, and revealing a shiny wet carapace formed under the old, even thicker than the last.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFate? What would you understand of Fate? Fate is life, and you\u2026 You and all of this is death,\u201d the creature bellowed, beginning to charge towards him.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this, Able chuckled.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I can\u2019t argue with that,\u201d he replied gleefully, pulling an enormous mace out of the shadows of his ragged cloak, its handle well over six feet in length, its head nothing more than a mass of whirling spikes, screaming obscenely as they spun in an intricate pattern of death.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The beast lumbered towards him quickly, its mighty footsteps causing the earth to shake, clods of dirt torn up in its wake, bearing down on him with the force and inevitability of an avalanche.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Able pulled back, standing sideways, moving his arms back behind him and grinding his feet into the ground. He turned towards the impending disaster, swinging his weapon idly with a seasoned flair.\n\n\n\nAnd then, the beast was upon him, and he swung, time seeming to stop as his weapon once more collided with the creature's head. There was a deafening crunch as its head was crushed again, splattered into pieces, its spine impacting, the monster becoming visibly shorter as the unstoppable force propelling it met with the immovable force colliding with it.\n\n\n\nThe sheer amount of chaos generated by those two immense forces meeting launched the reptile several dozen meters away, spinning like an errant missile, lumps of it flying off as it sailed through the air. It hit the earth with a boom, bits and pieces of its frame dotting the landscape around the impact crater like raindrops during spring showers.\n\n\n\nAble cracked his neck, ignoring the blood streaming down the thick gash in his leg, or the three along his chest, gained when his opponent slashed at him as he swung. Instead, he discarded the now bent and still mace behind him with an uncaring toss, popped his shoulders back into place with a jerky, awkward shrug, and started to reset his shattered elbow.\n\n\n\nThe creature pushed itself up, eating everything around it, growing heavier, thicker and more rocklike in appearance. It shook off the excess blood from its form like a dog, droplets of the thick dark liquid spattering the earth around it, and began to clump out of the crater.\n\n\n\nIt lumbered over the lip of the fissure it had created, only to be greeted with a large chakram shredding into its flesh, the ring digging in as the exterior saw blades spun and forced it ever deeper into the wound. Several more followed suit, flying from Able\u2019s hands as he drew them out of the shadows, running towards his opponent.\n\n\n\nHe threw himself into the air, unleashing a monstrous axe from the folds of his cloak, and hammering down onto his opponent like a bomb.\n\n\n\nIt shrugged off the attack as a horse does a gnat, trying to swat Able with its huge clawed hands. He dodged and weaved around its sailing fists, planting drill like daggers into its thick hide, leaving them to rip and tear into its flesh. Whenever an attack would come close to landing on him, he would pull himself aside using an embedded knife close at hand.\n\n\n\nStill, the creature showed no sign of slowing its attacks, or even that it felt any pain at all. It was single-minded in its assault, with only one objective in its sight.\n\n\n\nKILL.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a stray claw caught Able across the shoulder, causing him to stumble. He was rewarded for this action with another crushing fist to the gut, pinning him solidly to the ground. The beast lifted its other claw to deal the finishing blow, an executioner's axe raised for its unsightly purpose, then descending in a flash of light and shadow.\n\n\n\nIt raised its hand again to crush whatever remained of Able, but was mildly surprised to find that its arm suddenly ended at the elbow, a river of molten blood flowing freely from the wound.\n\n\n\nThe other arm quickly followed suit, snipped off at the joint by a gigantic mechanical pair of scissors held by Able, the inner blades spinning feverishly, fresh gore spraying from their moving teeth.\n\n\n\nThe monster attempted to consume the fallen limbs and replace what it had lost, only to meet the bladed boot of Able, kicking it directly in the bottom of the jaw and knocking it onto its back.\n\n\n\nAble fell onto the prone creature like a jackal onto its prey, laying into the creature with an animalistic ferocity, screaming incoherently in his berserker blood rage. He kept pounding on the beast with his weapons, pulling out a fresh one each time another got too deeply lodged to pull out, or broken from the sheer strain. \n\n\n\nEventually, he pulled back, his breathing heavy, drenched completely in vile smelling crimson liquid, a bloody, hellish apparition. He watched it still struggle to breath, its body still trying to reform itself.\n\n\n\nAnd that was when he saw it. A pulse emitted from the creature, a shockwave that forced aside the very fabric of reality, the world warping around the beast as a shock of electricity quickly ran across its mutilated body.\n\n\n\nBut whatever it was, he did not care. It expected no quarter, and he would give it none.\n\n\n\nIt looked at him weakly, blatant disgust and hatred still as strong, still as clear as it had always been. He pulled a last long sword out of his shredded cloak, and intended to deliver the final blow.\n\n\n\nThe beast bared its fangs, and shot up as his sword descended. His blade buried itself in the roof of the creatures mouth, travelling straight through its brain and out the top of its head, the blades still spinning as they ripped through the pulsing grey matter.\n\n\n\nStill the monster lived, its toothy maw wrapped around Able\u2019s arm. It eyed him smugly, and gently, almost reverently, bit directly through his arm, ivory teeth effortlessly slicing through muscle and bone to meet together with a light click.\n\n\n\nAble staggered back in surprise, and the creature reared back, head butting him in the skull with a piercing crack, knocking him onto his ass. It gave him a final cold look, and opened its mouth to consume him.\n\n\n\nBefore its jaws closed around him, Able grabbed the sword still embedded in its head, grasping the hilt from inside its mouth. As the beasts mouth closed around him, he forced it down with all of his strength, slicing the beast clean in two.\n\n\n\nBut its motions, once set in action, could not be stopped. Its teeth cleaved his upper torso in two, freeing his remaining arm and head to flop lifelessly on the ground.\n\n\n\nWith his final moments of consciousness, Able thought he could hear a strange whistling sound, like something falling from a great height.\n\n\n\nThen\u2026 only darkness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime passed as a dreamless sleep, and Able awoke to find himself whole and anew, back in his tomb. He moved jerkily, forcing open the coffin that held him, pushing aside the chains hurriedly in a bid to get out of that bitter cold.\n\n\n\nIt took him several minutes to unlock the stone door that blocked his escape, all the time pawing at the frosty ground with his boots, his breath crystallizing in front of him.\n\n\n\nWhen he finally did emerge, he breathed a sigh of relief. He had never liked the cold, being more a man for heat and warmth.\n\n\n\nStill, he reasoned to himself, that was most likely the best fight he had had in ages. There should be a feast to celebrate, with all of his team. Now where had they put that strange \"pizza\" box?\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "able", "action", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "tale"], "title": "The Warrior And The Dragon - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-warrior-and-the-dragon", "year": 2008}, "what-love-is-pt-1": {"created_at": "2008-12-23T07:46:00", "creator": "agatharights", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-23T07:46:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-23T07:54:00"}, {"author": "agatharights", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/agatharights", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-23T08:06:00"}, {"author": "Melfice", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/melfice", "comment": "Just a small change that makes the sentence feel better to me.\nThere's another change that would make it flow better, but would change the whole sentence, though it would mean roughly the same.", "date": "2009-09-09T21:17:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "rating module", "date": "2011-01-02T23:58:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: adult, tale.

His arms hang well to his knees, but they are too constantly in motion to tell, the inhumanly long, slim fingers, wrapped around a book and drumming on the arm of his chair. He looks up with mismatched eyes, lips pursed in bemused thought, before splitting into a grin that spans practically the full width of his face.</em></p>\n<p>I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry. You want me to talk about\u2026what?</p>\n<p>No, no, it\u2019s fine. I should have expected the most bizarre conversation as soon as you came in with a tape recorder. And for once, I don\u2019t even have to take anything open to speak about it, ja?</p>\n<p>Love\u2026I\u2019m not sure if I can answer, exactly, what love is to me. <em>Liebe</em>\u2026</p>\n<p>You know\u2026that feeling you get, when the person you love very much touches you? Not like <em>that</em>, well, yes like that\u2026but no matter where or when, that touch. When they place a hand upon your shoulder or gently brush their fingertips against the small of your back\u2026that is what living tissue feels like. Once you get past the skin and into the true workings of the body, it\u2019s just\u2026that. Very real, hard to deny.</p>\n<p>\u2026I\u2019m honestly surprised and impressed. Most, at this point, would have left the room\u2026</p>\n<p>Oh, yes, I\u2019ll continue.</p>\n<p>I long lost the urge to engage in copulation, you know that\u2026but that does not mean that I do not still make love, if in different ways. A dear friend of mine- don\u2019t give me that look, child. I still make friends, you know that. But a dear friend of mine was in an\u2026accident, of sorts. She was eviscerated, slit open from her collarbone down to her pelvic bone. Everybody else left her for dead in that moment, but I\u2026could not.</p>\n<p>Even as I knelt down beside her, she attempted to smile. Her diaphragm was, of course, badly damaged and one of her lungs ripped open, so she couldn\u2019t truly speak, but I am fairly good at reading lips. She spoke to me- \u201c<em>Mein Herz ist jetzt deins</em>\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy heart is yours now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Earlier I had\u2026admitted that, were she to ever let her guard down around me, I would pluck her heart from her chest- oh, such a <em>sch\u00f6nes Herz</em>, perfect and beautiful in sound, always such a steady beat, even when she was scared.</p>\n<p>I will admit, I was tempted. She was so broken, the poor muscles and flesh all ripped and torn asunder\u2026but even if nobody else would try to fix her, I <em>knew</em> that I could, <em>mein Gott</em>, I knew it.</p>\n<p>The worst damage was to her chest. The ribcage, oh, those poor ribs\u2026the sternum had been pushed aside, into her lungs. It was very lucky that I had quite a bit of wire and string on me, indeed. I was able to repair the damage to her lungs best I could, and the entire ribcage had to be wired back into place. It wasn\u2019t a perfect job, but I would be able to do more later, for now, I just had to keep her alive before she bled out.</p>\n<p><em>Was</em>? Oh\u2026yes, I can gloss over the details, if you insist, but yes\u2026she lived. For another three years, she lived.</p>\n<p>Love?</p>\n<p>\u2026Love was when I was inside her.</p>\n<p>No, not like that. Don\u2019t give me that look when I\u2019m trying to explain something, child.</p>\n<p>To feel her whole body, so alive, still alive, to know that she could be saved\u2026when I gently sewed her broken intestines back together, or when I coaxed her heart to resume beating when it threatened to stop\u2026that was love. It was, indeed, comparable to making love, if not in ecstasy, but in emotion. To gently close her body back up and watch as she breathed on her own was utter relief and bliss.</p>\n<p>Love is\u2026<em>Hei\u00df und na\u00df</em>. Love is warm and wet. It\u2019s alive and throbbing, moving\u2026flushed with blood and-</p>\n<p>\u2026You look uncomfortable. Would you like for me to stop? I am almost done, <em>Ich verspreche</em>. Hah.</p>\n<p>You see\u2026our interpretations of love aren\u2019t that different when you get down to it. There\u2019s still that first soft, gentle touch, and then delving into something far more\u2026intimate. Whether it\u2019s through flesh and blood or not.

His arms hang well to his knees, but they are too constantly in motion to tell, the inhumanly long, slim fingers, wrapped around a book and drumming on the arm of his chair. He looks up with mismatched eyes, lips pursed in bemused thought, before splitting into a grin that spans practically the full width of his face.//\n\n\n\nI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry. You want me to talk about\u2026what?\n\n\n\nNo, no, it\u2019s fine. I should have expected the most bizarre conversation as soon as you came in with a tape recorder. And for once, I don\u2019t even have to take anything open to speak about it, ja?\n\n\n\nLove\u2026I\u2019m not sure if I can answer, exactly, what love is to me. //Liebe//\u2026\n\n\n\nYou know\u2026that feeling you get, when the person you love very much touches you? Not like //that//, well, yes like that\u2026but no matter where or when, that touch. When they place a hand upon your shoulder or gently brush their fingertips against the small of your back\u2026that is what living tissue feels like. Once you get past the skin and into the true workings of the body, it\u2019s just\u2026that. Very real, hard to deny.\n\n\n\n\u2026I\u2019m honestly surprised and impressed. Most, at this point, would have left the room\u2026\n\n\n\nOh, yes, I\u2019ll continue.\n\n\n\nI long lost the urge to engage in copulation, you know that\u2026but that does not mean that I do not still make love, if in different ways. A dear friend of mine- don\u2019t give me that look, child. I still make friends, you know that. But a dear friend of mine was in an\u2026accident, of sorts. She was eviscerated, slit open from her collarbone down to her pelvic bone. Everybody else left her for dead in that moment, but I\u2026could not.\n\n\n\nEven as I knelt down beside her, she attempted to smile. Her diaphragm was, of course, badly damaged and one of her lungs ripped open, so she couldn\u2019t truly speak, but I am fairly good at reading lips. She spoke to me- \u201c//Mein Herz ist jetzt deins//\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy heart is yours now.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier I had\u2026admitted that, were she to ever let her guard down around me, I would pluck her heart from her chest- oh, such a //sch\u00f6nes Herz//, perfect and beautiful in sound, always such a steady beat, even when she was scared.\n\n\n\nI will admit, I was tempted. She was so broken, the poor muscles and flesh all ripped and torn asunder\u2026but even if nobody else would try to fix her, I //knew// that I could, //mein Gott//, I knew it.\n\n\n\nThe worst damage was to her chest. The ribcage, oh, those poor ribs...the sternum had been pushed aside, into her lungs. It was very lucky that I had quite a bit of wire and string on me, indeed. I was able to repair the damage to her lungs best I could, and the entire ribcage had to be wired back into place. It wasn\u2019t a perfect job, but I would be able to do more later, for now, I just had to keep her alive before she bled out.\n\n\n\n//Was//? Oh\u2026yes, I can gloss over the details, if you insist, but yes\u2026she lived. For another three years, she lived.\n\n\n\nLove?\n\n\n\n\u2026Love was when I was inside her.\n\n\n\nNo, not like that. Don\u2019t give me that look when I\u2019m trying to explain something, child.\n\n\n\nTo feel her whole body, so alive, still alive, to know that she could be saved\u2026when I gently sewed her broken intestines back together, or when I coaxed her heart to resume beating when it threatened to stop\u2026that was love. It was, indeed, comparable to making love, if not in ecstasy, but in emotion. To gently close her body back up and watch as she breathed on her own was utter relief and bliss.\n\n\n\nLove is\u2026//Hei\u00df und na\u00df//. Love is warm and wet. It\u2019s alive and throbbing, moving\u2026flushed with blood and-\n\n\n\n\u2026You look uncomfortable. Would you like for me to stop? I am almost done, //Ich verspreche//. Hah.\n\n\n\nYou see\u2026our interpretations of love aren\u2019t that different when you get down to it. There\u2019s still that first soft, gentle touch, and then delving into something far more...intimate. Whether it\u2019s through flesh and blood or not. And then everything is warm and wet, and alive.\n\n\n\n\u2026You\u2019re the color of a tomato. Lets stop this and play chess, //mein Doktor//. Maybe we can even bet on the stakes this time\u2026we could put those lovely eyes of yours on the table. No? Well\u2026maybe next time, //ja//?\n\n\n\nI really would be gentle, you know.\n\n\n\n//Hei\u00df und na\u00df//, indeed.\n\n\n\nI call white this time.\n\n\n\n[[Note - Doing some minor edits over time as friends who know some German (unlike me) read it over.]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-rights", "first-person", "romance", "tale"], "title": "What Love Is, Part One - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/what-love-is-pt-1", "year": 2008}}
