Words spoken again and again, she squeals and screams, and it starts all again. It's repetitive, but not enough to form even a rhythm of pain.

She was content to die that day, trapped inside the [[size 110%]] ##red|\"GOD'S\"## [[/size]] domain. As she closed her eyes, it all began to spark.

She rubs the dust out of her eyes, grumbling as she finds her glasses, hidden within the haphazardly thrown about sheets. It wasn't her fault though, she didn't really think she would be sleeping.\n\n\n\nShe puts on her glasses, getting up to acquire a cup of coffee, as a stray thought passes her mind. It's so vile that it comes out of her mouth, venomous and confused.\n\n\n\n\"... why the fuck am I dreaming of //Clef.//\"\n", "references": [], "tags": ["afterlife", "doctor-light", "eventyr", "fantasy", "religious-fiction", "surrealism", "tale"], "title": "A Good Light's Sleep - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-good-lights-sleep", "year": 2025}, "a-passing-rain": {"created_at": "2025-01-27T19:01:00", "creator": "Uncle Nicolini", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-27T19:01:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "Added tags: bleak, faeowynn-wilson, lgbtq, tale, wilsons-wildlife.

What did you say his name was?\" \n\n\n\nFae blinked. \"I don't think I told you.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's why I'm asking.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Oseman.\" She lied.\n\n\n\nAnother, more pregnant pause.\n\n\n\n\"Fae...\" Alex sighed.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" Her tone betrayed her.\n\n\n\n\"There's only one psychiatry practice in Boring. I called last night and asked for a list of their practicing doctors, and Oseman is not one of them.\" \n\n\n\n\"How do you know I didn't go to Portlands?\"\n\n\n\n\"No one's heard of or from Portlands in months.\"\n\n\n\n\"I meant Portland. Singular.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know you hate it the--\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine. You got me. I haven't been going to see a psychiatrist.\" She folded her arms.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that you didn't actually go to one after promising me you'd go.\" Alex took a step towards her, putting a hand on her arm. \"Fae. I love you. I know what the Center meant to you. What it meant to your dad. It means a lot to me too. But we can't keep living in the past. You need to talk to someone. Someone qualified. As much as I wish I could help you, I can't.\"\n\n\n\nFae sighed, to which Alex leaned in and got on is tiptoes to kiss her. \n\n\n\n\"You're right. I hear the Supervisors are offering counseling to all their employees, and we qualify as them. I'll talk to Tarpan today.\" Fae was stubborn, but she was willing to see where she had been wrong.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"And thank you for sticking with me through my bullshit.\" Fae cocked her head down and kissed Alex.\n\n\n\n\"So how about marrying me now?\" He teased.\n\n\n\n\"I'll have to think about it.\"\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**<<** **__[[[I Told You That I Was Afraid]]]__** **|** The World Kept Turning **|** **__[[[I Want To Listen]]]__** **>>**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wikimodule\">:scp-wiki:component:wikimodule</a> |normal= --]]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Uncle Nicolini]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["i-told-you-that-i-was-afraid", "i-want-to-listen", "scp-6512", "scp-4046", "scp-4982", "scp-1799", "scp-4003", "scp-7221", "scp-4967", "abraka-davids-proposal", "scp-6726", "scp-5047", "scp-es-101-j", "scp-7727", "scp-057-int", "scp-7337", "scp-es-227", "gluttony-is-impossible", "lillian-lillihammer-and-the-great-meme-war", "veilfall", "tactical-theology-disciplinary-meeting-diana-ribiero", "pediatric-para-psychology", "yamizushi-file-no995", "the-remains-of-the-day", "theres-ngo-helping-this-one", "grant-request-post-mortem-neural-preservation", "drunkenly-stumbling-down-memory-lane", "chicago-factory", "raisa-6147", "project-proposal-2018-145", "wilsons-orientation", "life-insurance-policy", "sciptember-2022-art", "uncle-nicolini-author-page", "ode-to-the-unknown-author", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bleak", "faeowynn-wilson", "lgbtq", "slice-of-life", "tale", "wilsons-wildlife"], "title": "A Passing Rain - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-passing-rain", "year": 2025}, "adrift-in-an-ocean-of-memories": {"created_at": "2025-01-25T02:51:00", "creator": "Queerious", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Queerious", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/queerious", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-25T02:51:00"}, {"author": "Queerious", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/queerious", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-25T02:54:00"}, {"author": "Queerious", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/queerious", "comment": "Added tags: forgotten-memories, tale.

This surge, and subsequent geological activity, would result in a warning ping from the OROGENESIS system.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Upon reception, its data was put through thaumaturgic processing. This allowed it to be identified as the temporary creation of an unstable Way, and its near-immediate collapse \u2014 which had taken one of the mine\u2019s tunnels down with it.\n<p>Due to MTF Gamma-89 (\u201cRock and a Hard Place\u201d) being temporarily offsite, the resultant collapse was investigated by Director Hellen Gibbs and Dr. Rudy Weller.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Dr. Weller pulls open the door to the mine with a grunt, sunlight from the outside briefly filters through the dust and dirt as he and Dir. Gibbs enter and begin to head downwards. Both are dressed in high-vis PPE,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> with active headlamps.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> I'm surprised you're the one coming down here with me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> I like to know what's happening in my site. A thaumaturgy-linked mine collapse is a major concern.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Weller shakes his head as he trudges forward.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Anomalous phenomena slowing down here my foot, it still feels like a magnet for oddities.</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> At the very least, we didn't detect any further compromise in the surrounding parts of the mine. A small-scale detonation, a collapse at the end of a single tunnel.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> The vibrations from the collapse weren't enough to stir anything, were they?</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> <em>[She shakes her head]</em> OROGENESIS would've pinged us if it did. Seems like the thaumaturgical blast was too weak to set off anything below.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Thank god. We don't need anything crawling outta hell whilst we're on a rescue mission.</p>\n<p><em>Her face has turned to worry. Dr. Weller pauses and glances at her.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Don't kid with me, Hellen. I know you're worried, but we both know that someone might be down here.</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> I'm more than worried. I think there <em>is</em> someone down here. It was a <em>Way</em>, Rudy. Someone could've come through it before it fell.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Weller ducks his head in a nod, though his expression is uncertain. The two of them pick up their pace.</em></p>\n<p><em>As the two walk, Dr. Weller pulls a small map from his hip \u2014 the spot of the collapse marked with a sharpie. He traces his finger along as they travel through the mine. They take a left, a right, cross a mesh bridge built over a gap and pass old equipment and minecart rails. Every once and a while, Dir. Gibbs reaches over to the wall and flips a heavy switch \u2014 turning on old lights with a heavy THUNK!</em></p>\n<p><em>They turn a final corner, and find what they're looking for. A few meters down, the ceiling of the tunnel has been partially collapsed \u2014 damaged supports and fallen rock.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> \u2026We should tread lightly. Dunno how stable all that looks.</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> Indeed.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Weller approaches the collapse, staring up at the snapped wooden supports \u2014 he squints.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> They look burnt.</p>\n<p><em>Dir. Gibbs, who'd been crouched next to a small gap in the rocks \u2014 seemingly attempting to peer beyond the collapse \u2014 looks up.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> Looks like the effects of the Way detonating. Look at the ceiling \u2014 swirl patterns.</p>\n<p><em>She points at the cave roof, Dr. Weller turns up the brightness of his hardhat's light, and it fully illuminates glittering patterns peaking out from some of the boulders and ceiling. Odd, discordant swirls that branch off one another with an ashen glitter.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Thaumaturgic imprints. Right, right.</p>\n<p><em>From beyond the fallen rocks and broken wood, a quiet groan is heard. Dir. Gibbs and Dr. Weller both jolt, eyes wide.</em></p>\n<p><em>Dir. Gibbs crouches by a part in the rocks, and angles her flashlight so that it can somewhat shine into the small gap. Against the dark, she can see scorch marks along the tunnel floor, burned-in runes on the far wall.</em></p>\n<p><em>And a battered figure collapsed amongst the dust.</em></p>\n<p><em>After a moment of silence, Dir. Gibbs opens and closes her mouth a few times before speaking.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Gibbs:</strong> \u2026Are you okay?</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Weller crouches down next to her, brow knitted in concern and alarm. His hand, pre-emptively, rests against his hip as though prepared to pull a weapon. Dir. Gibbs glances at him warily.</em></p>\n<p><em>The figure shifts and sits up slowly.

Is there a correlation I'm missing?\" the door shutters shut behind him with a heavy slam, and they walk away from the door and towards a small wooden shack. Weller slips a key off his hip, and opens it up \u2014 the old door creaking in protest of their entrance.</p>\n<p>\"I think in this case, it's coincidence, Rudy,\" Gibbs replies, hanging her hardhat on a wall-mounted rack. \"I don't think fi meant to end up underground.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe,\" the old man sighs in response. Gibbs simply hums quietly to herself, opening the small closet space to stow her high-vis vest. \"I dunno how to feel about all that, though. Feels strange.\"</p>\n<p>\"A little, but I\u2019m curious.\"</p>\n<p>Weller sighs, \"Yeah, well, if you end up back down there be damned careful. We know nothing of that PoI.\"</p>\n<p>She can hear the tense sort of annoyance in his voice.</p>\n<p>\"I know, I know.\u201d Gibbs sighs, \u201cYou can get back to work, Rudy. I saw you were handling integrating some new volunteers when the change of plans hit.\" she glances at him, extending a hand to take and hang his vest, \"my schedule for the day is clear, anyways.\"</p>\n<p>She hears Weller grunt as he slips off the high-vis and hands it off to her, seeming to consider her words for a few moments. \"Bah, I'd almost rather deal with dragons over interns.\" he jokes, \"But yeah, yeah. I will. But\u2014\" he pointedly pokes her shoulder, \"\u2014<em>you</em> better keep your guard up. Be careful.\"</p>\n<p>\"You don\u2019t have to lecture your own Director, Rudy.\u201d Gibbs chuckles as the man heaves a mockingly dramatic sigh, though it's all in good nature. She leads the way out of the storage shack, and strides away from the mine's heavy doors, across the grass and gravel towards the containment fence that keeps the entrance fully sealed. The Director presses her palm to a scanner. It hums to life, before the fence rumbles open and allows the two departure. They cross the Site's lot over towards the building itself \u2014 one that sits nestled in the gap between two mountains, with an overgrown swamp and a lone road as its sole neighbors.</p>\n<p>Gibbs swipes her keycard, holds the door open for Weller, and they both slip inside.</p>\n<p>Site-898 is primarily a white-walled research facility, small in scale (by Foundation standards, that is) but they've done work to make it feel like home. After giving a nod to one of the few members of Site security, Gibbs passes by colorful posters and doors to offices propped open with (non-anomalous) rock samples. Windows let sunlight filter in, reflecting off display cases of various minerals and crystals from around the world.</p>\n<p>Weller peels off when she enters the Site's Habitation Sector; a two story space that looked akin to a hotel's open lobby, which holds host to the Site's population of roughly 100 staff. The roof curves into a dome above her head, a few windows shine light down onto the foyer of the second floor that rims the room. The center fixture of it all was a behemoth crystal \u2014 deep and glittering black, with conical spiked protrusions. A scale from the deceased <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8007\">SCP-8007</a> instance of Plosky Tolbachik. It sits as part of a fountain, and she catches the glimpse of Dr. Lindsey's much-beloved koi fish swimming happily inside amidst bits of foliage. Well-socialized little critters, currently being spoiled with treats via two researchers sat on the fountain's rim. She greets them, and others milling around the space, with a small nod or wave as she passes through towards the cafeteria.</p>\n<p>She gets a concerned look from one when she slips a first-aid kit from the wall and stores it under her arm, as she passes into the mess hall.</p>\n<p>It's a quick in-and-out sort of trip. She asks the nearest cook for a to-go container, and filled it with various bits of food. Some rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and corn. She throws a plastic fork in there, tucks a water bottle into her pocket, and it's back into the August heat to re-enter the Red Brook Mine.</p>\n<p>Gibbs re-opens the gate, dons her PPE, and tugs open the door.</p>\n<p>The air of the mine is far cooler than the frankly sweltering outside, and she's quite glad for that. It's a five minute walk through tunnels, over gaps, in the sprawling mine \u2014 before Gibbs returns to that collapsed dead end. Evidently, her footsteps had been quite audible, as she sees three blue eyes shining back at her from through the gap in the rock.</p>\n<p>\"You're back,\" she hears Draws remark, the corners of the three eyes upturned.</p>\n<p>\"Brought a first aid kit, some food and water. Let's see if I cram it through, or if I'm gonna be sending it in pieces.\" Gibbs replies, sitting down by the collapse. The first aid kit does, in fact, end up being too wide to fit the gap. So Gibbs takes out the bottle of antibiotic, water and medical gauze, passing it into Draws' clawed hand.</p>\n<p>\"All I need to do is clean and bandage them, right?\" fi asks quietly, \"I've never really gotten burned before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Rinse with water, dry it, apply the antibiotic and then wrap it.\" Gibbs replies with a nod, and she hears Draws occasionally hiss as fi does as instructed. After a few moments, Draws starts to talk.</p>\n<p>\"This is a mine, right? I see wooden supports 'n stuff.\" the words come out slightly strained, as fi works to tend to the burns.</p>\n<p>\"Indeed. It used to be a coal mine, primarily.\" Gibbs replies, leaning back against the rock. She rests a hand on the to-go container, she can pass it to Draws once fi finishes fixing firself up.</p>\n<p>\"Is this place in the Appalachians, then?\"</p>\n<p>Now <em>that</em> came as a bit of a surprise. Gibbs turns her head, raises an eyebrow, \"Pennsylvania, yes. How did you know?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, it's kinda a coin flip,\" Draws chuckles, a tad sheepish, \"coal really only is dug up on the East Coast or the Midwest in America. Which is where I assumed we were.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have geological knowledge,\" the woman remarks, brow raising, \"intriguing coincidence.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mm?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm a geologist, as are my workers. This mine sits below Geological Research Site-898.\"</p>\n<p>There's a pause, seemingly of shock, before Draws goes, \"Wow\u2026 okay\u2014 alright,\" with a certain giddiness tracing fir tone. \"That lady didn't lie then.\"</p>\n<p>\"About what?\"</p>\n<p>\"When I was looking for \u2014 for the spell that I used \u2014 I asked a lady behind the checkout for how I control where I go. She said that, sometimes, you don't? But Ways have a \u2014 ha \u2014 <em>way</em> with things. Sometimes they take you just where you need to go.\"</p>\n<p>\"So more than a coincidence,\" Gibbs smiles.</p>\n<p>\"And more like magic.\" Draws agrees.</p>\n<p>\"So you've studied the field?\" Gibbs tilts her head, even though Draws can't see her.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah! I ah\u2014 I remember studying it in the Library. I don't\u2026 think I had a traditional schooling, but I liked wandering around the Stacks and picking up books on it. Did you know the Library has its own deposits?\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't,\" Gibbs says, interest lining her tone, \"can you tell me about them? I've never seen the Library.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well! The lantern koi will spit up this incandescent liquid every once and a while \u2014 it's like a glass? Silica, probably. And they'll form these bead-y looking stalactites on the undersides of shelves and ceilings. They glow like they have fireflies inside them,\" Draws' voice has come to life \u2014 forgoing the earlier pain and strain, becoming suddenly quite animated. Gibbs smiles softly. As she listens to the other talk, she finds her gaze tracing a rivulet of water that drips down the wall near her. The rainwater from a few days past must finally be working its way down.</p>\n<p>\"There are scales from the Serpent tucked far down below if you know where to look \u2014 they've been fossilized by paper and stone which <em>looks</em> really damn weird. The scales are like\u2026 all layered? And they've been pressed down by the Library above and cemented into this glittering calcite-type stuff. They're a deep green with a sort of oil-y sheen to em. I wish I could've broken off a piece to take with, but they're super sturdy.\" Draws\u2019 voice echoes off the mine\u2019s walls, the sounds of shifting feathers indicating fir wings fluttering as fi speaks.</p>\n<p>\"That sounds wonderous,\" Gibbs hums, \"it makes sense that a place as infinite and sprawling as the Wanderers' Library would host not just its own ecosystem, but its own geological processes.\" The rivulet ends at a puddle carved by erosion, and still she watches the water drip.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah\u2026 I wish I could've explored more,\" Draws' voice dips down in volume, becoming a bit smaller. Gibbs is pretty sure fi shrinks inwards, too.</p>\n<p>A tilt of the head, another water droplet hits the puddle.</p>\n<p>\"Do you remember now why you left?\"</p>\n<p>She hears a rustling, probably Draws shaking fir head before realizing Gibbs can't see and goes, \"No. I just\u2026 I know I was scared. Relieved? I'd\u2026 done something before I left. Not a bad thing!\" Gibbs vaguely sees Draws' waving fir claws in the air, \"I did something that\u2026 made me feel relieved. But in doing it I don't think I was\u2026 safe anymore?\"</p>\n<p>Gibbs listens, making a quiet sound to indicate such, and furrows her brow. The dragon beyond the rocks sounds both confused and\u2026 lost.</p>\n<p>She finds herself fishing a small pebble out from the puddle.</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't safe. So I ran. I think it was part of a plan because I already had the spell to leave. I just\u2026 I don't remember.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you remember?\" Gibbs tilts her head, \"about your time in the Library.\"</p>\n<p>There's a long pause. Silence broken only once by a droplet of water.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I grew up in there.\"</p>\n<p><em>Drip.</em></p>\n<p>\"Alone?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\" The response is quick. \"I had others.\" a pause, hesitation, \"I don't\u2026 I don't think I liked them.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Gibbs replies softly, frowning. There's a lapse into silence. She tries to peak a little further into the gap, and sees Draws' gaze is downcast \u2014 face twisted into something that seems equal parts confused, and conflicted. When she straightens up again, she elects to change topics.</p>\n<p>\"I brought you food and water, if you're hungry.\" She places the smooth, water-shiny pebble onto the to-go container.</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" she sees Draws' perk up.</p>\n<p>\"Yup, here\u2014\" Gibbs scoops up the container, and holds it up to the gap. A pair of feathered hands, with curved black claws, reaches out and tentatively takes it.</p>\n<p>\"Might've gotten cold, sorry about that.\" she chuckles lightly. Gibbs smiles a little, when she sees Draws gently pick up the pebble in fir claws, and stares at it.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" The pebble is slipped into the pocket of a tattered coat, \"It's alright! I can fix that,\" Gibbs is about to ask what that means, before there's a few small flashes of blue-purple light from the gap. The faint smell of smoke.</p>\n<p><em>Right. A dragon.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Ohh! Fuck yes I love potatoes,\"</em> she hears Draws' murmuring excitedly as fi opens the container.</p>\n<p>Gibbs shifts her sitting position, and quiet repacks the first aid kit so she can return it later. She raises her head when she hears Draws shift \u2014 claws scraping against stone.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you \u2014 uh,\" a pause, \"ma'am? What was your name again? You said it earlier but I'm really bad with names.\"</p>\n<p>She chuckles, \"Hellen Gibbs.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay! Alright, alright. And you know mine too, right? Did I tell you about the middle part?\" She watches, curiously, as Draws seems to draw firself inwards again.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think you did.\" Gibbs blinks, tilts her head.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Well, uh \u2014 I think my\u2026 what's the word \u2014 middle name? It's two dashes.\" The statement is awkward, a touch confused.</p>\n<p>\"Two dashes?\" Gibbs echoes, \"How'd that happen?\" Her eyes briefly flicks over to the puddle again, when an especially large droplet splatters against its surface.</p>\n<p>\"Um. I'm\u2026 not sure? It's just sorta on my Library card. Two little dashes. So I assume it's part of my name. Those show your true name, y'know?\" she hears Draws' tap fir talons against the rock. A quiet <em>tink-tink-tink.</em></p>\n<p>\"Huh.\" Gibbs blinks a bit, \"interesting.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah I don't know why it's like that either,\" Draws says sheepishly, \"maybe it's just Library-weirdness.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't know either,\" Gibbs chuckles, \"but I'll keep that bit in mind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alrighty,\" fi replies, and there's more shuffling before the Styrofoam container appears half-through the hole. \"I finished the food you brought.\"</p>\n<p>Gibbs takes the container back, \"Good, good. I'll be sure to bring you more later, alright? Not gonna let you go hungry down here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Draws murmurs. For a brief moment, Gibbs sees fir eyes drop down, the glinting of fir teeth as fi opens and closes fir mouth a few times.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know how long it'll be?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not too long. Maybe three days? Our team is en-route back soon.\" Gibbs assures, putting her hand on the rock that shelves the gap, \"We'll keep an eye on you in the meantime. Do you have anything in there with you? I could probably bring you a thing or two for entertainment.\"</p>\n<p>There's a shuffling, \"All I've got is my hat, and my clothes. My pockets uuhhh\u2026 <em>whatisinhereholdon\u2014</em>\" even more shuffling. Gibbs hears a quiet clatter.</p>\n<p>\"I've got a pen! And a pebble. I dunno how long that's been there, ooh! Wait! I've got a book. Oh please let this not be a Library book I don't wanna a late charge\u2014\" Gibbs tilts her head as she hears paper rustling.</p>\n<p>\"Oop, never mind. False alarm,\" Gibbs hears Draws pat the book, \"this one's mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well that's good,\" Gibbs nods, \"I can bring you some books if you want.\"</p>\n<p>Through the gap, she sees Draws perk up.</p>\n<p>\"You said this is a Geological Research Site right? Do you have like\u2026 books for that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Plenty. Though\u2026 they're primarily <em>textbooks</em>, so I don't know if those would fit through the gaps. However, I think we have a few pocket-sized field guides, though.\" Gibbs drums her finger against her leg. \"I can bring them the next time I come down.\"</p>\n<p>She hears another droplet of water.</p>\n<p>\"That'd be awesome!\" Draws claps fir claws together, \"I was worried I was gonna go stir crazy down here.\" fi trails off with a chuckle, before adding on:</p>\n<p>\"Miss Gibbs?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mm?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you \u2014 can you stay and talk, too? When you come back?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course.\" Gibbs smiles softly, and in the low light, through the gaps in the rock, she can see that Draws is too.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div class=\"modal\">\n<h2 id=\"toc1\"><span>This file is currently under edit lock by:</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span><span class=\"green\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">hgibbs@scp.int</span></span></span></h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>Person of Interest 1027</span></h3>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>PoI Designation:</strong> 1027\n<p><strong>Date of Identification:</strong> 21/8/2011</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dino \u2010\u2010 Draws<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> <span class=\"green\">(Adjust for footnote later: Database keeps trying to change the double-dash to an em-dash due to something in the code that's making an error pop up, but it's a double dash.)</span></p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"holdingcell.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/amnesia-was-fir-name/holdingcell.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>PoI-1027 within Holding Cell B.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> PoI-1027 is a <span class=\"green\">currently unknown</span> draconic humanoid of indeterminate age. <span class=\"green\">Note, this is unconfirmed \u2014 but fi seemed young?</span> PoI-1027's scales are a range of dark purples, with light purple feathers down the back, tail, and on the hands and feet.

She rubs the side of her face with a sigh, feeling that growing pit in her stomach once again. Dripping water rings in her ears.</p>\n<p>Containment. It was looming on her mind like some horrible miasma. There was something cosmically cruel in knowing that Draws had came to them for protection, for safety \u2014 to escape from something. To hear that and know that fir likely destination <em>now</em> was a containment cell for god knows how long rose a guilt in Gibbs' chest that she wasn't used to. She thinks of the excitement in fir voice, that intense passion \u2014 hell, a relevant one to the very Site she commands.</p>\n<p><em>\"Ways have a \u2014 ha \u2014 way with things. Sometimes they take you just where you need to go.\"</em></p>\n<p>Gibbs lowers her head.</p>\n<p><em>Fi doesn't deserve this.</em></p>\n<p>But there is a sprinkle of hope. An idea. If she can pull it off, then just maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>She's torn from her thoughts by a loud knock on her office door. Gibbs raises up her head, \"Come in,\" and in steps Dr. Sarah Lindsey \u2014 an old woman, and an old friend \u2014 Geophysics Chair.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Sarah. Is there something wrong?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nah, me 'n Rudy were just wondering where you were. Remember those dinner plans we made?\" Lindsey hums, she gestures to the clock. Gibbs stares at it, racks her brain, and remembers it's about two hours <em>from</em> said dinner plans.</p>\n<p>\"Ah\u2026 shoot, right. I'm just,\" Gibbs pauses, glances at her screen, sighs, \"struggling a little with Draws' PoI file.\"</p>\n<p>\"Struggling with what part? Containment?\" The statement was meant to be a joke, but the way Gibbs frowns makes her tilt her head, \"You'd figure that to be the easy part!\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not. We barely contain living things here \u2014 a few, sure, but to date we've never gotten anything <em>sapient</em> in the Site.\" Gibbs murmurs, \"Fi's a sapient humanoid \u2014 once everything's filed in full, fi'll end up shipped off to Site-17 or something to never see the light of day again.\"</p>\n<p>It makes Lindsey pause, a concern bubbling in her features \u2014 taken aback by her Director's apparent dismay. \"You're upset about this.\" Is all she finds herself able to say, brow furrowed.</p>\n<p>\"Of course I am,\" comes the response, \"there's a bright young mind down there in that holding cell\u2014 someone who could have a future. A future <em>here.</em>\" <em>Fi fled to us.</em> The added thought makes Gibbs hang her head in silence. It feels all so naive of her, but her site \u2014 her <em>Department</em> \u2014 has rarely dealt in things with thought. Rocks typically don't come with as many quandaries on the conscious.</p>\n<p>\"I've been combing through the database for the past few hours \u2014 looking for something, <em>anything</em> that may keep fir out of a cell.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any luck?\" Lindsey asks weakly. Part of her hoped so.</p>\n<p>And to her surprise, Gibbs inhales, composes herself, and nods. \"Yeah, one thing. Come look.\"</p>\n<p>Gibbs gestures to Lindsey to come over to her desk. The woman closes the door behind her and slips over, positioning herself to look over her Director's shoulder and at the computer monitor.</p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7629\">SCP-7629</a> \u2014 The Sky Keepers, or more simply, 'Droganians'.\" She gestures to the file, before paging down and downloading an attached document. \"The Foundation found an underground city of dragon people in the late 90s, and made a political arrangement with them.\"</p>\n<p>Lindsey blinks rapidly, \"What in the Tolkien..?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think the Roundtable Agreement might be our new friend's lucky break.\"</p>\n<p>She raises an eyebrow, \"Why's that?\" and Gibbs looks up at Lindsey, her solemn face breaking into a grin.</p>\n<p>\"There's an exchange program.\"</p>\n<div class=\"document\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"roundtable.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/amnesia-was-fir-name/roundtable.png\"/><br/>\n<em>THE ROUND TABLE AGREEMENT / SCP-7629 PROTOCOL</em></div>\n<br/>\n<em>[\u2026]</em>\n<p><em>Droganian volunteers may be integrated into Free Port Nexuses and willing Foundation facilities as a part of integration and exchange to aid in their re-incorporation into the modern anomalous world.

This surge, and subsequent geological activity, would result in a warning ping from the OROGENESIS system.[[footnote]] Site-898\u2019s geological monitoring system and .AIC, designated as OROGENESIS.aic but often colloquially nicknamed as \"Ori\". Further information restricted to level 5/OROGENESIS-CORE.[[/footnote]] Upon reception, its data was put through thaumaturgic processing. This allowed it to be identified as the temporary creation of an unstable Way, and its near-immediate collapse \u2014 which had taken one of the mine\u2019s tunnels down with it.\n\n\n\nDue to MTF Gamma-89 (\u201cRock and a Hard Place\u201d) being temporarily offsite, the resultant collapse was investigated by Director Hellen Gibbs and Dr. Rudy Weller.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller pulls open the door to the mine with a grunt, sunlight from the outside briefly filters through the dust and dirt as he and Dir. Gibbs enter and begin to head downwards. Both are dressed in high-vis PPE,[[footnote]] Personal Protection Equipment. [[/footnote]] with active headlamps.// \n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** I'm surprised you're the one coming down here with me.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I like to know what's happening in my site. A thaumaturgy-linked mine collapse is a major concern.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller shakes his head as he trudges forward.// \n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Anomalous phenomena slowing down here my foot, it still feels like a magnet for oddities. \n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** At the very least, we didn't detect any further compromise in the surrounding parts of the mine. A small-scale detonation, a collapse at the end of a single tunnel.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** The vibrations from the collapse weren't enough to stir anything, were they?\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** //[She shakes her head]// OROGENESIS would've pinged us if it did. Seems like the thaumaturgical blast was too weak to set off anything below. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Thank god. We don't need anything crawling outta hell whilst we're on a rescue mission. \n\n\n\n//Her face has turned to worry. Dr. Weller pauses and glances at her.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Don't kid with me, Hellen. I know you're worried, but we both know that someone might be down here.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I'm more than worried. I think there //is// someone down here. It was a //Way//, Rudy. Someone could've come through it before it fell. \n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller ducks his head in a nod, though his expression is uncertain. The two of them pick up their pace.//\n\n\n\n//As the two walk, Dr. Weller pulls a small map from his hip -- the spot of the collapse marked with a sharpie. He traces his finger along as they travel through the mine. They take a left, a right, cross a mesh bridge built over a gap and pass old equipment and minecart rails. Every once and a while, Dir. Gibbs reaches over to the wall and flips a heavy switch -- turning on old lights with a heavy THUNK!//\n\n\n\n//They turn a final corner, and find what they're looking for. A few meters down, the ceiling of the tunnel has been partially collapsed -- damaged supports and fallen rock.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** ...We should tread lightly. Dunno how stable all that looks.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Indeed.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller approaches the collapse, staring up at the snapped wooden supports -- he squints.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** They look burnt.\n\n\n\n//Dir. Gibbs, who'd been crouched next to a small gap in the rocks -- seemingly attempting to peer beyond the collapse -- looks up.//\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Looks like the effects of the Way detonating. Look at the ceiling -- swirl patterns. \n\n\n\n//She points at the cave roof, Dr. Weller turns up the brightness of his hardhat's light, and it fully illuminates glittering patterns peaking out from some of the boulders and ceiling. Odd, discordant swirls that branch off one another with an ashen glitter.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Thaumaturgic imprints. Right, right. \n\n\n\n//From beyond the fallen rocks and broken wood, a quiet groan is heard. Dir. Gibbs and Dr. Weller both jolt, eyes wide.//\n\n\n\n//Dir. Gibbs crouches by a part in the rocks, and angles her flashlight so that it can somewhat shine into the small gap. Against the dark, she can see scorch marks along the tunnel floor, burned-in runes on the far wall.//\n\n\n\n//And a battered figure collapsed amongst the dust.// \n\n\n\n//After a moment of silence, Dir. Gibbs opens and closes her mouth a few times before speaking.//\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** ...Are you okay?\n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller crouches down next to her, brow knitted in concern and alarm. His hand, pre-emptively, rests against his hip as though prepared to pull a weapon. Dir. Gibbs glances at him warily.// \n\n\n\n//The figure shifts and sits up slowly. The two can see the shape of two curved horns and a snout in the limited light.//\n\n\n\n**Unknown:** //...Hello..?// \n\n\n\n//The voice is a quiet, weak murmur.//\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Hello. My name is Director Hellen Gibbs, and this --\n\n\n\n//She gestures to Dr. Weller, though is unsure if the other can see.// \n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Is Doctor Rudy Weller. Are you okay? Do you know where you are?\n\n\n\n**Unknown:** I don't. To ah, to both of those? //[There is a pause for a sharp intake of breath]// Something burns. I-- I don't know what. I think I got burned coming in.\n\n\n\n//There is a pause.//\n\n\n\n**Unknown:** You said you were a Director?\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Yes. Is that of significance to you?\n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller is visibly tense, eyes narrowing.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** //...Gibbs, did it come here on purpose..?//\n\n\n\n**Unknown:** Yeah. Cause that means you're Foundation. So it worked, holy shit. //[The figure tries to shift, and hisses sharply]// //Ow. Fuck me running --// okay. Okay. Half worked. \n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** So you did come to us on purpose. \n\n\n\n**Unknown:** Yes. I-- I was running. I think? I don't fully remember. Which is concerning. I just know I had to get out of the Library. \n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller glances at Dir. Gibbs, who simply has her head tilted to the side as she listens. He narrows his eyes, and turns back to the gap in the rocks.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Why's that?\n\n\n\n**Unknown:** I don't know. Everything feels... wrong right now. My head hurts.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** //[She frowns]// Do you know your name? \n\n\n\n//For a moment, the individual doesn't respond -- before suddenly perking up.//\n\n\n\n**Unknown:** Yes! Yes, I do. It's Draws. Well, Dino. Then Draws. First and last, that's the words for it. Fi and fir. //[There's a pause]// It's kinda weird. I'm sorry. I don't think I did it right.[[footnote]] Henceforth, within documentation, this individual will be referred to under the temporary designation of \"PoI-1027\".[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n//Dr. Weller huffs in confusion, and glances at Dir. Gibbs.//\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I've heard weirder. You're alright, dear. //[She briefly chuckles]// Speaking of alright -- you said you were hurt? \n\n\n\n**PoI-1027:** Yeah. I'm not... good at magic. I messed it up. I think I burnt my arms and back? Been trying not to move much. //[There's an inhale, it's shaky]// Are you gonna-- are you gonna be able to get me out of here?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Our only folks qualified to do that are still a few days out, but we'll\u2026 do the best we can in the meantime.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** We'll keep you safe, okay? Do you know how to use first aid?\n\n\n\n**PoI-1027:** Yeah, I think so.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Weller:** Then we're gonna go get you that. Some water, too yeah? //[He looks to Gibbs]// Probably. \n\n\n\n//PoI-1027 nods.//\n\n\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Sit tight, you'll be okay. \n\n\n\n<End Log> \n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWeller wipes his brow, as he hauls open the door and exits the mine, \"Why does it feel like it's //always// dragons, with this Department? Is there a correlation I'm missing?\" the door shutters shut behind him with a heavy slam, and they walk away from the door and towards a small wooden shack. Weller slips a key off his hip, and opens it up -- the old door creaking in protest of their entrance. \n\n\n\n\"I think in this case, it's coincidence, Rudy,\" Gibbs replies, hanging her hardhat on a wall-mounted rack. \"I don't think fi meant to end up underground.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe,\" the old man sighs in response. Gibbs simply hums quietly to herself, opening the small closet space to stow her high-vis vest. \"I dunno how to feel about all that, though. Feels strange.\"\n\n\n\n\"A little, but I\u2019m curious.\" \n\n\n\nWeller sighs, \"Yeah, well, if you end up back down there be damned careful. We know nothing of that PoI.\"\n\n\n\nShe can hear the tense sort of annoyance in his voice. \n\n\n\n\"I know, I know.\u201d Gibbs sighs, \u201cYou can get back to work, Rudy. I saw you were handling integrating some new volunteers when the change of plans hit.\" she glances at him, extending a hand to take and hang his vest, \"my schedule for the day is clear, anyways.\" \n\n\n\nShe hears Weller grunt as he slips off the high-vis and hands it off to her, seeming to consider her words for a few moments. \"Bah, I'd almost rather deal with dragons over interns.\" he jokes, \"But yeah, yeah. I will. But\u2014\" he pointedly pokes her shoulder, \"\u2014//you// better keep your guard up. Be careful.\"\n\n\n\n\"You don\u2019t have to lecture your own Director, Rudy.\u201d Gibbs chuckles as the man heaves a mockingly dramatic sigh, though it's all in good nature. She leads the way out of the storage shack, and strides away from the mine's heavy doors, across the grass and gravel towards the containment fence that keeps the entrance fully sealed. The Director presses her palm to a scanner. It hums to life, before the fence rumbles open and allows the two departure. They cross the Site's lot over towards the building itself -- one that sits nestled in the gap between two mountains, with an overgrown swamp and a lone road as its sole neighbors.\n\n\n\nGibbs swipes her keycard, holds the door open for Weller, and they both slip inside.\n\n\n\nSite-898 is primarily a white-walled research facility, small in scale (by Foundation standards, that is) but they've done work to make it feel like home. After giving a nod to one of the few members of Site security, Gibbs passes by colorful posters and doors to offices propped open with (non-anomalous) rock samples. Windows let sunlight filter in, reflecting off display cases of various minerals and crystals from around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWeller peels off when she enters the Site's Habitation Sector; a two story space that looked akin to a hotel's open lobby, which holds host to the Site's population of roughly 100 staff. The roof curves into a dome above her head, a few windows shine light down onto the foyer of the second floor that rims the room. The center fixture of it all was a behemoth crystal -- deep and glittering black, with conical spiked protrusions. A scale from the deceased [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8007 SCP-8007] instance of Plosky Tolbachik. It sits as part of a fountain, and she catches the glimpse of Dr. Lindsey's much-beloved koi fish swimming happily inside amidst bits of foliage. Well-socialized little critters, currently being spoiled with treats via two researchers sat on the fountain's rim. She greets them, and others milling around the space, with a small nod or wave as she passes through towards the cafeteria. \n\n\n\nShe gets a concerned look from one when she slips a first-aid kit from the wall and stores it under her arm, as she passes into the mess hall.\n\n\n\nIt's a quick in-and-out sort of trip. She asks the nearest cook for a to-go container, and filled it with various bits of food. Some rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and corn. She throws a plastic fork in there, tucks a water bottle into her pocket, and it's back into the August heat to re-enter the Red Brook Mine. \n\n\n\nGibbs re-opens the gate, dons her PPE, and tugs open the door. \n\n\n\nThe air of the mine is far cooler than the frankly sweltering outside, and she's quite glad for that. It's a five minute walk through tunnels, over gaps, in the sprawling mine -- before Gibbs returns to that collapsed dead end. Evidently, her footsteps had been quite audible, as she sees three blue eyes shining back at her from through the gap in the rock.\n\n\n\n\"You're back,\" she hears Draws remark, the corners of the three eyes upturned.\n\n\n\n\"Brought a first aid kit, some food and water. Let's see if I cram it through, or if I'm gonna be sending it in pieces.\" Gibbs replies, sitting down by the collapse. The first aid kit does, in fact, end up being too wide to fit the gap. So Gibbs takes out the bottle of antibiotic, water and medical gauze, passing it into Draws' clawed hand.\n\n\n\n\"All I need to do is clean and bandage them, right?\" fi asks quietly, \"I've never really gotten burned before.\"\n\n\n\n\"Rinse with water, dry it, apply the antibiotic and then wrap it.\" Gibbs replies with a nod, and she hears Draws occasionally hiss as fi does as instructed. After a few moments, Draws starts to talk.\n\n\n\n\"This is a mine, right? I see wooden supports 'n stuff.\" the words come out slightly strained, as fi works to tend to the burns. \n\n\n\n\"Indeed. It used to be a coal mine, primarily.\" Gibbs replies, leaning back against the rock. She rests a hand on the to-go container, she can pass it to Draws once fi finishes fixing firself up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Is this place in the Appalachians, then?\" \n\n\n\nNow //that// came as a bit of a surprise. Gibbs turns her head, raises an eyebrow, \"Pennsylvania, yes. How did you know?\" \n\n\n\n\"Well, it's kinda a coin flip,\" Draws chuckles, a tad sheepish, \"coal really only is dug up on the East Coast or the Midwest in America. Which is where I assumed we were.\" \n\n\n\n\"You have geological knowledge,\" the woman remarks, brow raising, \"intriguing coincidence.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mm?\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm a geologist, as are my workers. This mine sits below Geological Research Site-898.\"\n\n\n\nThere's a pause, seemingly of shock, before Draws goes, \"Wow... okay-- alright,\" with a certain giddiness tracing fir tone. \"That lady didn't lie then.\"\n\n\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\n\n\"When I was looking for -- for the spell that I used -- I asked a lady behind the checkout for how I control where I go. She said that, sometimes, you don't? But Ways have a -- ha -- //way// with things. Sometimes they take you just where you need to go.\" \n\n\n\n\"So more than a coincidence,\" Gibbs smiles.\n\n\n\n\"And more like magic.\" Draws agrees.\n\n\n\n\"So you've studied the field?\" Gibbs tilts her head, even though Draws can't see her. \n\n\n\n\"Yeah! I ah-- I remember studying it in the Library. I don't... think I had a traditional schooling, but I liked wandering around the Stacks and picking up books on it. Did you know the Library has its own deposits?\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't,\" Gibbs says, interest lining her tone, \"can you tell me about them? I've never seen the Library.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well! The lantern koi will spit up this incandescent liquid every once and a while -- it's like a glass? Silica, probably. And they'll form these bead-y looking stalactites on the undersides of shelves and ceilings. They glow like they have fireflies inside them,\" Draws' voice has come to life -- forgoing the earlier pain and strain, becoming suddenly quite animated. Gibbs smiles softly. As she listens to the other talk, she finds her gaze tracing a rivulet of water that drips down the wall near her. The rainwater from a few days past must finally be working its way down.\n\n\n\n\"There are scales from the Serpent tucked far down below if you know where to look -- they've been fossilized by paper and stone which //looks// really damn weird. The scales are like... all layered? And they've been pressed down by the Library above and cemented into this glittering calcite-type stuff. They're a deep green with a sort of oil-y sheen to em. I wish I could've broken off a piece to take with, but they're super sturdy.\" Draws\u2019 voice echoes off the mine\u2019s walls, the sounds of shifting feathers indicating fir wings fluttering as fi speaks.\n\n\n\n\"That sounds wonderous,\" Gibbs hums, \"it makes sense that a place as infinite and sprawling as the Wanderers' Library would host not just its own ecosystem, but its own geological processes.\" The rivulet ends at a puddle carved by erosion, and still she watches the water drip. \n\n\n\n\"Yeah... I wish I could've explored more,\" Draws' voice dips down in volume, becoming a bit smaller. Gibbs is pretty sure fi shrinks inwards, too. \n\n\n\nA tilt of the head, another water droplet hits the puddle. \n\n\n\n\"Do you remember now why you left?\"\n\n\n\nShe hears a rustling, probably Draws shaking fir head before realizing Gibbs can't see and goes, \"No. I just... I know I was scared. Relieved? I'd... done something before I left. Not a bad thing!\" Gibbs vaguely sees Draws' waving fir claws in the air, \"I did something that... made me feel relieved. But in doing it I don't think I was... safe anymore?\"\n\n\n\nGibbs listens, making a quiet sound to indicate such, and furrows her brow. The dragon beyond the rocks sounds both confused and... lost. \n\n\n\nShe finds herself fishing a small pebble out from the puddle.\n\n\n\n\"I wasn't safe. So I ran. I think it was part of a plan because I already had the spell to leave. I just... I don't remember.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you remember?\" Gibbs tilts her head, \"about your time in the Library.\"\n\n\n\nThere's a long pause. Silence broken only once by a droplet of water. \n\n\n\n\"Well, I grew up in there.\"\n\n\n\n//Drip.//\n\n\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\" The response is quick. \"I had others.\" a pause, hesitation, \"I don't... I don't think I liked them.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Gibbs replies softly, frowning. There's a lapse into silence. She tries to peak a little further into the gap, and sees Draws' gaze is downcast -- face twisted into something that seems equal parts confused, and conflicted. When she straightens up again, she elects to change topics. \n\n\n\n\"I brought you food and water, if you're hungry.\" She places the smooth, water-shiny pebble onto the to-go container.\n\n\n\n\"Really?\" she sees Draws' perk up.\n\n\n\n\"Yup, here--\" Gibbs scoops up the container, and holds it up to the gap. A pair of feathered hands, with curved black claws, reaches out and tentatively takes it.\n\n\n\n\"Might've gotten cold, sorry about that.\" she chuckles lightly. Gibbs smiles a little, when she sees Draws gently pick up the pebble in fir claws, and stares at it.\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" The pebble is slipped into the pocket of a tattered coat, \"It's alright! I can fix that,\" Gibbs is about to ask what that means, before there's a few small flashes of blue-purple light from the gap. The faint smell of smoke.\n\n\n\n//Right. A dragon.// \n\n\n\n//\"Ohh! Fuck yes I love potatoes,\"// she hears Draws' murmuring excitedly as fi opens the container.\n\n\n\nGibbs shifts her sitting position, and quiet repacks the first aid kit so she can return it later. She raises her head when she hears Draws shift -- claws scraping against stone. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you -- uh,\" a pause, \"ma'am? What was your name again? You said it earlier but I'm really bad with names.\"\n\n\n\nShe chuckles, \"Hellen Gibbs.\" \n\n\n\n\"Okay! Alright, alright. And you know mine too, right? Did I tell you about the middle part?\" She watches, curiously, as Draws seems to draw firself inwards again.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think you did.\" Gibbs blinks, tilts her head. \n\n\n\n\"Oh! Well, uh -- I think my... what's the word -- middle name? It's two dashes.\" The statement is awkward, a touch confused. \n\n\n\n\"Two dashes?\" Gibbs echoes, \"How'd that happen?\" Her eyes briefly flicks over to the puddle again, when an especially large droplet splatters against its surface.\n\n\n\n\"Um. I'm... not sure? It's just sorta on my Library card. Two little dashes. So I assume it's part of my name. Those show your true name, y'know?\" she hears Draws' tap fir talons against the rock. A quiet //tink-tink-tink.//\n\n\n\n\"Huh.\" Gibbs blinks a bit, \"interesting.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah I don't know why it's like that either,\" Draws says sheepishly, \"maybe it's just Library-weirdness.\" \n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know either,\" Gibbs chuckles, \"but I'll keep that bit in mind.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alrighty,\" fi replies, and there's more shuffling before the Styrofoam container appears half-through the hole. \"I finished the food you brought.\"\n\n\n\nGibbs takes the container back, \"Good, good. I'll be sure to bring you more later, alright? Not gonna let you go hungry down here.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" Draws murmurs. For a brief moment, Gibbs sees fir eyes drop down, the glinting of fir teeth as fi opens and closes fir mouth a few times.\n\n\n\n\"Do you know how long it'll be?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not too long. Maybe three days? Our team is en-route back soon.\" Gibbs assures, putting her hand on the rock that shelves the gap, \"We'll keep an eye on you in the meantime. Do you have anything in there with you? I could probably bring you a thing or two for entertainment.\"\n\n\n\nThere's a shuffling, \"All I've got is my hat, and my clothes. My pockets uuhhh... //whatisinhereholdon--//\" even more shuffling. Gibbs hears a quiet clatter.\n\n\n\n\"I've got a pen! And a pebble. I dunno how long that's been there, ooh! Wait! I've got a book. Oh please let this not be a Library book I don't wanna a late charge--\" Gibbs tilts her head as she hears paper rustling.\n\n\n\n\"Oop, never mind. False alarm,\" Gibbs hears Draws pat the book, \"this one's mine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well that's good,\" Gibbs nods, \"I can bring you some books if you want.\"\n\n\n\nThrough the gap, she sees Draws perk up.\n\n\n\n\"You said this is a Geological Research Site right? Do you have like... books for that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Plenty. Though... they're primarily //textbooks//, so I don't know if those would fit through the gaps. However, I think we have a few pocket-sized field guides, though.\" Gibbs drums her finger against her leg. \"I can bring them the next time I come down.\" \n\n\n\nShe hears another droplet of water.\n\n\n\n\"That'd be awesome!\" Draws claps fir claws together, \"I was worried I was gonna go stir crazy down here.\" fi trails off with a chuckle, before adding on:\n\n\n\n\"Miss Gibbs?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you -- can you stay and talk, too? When you come back?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\" Gibbs smiles softly, and in the low light, through the gaps in the rock, she can see that Draws is too. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ This file is currently under edit lock by:\n\n+++ [[span class=\"green\"]] @@hgibbs@scp.int@@ [[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ Person of Interest 1027 \n\n[[/=]]\n\n**PoI Designation:** 1027\n\n\n\n**Date of Identification:** 21/8/2011\n\n\n\n**Name:** Dino \u2010\u2010 Draws[[footnote]]**Database alert:** Possible semiohazard detected.[[/footnote]] [[span class=\"green\"]] (Adjust for footnote later: Database keeps trying to change the double-dash to an em-dash due to something in the code that's making an error pop up, but it's a double dash.)

[[span class=\"green\"]]Note, this is unconfirmed -- but fi seemed young? [[/span]] PoI-1027's scales are a range of dark purples, with light purple feathers down the back, tail, and on the hands and feet. A series of darker, plate-like scales run down fir body, as well as fir limbs, and PoI-1027 bears two curved horns on the head. The entity is in possession of --two sets of wings, and a fan of feathers upon the tail.-- [[span class=\"green\"]]Three sets of feathered wings,[[/span]] and is capable of flight. [[span class=\"green\"]]Note for later: don't forget apparent fire-breathing, amateur thaumaturgy skills. Mention three eyes, the clear covering on the neck/chest/tail and apparently liquid organ system. I am not a biologist, send a memo to Dr. Souch for some sort of checkup \u2014 especially to check fir burns.[[/span]]\n\n\n\n**Background Information:** [[span class=\"green\"]]PoI-1027 manifested in the Red Brook Mine via a self-created Way on 21/8/2011, and would remain trapped there until freed by MTF Gamma-89 on 24/8/2011. For the period of time in which fi was trapped, Director Hellen Gibbs would take on the primary duty of overseeing fir. (Note, currently unsure how to summarize several off-record conversations, bullet pointing for now)\n\n* Fled from the Library, does not remember why. Only remembers fir emotions, blurred images. Has forgotten individuals, too. Knows there was a threat to fir life. \n\n* Signs point to possible antimemetic exposure? Over the course of the three days I asked if fir head has cleared -- and fi's told me no, for the most part. Fi has sustained no head injuries\n\n* Has surprisingly intricate knowledge of geology, claims to have undergone schooling in the Library. Judging by the talks we had (and a bit of for-fun quizzing and discussion on my part) fir knowledge seems apt towards college level. \n\n* Generally well mannered, appears non-hostile. Curious, excited, lost.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* Currently in Holding Cell B of the Containment Sector (Basement Floor) \n\n[[/span]]\n\n\n\n[[div id=\"blink-bar\"]]\n\n**Course of Action:**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\nGibbs has had the PoI file half-screen split with the general Foundation database for more hours than necessary. She rubs the side of her face with a sigh, feeling that growing pit in her stomach once again. Dripping water rings in her ears.\n\n\n\nContainment. It was looming on her mind like some horrible miasma. There was something cosmically cruel in knowing that Draws had came to them for protection, for safety -- to escape from something. To hear that and know that fir likely destination //now// was a containment cell for god knows how long rose a guilt in Gibbs' chest that she wasn't used to. She thinks of the excitement in fir voice, that intense passion -- hell, a relevant one to the very Site she commands. \n\n\n\n//\"Ways have a -- ha -- way with things. Sometimes they take you just where you need to go.\"//\n\n\n\nGibbs lowers her head. \n\n\n\n//Fi doesn't deserve this.// \n\n\n\nBut there is a sprinkle of hope. An idea. If she can pull it off, then just maybe--\n\n\n\nShe's torn from her thoughts by a loud knock on her office door. Gibbs raises up her head, \"Come in,\" and in steps Dr. Sarah Lindsey -- an old woman, and an old friend -- Geophysics Chair. \n\n\n\n\"Ah, Sarah. Is there something wrong?\" \n\n\n\n\"Nah, me 'n Rudy were just wondering where you were. Remember those dinner plans we made?\" Lindsey hums, she gestures to the clock. Gibbs stares at it, racks her brain, and remembers it's about two hours //from// said dinner plans. \n\n\n\n\"Ah... shoot, right. I'm just,\" Gibbs pauses, glances at her screen, sighs, \"struggling a little with Draws' PoI file.\" \n\n\n\n\"Struggling with what part? Containment?\" The statement was meant to be a joke, but the way Gibbs frowns makes her tilt her head, \"You'd figure that to be the easy part!\" \n\n\n\n\"It's not. We barely contain living things here -- a few, sure, but to date we've never gotten anything //sapient// in the Site.\" Gibbs murmurs, \"Fi's a sapient humanoid -- once everything's filed in full, fi'll end up shipped off to Site-17 or something to never see the light of day again.\" \n\n\n\nIt makes Lindsey pause, a concern bubbling in her features -- taken aback by her Director's apparent dismay. \"You're upset about this.\" Is all she finds herself able to say, brow furrowed. \n\n\n\n\"Of course I am,\" comes the response, \"there's a bright young mind down there in that holding cell-- someone who could have a future. A future //here.//\" //Fi fled to us.// The added thought makes Gibbs hang her head in silence. It feels all so naive of her, but her site -- her //Department// -- has rarely dealt in things with thought. Rocks typically don't come with as many quandaries on the conscious. \n\n\n\n\"I've been combing through the database for the past few hours -- looking for something, //anything// that may keep fir out of a cell.\"\n\n\n\n\"Any luck?\" Lindsey asks weakly. Part of her hoped so. \n\n\n\nAnd to her surprise, Gibbs inhales, composes herself, and nods. \"Yeah, one thing. Come look.\"\n\n\n\nGibbs gestures to Lindsey to come over to her desk. The woman closes the door behind her and slips over, positioning herself to look over her Director's shoulder and at the computer monitor. \n\n\n\n\"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7629 SCP-7629] -- The Sky Keepers, or more simply, 'Droganians'.\" She gestures to the file, before paging down and downloading an attached document. \"The Foundation found an underground city of dragon people in the late 90s, and made a political arrangement with them.\"\n\n\n\nLindsey blinks rapidly, \"What in the Tolkien..?\" \n\n\n\n\"I think the Roundtable Agreement might be our new friend's lucky break.\"\n\n\n\nShe raises an eyebrow, \"Why's that?\" and Gibbs looks up at Lindsey, her solemn face breaking into a grin.\n\n\n\n\"There's an exchange program.\" \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[image roundtable.png]]\n\n//THE ROUND TABLE AGREEMENT / SCP-7629 PROTOCOL//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n//[...]//\n\n\n\n//Droganian volunteers may be integrated into Free Port Nexuses and willing Foundation facilities as a part of integration and exchange to aid in their re-incorporation into the modern anomalous world.

Draws doesn't fully match with being a Droganian. Too many wings, an extra eye. They seem quite physiologically diverse, but this might be pushing it.\" She glances over.\n\n\n\n\"A bit, though it looks like some have feathers. Regardless, you know how it is with thaumaturgy, right?\" Gibbs gives her a sly look, \"especially something as unpredictable as a //failed// spell that has quite the backfire. We could simply... hand wave fir strangeness?\"\n\n\n\nLindsey's brow shoots up, and she finds herself giving a half-manic giggle, \"Hellen! Isn't that falsifying information?\" \n\n\n\n\"I prefer to call it //'proposing a hypothesis'.//\" Gibbs hums back, \"If we fudge some things, we can conclude in the final POI file that Draws is Droganian, augmented by fir passage through the collapsing Way, and I can invoke this section of the Roundtable Agreement in fir defense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Has Draws stated what fi may be on record?\"\n\n\n\nGibbs shakes her head, \"Only off-record, and that fi doesn't know.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well!\" Lindsey claps her hands, \"Then I suppose we have good news for fir, mm?\"\n\n\n\nThe Director's face brightens. \"A whole lot of it, actually.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Submit edit and upload file?\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Confirm\" hide=\"Upload Successful!\"]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:id-card\">:scp-wiki:component:id-card</a> |css=--\n\n|photo=draws\n\n|level=2\n\n|name=Dino \u2010\u2010 Draws\n\n|dept=Geology |position=Jr. Researcher\n\n|id-number= 1027-89821\n\n|expiry=05/2020\n\n]]\n\n\n\n\"Welcome to the team,\" Director Gibbs' voice is professional, but fi can hear an underlying joy.\n\n\n\nThe card is held gently in a set of claws, as Draws stares down at it.

Been a hot minute since you\u2019ve seen field work, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d The voice, slightly chiding in tone, was directed at Gabriel Clef from a small screen present on his desk. Despite the distortion leveled on it to protect the users identity, its southern twang still rang true through its words.</p>\n<p>When he had been told his father would make it up to him, Gabriel hardly expected this to be the outcome. Then again, planning around his father had always been like planning for a chance of rain that benefited you; hardly possible, not foolproof worthy to bring an umbrella, and mostly up to the changing of tides.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Clef sat fiddling with a stressball, leaning back in the plush leather roller chair as he pretended he really gave a fuck. It wasn\u2019t particularly the safest way to lounge, hes been warned against it but in the comfort of the red and black office there wasnt a soul going to tell him off. The benefits of seniority and status in his position. His eyes flick down to the fidget toy, giving it another squeeze, then up to the screen. The call had been completely out of the blue, as per usual, but when you\u2019re the son of Alto Clef you learn to work on his schedule. Not yours.</p>\n<p>The screen bears no emotion, no sign of the larger than life figure on the other end, excepting the flickering of the SCP logo on the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Samuel Roscharch squints.</p>\n<p>\u201cA change of scenery?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Samuel. I think you\u2019re in high need of it, and not just that, considering your work here in Area Two has just about been offloaded to me, I don\u2019t see why not. Additionally, you have 180 vacation days you have failed to cash-in, which you can still make use of at any time you deem necessary. Whens the last time you had a genuine peek at the outside world outside of work hours?</p>\n<p>Samuel sighs, carding a hand through his head of black hair, strands of white interspersed amongst it from the toll stress has taken on him, as he stares fruitlessly down at the report paper he\u2019s supposed to be grading. The words have bled together a long time ago, a mixture of official jargon and foundation doublespeak that would lull less experienced personnel to sleep. That was somewhat of its purpose; these papers were important after all, couldn\u2019t have just anyone understanding what exactly they pertained to. Sometimes Samuel had the thought that half of these papers didn\u2019t even understand themselves.</p>\n<p>With his new position, he was getting recognised. That was clear, yes, but by god did the paperwork keep on stacking up. Where he had been able to slice through 20 reports with ease, he now saw an ever climbing pile of tasks in his inbox tray, a hydra where every report equalled another three more and kept him chained to his desk, that insistent thought in the back of his head repeating he could only ever take a break when it was all done.</p>\n<p>He looks up at the evidence board in front of him, lines crossing over pictures, coffee stained papers and post-it notes. Maybe SAM was right. The dang thing just about ran autonomously now, in regards to answering his teams inquiries. His social inbox was quiet, only devoted to these more administrative papers that bore all the importance of any document. Samuel Roscharch had less requirement than ever to interact with his fellow man, which suited him just fine all things considered. Yet there was still a nagging for a genuine push to do so; as the saying goes all work no play makes Jack a dull boy. And judging by stats, with a cursory side eye to the other screen, he was in sore need of it.</p>\n<p>Sam waves a dismissive hand to his main monitors digital assistant, as pinching his nose, he squints at the letters on the paper he\u2019s reading through.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Set me up on a field mission that you deem fits my ability criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAffirmative leave it to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>In two different offices, 200\u00a0km from each other, a memo is received on their respective computers, one being eyed with casual boredom, to be perused sporadically as per his norm when the mood struck him, the other clicked open immediately and several tabs brought up automatically. His computer system detects and highlights relevant information and documentation. Their respective digital friends spoke of it in their own ways, informing them verbally of the necessary TLDR.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be going on a two person mission to investigate a company that seems to be using anomalous tech to further their company proceeds. Due to our lack of jurisdiction in the Gulf, you will be going undercover. Attached to the dossier you will find your fly date, and your allowance. And, ah yes. Your partner for this mission will be..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014-</p>\n<p>\u201cClef.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't you think that getup is a bit much?\u201d</p>\n<p>Samuel Roscharch squints. His flight was a long one, and he\u2019s not used to the bright night lights of the cities glare. He's used to the dimmer light sensitive bulbs of the facility, which he realises weren\u2019t as bright as he once judged them to be if these are so grating on the eyes. Here Gabriel is, in his usual (at least for Gabriels case) bright outfit, consisting of white jeans and a prussian blue hawaiian shirt with a leaf pattern. Roscharchs eyes flick over the loud outfit, the LC500 Lexus he's leaning against, and Gabriels shit eating grin he's giving Roscharch, and can\u2019t help but express some doubt on whether the guy had fully read the brief or if he\u2019s just here for vacations sake. He sure looks the part. The company full paid mission fund does come in handy for drinks after all.</p>\n<p>Gabriel chides him. \u201cSomeone didn\u2019t read the dress memo. You look like someones white collar accountant.\u201d Compared to Gabriel there was none of the flamboyance and color present in Roscharch\u2019s outfit. Dressed in a brown jacket tossed over a work shirt and corduroy dress pants, a patterned tie and a standard issue belt, he was someone you\u2019d pass over in the street, eyes sliding over him in a crowd without a second thought. While Clef looked like he\u2019d walked straight out of a magazine page, Roscharchs garb was more ruffled, the blame being his far from peaceful night on the plane. He never was the best sleeper.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did read the memo, it said to fit in and be discrete. Kind of what I was going for.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a hoist, he throws his dented case and duffle bag into the open back of the car alongside Gabriel\u2019s suitcases, slamming it shut and then making his way over to the right side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well where we\u2019re going that drab little outfit of yours will NOT make you \u201cfit in\u201d. Or \u201cbe discrete\u201d. Just saying!\u201d Gabriel swings into the drivers seat, turning the key and revving the engine. It roars to life, giving a purr that makes him grin. \u201cI managed to get a bit of a change to accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy bit of a change you mean upping our expenditures. \u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a more.. considerate use of our funds. To fit the clientele we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Where are we going anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Roscharch shifts, buckling in and checking the glove and shades compartments, as Gabriel pulls out and onto the main road.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh you\u2019ll see!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be upgraded to an executive suite immediately. Though do note it is a smoking floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean for the room?\u201d</p>\n<p>The entire lobby was warmly lit by the resplendent glow of the 300 crystal chandelier hanging above the room, the walls a tangle of repeating geometric patterns the eye easily got lost in. People talk in small groups scattered across the tiled marble floor while a pianist plays on the grand piano standing in the lobby. Gabriel leans on the counter, talking to the well groomed young man manning the lobby desk, his reflection catching in the mottled gold shield behind it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it means you\u2019ll get a living room, separate bathroom and a balcony along with the current accommodation.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee what did i tell you?\u201d Gabriel turns his head. \u201cUpgrade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Samuel squints at him, hand squeezing the sash of his duffle bag. He\u2019s not used to this. He just wants to get to his room and set up the necessary provisions and leech off the wifi for a while as he scours the already thoroughly thumbed through brief. The plane trip has left him exhausted enough. He scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just need your company ID, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait what? My ID?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir you see as part of the discount and upgrade we have to see any identification of your employment with the company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gabriel blinks and bend down to rummage through the duffel bag next to him. Shit shit shit. Shit!! Shit!! It\u2019s not under the folded outerwear, or the pocket with the magazines, definitely isn\u2019t in the compartment with his toiletries, and scraping the side only brings up a few errant condoms. No ID. Sam watches him somewhat bemused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it on me. I\u2019m on vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. A business card will do then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t give out business cards. <em>I\u2019ve never had this issue before</em>. Look, I\u2019ve booked here before just pull my profile up from last time I booked, it should be there.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course sir let me just check.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gabriel\u2019s nails tap impatiently on the marble desk, eying up the company around them. Its mostly a mix of people that, like Gabriel had implied earlier, were on the higher side of life, if not apparent from their tailored fitted clothing, and well maintained figures. There\u2019s the occasional tourist family, outliers for their pack of bags, bright artificial colors and corny novelty t-shirts that don\u2019t toe the line between post-irony and simplification (an important distinction from the bourgeoisie version of those sort of things) but they\u2019re few and far between. From what Gabriel can see, nobody of note that he needs to keep an eye on is present.</p>\n<p>The receptionists tanned fingers tap over the keys of the keyboard, eyes flicking over the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve checked, and while we have your passport, I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have your company ID sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gabriel\u2019s voice raises, a slight scoff on his tone as he inclines his head. \u201cThis is fucking bullsh-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSir I\u2019m afraid its hotel policy-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I KNOW its hotel policy. Totally get what you\u2019re saying here. I\u2019m saying this is new to me. This hasn\u2019t happened to me before, and if this is the route we\u2019re picking then be confident in the fact i\u2019m never booking with you, <em>again</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The receptionist looks up from his computer, his dark brown eyes meet Gabriel\u2019s amber ones. A look dares him to call his bluff. That he double dog dares him. The receptionist decides he doesn\u2019t like his odds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go check with my manager sir, one moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s gone for a few moments, disappearing behind a wall. When he returns, stoic faced as usual but to the watchful eye a bit more of a crease in his other perfectly content composure. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry sir. No need to worry about all of this. Your papers are in order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries. Do you mind if I get your name so i can send you them later? Just for you to make sure, iron everything out so we don\u2019t have this problem in future.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s body language relaxes, giving him a wry smile as the man goes a shade paler.</p>\n<p>\u201cIts really not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no i insist. For your records, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.. Mohammed Shakif, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell Mohammed, expect an email your hotels way in i\u2019d say.. five to seven business days. Tops. And trust me you\u2019ll know when it comes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mohammed gulped, staring straight ahead while the pair carted their luggage past him into the mahogany hallway with the four elevators.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>They arrive on the 29th floor of the hotel.</p>\n<p>The first thing they both notice walking out into the hallway is the slight smell of nicotine, causing Roscharch to wrinkle his nose as they walk through the wooden paneled halls, shoes quiet on the white carpeted floor. The doors are blue, little side tables with lamps and phones interspersed across the wide hall, dead quiet courtesy of the copious amount of soundproof. What goes on in these suites is the business of the resident, not the hotel, after all. They pay good money to make sure of it.</p>\n<p>Samuel had refused concierge \u2014 even at the behest of Gabriel for the amount of arm work he would have to do dragging up the provisions and the insistence of \u201cits paid we might as well indulge\u201d \u2014 it had been too risky in Sam\u2019s opinion for the bell boys to lay even a finger on the handles of their luggage. But in all actuality, it was moreso he preferred keeping some sort of modicum of connection to being the working man, less removed from all this fancy expenditure and having people wait on doing what you wanted.</p>\n<p>Gabriel is already up ahead, pressing the sleek grey keycard with the hotels insignia against the reader as he pushes against the gold handle of the blue door. It opens into a living room, fit with manila painted walls, a wide couch and tv setup, and a minibar counter with a fruit bowl on it. Dark heavy curtains are directly opposite the door, hiding the sparkling view of the city. While Gabriel drops his luggage like a bag of rocks and beelines for the fruit bowl and the drink selection, Roscharch carries his to the master bedroom.</p>\n<p>The entire place is carpeted, their steps muffled. With the tug of a cord, the heavy drapes lining one side of the room give way to a tremendous view of the city skylines, skyscrapers embedded with LED lights to give a moving swaying display on their surfaces, the red and yellow blink of cars passing below to the dancing multicolor flashes of nightlight as spotlights comb the sky.</p>\n<p>Sam turns his eyes from the exterior and focuses more on the interior. A cupboard stands on his left, two dressing gowns and a safe inside. He narrows his eyes at the beds or well, the one bed in the room.</p>\n<p>A queen bed. Roscharch squints at it, and then sighs. Not unexpected per se, just surprising. He had expected two beds, as per norm. But bothering about it would be too much of a hassle; the end of the hall room allows for many benefits and the floor is high and spacious. A good setup if ever. This shouldn\u2019t compromise the mission that much, and the last thing he wants is to be picky on his first mission when requesting specifically for a more suitable setup would raise eyebrows. He might as well call it out now.</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cI\u2019ll take the left side.\u201d Roscharch starts checking the cupboards, finding only a Quran, and a prayer mat. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Gabriel looks up from where he had been perusing a magazine while chowing down on some fruit, walking over to stand in the doorway and noting the bed, as roscharch stands up from his cupboard check and heads to the bathroom. Oh. A queen bed? That was.. certainly unexpected. Never had that happen before, not on the couple of missions his dad sent him on. Samuel doesn\u2019t seem swayed by it at least, and Gabriel wonders quietly what he must have thought about it, as he hears Roscharch click on the lights and the marble clatter of the the tank lid beimg lifted from the tank. God this guy is weird.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll take the other side. No need to get too cuddly then!\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028Roscharch rolls his eyes as he places the tank lid back ontop of the toilet, unwrapping the soap to wash his hands. He calls out to Gabriel.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you get the bag in the left compartment of my duffle bag?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028\u201cCan\u2019t you do that yourself?\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cIt\u2019ll take you all of five seconds!\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028Gabriel sighs, as he stoops to open the bag, if Roscharch is giving him permission, he might as well peruse. The guy.. is packed to the fucking nines. Jesus christ this thing is full of bulky items. He pulls out the nondescript black bag, making his way over and placing it on the marble sink countertop and leaning against the wall, arms crossed as Samuel wordlessly unzips it and starts rummaging inside, taking out nondescript black cameras and placing them on the countertop, he counts six. \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re kind of overdoing it on the security, Sam. I mean Jesus Christ we\u2019re working for a foundation with the motto that secures, contains, and protects, but no need to outfit this place like Fort Knox.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028\u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah but <em>six</em>?\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028Samuel starts unpeeling the double sided tape on the back, setting the small paper backings to the side as he clicks them all on, one after the other. Once done, he switches his phone to an app, bringing up the camera and panning it over the room. He catches Gabriel in the picture, who gives the camera a sarcastic grin. Once Roscharch lowers it, Clef moseys on over, taking a peek at what Sam is doing on his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking pictures already of our cute rendezvous away from the facility is certainly a first.\u201d \u2028\u2028\u201cNo. I\u2019m doing a panoramic view of the room, so I can note the full image for checking if there\u2019s any discrepancies later. SAM catalogues everything in there, including the ostentatious prick leaning agains the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>Watching over Sams shoulder, the image loads for a bit before turning black, a separate application creating a digital render of the room, which Sam is using to circle certain areas and place models in. After a bit of thinking, the thing brings up stats, recommending plans of action and efficiency levels.<br/>\n\u2028\u2028\u201cYou mean the handsome blonde son of a gun, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028\u201cNo. I meant what the application wrote out.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028Sam taps the screen, bringing it back to the panoramic original view. Tapping Clefs image in the photo blurs him, and the words \u201cOSTENTATIOUS PRICK\u201d show up on the screen. Gabriel squints.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might want to bug check your software Sam, seems to be running below par\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cAlready did, it\u2019s running at 98.7% efficiency.\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cWell it\u2019s telling lies.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cSAM has been anything but a liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028The machine outputs a list of location suggestions for the cameras for the best coverage, registering them all as online and cataloguing the details of the room. Sam picks up a handful of them, moving to the far left of the bathroom to start giving them plastic covers that match the shade of the wall as he continues the conversation with clef, their voices echoing slightly in the enclosed space.</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cOh come on now. You\u2019ve used that thing to pretend to be you and blow off everyone who doesn\u2019t come bearing gifts and good fortune to your emails front door office. That doesn\u2019t sound like anything but a liar.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not lying, it\u2019s a convenient use of its function. Some people take offense to being answered so candidly by a robot.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cIt helps work efficiency, wasn\u2019t that something you\u2019ve always encouraged? I\u2019m hardly the most sociable person.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something called the skill of learning to manipulate the masses..\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cSomething that I won\u2019t personally be employing.\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028Gabriel watches Roscharch bustle about the room, setting them up. He turns his attention to the toiletries on the countertop, inspecting a bottle of lotion that tells him that removal of the luxury item will result in a pretty pricey 200 QAR or 85 USD charge to his card. Sheesh. He looks up as Roscharch moves past him back to the master bedroom, and starts repeating the process of the panorama, and Gabriel sighs. This will take forever, knowing Sam he will want every single cubic inch secure before he starts even considering going out, and Gabriel is more about fieldwork in you know, the field, than whatever B.S. Roscharch is dealing with in all these camera bugs and motion triggers and whatnot.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you HAVE to do this with everything?\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cyes, among other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2026left to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cWell.\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>With a grunt Roscharch stands up from where he had been placing yet another camera bug near the bed, tired eyes meeting Gabriels as he fiddles with the remaining devices in his hand as he answers.</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028\u201cFirst, I\u2019ve got to get these bugs set up. Audio too, for this room and the dining area, as well as the hallway. Motion detectors are online, at least from what I\u2019ve got running right now, the 36 hour battery life should keep us in the know, so to speak. Then I need to collect data from spoofing wifi networks and follow up on some of the leads they gave me and..\u201d</p>\n<p>Gabriel can feel his eyes closing just hearing that long list. \u201cBLAH BLAH BLAH. Look. Samuel. Saaammmy.\u201d He makes his way over, casually leaning an arm over him as he talks, leaning into him. \u201cHow about this. We do something FUN for a change. Get little ol killjoy out into the big city. We\u2019re in fucking Qatar of all places! In the fucking Ritz no less!\u201d Samuel tenses slightly, stiffening under the friendly gesture as Gabriel keeps talking. Clef knows if he stops then his overactive mind will stutter and short circuit, so the best way to deal with it is to overwhelm the stream of consciousness.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll go out to a club, ok? From there, get contacts, information, drinks, and then we\u2019ll settle in for the long haul! Sound good?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>Rosharch looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not really a nightlife guy.\u201d \u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to really be a nightlife guy to do it. Besides, won\u2019t do any harm, you can probably spoof a few contacts and identities off the hotshots there while I work on getting more \u201con the ground\u201d intelligence so to speak. Ok? It\u2019ll only be one night.\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028Samuel\u2019s still on the fence. Gabriel can see it in the way hes fidgeting with the cameras and the way his jaw is tightening, taken offguard by Clefs blatant disregard for his personal space.. Hes pulling a long face. It just won\u2019t do at all. Clef needs action. Clef needs city, and not to deal with the whims of this guy. Clef decides to pull out his trump card, talking softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSamuel.. Please? Come on. You\u2019re my partner for this mission, I\u2019m fine doing it alone, but if I can\u2019t have you around, then who will watch my back? You'll be my eyes in the sky. Come oon. Live a little. \u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>That got him. Samuels breath hitches as he squeezes the cameras tighter. Hes so used to watching from the distance and now Clef has two hands on his shoulders and is shifting him closer to the deep end. Clef watches the cogs work in his brain, the thought process as he weighs pros and cons,gaze narrowing and eyebrows furrowing, as he comes to a decision. His frown deepens for a moment before he relaxes, nodding curtly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Fine. But you have to stay where I can see you.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cAlright alright mr paranoid.\u201d \u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Roscharch is not sure if he regrets agreeing to this or not, but he's pretty sure its the latter. His eyes trace over the crowd, a mass of colour and movement and sound. Gabriel meanwhile, feels the rush of life around him and grins.</p>\n<p>The place Gabriel picked is a rooftop club which Gabriel assured Sam \u201cwas a lot tamer than the others.\u201d Roscharch can't tell. With all the people dancing on the open multicolored lit dance floor in front of the raised DJ station, it seems plenty rowdy enough. Then again he wasn\u2019t a person particularly given to this side of life, so how should he know?</p>\n<p>Sitting at the bar that\u2019s backlit through the hundreds of artful, multicolored drink bottles sitting on the shelves, his hands tap at the tinted glass table. He looks over at Gabriel. Gabriel is busy scanning the crowd while he waits to get the barkeeps attention, probably scouting for notables. He always had a way with remembering faces. It\u2019s what made him such a good people person, after all.</p>\n<p>Sam eyes turn to the city skyline. You can see the coast from here, the resplendent coloured buildings scraping the sky as they glow, some of them changing hues or writing words on them. It reminds him of the way the crystals in the caves glowed in the dark pitch of the cave, a world away. Hes never been one for homesickness but surrounded by the new he feels a pang of desire for the old, for the known. Surrounded by people, he feels more on edge than hes been in a while.</p>\n<p>Gabriel leans on the bar, addressing the man behind the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll have your blood and sand, shaken not stirred, while looking at a bottle of grey goose, and god help you if the orange is the artificial kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man squints, calculates that in his head, and then gives a curt nod. There have been stranger requests. He\u2019s not questioning it. He turns to Sam.</p>\n<p>\"And for you sir?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cSoju.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t serve that here sir.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cSeriously? Soju?\u201d Gabriel chides him. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty goddamn tame.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not the best of drinkers. Unlike you, Mr. Five Shots and a kombucha.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh that\u2019s bullshit. That\u2019s bullshit right there!\u201d Gabriel pokes him. \u201cDidn\u2019t have a problem with it in the past..\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. In the past.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cCome oooon Sam. One drink won\u2019t hurt. What happened to \u201cfitting in?\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028Sam frowns. He turns his gaze to the bartender, who offers him a small smile and clears his throat.\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cIf I may suggest.. perhaps a blue lagoon would suit you?\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201c\u2026What\u2019s in it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVodka, cura\u00e7ao, and lemonade, sir.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028\u201cSee! There you go sam! Lighten up a little, you got it!\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>One drink later and it had helped to lighten both of their mood and loosen their tongues, if a little. As the first rounds worked their magic and the sound of the music beat a steady rhythm into everything, a more casual conversation developed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, I don\u2019t get your whole deal with randomly testing people. What the hell was that drink order from earlier?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much testing as randomly deciding to mess with people. There's a lot of people out there that lack boundaries, complacent to jump sit and stay if you act like you're in charge. I'm testing that instinct. Didn't exactly order him to do that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Still. That's quite the gambit to play.\"</p>\n<p>\"You knooow sam. Maybe i'm just really picky about my favourite drinks. Have you considered that?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. Why on earth would I consider it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Future reference. Trust me, one of these days you and me have GOT to try some of them, I know some really fanatical ones. You've heard of the Corpse Reviver, but have you heard of the Red Seal of Valhalla?\"</p>\n<p>\"These sound like skips nicknames if I'm being dead honest.\"</p>\n<p>\"Moot point. Telling you now sam, chug one of those and you'll be feeling like a legend in not time.\"</p>\n<p>Their rather spirited conversation is interrupted by the elevator door opening across the bar. Gabriel looks over, gets a good look at who's coming out of it, and perks up, straightening as he leans to the side to get a better look. He finally recognizes someone of importance, someone of note. His eyes move past Roscharch, focusing on her.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s walking in the club, the elevator closing behind her. Tanned immaculate skin, long dark wavy hair, a white diamond choker and earrings, and a black dress. Her posse of girlfriends, all dressed as fashionably resplendent as her, chatter and laugh amongst each other, tapping on their phones, passing glances over the company to gauge how full this club was, adjusting their hair. They too are checking for people of interest, but in the way that\u2019s common for club goers.</p>\n<p>They say hellos to club goers that approach them, exchanging small talk and laughs before most of them head towards an empty half circle couch, sitting down and resuming the conversation. One of them breaks away to head to the bar. Gabriel elbows Sam.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s who?\u201d \u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cNoor Salim. She\u2019s the daughter of one of the CEOs connected to Cortex.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>Sam attempts to turn to look at her, and receives a hard elbow in the side. \u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it too obvious! \u2026Was she looking over here?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cYes? Why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cJust play along, okay?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>They resume their conversation, Gabriel a bit more animated perhaps than before, smiling and gesturing as they jump from topic and topic. Talking between them has always been easy, the ebb and flow always continuing it on. More drinks are ordered, and drunk. Sam nearly forgets the girl as they get into yet another discussion about what defines \u201cfreedom\u201d and what defines \u201cwaste of time\u201d until one of the girls from Noor\u2019s table gets up and approaches the bar. As she orders the drinks, she turns to Gabriel.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice you from across the club. What brings you here?\"</p>\n<p>Gabriel turns to her, raising his hand and waving it vaguely. \"Taking a week or three off of work. Company can shove it for all i care, GOD does it feel nice to be out.\"</p>\n<p>She nods. \"Uggh tell me about it. Some of the guys at my work, SO hungup on themselves couldn't tell their heads from their asses with half the repackaged shit they spit out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yup, definitely know the type. It's a ruthless field..\"</p>\n<p>The bartender comes over. She leans forward, giving him a smile.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah seven cosmo's pleaaase.Thanks!'</p>\n<p>Did you know that the cosmopoli-\"</p>\n<p>\u201cCosmopolitan was popularized by Madonna? Yeah I know.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny. Didn\u2019t think anyone would be able to beat me to the punch on that.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than a martini. Helps to know your drinks.\u201d\u2028\u2028The girl lets out a snicker. She gives him an incline of the head, as the bartender makes the drinks.\u2028She's interested now, Gabriel knows. First impressions like these are crucial, and he's played it safe and savvy. Can't give too much to make her think he's over-enthusiastic, or not enough to make her think he's one of <em>those</em> dry white collars.</p>\n<p>\"You know i was <em>just</em> saying this to my friend over here.\u2028If you're looking for dedication to the job, he's all that and more.\" That gets a laugh out of her. At Sams expense sure, but Sam will understand. Sam rolls his eyes, taking another swig of his drink and saying nothing.</p>\n<p>\"But lets talk less work and more party. I\u2019ve got to say the clubbing scene isn\u2019t anything compared to Berlin.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cLol you're soo right. You seem to know your party spots. What club in Berlin?\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh.. well there was a couple. But the one that stuck out to me the most was..ah what was it the Vundabar? Berghain? yes.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>Her jaw drops. Her eyebrows raised, before with a light laugh she leans closer to him.\u2028\u201cOh my god, the Berghain?? <em>The</em> Berghain?\"</p>\n<p>\"Unless I developed a stammer or heard myself wrong, yes, I one hundred percent mean the Berghain. Never had a problem getting in.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wow. Now that's a story.\"</p>\n<p>The bartender passes the drinks to the girl, she smiles, bids Gabriel adieu, and heads back to the table, handing them out and talking to them. A few of the girls look over at Gabriel, and then go back to discussion. Gabriel doesn't need to turn to know. He smiles, swirling his drink and then downing it.</p>\n<p>\"Hook line and sinker, Sam. Hook line and sinker. Just wait.\"</p>\n<p>He doesn't have to wait long. Samuel isn\u2019t so much focusing on the conversation anymore as tapping on his phone because soon enough, Gabriel is approached by three girls, keeping close to each other as they start asking him questions. Noor watches from the table, sprawling back against the seats and idly chewing on a toothpick. Eventually they ask him to come over and continue the conversation. Gabriel is happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>Sam's not invited to the table with them. That suits him just fine, probably wouldn\u2019t have gone anyway, and he chooses to tactfully ignore that theres still a bit of him hurt by the fact this wasn\u2019t something he was offered beforehand. He starts searching for medieval executions.</p>\n<p>First meeting someone who's prestigious and making them like you, when they're used to having people like them and it always being a one way street, is sort of like having a job interview, and there is absolutely no difference except the scene they use to do it. They ask for your experience. A rough CV. Through questions they prod you about your character traits. And then in some mystical unspoken way come to a decision on whether you're it or not.</p>\n<p>It is often that a person is underqualified. It's hard not to feel intimidated. There is the occasion where you're overqualified; know too much and the opponent can feel hostile, threatened, it's human nature. Gabriel however is able to balance the middle line, letting the girls talk, measuring the tempos and tones, playing the perfect foil and comrade.</p>\n<p>He's able to answer their questions, say things in a way familiar to their style of language. He's cordial. He's devilish. While Noor is generally more stoic, ignoring and addressing her girl friends to test him, soon enough they're talking to each other too, about the ways they subtly poke at others for fun, about stories of parties and late night hijinks.</p>\n<p>Sam searches up recipes in his phone and watches how to make a seafood bisque.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s kind of forgotten about the mission. The alchohol makes his head feel dizzy. And then hes nudged as Gabriel passes, arm in arm with that girl and her friends as they look at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man we\u2019re ditching this place. See me and Noor were talking and the main club scene is kinda overrated. The real money is in house parties. You coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028Sam considers if they want him to say no. He should say no. He could. But a small part of his heart recalls so clear what Gabriel said earlier. They should stick together, right? Sam makes a face, letting out a sigh as he goes to grab his coat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can bring the car round, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the girls looks over him. His demeanour leaves somewhat lacking in clubbing buddies. She voices her thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he should..\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam squints at her. He isn't helping his case. Gabriel looks between them and clears his throat.<br/>\n\u2028\u201cLadies! Ladies, please, someone has to drive me back. Appreciate the sentiment but my hotel is pretty far from here.\u201d \u2028\u2028\u201cOr weee could have someone take you back from my place gaaabe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd go to all that bother? Let me be a gentleman and spare you the fuss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGabe if that story about you in Maldives you told is true I think you\u2019re HARDLY the one to speak on gentlemanship.\u201d</p>\n<p>They burst into laughter, continuing to talk in this matter as they take the elevator down. They're already on private knowledge. Sam furrows his brow, to stop himself from rolling his eyes at their nonsensical blather. He has a feeling its going to be a long night. \u2028<br/>\n\u2014</p>\n<p>Out of the city, past the streets. The streets give way to backroads, then open roads, and finally, gates. Gates that lead into the places where the real rich come to play. Lots of land, massive and sprawling and lavish, houses that sit on an island all of their own. The club music is following here too, on the radio. \u2028Past long big driveways lined with desert and palm trees, they finally pull up on a geometric modern mansion, lights flashing from the windows, people partying on balconies, cars parked wherever. This. THIS is where the real party is.</p>\n<p>If Sam had to describe it, it had all the rowdiness of a high school get together that he was never invited to, wrapped up in the lavish bows and finery that gem and oil money can buy you. Catching up with the group, he walks in and-</p>\n<p>Ho. Lee. Fuck.</p>\n<p>The music is amplified, seeming to jostle his bones. The open floor layout isn\u2019t as crowded as the club from before, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t rife with action. A bar higher, if some of the way partygoers are dressed is anything to base off of. The entire place is tinged purple and red, people yelling and laughing over the din as waiters walk through the crowd passing small drinks and treats over adult movie stars lounging in the laps of suited men. The air seems colored too, a slight fog filling the air and giving it a dreamlike feel from the hookahs some of the party is using while sitting on divans, talking business.</p>\n<p>The kitchen island serves as a bar and a la carte table, with plates decked with proper food, and other delicacies being available. Hell, Sam thinks he sees small vials of meth on the table, for anyone who's feeling particularly ballsy. Gabriel lets out a low whistle and then laughs. Sam can\u2019t hear what he says over the din. He asks him to repeat it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT WAS THAT?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cSAM! WE\u2019RE GOING TO GET DRINKS OK? SAVE US A TABLE YA?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cHUH?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>Gabriel rolls his eyes, looking to the gaggle of girls and then gestures vaguely to Sam.<br/>\n\u2028\u201cTABLE. SAVE ONE.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cI-\u201c\u2028\u2028Before he can argue or voice any of the thoughts at the tip of his tongue, Gabriel yelps as Noor tugs him further into the dance floor. Seems she wants something to do with him. Sam stands there for a moment, collecting himself. The smoky perfumed air isn\u2019t properly circulating through his lungs, he thinks. It's drowning him. He swims back through the gaggle of people to the sides.</p>\n<p>With a gasp, he reaches the side of the room. The place seems to have widened, became liminal almost. It's hard to tell how far it is to the other side with the distance warped by fog. He grits his teeth as the house music hits a blaring note, his head still pounding. Note to self, ask for modificatory earphones or noise cancelling devices for future endeavours. He steadies himself with a hand to the wall, groans, and then looks around for an empty table.</p>\n<p>Most of them are taken up, groups of all variety sitting lying or using the table in some way. But god seems to have thrown him a bone, as conveniently. there\u2019s a free one only a ways away. And it only has a few empty and half full glasses as its occupants. As sam makes his way over, he concludes whoever they are, they sure shouldn't mind.</p>\n<p>He moves the glasses to one side, and then sits down gingerly, placing his elbows on the table and his chin on his palms as his eyes roam the room, trying to pick Gabirel out in the crowd. The lighting makes it hard to pick out finer details, people flashing in and out from silhouette to colour in flashes. He feels queasy. He takes out his phone and starts searching medieval executions again.</p>\n<p>His scrolling is interrupted by a man sitting down at the same table. He\u2019s rather portly, his forehead beaded from sweat. Sam has the suspicion it\u2019s from the outfit hes wearing, then from any physical exertion on the dance floor. The slightly unbuttoned shirt and tight dress pants do little to mitigate lend a pretty solid suspicion.</p>\n<p>The man is breathing hard, his mouth open, as he fumbles for one of the glasses and finishes whatever was in it with a thirsty chug. He looks at Sam, and then at the dance floor. Tilts his head to Sam slightly, and speaking in a raised accented voice, addresses him.</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cQuite the party tonight ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028Sam blinks, raising his head from his phone. Not sure what to say, he nods. \u2028</p>\n<p>\"Yeah it is.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cI tell you- can\u2019t beat parties like this! Similar in case to uh- Dionysus and his extravagant parties of old in the woods- sex and drinks and pure human energy!</p>\n<p>Silence. Sam only nods again.</p>\n<p>\"Know much about greek mythology my good man?\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cYeah, somewhat.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look the type. What was the word for it.. Well read. Well read, yes that\u2019s how you look.\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>Sam looks down to his phone again. Starts typing out queries on how to avoid awkward conversation. Where is Gabriel. He said he would be back with drinks a while ago. He hates this conversation. He hates this port, awkward man. He hates the air. He hates everyones smiling plastic faces. A waiter comes over, sliding a drink over wordlessly and leaves. The man doesn\u2019t seem to take the hint, taking a swig from the new drink, making a loud satisfied noise and fixing him with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou come here with anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028\u201cUh.. yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cWho?\u201d\u2028\u2028Sams head is pounding. This guys voice is annoying. He scans the dance floor, and spots Gabriel, dancing amongst the group. Or at least he thinks so. He points to him mutely.\u2028\u2028The man follows his pointed finger, looking back and forth between his wavering pointed hand and the direction hes pointing. Narrows his eyes as he seems to waver upon realizing who Sam seems to be pointing at. Clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cWell.. I suppose the place brings all types eh?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>Sam fixes him with a stare. What the hell is this man talking about. Does he think Gabriels outfit is weird?\u2028\u2028The man swallows, and then makes a quick exit, mumbling something about seeing a colleague somewhere elsewhere. Sam doesn\u2019t wave back.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Out on the dance floor, it\u2019s all color, noise, and sound. Gabriel laughs along as people dance their hearts out and move to the sound of the room, the rhythm an organ that beats within them. Noor is grinning and purposefully teasing at him by pressing against him as she dances, and giving him a knowing look.</p>\n<p>Oh, he sees how this is. Never one to turn down a good challenge, he teases her in kind, matching the tempo and showing off a fair bit just to be dramatic.</p>\n<p>Noor squeals, clapping her hands as she gets more frisky with it, shamoosing her body over to his as he does likewise and letting out a laugh as soon enough they match rhythms. An exchange without words, all body, all movement, until he's got his fingers intertwined with hers and their bodies are pressed against each other. She\u2019s pressed up against his chest as she gives him bedroom eyes. Gabriel smiles. \u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cHellooo darling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028With a gasp she squeezes his hand in hers, giggling as she presses against him, her free hand walking up his chest as she purrs.\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cHeeyyy. Come here often?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cNo but a little devil from hell itself charmed me down here, would you believe that?\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>She snickers, her hand squeezing his arm as she turns her head to press against his chest. \u2028\u2028\u201cOhh you\u2019re too cute. Say.. wanna head somewhere more.. private? Mm?\u201d\u2028</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028She tugs his shirt, biting her lip devilishly as she turns around and starts making her way through the crowd. Up a set of stairs, through corridors, and then to one that\u2019s more empty, private. \u2028\u2028\u201cTurn around.\u201d\u2028\u2028Gabriel complies, turning around and facing the wall as he listens to her punch in a code to the door. It beeps and there\u2019s the sound of a lock opening. \u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>\u201cOk come on.\u201d\u2028\u2028She grabs him by the wrist, closing the door behind him a bit breathlessly. A hallway greets him with its stark white walls, wooden paneled floor, and black doors. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the party below, and a glimpse of what the house probably looks like in the daylight, when it's not full of rowdy rich partygoers. The music is quieter here, muffled by the soundproof walls. Gabriel only gets a glimpse before they\u2019re walking into a bedroom, the lights turning on automatically as they enter. A large bed sits in the middle of the room, paneled wardrobe on the left, master bathroom on the right. She walks ahead of him, giving a little sigh as she moves to hop onto the cushy bed, spreading herself on it and beckoning to him.</p>\n<p>Gabriel takes a deep breath, eyes flicking over her body before he shakes his head with a smile, raising his hands. He unbuttons a few of the buttons of his shirt before moving to get on the bed with her, pressing her down as with a happy little sigh, she wraps her arms around his neck and starts pressing kisses into his skin.</p>\n<p>He lets her, hands undoing each and every strap on the back of her dress as she presses against him. Their lips press against each other, her mouth locking against his as he closes his eyes, engaged in a passionate kiss as her hands card through his hair.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s so focused, she doesn\u2019t feel the prick of a small sharp needle into the back of her neck as his fingers press against her skin.</p>\n<p>Her eyes flutter. Gabriel presses her down. It\u2019ll be okay, he wants to say. But it\u2019s best to let the mind fill in the blanks naturally for when she wakes up. Things like this can just cause trouble.</p>\n<p>Amnestics can be a hell of a punch.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s out in a minute, breaths rising and falling softly as Gabriel pulls away from her, buttoning his shirt back up and grabbing his belt. As much as he\u2019d like to continue, it\u2019s best to leave it for the after mission celebration. Now, to see about what this place was.</p>\n<p>Opening the door, he takes out his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSam.\u201d\u2028\u2028No response. \u2028\u2028\u201cSaaam. You there? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re too busy talking it up to a group of hot babes and have left me out in the cold.\u201d\u2028A moment of silence, broken by a typing chat bubble popping up and then- \u2028\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>There he is.</p>\n<p>\"How's it going down there?\"</p>\n<p>\"Bad.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, anyways, any hope of getting into the smart home system?\"</p>\n<p>Sams little indicator displays as seen for all of two minutes while Gabriel paces. He's halfway to asking Sam if he's passed out at the table when he starts typing again.</p>\n<p>\"I'm in.\"</p>\n<p>\"That was fast. Go ahead and navigate to the top floor. You see me?\"</p>\n<p>Another few moments. Then a response.</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Great. Keep your sights around the area.\"</p>\n<p>\"You sure you don't want me to try and look for auspicious areas?\"</p>\n<p>Gabriel ignores him. He's got it, pretty sure. Besides, there's fun in exploring.</p>\n<p>He tries the door opposite the bedroom. Another bedroom. From somewhere in the room, he knows Sam is watching him. This one has a darker palette than the more neutral hues of the other bedroom, and smells of cologne. There's a computer set up in the corner, prompting his attention. He takes out a USBdrive from his pocket, twirling it before pushing it into the input slot.</p>\n<p>The thing flickers, lines of code breaking down the defenses of the machine as Gabriel runs a cursory eye over the documents on the table. A proposition to set back funds for a certain subdivision of the marketing departmnet. A request to move the finish date of a building over by a year. Nothing of note, to him.</p>\n<p>The computer shows a blue screen, indicating it's done scraping data. He tugs it out, inspecting the USB drive before turning to the rest of the room and giving it a look over.</p>\n<p>He decides he'll come back later. Best to cover all the points to some extent before delving into one specific scrub down.</p>\n<p>He makes for another door. Walking into the room, he cam immediately tell this is where the money is at.</p>\n<p>It's an office. The lights are off, but moonlight shines in from the large bay windows to the left of the office, fluttering slightly in the draft. The moon illuminates the handsome wood paneling of the walls, The black leather couches seated around a coffee table, and the desk at the far end of the room, a red chair and a large painting behind it.</p>\n<p>Jackpot.</p>\n<p>These places are veritable treasure troves. He heads over to the table, starts opening each and every drawer as he taps the computer awake. He repeats the process of taking out another thumbdrive and pressing it in as he searches in a more traditional way.</p>\n<p>Stationary. A gun. Paperwork. A watch.</p>\n<p>It's not really necessary to search in this way, he knows, but he enjoys the process. A way of getting hands on into the heads of others. The small eccentricities.</p>\n<p>Suddenly all the lights cut off. His phone buzzes.</p>\n<p>\"Someone's coming. Hide.\"</p>\n<p>Gabriels head whips up to the screen. 87%. Still needs a bit more time.</p>\n<p>He scans the room. A wardrobe. Curtains. Nowhere to really hide.</p>\n<p>There's the sound of heels clacking on wooden flooring. It gets closer to the door. 90%. Holy shit will it load faster?</p>\n<p>Gabriel curses under his breath, smacking the table to try and make it go faster. It doesn't. There's not enough time, he yanks it out and turns the computer off, ducking under the desk.</p>\n<p>And just in time too, as the door clicks and light hits the office chair as Gabriel huddles underneath, trying to keep his frame small as the figure, whoever they are, stands for a long moment in the hall door.</p>\n<p>It walks in, heels tapping as with slow deliberate steps, it stalks over to the far side of the room. There's the sound of rifling through papers, and a small exhale. The papers are put down, and Gabriel strains his ears to keep a rough estimate of where the figure is.</p>\n<p>It turns. Takes a few steps in an indeterminable direction before striding over to stand in front of the desk. He looks down to note her dark two inch platformed boots.</p>\n<p>It stays there for what feels like a dragged out couple of moments, Gabriel watching the shoes before it turns, heading out of view, and stops somewhere at the wall to the right.</p>\n<p>He hears a clatter as something is removed, and then a sigh as with the clack of a bracelet, they start punching in a code. A whirr, as what he can presume is a safe opens, and something is removed.</p>\n<p>He wishes he could see what it was. It's hard to tell. Either way, the figure only lingers a few moments there, before closing the safe, replacing the cover of the hidden panel, and leaving the room.</p>\n<p>Gabriel counts to 160 in his head. And then gets up, dusting himself off. He looks to where the figure lingered, and sees a painting, Arabic Men with scabbards and white horses galloping into battle. It speaks of ancient gold, of long faded gunpowder, in its gold leafed wooden frame.</p>\n<p>Gabriel makes his way over, hands pressing against the frame as he tugs at it. No dice. He takes a closer look at it.</p>\n<p>It's carved, beautifully really. Hawks fly over the top of the frame, and here soldiers on horseback also ride and clash across the walls and bottom of the frame, the men determined and gripping hard on the reins, the horses bucking with wild eyes as they too seem ready to jump into the painting itself to with the way the carver has articulated the grooves.</p>\n<p>He's pretty sure he knows exactly what this is. Doesn't like the idea of it though. He picks up his phone, texting Sam.</p>\n<p>\"Sam, do you see me right now?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean no?\"</p>\n<p>\"Closed camera system specifically in that room. I can see a lot, but that ones on a different level. That or it doesn't have one.\"</p>\n<p>Great. Just great. The last thing he needs actually. He's not good with finicky things like this, he mutters, as he presses the frame at random. Some of the parts seem to shift but not many. He decides he'll come back to it another time.</p>\n<p>For now, he needs to move on to the other rooms.</p>\n<p>As he searches, his phone beeps, mostly texts he only reads for directions. Nothing he directly replies to. Sam can understand, time is of the essence after all. The rest of the rooms turn up a few bits of fancy, but nothing of real note. Thumbdrives are plugged in to scrape data, drawers are opened and closed. Finishing up with a decided slam of a bedroom, he sighs, stretches, and then walks back into the hallway and makes for the door. He pulls out his phone to ask Sam for the code and is greeted by a text from Sam, overlapping the others.</p>\n<p>\"Guard. Heading your way.\"</p>\n<p>Think fast. No use in ducking in, it'd be more suspicious. So as the guard approaches, Gabriel leans against the wall, adopting an air of agitation as he makes eye contact with the guard through the panel in the door, who gives him a quizical look and punches in the code.</p>\n<p>As soon as the door opens, Gabriel walks up to him, talking to him a mile a minute.</p>\n<p>\"THERE you are man! Christ took you guys long enough! Look. I've been locked in here for a while, had a thing with Noor back there- she's nice you know but I *have to get going* ok? I mean christ i was looking for an alert or something everywhere do you guys even check the cameras?\"</p>\n<p>The man looks at him, bemused. His sturdy frame, dressed in a black suit falters. Gabriel swallows.</p>\n<p>\"God- anyways i'm going back down to the party. She knows where to find me I gave her my contacts so no worries there. You can check. Au revoir!\"</p>\n<p>He's out before the guard can even think to follow him, and by the time he does, Gabriels disappeared into the mosh of people in the main area of the mansion, eyes darting around the floor as he descends the stairs.</p>\n<p>There Sam is, sitting at a table as he scrolls his phone. Kind of the outlier, but at least his standoffish nature makes him easy to spot by how candidly he avoids crowds.</p>\n<p>He skips the last few steps, pushing through people to pounce on Sam, who startles, jolting in his seat and cursing aloud as he nearly drops his phone. Gabriel grins.</p>\n<p>\"It's go time.\"</p>\n<p>Sam adjusts himself, trying to say something, to which Gabriel merely shakes his head at. Not here. Grabbing Sam by the wrist, he pulls him through the people, the smoky air, and out into the night air. The stars shine dimly in the pitch black over the waves of haphazardly parked cars.</p>\n<p>\"Are you going to tell me what happened in there, or am I going to have to wait for tomorrow to figure out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow. I got you some chips though, trust me, you're going to want to look at those. Look at me being productive!\"</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t\u201cI think it\u2019s time you got a change of pace don\u2019t you think? Been a hot minute since you\u2019ve seen field work, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d The voice, slightly chiding in tone, was directed at Gabriel Clef from a small screen present on his desk. Despite the distortion leveled on it to protect the users identity, its southern twang still rang true through its words.\n\n\n\nWhen he had been told his father would make it up to him, Gabriel hardly expected this to be the outcome. Then again, planning around his father had always been like planning for a chance of rain that benefited you; hardly possible, not foolproof worthy to bring an umbrella, and mostly up to the changing of tides. \n\n\n\n\n\nGabriel Clef sat fiddling with a stressball, leaning back in the plush leather roller chair as he pretended he really gave a fuck. It wasn\u2019t particularly the safest way to lounge, hes been warned against it but in the comfort of the red and black office there wasnt a soul going to tell him off. The benefits of seniority and status\u00a0\u00a0in his position.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes flick down to the fidget toy, giving it another squeeze, then up to the screen. The call had been completely out of the blue, as per usual, but when you\u2019re the son of Alto Clef you learn to work on his schedule. Not yours. \n\n\n\nThe screen bears no emotion, no sign of the larger than life figure on the other end, excepting the flickering of the SCP logo on the screen. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo how about it?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nSamuel Roscharch squints. \n\n\n\n\u201cA change of scenery?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYes Samuel. I think you\u2019re in high need of it, and not just that, considering your work here in Area Two has just about been offloaded to me, I don\u2019t see why not. Additionally, you have 180 vacation days you have failed to cash-in, which you can still make use of at any time you deem necessary. Whens the last time you had a genuine peek at the outside world outside of work hours? \n\n\n\nSamuel sighs, carding a hand through his head of black hair, strands of white interspersed amongst it from the toll stress has taken on him,\u00a0\u00a0as he stares fruitlessly down at the report\u00a0\u00a0paper he\u2019s supposed to be grading. The words have bled together a long time ago, a mixture of official jargon and foundation doublespeak that would lull less experienced personnel to sleep. That was somewhat of its purpose; these papers were important after all, couldn\u2019t have just anyone understanding what exactly they pertained to. Sometimes Samuel had the thought that half of these papers didn\u2019t even understand themselves. \n\n\n\nWith his new position, he was getting recognised. That was clear,\u00a0\u00a0yes, but by god did the paperwork keep on stacking up. Where he had been able to slice through 20 reports with ease, he now saw an ever climbing pile of tasks in his inbox tray, a hydra where every report equalled another three more and kept him chained to his desk, that insistent thought in the back of his head repeating he could only ever take a break when it was all done.\n\n\n\nHe looks up at the evidence board in front of him, lines crossing over pictures, coffee stained papers and post-it notes.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe SAM was right. The dang thing just about ran autonomously now, in regards to answering his teams inquiries.\u00a0\u00a0His social inbox was quiet, only devoted to\u00a0\u00a0these more administrative papers that bore all the importance of any document. Samuel Roscharch had less requirement than ever to interact with his fellow man, which suited him just fine all things considered. Yet there was still a nagging for a genuine push to do so; as the saying goes all work no play makes Jack a dull boy. And judging by stats, with a cursory side eye to the other screen, he was in sore need of it. \n\n\n\nSam waves a dismissive hand to his main monitors digital assistant, as pinching his nose, he squints at the letters on the paper he\u2019s reading through. \n\n\n\n\u201cFine. Set me up on a field mission that you deem fits my ability criteria.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAffirmative leave it to me!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nIn two different offices, 200 km from each other, a memo is received on their respective computers, one being eyed with casual boredom, to be perused sporadically as per his norm when the mood struck him, the other clicked open immediately and several tabs brought up automatically. His computer system detects and highlights relevant information and documentation. Their respective digital friends spoke of it in their own ways, informing them verbally of the necessary TLDR. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou will be going on a two person mission to investigate a company that seems to be using anomalous tech to further their company proceeds. Due to our lack of jurisdiction\u00a0\u00a0in the Gulf, you will be going undercover. Attached to the dossier you will find your fly date, and your allowance. And, ah yes. Your partner for this mission will be..\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\n\n\u201cClef.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSamuel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon't you think that getup is a bit much?\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuel Roscharch squints. His flight was a long one, and he\u2019s not used to the bright night lights of the cities glare. He's used to the dimmer light sensitive bulbs of the facility, which he realises weren\u2019t as bright as he once judged them to be if these are so grating on the eyes. Here Gabriel is, in his usual\u00a0\u00a0(at least for Gabriels case) bright outfit, consisting of white jeans and a prussian blue hawaiian shirt with a leaf pattern. Roscharchs eyes flick over the loud outfit, the LC500 Lexus he's leaning against, and Gabriels shit eating grin he's giving Roscharch, and can\u2019t help but express some doubt on whether the guy had fully read the brief or if he\u2019s just here for vacations sake. He sure looks the part. The company full paid mission fund does come in handy for drinks after all.\n\n\n\nGabriel chides him.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSomeone didn\u2019t read the dress memo. You look like someones white collar accountant.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Compared to Gabriel there was none of the flamboyance and color present in Roscharch\u2019s outfit. Dressed in a brown jacket tossed over a work shirt and corduroy dress pants, a patterned tie and a standard issue belt, he was someone you\u2019d pass over in the street, eyes sliding over him in a crowd without a second thought. While Clef looked like he\u2019d walked straight out of a magazine page, Roscharchs garb was more ruffled, the blame being his far from peaceful night on the plane. He never was the best sleeper. \n\n\n\n\u201cI did read the memo, it said to fit in and be discrete. Kind of what I was going for.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a hoist, he throws his dented case and duffle bag into the open back of the car alongside Gabriel\u2019s suitcases, slamming it shut and then making his way over to the right side.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah well where we\u2019re going that drab little outfit of yours will NOT make you \u201cfit in\u201d. Or \u201cbe discrete\u201d. Just saying!\u201d Gabriel swings into the drivers seat, turning the key and revving\u00a0\u00a0the engine. It roars to life, giving a purr that makes him grin.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI managed to get a bit of a change to accommodation.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBy bit of a change you mean upping our expenditures. \u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a more.. considerate use of our funds. To fit the clientele we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cFine. Where are we going anyway.\u201d \n\n\n\nRoscharch shifts, buckling in and checking the glove and shades compartments, as Gabriel pulls out and onto the main road.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll see!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be upgraded to an executive suite immediately. Though do note it is a smoking floor.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean for the room?\u201d \n\n\n\nThe entire lobby was warmly lit by the resplendent glow of the 300 crystal chandelier hanging above the room, the walls a tangle of repeating geometric patterns the eye easily got lost in. People talk in small groups scattered across the tiled marble floor while a pianist plays on the grand piano standing in the lobby. Gabriel leans on the counter, talking to the well groomed young man manning the lobby desk, his reflection catching in the mottled gold shield behind it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWell it means you\u2019ll get a living room, separate bathroom and a balcony along with the current accommodation. \n\n\n\n\u201cSee what did i tell you?\u201d Gabriel turns his head. \u201cUpgrade.\u201d \n\n\n\nSamuel squints at him, hand squeezing the sash of his duffle bag. He\u2019s not used to this.\u00a0\u00a0He just wants to get to his room and set up the necessary provisions and leech off the wifi for a while as he scours the already thoroughly thumbed through brief.\u00a0\u00a0The plane trip has left him exhausted enough. He scowls. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just need your company ID, sir.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWait what? My ID?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes sir you see as part of the discount and upgrade we have to see any identification of your employment with the company.\u201d \n\n\n\nGabriel blinks and bend down to rummage through the duffel bag next to him. Shit shit shit. Shit!! Shit!! It\u2019s not under the folded outerwear, or the pocket with the magazines,\u00a0\u00a0definitely isn\u2019t in the compartment with his toiletries, and scraping the side only brings up a few errant condoms.\u00a0\u00a0No ID. Sam watches him somewhat bemused.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have it on me. I\u2019m on vacation.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. A business card will do then.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t give out business cards. //I\u2019ve never had this issue before//. Look, I\u2019ve booked here before just pull my profile up from last time I booked, it should be there.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course sir let me just check.\u201d\n\n\n\nGabriel\u2019s nails tap impatiently on the marble desk, eying up the company around them. Its mostly a mix of people that, like Gabriel had implied earlier, were on the higher side of life, if not apparent from their tailored fitted clothing, and well maintained figures. There\u2019s the occasional tourist family, outliers for their pack of bags, bright artificial colors and corny novelty t-shirts that don\u2019t toe the line between post-irony and simplification (an important distinction from the bourgeoisie version of those sort of things) but they\u2019re few and far between. From what Gabriel can see, nobody of note that he needs to keep an eye on is present. \n\n\n\nThe receptionists tanned fingers tap over the keys of the keyboard, eyes flicking over the screen.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve checked, and while we have your passport, I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have your company ID sir.\u201d\n\n\n\nGabriel\u2019s voice raises, a slight scoff on his tone as he inclines his head. \u201cThis is fucking bullsh-\u201c \n\n\n\n\u201cSir I\u2019m afraid its hotel policy-\u201c \n\n\n\n\u201cYes I KNOW its hotel policy. Totally get what you\u2019re saying here. I\u2019m saying this is new to me. This hasn\u2019t happened to me before, and if this is the route we\u2019re picking then be confident in the fact i\u2019m never booking with you, //again//.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe receptionist looks up from his computer, his dark brown eyes meet Gabriel\u2019s amber ones. A look dares him to call his bluff. That he double dog dares him. The receptionist decides he doesn\u2019t like his odds. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go check with my manager sir, one moment.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s gone for a few moments, disappearing behind a wall. When he returns, stoic faced as usual but to the watchful eye a bit more of a crease in his other perfectly content composure. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry sir. No need to worry about all of this. Your papers are in order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo worries. Do you mind if I get your name so i can send you them later? Just for you to make sure, iron everything out so we don\u2019t have this problem in future.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s body language relaxes, giving him a wry smile as the man goes a shade paler. \n\n\n\n\u201cIts really not necessary.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo no i insist. For your records, of course.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cUh.. Mohammed Shakif,\u00a0\u00a0sir.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWell Mohammed, expect an email your hotels way in i\u2019d say.. five to seven business days. Tops. And trust me you\u2019ll know when it comes.\u201d \n\n\n\nMohammed gulped, staring straight ahead while the pair carted their luggage past him into the mahogany hallway with the four elevators. \n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nThey arrive on the 29th floor of the hotel. \n\n\n\nThe first thing they both notice walking out into the hallway is the slight smell of nicotine, causing Roscharch to wrinkle his nose as they walk through the wooden paneled halls, shoes quiet on the white carpeted floor. The doors are blue, little side tables with lamps and phones interspersed across the wide hall, dead quiet courtesy of the copious amount of soundproof. What goes on in these suites is the business of the resident, not the hotel, after all. They pay good money to make sure of it. \n\n\n\nSamuel had refused concierge \u2014 even at the behest of Gabriel for the amount of arm work he would have to do dragging up the provisions and the insistence of \u201cits paid we might as well indulge\u201d \u2014\u00a0\u00a0it had been too risky in Sam\u2019s opinion for the\u00a0\u00a0bell boys to lay even a finger on the handles of their luggage. But in all actuality, it was moreso\u00a0\u00a0he preferred keeping some sort of modicum of connection to being the working man, less removed from all this fancy expenditure and having people wait on doing what you wanted. \n\n\n\nGabriel is already up ahead, pressing the sleek grey keycard with the hotels insignia against the reader as he pushes against the gold handle of the blue door. It opens into a living room, fit with manila painted walls, a wide couch and tv setup, and a minibar counter with a fruit bowl on it. Dark heavy curtains are directly opposite the door, hiding the sparkling view of the city.\u00a0\u00a0While Gabriel drops his luggage like a bag of rocks and beelines for the fruit bowl and the drink selection,\u00a0\u00a0Roscharch carries his to the master bedroom.\n\n\n\nThe entire place is carpeted, their steps muffled. With the tug of a cord, the heavy drapes lining one side of the room give way to a tremendous view of the city skylines, skyscrapers embedded with LED lights to give a moving swaying display on their surfaces, the red and yellow blink of cars passing below to the dancing multicolor flashes of nightlight as spotlights comb the sky. \n\n\n\nSam turns his eyes from the exterior and focuses more on the interior. A cupboard stands on his left, two dressing gowns and a safe inside. He narrows his eyes at the beds or well, the one bed in the room.\n\n\n\nA queen bed. Roscharch squints at it, and then sighs. Not unexpected per se, just surprising. He had expected two beds, as per norm. But bothering about it would be too much of a hassle; the end of the hall room allows for many benefits and the floor is high and spacious. A good setup if ever. This shouldn\u2019t compromise the mission that much, and the last thing he wants is to be picky on his first mission when requesting specifically for a more suitable setup would raise eyebrows. He might as well call it out now. \n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cI\u2019ll take the left side.\u201d Roscharch starts checking the cupboards, finding only a Quran, and a prayer mat. Nothing else. \n\n\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Gabriel looks up from where he had been perusing a magazine while chowing down on some fruit, walking over to stand in the doorway\u00a0\u00a0and noting the bed, as roscharch stands up from his cupboard check and heads to the bathroom. Oh. A queen bed? That was.. certainly unexpected. Never had that happen before, not on the couple of missions his dad sent him on. Samuel doesn\u2019t seem swayed by it at least, and Gabriel wonders quietly what he must have thought about it, as he hears Roscharch click on the lights and the marble clatter of the the tank lid beimg lifted from the tank. God this guy is weird. \n\n\n\n\u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll take the other side. No need to get too cuddly then!\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028Roscharch rolls his eyes as he places the tank lid back ontop of the toilet, unwrapping the soap to wash his hands. He calls out to Gabriel. \n\n\n\n\u201cCan you get the bag in the left compartment of my duffle bag?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u201cCan\u2019t you do that yourself?\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cIt\u2019ll take you all of five seconds!\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028Gabriel sighs, as he stoops to open the bag, if Roscharch is giving him permission, he might as well peruse. The guy.. is packed to the fucking nines. Jesus christ this thing is full of bulky items. He pulls out the nondescript black bag, making his way over and placing it on the marble sink countertop and leaning against the wall, arms crossed as Samuel wordlessly unzips it and starts rummaging inside, taking out nondescript black cameras and placing them on the countertop, he counts six. \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re kind of overdoing it on the security, Sam. I mean Jesus Christ we\u2019re working for a foundation with the motto that secures, contains, and protects, but no need to outfit this place like Fort Knox.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah but //six//?\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028Samuel starts unpeeling the double sided tape on the back, setting the small paper backings to the side as he clicks them all on, one after the other.\u00a0\u00a0Once done, he switches his phone to an app, bringing up the camera and panning it over the room. He catches Gabriel in the picture, who gives the camera a sarcastic grin. Once Roscharch lowers it, Clef moseys on over, taking a peek at what Sam is doing on his phone. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cTaking pictures already of our cute rendezvous away from the facility is certainly a first.\u201d \u2028\u2028\u201cNo. I\u2019m doing a panoramic view of the room, so I can note the full image for checking if there\u2019s any discrepancies later. SAM catalogues everything in there, including the ostentatious prick leaning agains the door.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0Watching over Sams shoulder, the image loads for a bit before turning black, a separate application creating a digital render of the room, which Sam\u00a0\u00a0is using to circle certain areas and place models in. After a bit of thinking, the thing brings up stats, recommending plans of action and efficiency levels.\n\n\u00a0\u2028\u2028\u201cYou mean the handsome blonde son of a gun, don\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u201cNo. I meant what the application wrote out.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028Sam taps the screen, bringing it back to the panoramic original view. Tapping Clefs image in the photo blurs him, and the words \u201cOSTENTATIOUS PRICK\u201d show up on the screen. Gabriel squints. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou might want to bug check your software Sam, seems to be running below par\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cAlready did, it\u2019s running at 98.7% efficiency.\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cWell it\u2019s telling lies.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cSAM has been anything but a liar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028The machine outputs a list of location suggestions for the cameras for the best coverage, registering them all as online and\u00a0\u00a0cataloguing the details of the room. Sam picks up a handful of them, moving to the far left of the bathroom to start giving them plastic covers that match the shade of the wall as he continues the conversation with clef, their voices echoing slightly in the enclosed space.\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cOh come on now. You\u2019ve used that thing to pretend to be you and blow off everyone who doesn\u2019t come bearing gifts and good fortune to your emails front door office. That doesn\u2019t sound like anything but a liar.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lying, it\u2019s a convenient use of its function. Some people take offense to being answered so candidly by a robot.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cIt helps work efficiency, wasn\u2019t that something you\u2019ve always encouraged? I\u2019m hardly the most sociable person.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something called the skill of learning to manipulate the masses..\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cSomething that I won\u2019t personally be employing.\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028Gabriel watches Roscharch bustle about the room, setting them up. He turns his attention to the toiletries on the countertop, inspecting a bottle of lotion that tells him that removal of the luxury item will result in a pretty pricey 200 QAR or 85 USD charge to his card. Sheesh. He looks up as Roscharch moves past him back to the master bedroom, and starts repeating the process of the panorama,\u00a0\u00a0and Gabriel sighs. This will take forever, knowing Sam he will want every single cubic inch secure before he starts even considering going out, and Gabriel is more about fieldwork in you know, the field, than whatever B.S. Roscharch is dealing with in all these camera bugs and motion triggers and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you HAVE to do this with everything?\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cyes, among other things.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s ...left to do?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cWell.\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a grunt Roscharch stands up from where he had been placing yet another camera bug near the bed, tired eyes meeting Gabriels as he fiddles with the remaining devices in his hand as he answers. \n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u201cFirst, I\u2019ve got to get these bugs set up. Audio too, for this room and the dining area, as well as the hallway. Motion detectors are online, at least from what I\u2019ve got running right now, the 36 hour battery life should keep us in the know, so to speak. Then I need to collect data from spoofing wifi networks and follow up on some of the leads they gave me and..\u201d\n\n\n\nGabriel can feel his eyes closing\u00a0\u00a0just hearing that long list. \u201cBLAH BLAH BLAH. Look. Samuel. Saaammmy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He makes his way over, casually leaning an arm over him as he talks, leaning into him. \u201cHow about this. We do something FUN for a change. Get little ol killjoy out into the big city. We\u2019re in fucking Qatar of all places! In the fucking Ritz no less!\u201d Samuel tenses slightly, stiffening under the friendly gesture as Gabriel keeps talking. Clef knows if he stops then his overactive mind will stutter and short circuit, so the best way to deal with it is to overwhelm the stream of consciousness.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll go out to a club, ok? From there, get contacts, information, drinks, and then we\u2019ll settle in for the long haul! Sound good?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nRosharch looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not really a nightlife guy.\u201d \u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to really be a nightlife guy to do it. Besides, won\u2019t do any harm, you can probably spoof a few contacts and identities off the hotshots there while I work on getting more \u201con the ground\u201d intelligence so to speak. Ok? It\u2019ll only be one night.\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028Samuel\u2019s still on the fence. Gabriel can see it in the way hes fidgeting with the cameras and the way his jaw is tightening, taken offguard by Clefs blatant disregard for his personal space.. Hes pulling a long face. It just won\u2019t do at all. Clef needs action. Clef needs city, and not to deal with the whims of this guy. Clef decides to pull out his trump card, talking softly. \n\n\n\n\u201cSamuel.. Please? Come on. You\u2019re my partner for this mission, I\u2019m fine doing it alone, but if I can\u2019t have you around, then who will watch my back? You'll be my eyes in the sky. Come oon. Live a little. \u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nThat got him. Samuels breath hitches as he squeezes the cameras tighter. Hes so used to watching from the distance and now Clef has two hands on his shoulders and is shifting him closer to the deep end. Clef watches the cogs work in his brain, the thought process as he weighs pros and cons,gaze narrowing and eyebrows furrowing, as he comes to a decision. His frown deepens for a moment before he relaxes, nodding curtly.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright. Fine. But you have to stay where I can see you.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cAlright alright mr paranoid.\u201d \u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nRoscharch is not sure if he regrets agreeing to this or not, but he's pretty sure its the latter. His eyes trace over the crowd, a mass of colour and movement and sound. Gabriel meanwhile, feels the rush of life around him and grins. \n\n\n\nThe place Gabriel picked is a rooftop club which Gabriel assured Sam \u201cwas a lot tamer than the others.\u201d Roscharch can't tell. With all the people dancing on the open multicolored lit dance floor in front of the raised DJ station, it seems plenty rowdy enough. Then again he wasn\u2019t a person particularly given to this side of life, so how should he know?\n\n\n\nSitting at the bar that\u2019s backlit through the hundreds of artful, multicolored drink bottles sitting on the shelves, his hands tap at the tinted glass table. He looks over at Gabriel. Gabriel is busy scanning the crowd while he waits to get the barkeeps attention, probably scouting for notables. He always had a way with remembering faces. It\u2019s what made him such a good people person, after all.\n\n\n\nSam eyes turn to the city skyline. You can see the coast from here, the resplendent coloured buildings scraping the sky as they glow, some of them changing hues or writing words on them. It reminds him of the way the crystals in the caves glowed in the dark pitch of the cave, a world away. Hes never been one for homesickness but surrounded by the new he feels a pang of desire for the old, for the known. Surrounded by people, he feels more on edge than hes been in a while. \n\n\n\nGabriel leans on the bar, addressing the man behind the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll have your blood and sand, shaken not stirred, while looking at a bottle of grey goose, and god help you if the orange is the artificial kind.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe man squints, calculates that in his head, and then gives a curt nod. There have been stranger requests. He\u2019s not questioning it. He turns to Sam. \n\n\n\n\"And for you sir?\"\n\n\n\n\u201cSoju.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t serve that here sir.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cSeriously? Soju?\u201d Gabriel chides him. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty goddamn tame.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not the best of drinkers. Unlike you, Mr. Five Shots and a kombucha.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cOhhh that\u2019s bullshit. That\u2019s bullshit right there!\u201d Gabriel pokes him. \u201cDidn\u2019t have a problem with it in the past..\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. In the past.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cCome oooon Sam. One drink won\u2019t hurt. What happened to \u201cfitting in?\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028Sam frowns. He turns his gaze to the bartender, who offers him a small smile and clears his throat.\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cIf I may suggest.. perhaps a blue lagoon would suit you?\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201c...What\u2019s in it?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cVodka, cura\u00e7ao, and lemonade, sir.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cSure. Whatever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u201cSee! There you go sam! Lighten up a little, you got it!\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nOne drink later and it had helped to lighten both of their mood and loosen their tongues, if a little. As the first rounds worked their magic and the sound of the music beat a steady rhythm into everything, a more casual conversation developed. \n\n\n\n\u201cSee, I don\u2019t get your whole deal with randomly testing people. What the hell was that drink order from earlier?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much testing as randomly deciding to mess with people. There's a lot of people out there that lack boundaries, complacent to jump sit and stay if you act like you're in charge. I'm testing that instinct. Didn't exactly order him to do that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Still. That's quite the gambit to play.\"\n\n\n\n\"You knooow sam. Maybe i'm just really picky about my favourite drinks. Have you considered that?\"\n\n\n\n\"No. Why on earth would I consider it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Future reference. Trust me, one of these days you and me have GOT to try some of them, I know some really fanatical ones. You've heard of the Corpse Reviver, but have you heard of the Red Seal of Valhalla?\"\n\n\n\n\"These sound like skips nicknames if I'm being dead honest.\"\n\n\n\n\"Moot point. Telling you now sam, chug one of those and you'll be feeling like a legend in not time.\"\n\n\n\nTheir rather spirited conversation is interrupted by the elevator door opening across the bar.\u00a0\u00a0Gabriel looks over, gets a good look at who's coming out of it, and perks up, straightening as he leans to the side to get a better look. He finally recognizes someone of importance, someone of note. His eyes move past Roscharch, focusing on her. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s walking in the club, the elevator closing behind her. Tanned immaculate skin, long dark wavy hair, a white diamond choker and earrings, and a black dress. Her posse of girlfriends, all dressed as fashionably resplendent as her, chatter and laugh amongst each other, tapping on their phones, passing glances over the company to gauge how full this club was, adjusting their hair. They too are checking for people of interest, but in the way that\u2019s common for club goers. \n\n\n\nThey say hellos to club goers that approach them, exchanging small talk and laughs before most of them head towards an empty half circle couch, sitting down and resuming\u00a0\u00a0the conversation. One of them breaks away to head to the bar. Gabriel elbows Sam.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who?\u201d \u2028\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNoor Salim. She\u2019s the daughter of one of the CEOs connected to Cortex.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nSam attempts to turn to look at her, and receives a hard elbow in the side. \u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make it too obvious! \u2026Was she looking over here?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cYes? Why.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cJust play along, okay?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nThey resume their conversation, Gabriel a bit more animated perhaps than before, smiling and gesturing as they jump from topic and topic. Talking between them has always been easy, the ebb and flow always continuing it on. More drinks are ordered, and drunk. Sam nearly forgets the girl as they get into yet another discussion about what defines \u201cfreedom\u201d and what defines \u201cwaste of time\u201d until one of the girls from Noor\u2019s table gets up and approaches the bar. As she orders the drinks, she turns to Gabriel.\n\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice you from across the club. What brings you here?\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nGabriel turns to her, raising his hand and waving it vaguely. \"Taking a week or three off of work. Company can shove it for all i care, GOD does it feel nice to be out.\"\n\n\n\nShe nods. \"Uggh tell me about it. Some of the guys at my work, SO hungup on themselves couldn't tell their heads from their asses with half the repackaged shit they spit out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yup, definitely know the type. It's a ruthless field..\"\n\n\n\nThe bartender comes over. She leans forward, giving him a smile.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah seven cosmo's pleaaase.Thanks!'\n\n\n\nDid you know that the cosmopoli-\"\n\n\n\n\u201cCosmopolitan was popularized by Madonna? Yeah I know.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re funny. Didn\u2019t think anyone would be able to beat me to the punch on that.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cBetter than a martini. Helps to know your drinks.\u201d\u2028\u2028The girl lets out a snicker. She gives him an incline of the head, as the bartender makes the drinks.\u2028She's interested now, Gabriel knows. First impressions like these are crucial, and he's played it safe and savvy. Can't give too much to make her think he's over-enthusiastic, or not enough to make her think he's one of //those// dry white collars. \n\n\n\n\"You know i was //just// saying this to my friend over here.\u2028If you're looking for dedication to the job, he's all that and more.\" That gets a laugh out of her. At Sams expense sure, but Sam will understand. Sam rolls his eyes, taking another swig of his drink and saying nothing.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"But lets talk less work and more party. I\u2019ve got to say the clubbing scene isn\u2019t anything compared to Berlin.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cLol you're soo right. You seem to know your party spots. What club in Berlin?\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cUhh.. well there was a couple. But the one that stuck out to me the most was..ah what was it the Vundabar? Berghain? yes.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\nHer jaw drops. Her eyebrows raised, before with a light laugh she leans closer to him.\u2028\u201cOh my god, the Berghain?? //The// Berghain?\"\n\n\n\n\"Unless I developed a stammer or heard myself wrong, yes, I one hundred percent mean the Berghain. Never had a problem getting in.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wow. Now that's a story.\" \n\n\n\nThe bartender passes the drinks to the girl, she smiles, bids Gabriel adieu, and heads back to the table, handing them out and talking to them. A few of the girls look over at Gabriel, and then go back to discussion. Gabriel doesn't need to turn to know. He smiles, swirling his drink and then downing it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Hook line and sinker, Sam. Hook line and sinker. Just wait.\" \n\n\n\nHe doesn't have to wait long. Samuel isn\u2019t so much focusing on the conversation anymore as tapping on his phone because soon enough, Gabriel is approached by three girls, keeping close to each other as they start asking him questions. Noor watches from the table, sprawling back against the seats and idly chewing on a toothpick. Eventually they ask him to come over and continue the conversation. Gabriel is happy to oblige. \n\n\n\nSam's not invited to the table with them. That suits him just fine, probably wouldn\u2019t have gone anyway, and he chooses to tactfully ignore that theres still a bit of him hurt by the fact this wasn\u2019t something he was offered beforehand. He starts searching for medieval executions. \n\n\n\nFirst meeting someone who's prestigious and making them like you, when they're used to having people like them and it always being a one way street, is sort of like having a job interview, and there is absolutely no difference except the scene they use to do it. They ask for your experience. A rough CV. Through questions they prod you about your character traits. And then in some mystical unspoken way come to a decision on whether you're it or not. \n\n\n\nIt is often that a person is underqualified. It's hard not to feel intimidated. There is the occasion where you're overqualified; know too much and the opponent can feel hostile, threatened, it's human nature. Gabriel however is able to balance the middle line, letting the girls talk, measuring the tempos and tones, playing the perfect foil and comrade.\n\n\n\nHe's able to answer their questions, say things in a way familiar to their style of language. He's cordial. He's devilish. While Noor is generally more stoic, ignoring and addressing her girl friends to test him,\u00a0\u00a0soon enough they're talking to each other too, about the ways they subtly poke at others for fun, about stories of parties and late night hijinks. \n\n\n\nSam searches up recipes in his phone and watches how to make a seafood bisque. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s kind of forgotten about the mission. The alchohol makes his head feel dizzy. And then hes nudged as Gabriel passes, arm in arm with that girl and her friends as they look at each other.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey man we\u2019re ditching this place. See me and Noor were talking and the main club scene is kinda overrated. The real money is in house parties. You coming?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028Sam considers if they want him to say no. He should say no. He could. But a small part of his heart recalls so clear what Gabriel said earlier. They should stick together, right? Sam makes a face, letting out a sigh as he goes to grab his coat. \n\n\n\n\u201cI can bring the car round, sure.\u201d \n\n\n\nOne of the girls looks over him. His demeanour leaves somewhat lacking in clubbing buddies. She voices her thoughts. \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he should..\u201d \n\n\n\nSam squints at her. He isn't helping his case. Gabriel looks between them and clears his throat. \n\n\u2028\u201cLadies! Ladies, please, someone has to drive me back. Appreciate the sentiment but my hotel is pretty far from here.\u201d \u2028\u2028\u201cOr weee could have someone take you back from my place gaaabe.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd go to all that bother? Let me be a gentleman and spare you the fuss.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGabe if that story about you in Maldives you told is true I think you\u2019re HARDLY the one to speak on gentlemanship.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey burst into laughter, continuing to talk in this matter as they take the elevator down. They're already on private knowledge. Sam furrows his brow, to stop himself from rolling his eyes at their nonsensical blather. He has a feeling its going to be a long night. \u2028\n\n\u2014 \n\n\n\nOut of the city, past the streets. The streets give way to backroads, then open roads, and finally, gates. Gates that lead into the places where the real rich come to play. Lots of land, massive and sprawling and lavish, houses that sit on an island all of their own. The club music is following here too, on the radio. \u2028Past long big driveways lined with desert and palm trees, they finally pull up on a geometric modern mansion, lights flashing from the windows, people partying on balconies, cars parked wherever. This. THIS is where the real party is. \n\n\n\nIf Sam had to describe it, it had all the rowdiness of a high school get together that he was never invited to, wrapped up in the lavish bows and finery that gem and oil money can buy you. Catching up with the group, he walks in and- \n\n\n\nHo. Lee. Fuck. \n\n\n\nThe music is amplified, seeming to jostle his bones. The open floor layout isn\u2019t as crowded as the club from before, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t rife with action. A bar higher, if some of the way partygoers are dressed is anything to base off of. The entire place is tinged purple and red, people yelling and laughing over the din as waiters walk through the crowd passing small drinks and treats over adult movie stars lounging in the laps of suited men.\u00a0\u00a0The air seems colored too, a slight fog filling the air and giving it a dreamlike feel from the hookahs some of the party is using while sitting on divans, talking business. \n\n\n\nThe kitchen island serves as a bar and a la carte table, with plates decked with proper food, and other delicacies being available. Hell, Sam thinks he sees small vials of meth on the table, for anyone who's feeling particularly ballsy. Gabriel lets out a low whistle and then laughs. Sam can\u2019t hear what he says over the din. He asks him to repeat it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWHAT WAS THAT?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cSAM! WE\u2019RE GOING TO GET DRINKS OK? SAVE US A TABLE YA?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cHUH?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nGabriel rolls his eyes, looking to the gaggle of girls and then gestures vaguely to Sam.\n\n\u2028\u201cTABLE. SAVE ONE.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cI-\u201c\u2028\u2028Before he can argue or voice any of the thoughts at the tip of his tongue, Gabriel\u00a0\u00a0yelps as Noor tugs him further into the dance floor. Seems she wants something to do with him. Sam stands there for a moment, collecting himself. The smoky perfumed air isn\u2019t properly circulating through his lungs, he thinks. It's drowning him. He swims back through the gaggle of people to the sides. \n\n\n\nWith a gasp, he reaches the side of the room. The place seems to have widened, became liminal almost. It's hard to tell how far it is to the other side with the distance warped by fog. He grits his teeth as the house music hits a blaring note, his head still pounding. Note to self, ask for modificatory earphones or noise cancelling devices for future endeavours. He steadies himself with a hand to the wall, groans, and then looks around for an empty table. \n\n\n\nMost of them are taken up, groups of all variety sitting lying or using the table in some way. But god seems to have thrown him a bone, as conveniently. there\u2019s a free one only a ways away. And it only has a few empty and half full glasses as its occupants. As sam makes his way over, he concludes whoever they are, they sure shouldn't mind. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe moves the glasses to one side, and then sits down gingerly, placing his elbows on the table and his chin on his palms as his eyes roam the room, trying to pick Gabirel out in the crowd. The lighting makes it hard to pick out finer details, people flashing in and out from silhouette to colour in flashes. He feels queasy. He takes out his phone and starts searching medieval executions again.\n\n\n\nHis scrolling is interrupted by a man sitting down at the same table. He\u2019s rather portly, his forehead beaded from sweat. Sam has the suspicion it\u2019s from the outfit hes wearing, then from any physical exertion on the dance floor. The slightly unbuttoned shirt and tight dress pants do little to mitigate lend a pretty solid suspicion. \n\n\n\nThe man is breathing hard, his mouth open, as he fumbles for one of the glasses and finishes whatever was in it with a thirsty chug.\u00a0\u00a0He looks at Sam, and then at the dance floor. Tilts his head to Sam slightly, and speaking in a raised accented voice, addresses him.\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cQuite the party tonight ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028Sam blinks, raising his head from his phone. Not sure what to say, he nods. \u2028\n\n\n\n\"Yeah it is.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cI tell you- can\u2019t beat parties like this! Similar in case to uh- Dionysus and his extravagant parties of old in the woods- sex and drinks and pure human energy!\n\n\n\nSilence. Sam only nods again.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"Know much about greek mythology my good man?\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cYeah, somewhat.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cYou look the type. What was the word for it.. Well read. Well read, yes that\u2019s how you look.\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\nSam looks down to his phone again. Starts typing out queries on how to avoid awkward conversation. Where is Gabriel. He said he would be back with drinks a while ago. He hates this conversation. He hates this port, awkward man. He hates the air. He hates everyones smiling plastic faces. A waiter comes over, sliding a drink over wordlessly and leaves. The man doesn\u2019t seem to take the hint, taking a swig from the new drink, making a loud satisfied noise and fixing him with a smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou come here with anyone?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u201cUh.. yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cWho?\u201d\u2028\u2028Sams head is pounding. This guys voice is annoying. He scans the dance floor, and spots Gabriel, dancing amongst the group. Or at least he thinks so. He points to him mutely.\u2028\u2028The man follows his pointed finger, looking back and forth between his wavering pointed hand and the direction hes pointing. Narrows his eyes as he seems to waver upon realizing who Sam seems to be pointing at. Clears his throat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cWell.. I suppose the place brings all types eh?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nSam fixes him with a stare. What the hell is this man talking about. Does he think Gabriels outfit is weird?\u2028\u2028The man swallows, and then makes a quick exit, mumbling something about seeing a colleague somewhere elsewhere. Sam doesn\u2019t wave back. \n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nOut on the dance floor, it\u2019s all color, noise, and sound. Gabriel laughs along as people dance their hearts out and move to the sound of the room, the rhythm an organ that beats within them. Noor is grinning and purposefully teasing at him by pressing against him as she dances, and giving him a knowing look.\n\n\n\nOh, he sees how this is. Never one to turn down a good challenge, he teases her in kind, matching the tempo and showing off a fair bit just to be dramatic.\n\n\n\nNoor squeals, clapping her hands as she gets more frisky with it, shamoosing her body over to his as he does likewise and letting out a laugh as soon enough they match rhythms. An exchange without words, all body, all movement, until he's got his fingers intertwined with hers and their bodies are pressed against each other. She\u2019s pressed up against his chest as she gives him bedroom eyes. Gabriel smiles. \u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cHellooo darling.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028With a gasp she squeezes his hand in hers, giggling as she presses against him, her free hand walking up his chest as she purrs.\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cHeeyyy. Come here often?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cNo but a little devil from hell itself charmed me down here, would you believe that?\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nShe snickers, her hand squeezing his arm as she turns her head to press against his chest. \u2028\u2028\u201cOhh you\u2019re too cute. Say.. wanna head somewhere more.. private? Mm?\u201d\u2028\n\n\n\n\u2028\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028She tugs his shirt, biting her lip devilishly as she turns around and starts making her way through the crowd. Up a set of stairs, through corridors, and then to one that\u2019s more empty, private. \u2028\u2028\u201cTurn around.\u201d\u2028\u2028Gabriel complies, turning around and facing the wall as he listens to her punch in a code to the door. It beeps and there\u2019s the sound of a lock opening. \u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n\u201cOk come on.\u201d\u2028\u2028She grabs him by the wrist, closing the door behind him a bit breathlessly. A hallway greets him with its stark white walls, wooden paneled floor, and black doors. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the party below, and a glimpse of what the house probably looks like in the daylight, when it's not full of rowdy rich partygoers. The music is quieter here, muffled by the soundproof walls. Gabriel only gets a glimpse before they\u2019re walking into a bedroom, the lights turning on automatically as they enter. A large bed sits in the middle of the room, paneled wardrobe on the left, master bathroom on the right. She walks ahead of him, giving a little sigh as she moves to hop onto the cushy bed, spreading herself on it and beckoning to him. \n\n\n\nGabriel takes a deep breath, eyes flicking over her body before he shakes his head with a smile, raising his hands. He unbuttons a few of the buttons of his shirt before moving to get on the bed with her, pressing her down as with a happy little sigh, she wraps her arms around his neck and starts pressing kisses into his skin.\n\n\n\nHe lets her, hands undoing each and every strap on the back of her dress as she presses against him. Their lips press against each other, her mouth locking against his as he closes his eyes, engaged in a passionate kiss as her hands card through his hair. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s so focused, she doesn\u2019t feel the prick of a small sharp needle into the back of her neck as his fingers press against her skin.\n\n\n\nHer eyes flutter. Gabriel presses her down. It\u2019ll be okay, he wants to say. But it\u2019s best to let the mind fill in the blanks naturally for when she wakes up. Things like this can just cause trouble.\n\n\n\nAmnestics can be a hell of a punch. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s out in a minute, breaths rising and falling softly as Gabriel pulls away from her, buttoning his shirt back up and grabbing his belt.\u00a0\u00a0As much as he\u2019d like to continue, it\u2019s best to leave it for the after mission celebration. Now, to see about what this place was.\n\n\n\nOpening the door, he takes out his phone. \n\n\n\n\u201cSam.\u201d\u2028\u2028No response. \u2028\u2028\u201cSaaam. You there? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re too busy talking it up to a group of hot babes and have left me out in the cold.\u201d\u2028A moment of silence, broken by a typing chat bubble popping up and then- \u2028\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\nThere he is. \n\n\n\n\"How's it going down there?\"\n\n\n\n\"Bad.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, anyways, any hope of getting into the smart home system?\"\n\n\n\nSams little indicator displays as seen for all of two minutes while Gabriel paces. He's halfway to asking Sam if he's passed out at the table when he starts typing again. \n\n\n\n\"I'm in.\" \n\n\n\n\"That was fast. Go ahead and navigate to the top floor. You see me?\"\n\n\n\nAnother few moments. Then a response. \n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Great. Keep your sights around the area.\"\n\n\n\n\"You sure you don't want me to try and look for auspicious areas?\"\n\n\n\nGabriel ignores him. He's got it, pretty sure. Besides, there's fun in exploring. \n\n\n\nHe tries the door opposite the bedroom. Another bedroom. From somewhere in the room, he knows Sam is watching him. This one has a darker palette than the more neutral hues of the other bedroom, and smells of cologne. There's a computer set up in the corner, prompting his attention. He takes out a USBdrive from his pocket, twirling it before pushing it into the input slot. \n\n\n\nThe thing flickers, lines of code breaking down the defenses of the machine as Gabriel runs a cursory eye over the documents on the table. A proposition to set back funds for a certain subdivision of the marketing departmnet. A request to move the finish date of a building over by a year. Nothing of note, to him.\n\n\n\nThe computer shows a blue screen, indicating it's done scraping data. He tugs it out,\u00a0\u00a0inspecting the USB drive before turning to the rest of the room and giving it a look over.\n\n\n\nHe decides he'll come back later. Best to cover all the points to some extent before delving into one specific scrub down. \n\n\n\nHe makes for another door. Walking into the room, he cam immediately tell this is where the money is at. \n\n\n\nIt's an office. The lights are off, but moonlight shines in from the large bay windows to the left of the office, fluttering slightly in the draft. The moon illuminates the handsome wood paneling of the walls, The black leather couches seated around a coffee table, and the desk at the far end of the room, a red chair and a large painting behind it. \n\n\n\nJackpot.\n\n\n\nThese places are veritable treasure troves. He heads over to the table, starts opening each and every drawer as he taps the computer awake. He repeats the process of taking out another thumbdrive and pressing it in as he searches in a more traditional way.\n\n\n\nStationary. A gun. Paperwork. A watch. \n\n\n\nIt's not really necessary to search in this way, he knows, but he enjoys the process. A way of getting hands on into the heads of others. The small eccentricities. \n\n\n\nSuddenly all the lights cut off. His phone buzzes. \n\n\n\n\"Someone's coming. Hide.\"\n\n\n\nGabriels head whips up to the screen. 87%. Still needs a bit more time.\n\n\n\nHe scans the room. A wardrobe. Curtains. Nowhere to really hide.\n\n\n\nThere's the sound of heels clacking on wooden flooring. It gets closer to the door. 90%. Holy shit will it load faster?\n\n\n\nGabriel curses under his breath, smacking the table to try and make it go faster. It doesn't. There's not enough time, he yanks it out and turns the computer off, ducking under the desk.\n\n\n\nAnd just in time too, as the door clicks and light hits the office chair as Gabriel huddles underneath, trying to keep his frame small as the figure, whoever they are, stands for a long moment in the hall door. \n\n\n\nIt walks in, heels tapping as with slow deliberate steps, it stalks over to the far side of the room. There's the sound of rifling through papers, and a small exhale. The papers are put down, and Gabriel strains his ears to keep a rough estimate of where the figure is. \n\n\n\nIt turns. Takes a few steps in an indeterminable direction before striding over to stand in front of the desk. He looks down to note her dark two inch platformed boots. \n\n\n\nIt stays there for what feels like a dragged out couple of moments, Gabriel watching the shoes before it turns, heading out of view, and stops somewhere at the wall to the right. \n\n\n\nHe hears a clatter as something is removed, and then a sigh as with the clack of a bracelet, they start punching in a code. A whirr, as what he can presume is a safe opens, and something is removed.\n\n\n\nHe wishes he could see what it was. It's hard to tell. Either way, the figure only lingers a few moments there, before closing the safe, replacing the cover of the hidden panel, and leaving the room.\n\n\n\nGabriel counts to 160 in his head. And then gets up, dusting himself off. He looks to where\u00a0\u00a0the figure lingered, and sees a painting, Arabic Men with scabbards and white horses galloping into battle.\u00a0\u00a0It speaks of ancient gold, of long faded gunpowder, in its gold leafed wooden frame.\n\n\n\nGabriel makes his way over, hands pressing against the frame as he tugs at it. No dice. He takes a closer look at it. \n\n\n\nIt's carved, beautifully really. Hawks fly over the top of the frame, and here soldiers on horseback also ride and clash across the walls and bottom of the frame, the men determined and gripping hard on the reins,\u00a0\u00a0the horses bucking with wild eyes as they too seem ready to jump into the painting itself to with the way the carver has articulated the grooves. \n\n\n\nHe's pretty sure he knows exactly what this is. Doesn't like the idea of it though. He picks up his phone, texting Sam.\n\n\n\n\"Sam, do you see me right now?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean no?\"\n\n\n\n\"Closed camera system specifically in that room. I can see a lot, but that ones on a different level. That or it doesn't have one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat. Just great. The last thing he needs actually. He's not good with finicky things like this, he mutters, as he presses the frame at random. Some of the parts seem to shift but not many. He decides he'll come back to it another time. \n\n\n\nFor now, he needs to move on to the other rooms.\n\n\n\nAs he searches, his phone beeps, mostly texts he only reads for directions. Nothing he directly replies to. Sam can understand, time is of the essence after all. The rest of the rooms turn up a few bits of fancy, but nothing of real note. Thumbdrives are plugged in to scrape data, drawers are opened and closed.\u00a0\u00a0Finishing up with a decided slam of a bedroom, he sighs, stretches, and then walks back into the hallway and makes for the door. He pulls out his phone to ask Sam for the code and is greeted by\u00a0\u00a0a text from Sam, overlapping the others.\n\n\n\n\"Guard. Heading your way.\"\n\n\n\nThink fast. No use in ducking in, it'd be more suspicious. So as the guard approaches, Gabriel leans against the wall, adopting an air of agitation as he makes eye contact with the guard through the panel in the door, who gives him a quizical look and punches in the code. \n\n\n\nAs soon as the door opens, Gabriel walks up to him, talking to him a mile a minute. \n\n\n\n\"THERE you are man! Christ took you guys long enough! Look. I've been locked in here for a while, had a thing with Noor back there- she's nice you know but I *have to get going* ok? I mean christ i was looking for an alert or something everywhere do you guys even check the cameras?\"\n\n\n\nThe man looks at him, bemused. His sturdy frame, dressed in a black suit falters. Gabriel swallows. \n\n\n\n\"God- anyways i'm going back down to the party. She knows where to find me I gave her my contacts so no worries there. You can check. Au revoir!\"\n\n\n\nHe's out before the guard can even think to follow him, and by the time he does, Gabriels disappeared into the mosh of people in the main area of the mansion, eyes darting around the floor as he descends the stairs. \n\n\n\nThere Sam is, sitting at a table as he scrolls his phone. Kind of the outlier, but at least his standoffish nature makes him easy to spot by how candidly he avoids crowds. \n\n\n\nHe skips the last few steps, pushing through people to pounce on Sam, who startles, jolting in his seat and cursing aloud as he nearly drops his phone. Gabriel grins.\n\n\n\n\"It's go time.\" \n\n\n\nSam adjusts himself, trying to say something, to which Gabriel merely shakes his head at. Not here. Grabbing Sam by the wrist, he pulls him through the people, the smoky air, and out into the night air. The stars shine dimly in the pitch black over the waves of haphazardly parked cars. \n\n\n\n\"Are you going to tell me what happened in there, or am I going to have to wait for tomorrow to figure out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tomorrow. I got you some chips though, trust me, you're going to want to look at those.\u00a0\u00a0Look at me being productive!\"\n", "references": [], "tags": ["corporate", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "spy-fiction", "tale"], "title": "bloodsandandguns - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bloodsandandguns", "year": 2025}, "calling-on-the-blackbird": {"created_at": "2025-01-26T07:57:00", "creator": "GreenWolf", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "GreenWolf", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/greenwolf", "comment": "Added tags: agent-merlo, crime-fiction, lgbtq, mystery, robin-thorne, tale, third-law, twisted-pines, unusual-incidents-unit.

Since the last time Vincent Anderson decided to visit, her apartment building has become one of the hardest targets in suburban Portland. Every room in the house has at least one panic button that can summon a full combat MTF within minutes, and the closet of the master bedroom has been fortified into a saferoom strong enough to hold off a squadron of battlemages long enough for that to matter.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is still an apartment building in suburban Portland, which carries with it certain intrinsic vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with the American government and its agents.</p>\n<p>She knew this better than anyone; knew that the UIU was far more capable than they chose to appear. She had been a UIU agent once, and had spent a considerable part of her Foundation career working with the Unit. It had long been her habit to act as if they knew where she lived.</p>\n<p>So Merlo wasn't exactly surprised when she came home to find the federal agent sitting in her living room, chatting amicably with her husband, Gabe.</p>\n<p>It even made sense. If ever there was a situation that would prompt a home visit by the FBI, the imminent shift in consensus normalcy brought about by her nemesis \u2014 and by her failure to stop him \u2014 was certainly one.</p>\n<p>So although she wasn't prepared, Merlo wasn't surprised that the UIU agent was there.</p>\n<p>But she was surprised that it was Robin Thorne.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, Merlo would have counted Thorne as her closest ally within the UIU. That was before she had betrayed their trust, of course \u2014 left them in the dark so she could stage an illegal raid in Three Portlands in another failed attempt to capture Anderson. The two had barely spoken since, although Merlo had hoped that their cooperation on the final, finally successful raid on Anderson's headquarters might lead to some rapprochement. Thorne being in her house now made that prospect seem less likely.</p>\n<p>\"Perfect timing, honey,\" Gabe said cheerfully, although Merlo could tell that his smile was somewhat forced. \"I was just telling Agent Thorne that you should be home any minute now.\"</p>\n<p>Merlo pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. \"Thorne, if you're here to give me another lecture about my Ahabian tendencies, you can save your breath. I realize that none of this would have happened if I'd just let the Unit arrest him for the Caldwell incident.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne looked at her blankly. \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\"</p>\n<p>Merlo blinked. \"You haven't heard?\"</p>\n<p>They shrugged. \"I've been taking some personal leave. I haven't heard anything about anything since this weekend.\"</p>\n<p>She frowned. \"You aren't here about Anderson?\"</p>\n<p>They shook their head. \"No. Why, did he escape?\"</p>\n<p>\"I should be so lucky,\" she muttered. \"No, <a href=\"/the-blackbird-and-the-falcon\">he only just orchestrated the biggest shift in consensus normalcy since the atom bomb from inside his damn cell</a>. Figured you were here to chew me out about it. Seems like that's all anyone wants to do the last few days.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope. I'll leave that to Spencer. Sounds like something he'll want to break out the special profanity for.\"</p>\n<p>\"Special profanity?\" Gabe asked.</p>\n<p>\"He collects them,\" Thorne explained. \"By his reckoning, he knows more insults, blasphemies, vulgarities, and curse words than anyone else alive. A lot of them can't even be used on this side of the Veil.\"</p>\n<p>\"Great, that'll be something to look forward to then.\" Merlo dropped into a seat across from Thorne. \"Why are you here, Thorne?\"</p>\n<p>The other agent bit their lip. \"I need your help, Sasha.\"</p>\n<p>Merlo took a long, hard look at Thorne. There was something deeply off about the wizard's demeanor. Their eyes kept flitting about the room, even as their gaze lingered just a little too long on the exits. And there was a telltale tension in the air, a weight pressing down on reality that Merlo had learned to recognize from working with Navarro \u2014 Thorne was holding an evocation in their mind, ready to cast in an instant, even as they fidgeted on the couch and tried to appear nonchalant.</p>\n<p>Thorne was expecting a fight.</p>\n<p>She glanced at Gabe, making eye contact for just a moment, and was gratified to see him tip his chin ever-so-slightly in silent acknowledgment. He had picked up on it too.</p>\n<p>\"What seems to be the trouble?\" Merlo asked.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe we could take a walk and discuss it?\" Thorne suggested. As they spoke, they moved their hand to brush a strand of hair out of their face, but finished the motion by tapping their ear twice \u2014 an obvious coded gesture.</p>\n<p>Merlo watched Gabe's face as he motioned with his eyes towards the blue table lamp, which concealed the nearest panic button.</p>\n<p>\"Sure, there's a dog park at the end of the block we can walk to.\" She blinked twice, answering Gabe's silent question in the negative. \"Gabe, honey, why don't you get started on dinner. I don't think we'll be long.\"</p>\n<p>As soon as they were outside, Thorne began muttering under their breath, a long string of mixed Latin, Celtic, Greek, and Old English words. Merlo could only pick out every third word or so, but just from that it was fairly obvious that Thorne was casting obfuscation wards around them to prevent eavesdropping.</p>\n<p>Once they were done, Thorne reached into their jacket and pulled out the semi-spectral form of an albino robin, which they gingerly held in front of their face with both hands. \"Circle aloft and stay out of sight. If you spot anything that seems off, break for the second nearest Way immediately and wait for me back at the federal building.\"</p>\n<p>The familiar twittered a question in Celtic.</p>\n<p>\"Then tell Spencer everything.\"</p>\n<p>The not-bird tilted its head to examine Merlo, then chirped another query.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, even that.\" Without waiting for a response, Thorne tossed the creature into the air, where it hovered for a moment before remembering that it was supposed to pretend to use its wings to fly.</p>\n<p>Merlo watched bemusedly as the familiar drifted up and out of sight. \"Paranoid enough?\"</p>\n<p>\"Never,\" Thorne said. \"The Foundation killed my mother.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's impossible.\" The words slipped out immediately, before Merlo could even think about it. \"I was at the funeral, Thorne. She was killed by a Lighthouse Mafia gunman. Everyone knows that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just like everyone knows wizards aren't real?\" Thorne retorted. \"The gunman was an escaped convict operating under the compulsion of a homicide geas that killed him via auto-memetic Cuchulainn syndrome. Before he died he was able to tell my mom that he had been recruited and released from prison \u2014 he thought by a three letter agency, but it's pretty obvious who it actually was.\"</p>\n<p>\"How on earth could you possibly know that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because before she died, she was able to record her last moments in this.\" Thorne held up a sunstone necklace that was hanging from their neck.</p>\n<p>\"And where's that been for the last 16 years?\"</p>\n<p>\"Forgotten in evidence lockup. I had to break in to get it out.\"</p>\n<p>Merlo studied the wizard with a new wariness, considering for the first time that they might actually be crazy. She was starting to regret telling Gabe not to call for an MTF. Her own personal panic button was in the front pocket of her jeans, but it might as well be on the far side of the Moon for all the good it would do her if Thorne decided to start throwing evocations around \u2014 the federal wizard might not have their mother's talent as a battlemage, but even the younger Thorne could easily turn her skull inside-out with a few words and some willpower.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, let's assume that all of that is true. That doesn't mean the Foundation is responsible. There's plenty of groups that could have pulled that off \u2014 the GOC, the Pentagram, probably a couple different CI cells.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh please, Sasha, pull your head out of the sand for a second and try to think like a cop again. Means, opportunity, motive \u2014 they're all lacking the third one.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Chaos Insurgency\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you mean the one that's just a Foundation false flag?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not!\" Merlo whirled on the wizard, disregarding personal safety to get directly in their face. \"The Foundation does not engage in assassination, and certainly not against its allies. It just doesn't.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne stared at her, steely-eyed and unwavering. \"<a href=\"/portland-vice\">Tell that to Ross and Creed</a>. Or did you mean that the Foundation only tries to assassinate its own agents?\"</p>\n<p>Merlo recoiled as if she had just been slapped. \"That's not the same,\" she hissed. \"That was the work of a rogue Ethics Committee member.\"</p>\n<p>\"And how many rogue elements are there in the Foundation?\" Thorne asked. \"How many secrets and lies and conspiracies that you don't even know of? The Foundation is not a monolith, and you are far too smart to believe the party line bullshit you're spewing at me, Sasha Merlo.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne reached into their jacket again and pulled out their badge. The Eye of Providence seemed to wink at Merlo in the evening twilight. \"You used to carry this badge, just like me, just like my mother. Do you remember? Do you remember taking an oath to serve the interests of truth and justice? To defend the innocent? Do you remember why any of us do this in the first place? Or has the Foundation taken your honor too? Filled your head with so much nonsense about necessary evils and hard choices that you don't even know what's right anymore?\"</p>\n<p>\"I remember!\" Merlo shouted. She took a breath. \"I remember,\" she said again. \"But think about what you're saying, Thorne. Do you have any idea what the consequences will be if you're right? If the Foundation really is behind your mother's death, then there is almost nothing they won't do to keep that secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know, and I don't care,\" Thorne said. \"All I care about is this: what are you willing to do to help me prove it?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When the history of the 8th Occult War is written, there are many moments that will eventually be cited as proximate causes. This isn't one of them. But it should be. Unbeknownst to anyone \u2014 certainly not to the two agents standing in an empty dog park in Portland, Oregon \u2014 a fateful decision is about to be made that will all-but-guarantee a collision course between the largest single normalcy organization and the dominant global superpower.</p>\n<p>Sasha Merlo decides to do the right thing and help the child of an old friend.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>She sighed. \"I can check our files for any corroborating evidence.\"</p>\n<p>She reached into her jacket and pulled out her secure phone, a chunky, featureless phablet with a full physical keyboard. She took a moment to pop the battery out and flip it around \u2014 a necessary precaution, as in its default configuration the phone wouldn't actually work except as a hand grenade, triggered by pressing the power button three times in rapid succession. She knew a couple agents who had lost fingers that way, and she didn't intend to join their ranks.</p>\n<p>\"I'm gonna start with your mom's old personnel file,\" Merlo explained, fingers flying through her secure login prompt. \"It'll be an unreadable mess of codeword classifications, but we might be able to infer something even from the codewords I don't have clearance for.\"</p>\n<p>She waited the few agonizing seconds for SCiPnet to respond to her query. \"Here, see\u2026\" She turned the phone to show it to Thorne. \"Grand Slam is gonna be the SATF Program, and Triton Point is for Site-246. No idea what Wise Guys is, but it looks like a sub-clearance of Grand Slam \u2014 maybe for the original Delta-3? Same with Love Doctor, that one only shows up in connection with Grand Slam or Wise Guys. Lightfoot Ballad is a complete mystery, but it only shows up twice in the 90s.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne nodded. \"That's when she left the Foundation, it's probably related to that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Makes sense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are there any file sections from 2008? What are those classified under?\"</p>\n<p>Merlo tapped at the keyboard to scroll through the rest of the file. \"Looks like\u2026 Blind Pythagoras, that's for the UIU, and Angry Bovine is MOOT. Here's one I haven't heard of\u2026 Lightfoot Elegy. It's the last clearance assigned to the file.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would that be related to Lightfoot Ballad?\" Thorne asked.</p>\n<p>\"Probably.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's gotta be it then. Can you see what other files have that codeword on them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, we've got\u2026\" Merlo paused, heart sinking as the results loaded in. \"Ah, fuck.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>She didn't say anything, just handed the phone to Thorne.</p>\n<p>\"A file on the Oregon State Penitentiary and something redacted?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a person of interest file,\" Merlo explained. \"Completely expunged, so there's just the RAISA metadata left. I've never seen that before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sounds like someone trying to cover something up,\" Thorne said softly.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it sure does.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne handed the phone back to Merlo. \"Can you get anything out of them?\"</p>\n<p>Merlo shook her head. \"No. It's above my clearance level. I'd need to get authorization from Holman\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thorne, be reasonable. We've both worked with him for years, you can't seriously believe that he would\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"That he would what? That he would authorize <a href=\"/austringers\">an illegal operation in Three Portlands</a>?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's different, and you know it.\"</p>\n<p>\"All I know is that my mom didn't trust him. Until we have proof that he wasn't involved, I'm going to follow her lead on this.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine. But without Director-level clearance, you aren't getting those files.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne rubbed their thumb against the sunstone necklace, their expression betraying the fact that they were clearly contemplating something distasteful.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Who's the current Director of Site-246?\" They asked.</p>\n<p>\"The Draintrap? Cody Westbrook. Why?\"</p>\n<p>Thorne shook their head. \"You're better off not knowing. Will anyone know you've been looking for these files?\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe. The RAISA request will be logged, and it might trip a flag if anyone is worried about someone digging. But I can pull some more of our files on the Unit to cover my tracks. If anyone asks, I'll just say that I was doing research for an assessment on whether we should try to recruit you and Spencer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not happening.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, yeah, that's obvious now, but it wasn't the last time Holman asked me about it.\" Merlo turned off the phone and reversed the battery again. \"Don't worry too much about me, I know how to answer questions from internal affairs. Seems like that's half my job these days.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne nodded. \"Thank you, Sasha. For everything. For believing me.\"</p>\n<p>\"You'll forgive me if I'm not as pleased about it as you are.\" Merlo blew out a long breath. \"I really didn't want you to be right.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know. I wish I wasn't.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's next?\" Merlo watched dispassionately as a young yuppie couple approached, walking one of those trendy labradoodle hybrids with a rididuculous name \u2014 probably a snickerdoodle or something equally stupid.</p>\n<p>Thorne stared pensively off into the distance. \"Now I get to see if my badge has the right memetics to convince the TSA that I'm an Air Marshal. Otherwise, I'm walking to Minnesota.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>can you trust the words of a bird?</em><br/>\n<strong>\u00ab <a href=\"/memory-of-a-murder\">Memory of a Murder</a> || <a href=\"/crowne-thorne-hub\">HUB</a> || <a href=\"/where-it-all-ended\">Where It All Ended</a> \u00bb</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"/component:preview\">component:preview</a> text=When the history of the 8th Occult War is written, there are many moments that will be cited as causes.

Since the last time Vincent Anderson decided to visit, her apartment building has become one of the hardest targets in suburban Portland. Every room in the house has at least one panic button that can summon a full combat MTF within minutes, and the closet of the master bedroom has been fortified into a saferoom strong enough to hold off a squadron of battlemages long enough for that to matter. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is still an apartment building in suburban Portland, which carries with it certain intrinsic vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with the American government and its agents.\n\n\n\nShe knew this better than anyone; knew that the UIU was far more capable than they chose to appear. She had been a UIU agent once, and had spent a considerable part of her Foundation career working with the Unit. It had long been her habit to act as if they knew where she lived. \n\n\n\nSo Merlo wasn't exactly surprised when she came home to find the federal agent sitting in her living room, chatting amicably with her husband, Gabe. \n\n\n\nIt even made sense. If ever there was a situation that would prompt a home visit by the FBI, the imminent shift in consensus normalcy brought about by her nemesis -- and by her failure to stop him -- was certainly one. \n\n\n\nSo although she wasn't prepared, Merlo wasn't surprised that the UIU agent was there.\n\n\n\nBut she was surprised that it was Robin Thorne.\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, Merlo would have counted Thorne as her closest ally within the UIU. That was before she had betrayed their trust, of course -- left them in the dark so she could stage an illegal raid in Three Portlands in another failed attempt to capture Anderson. The two had barely spoken since, although Merlo had hoped that their cooperation on the final, finally successful raid on Anderson's headquarters might lead to some rapprochement. Thorne being in her house now made that prospect seem less likely.\n\n\n\n\"Perfect timing, honey,\" Gabe said cheerfully, although Merlo could tell that his smile was somewhat forced. \"I was just telling Agent Thorne that you should be home any minute now.\"\n\n\n\nMerlo pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. \"Thorne, if you're here to give me another lecture about my Ahabian tendencies, you can save your breath. I realize that none of this would have happened if I'd just let the Unit arrest him for the Caldwell incident.\"\n\n\n\nThorne looked at her blankly. \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\"\n\n\n\nMerlo blinked. \"You haven't heard?\"\n\n\n\nThey shrugged. \"I've been taking some personal leave. I haven't heard anything about anything since this weekend.\"\n\n\n\nShe frowned. \"You aren't here about Anderson?\"\n\n\n\nThey shook their head. \"No. Why, did he escape?\"\n\n\n\n\"I should be so lucky,\" she muttered. \"No, [[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon|he only just orchestrated the biggest shift in consensus normalcy since the atom bomb from inside his damn cell]]]. Figured you were here to chew me out about it. Seems like that's all anyone wants to do the last few days.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope. I'll leave that to Spencer. Sounds like something he'll want to break out the special profanity for.\"\n\n\n\n\"Special profanity?\" Gabe asked.\n\n\n\n\"He collects them,\" Thorne explained. \"By his reckoning, he knows more insults, blasphemies, vulgarities, and curse words than anyone else alive. A lot of them can't even be used on this side of the Veil.\"\n\n\n\n\"Great, that'll be something to look forward to then.\" Merlo dropped into a seat across from Thorne. \"Why are you here, Thorne?\"\n\n\n\nThe other agent bit their lip. \"I need your help, Sasha.\"\n\n\n\nMerlo took a long, hard look at Thorne. There was something deeply off about the wizard's demeanor. Their eyes kept flitting about the room, even as their gaze lingered just a little too long on the exits. And there was a telltale tension in the air, a weight pressing down on reality that Merlo had learned to recognize from working with Navarro -- Thorne was holding an evocation in their mind, ready to cast in an instant, even as they fidgeted on the couch and tried to appear nonchalant.\n\n\n\nThorne was expecting a fight.\n\n\n\nShe glanced at Gabe, making eye contact for just a moment, and was gratified to see him tip his chin ever-so-slightly in silent acknowledgment. He had picked up on it too.\n\n\n\n\"What seems to be the trouble?\" Merlo asked.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe we could take a walk and discuss it?\" Thorne suggested. As they spoke, they moved their hand to brush a strand of hair out of their face, but finished the motion by tapping their ear twice -- an obvious coded gesture.\n\n\n\nMerlo watched Gabe's face as he motioned with his eyes towards the blue table lamp, which concealed the nearest panic button. \n\n\n\n\"Sure, there's a dog park at the end of the block we can walk to.\" She blinked twice, answering Gabe's silent question in the negative. \"Gabe, honey, why don't you get started on dinner. I don't think we'll be long.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as they were outside, Thorne began muttering under their breath, a long string of mixed Latin, Celtic, Greek, and Old English words. Merlo could only pick out every third word or so, but just from that it was fairly obvious that Thorne was casting obfuscation wards around them to prevent eavesdropping.\n\n\n\nOnce they were done, Thorne reached into their jacket and pulled out the semi-spectral form of an albino robin, which they gingerly held in front of their face with both hands. \"Circle aloft and stay out of sight. If you spot anything that seems off, break for the second nearest Way immediately and wait for me back at the federal building.\"\n\n\n\nThe familiar twittered a question in Celtic.\n\n\n\n\"Then tell Spencer everything.\"\n\n\n\nThe not-bird tilted its head to examine Merlo, then chirped another query.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, even that.\" Without waiting for a response, Thorne tossed the creature into the air, where it hovered for a moment before remembering that it was supposed to pretend to use its wings to fly.\n\n\n\nMerlo watched bemusedly as the familiar drifted up and out of sight. \"Paranoid enough?\"\n\n\n\n\"Never,\" Thorne said. \"The Foundation killed my mother.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's impossible.\" The words slipped out immediately, before Merlo could even think about it. \"I was at the funeral, Thorne. She was killed by a Lighthouse Mafia gunman. Everyone knows that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Just like everyone knows wizards aren't real?\" Thorne retorted. \"The gunman was an escaped convict operating under the compulsion of a homicide geas that killed him via auto-memetic Cuchulainn syndrome. Before he died he was able to tell my mom that he had been recruited and released from prison -- he thought by a three letter agency, but it's pretty obvious who it actually was.\"\n\n\n\n\"How on earth could you possibly know that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because before she died, she was able to record her last moments in this.\" Thorne held up a sunstone necklace that was hanging from their neck.\n\n\n\n\"And where's that been for the last 16 years?\"\n\n\n\n\"Forgotten in evidence lockup. I had to break in to get it out.\"\n\n\n\nMerlo studied the wizard with a new wariness, considering for the first time that they might actually be crazy. She was starting to regret telling Gabe not to call for an MTF. Her own personal panic button was in the front pocket of her jeans, but it might as well be on the far side of the Moon for all the good it would do her if Thorne decided to start throwing evocations around -- the federal wizard might not have their mother's talent as a battlemage, but even the younger Thorne could easily turn her skull inside-out with a few words and some willpower.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, let's assume that all of that is true. That doesn't mean the Foundation is responsible. There's plenty of groups that could have pulled that off -- the GOC, the Pentagram, probably a couple different CI cells.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh please, Sasha, pull your head out of the sand for a second and try to think like a cop again. Means, opportunity, motive -- they're all lacking the third one.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Chaos Insurgency--\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you mean the one that's just a Foundation false flag?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is not!\" Merlo whirled on the wizard, disregarding personal safety to get directly in their face. \"The Foundation does not engage in assassination, and certainly not against its allies. It just doesn't.\"\n\n\n\nThorne stared at her, steely-eyed and unwavering. \"[[[portland-vice|Tell that to Ross and Creed]]]. Or did you mean that the Foundation only tries to assassinate its own agents?\"\n\n\n\nMerlo recoiled as if she had just been slapped. \"That's not the same,\" she hissed. \"That was the work of a rogue Ethics Committee member.\"\n\n\n\n\"And how many rogue elements are there in the Foundation?\" Thorne asked. \"How many secrets and lies and conspiracies that you don't even know of? The Foundation is not a monolith, and you are far too smart to believe the party line bullshit you're spewing at me, Sasha Merlo.\"\n\n\n\nThorne reached into their jacket again and pulled out their badge. The Eye of Providence seemed to wink at Merlo in the evening twilight. \"You used to carry this badge, just like me, just like my mother. Do you remember? Do you remember taking an oath to serve the interests of truth and justice? To defend the innocent? Do you remember why any of us do this in the first place? Or has the Foundation taken your honor too? Filled your head with so much nonsense about necessary evils and hard choices that you don't even know what's right anymore?\"\n\n\n\n\"I remember!\" Merlo shouted. She took a breath. \"I remember,\" she said again. \"But think about what you're saying, Thorne. Do you have any idea what the consequences will be if you're right? If the Foundation really is behind your mother's death, then there is almost nothing they won't do to keep that secret.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know, and I don't care,\" Thorne said. \"All I care about is this: what are you willing to do to help me prove it?\"\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nWhen the history of the 8th Occult War is written, there are many moments that will eventually be cited as proximate causes. This isn't one of them. But it should be. Unbeknownst to anyone -- certainly not to the two agents standing in an empty dog park in Portland, Oregon -- a fateful decision is about to be made that will all-but-guarantee a collision course between the largest single normalcy organization and the dominant global superpower.\n\n\n\nSasha Merlo decides to do the right thing and help the child of an old friend.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nShe sighed. \"I can check our files for any corroborating evidence.\"\n\n\n\nShe reached into her jacket and pulled out her secure phone, a chunky, featureless phablet with a full physical keyboard. She took a moment to pop the battery out and flip it around -- a necessary precaution, as in its default configuration the phone wouldn't actually work except as a hand grenade, triggered by pressing the power button three times in rapid succession. She knew a couple agents who had lost fingers that way, and she didn't intend to join their ranks.\n\n\n\n\"I'm gonna start with your mom's old personnel file,\" Merlo explained, fingers flying through her secure login prompt. \"It'll be an unreadable mess of codeword classifications, but we might be able to infer something even from the codewords I don't have clearance for.\"\n\n\n\nShe waited the few agonizing seconds for SCiPnet to respond to her query. \"Here, see...\" She turned the phone to show it to Thorne. \"Grand Slam is gonna be the SATF Program, and Triton Point is for Site-246. No idea what Wise Guys is, but it looks like a sub-clearance of Grand Slam -- maybe for the original Delta-3? Same with Love Doctor, that one only shows up in connection with Grand Slam or Wise Guys. Lightfoot Ballad is a complete mystery, but it only shows up twice in the 90s.\"\n\n\n\nThorne nodded. \"That's when she left the Foundation, it's probably related to that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Makes sense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are there any file sections from 2008? What are those classified under?\"\n\n\n\nMerlo tapped at the keyboard to scroll through the rest of the file. \"Looks like... Blind Pythagoras, that's for the UIU, and Angry Bovine is MOOT. Here's one I haven't heard of... Lightfoot Elegy. It's the last clearance assigned to the file.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would that be related to Lightfoot Ballad?\" Thorne asked.\n\n\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's gotta be it then. Can you see what other files have that codeword on them?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, we've got...\" Merlo paused, heart sinking as the results loaded in. \"Ah, fuck.\"\n\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\nShe didn't say anything, just handed the phone to Thorne.\n\n\n\n\"A file on the Oregon State Penitentiary and something redacted?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a person of interest file,\" Merlo explained. \"Completely expunged, so there's just the RAISA metadata left. I've never seen that before.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sounds like someone trying to cover something up,\" Thorne said softly.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, it sure does.\"\n\n\n\nThorne handed the phone back to Merlo. \"Can you get anything out of them?\"\n\n\n\nMerlo shook her head. \"No. It's above my clearance level. I'd need to get authorization from Holman--\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thorne, be reasonable. We've both worked with him for years, you can't seriously believe that he would--\"\n\n\n\n\"That he would what? That he would authorize [[[austringers|an illegal operation in Three Portlands]]]?\"\n\n\n\n\"That's different, and you know it.\"\n\n\n\n\"All I know is that my mom didn't trust him. Until we have proof that he wasn't involved, I'm going to follow her lead on this.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine. But without Director-level clearance, you aren't getting those files.\"\n\n\n\nThorne rubbed their thumb against the sunstone necklace, their expression betraying the fact that they were clearly contemplating something distasteful.\n\n\n\n\"\u2026Who's the current Director of Site-246?\" They asked.\n\n\n\n\"The Draintrap? Cody Westbrook. Why?\"\n\n\n\nThorne shook their head. \"You're better off not knowing. Will anyone know you've been looking for these files?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe. The RAISA request will be logged, and it might trip a flag if anyone is worried about someone digging. But I can pull some more of our files on the Unit to cover my tracks. If anyone asks, I'll just say that I was doing research for an assessment on whether we should try to recruit you and Spencer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not happening.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, yeah, that's obvious now, but it wasn't the last time Holman asked me about it.\" Merlo turned off the phone and reversed the battery again. \"Don't worry too much about me, I know how to answer questions from internal affairs. Seems like that's half my job these days.\"\n\n\n\nThorne nodded. \"Thank you, Sasha. For everything. For believing me.\"\n\n\n\n\"You'll forgive me if I'm not as pleased about it as you are.\" Merlo blew out a long breath. \"I really didn't want you to be right.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know. I wish I wasn't.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's next?\" Merlo watched dispassionately as a young yuppie couple approached, walking one of those trendy labradoodle hybrids with a rididuculous name -- probably a snickerdoodle or something equally stupid.\n\n\n\nThorne stared pensively off into the distance. \"Now I get to see if my badge has the right memetics to convince the TSA that I'm an Air Marshal. Otherwise, I'm walking to Minnesota.\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n//can you trust the words of a bird?//\n\n**<< [[[memory-of-a-murder| Memory of a Murder]]]\u00a0\u00a0|| [[[crowne-thorne-hub| HUB]]] || [[[where-it-all-ended| Where It All Ended]]] >>**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n", "references": ["greenwolf-s-author-page", "florence-thorne-hub", "unusual-investigations", "those-twisted-pines-hub", "the-blackbird-and-the-falcon", "memory-of-a-murder", "crowne-thorne-hub", "where-it-all-ended", "portland-vice", "austringers"], "tags": ["agent-merlo", "crime-fiction", "lgbtq", "mystery", "robin-thorne", "tale", "third-law", "twisted-pines", "unusual-incidents-unit"], "title": "Calling on the Blackbird - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/calling-on-the-blackbird", "year": 2025}, "clean-up-for-customer-082": {"created_at": "2025-01-04T21:04:00", "creator": "Mr Panik", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Mr Panik", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mr-panik", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-04T21:04:00"}, {"author": "Mr Panik", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mr-panik", "comment": "Added tags: black-comedy, slice-of-life.

High, whitewashed walls lined with pillars and neat blue shutters for the windows smiled at him as he inched the clanking van emblazoned with the words SAFE CLEANUP PROFESSIONALS down the driveway in the early morning sun.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Mr. Fernand was a gourmand who hosted parties around town that often left quite a mess \u2014 a mess that only the Foundation was willing to clean up. His mentor, Dee, had told him all the new guys had to do it at least once. Beau didn't mind. If Mr. Fernand hung out in fancy houses like this, he'd clean with a smile on his face. Here, in the wealthy suburbs of Pierre, the stillness of <em>some</em> isolation blocked out the noise from the world outside. It was truly peaceful and as Beau approached the front door, he found himself smiling.</p>\n<p>As Beau ascended the stairs to the door on the chilly morning, he noticed it stood slightly ajar. He froze, staring for a second, wondering why anyone would be so silly. It was freezing and all this cold air wasn't going to be good for a person. At least, that's what his gran had told him. Getting closer, he couldn't help but notice the red fingerprints smeared on the door. He peered at them closely, wondering what it was going to take to get that off.</p>\n<p>After a second of considering the problem in front of him, he realised he was being watched from deeper in the house. A looming shadow from the top of the stairs peered down at him and Beau took it as his cue.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" Beau said uncertainly. \"This is Beau from the cleaning agency. SCP - Cleanliness Guaranteed!\"</p>\n<p>Thundering footsteps approached the door hurriedly and Beau's stomach knotted, waiting for him to be told he had the wrong house and that he was going to get melted by an old god if he didn't leave immediately. As the door swung open, though, Mr. Fernand beamed down at him from his towering full height. His wide, lopsided mouth approximated a smile, a smile Beau couldn't help but return. Happy clients were always a joy, especially if they were smiling before he even started.</p>\n<p>\"My good friend!\" Mr. Fernand spoke in reedy, heavily-accented English and stood back to let him into the entrance hall. It was a little cramped, but the light from the window above the door bathed the room in a welcoming warmth. The smudges on the floor were going to be a nightmare to deal with, but he was getting the idea it was the least of his worries. \"It is so good of you to come out on such short notice. Usually I schedule things more comfortably, but last night's affair was so short notice, I didn't have a chance to set anything up with the agency. Thank you so much for your time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not at all!\" Beau chuckled. \"This is way better than the whale my colleagues have to go scrape up this morning. A dinner party, I can deal with.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's more the prep for the dinner party that needs to get cleaned up,\" Mr. Fernand explained, indicating for Beau to follow as he disappeared into the adjoining living room. \"We had venison and I was preparing the elk and let's just say it got messy. The garage and dining room are going to need some proper work. Don't mind the smudges. There was quite a sticky basting sauce.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not a problem. It's what I'm here for. You'll just need to show me the area of biggest concern for you right now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, sure!\" said Mr. Fernand. \"I'll be happy to.\"</p>\n<p>\"Also, may I say, nice cravat?\" Beau said, his eye catching another broad smear along a wall.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! You like it? It was a gift from the Prince of Venezuela! We met last week for his birthday and he just handed it to me. What was I to do, say no?\" Mr. Fernand tutted. \"Of course, not.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that you're totally right. You can't look a gift like that in the mouth. The Prince would have been angry.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand didn't stop nattering about the Prince as he led the way through the elegant home. Beau was there to work though, so as much as he was getting lost in the tales Fernand was telling, he made sure to keep scanning the space for marks. There were a lot of them. Fernand's guests, whoever they were, had thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, it seemed.</p>\n<p>A loud thud from upstairs stopped them in their tracks. Mr. Fernand's eyes shot towards the staircase, his ear cocked, listening closely.</p>\n<p>\"Is everything okay?\" Beau asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. The dog is just being naughty again.\" Fernand said, his expression relaxing before he slowly nodded and carried on leading the way, satisfied the dog had gone quiet.</p>\n<p>\"What breed are they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Chihuahua,\" said Fernand and signaled for Beau to follow. \"Come. I'll show you where the party starts.\"</p>\n<p>Beau dutifully followed, but he was pretty sure he was getting the idea of what waited for him in the garage from last night's debris scattered about. The kitchen was a mess of blood and viscera \u2014 looked like lungs, to be specific \u2014 marring the sink, stove and counter space. Fernand, to his credit, seemed at least a little embarrassed at the state of the place and Beau wondered if he'd need to call in Dee to help with this one. It was still early, he reminded himself; there would be enough time.</p>\n<p>\"So as part of my show for the guests, I start in here,\" Fernand said, leading the way into the wide garage down a path lined with flowerbeds waiting for spring. \"This is where I gut and clean the animal for the guests. Of course, I keep the killing of the animal for before. It becomes problematic to serve dinner once your guests are emotionally invested in the meal, so to speak.\"</p>\n<p>\"Whoa!\" said Beau as he stepped in to find yet more viscera and blood centered around a stainless steel hook hanging in the center of the room. Unlike the kitchen, there was no control to this mess. Somehow, Fernand had got bits of his pre-cooked dinner on the roof, on the walls and on the floor. \"This is so interactive!\"</p>\n<p>\"You understand!\" Fernand clapped his hands together, delighted. \"I honestly just like putting on a show for my guests and having them choose the parts they'll be eating draws them so much closer to the experience, don't you think?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that sounds pretty immersive, alright!\" Beau smiled, turning to regard the garage. \"I'm going to need to get started, though. It wasn't just your guests that were immersed last night.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course! Of course! Let me get out of your way! If you need anything, anything at all, I'm just upstairs.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks a lot! And it's just in here, the kitchen and dining room, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yes, the housekeeper comes on Monday, but there's just no way I was going to call her in for this,\" he said and a grin spread across his face. \"She doesn't quite have the stomach for my parties.\"</p>\n<p>A long silence hung between them as Fernand's eyes traced lines across Beau's face. But Beau quickly began to feel the weight of his backpack and dumped it on the ground and brightly said, \"Well, I better get to work!\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the words of Mister Fritz Diedrich Williams, Administrator of the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation, \"An SCProfessional's best friend is soap, water and <em>elbow grease!</em> Get scrubbing.\"</p>\n<p>So that's what Beau did. He took a quick sweep of the mess of the house and gathered what he could. Fortunately, Mr. Fernand had put most of the leftovers away already, and Beau had to admit, the crackling looked pretty good. Here and there, the streaks of a cloth made from a shirt that now sat crusted and dried on the edge of the sink told Beau that Mr. Fernand had probably tried to clean up himself before giving up. He couldn't help but chuckle. Some people just needed that extra bit of help, and from how hard Fernand was clenching his jaw, this was all probably pretty overwhelming for him.</p>\n<p>\"Eat shit, Dee,\" he said, dropping the last of some bones, marrow sucked clean, into the trash and heading for the oozing lungs in the sink. \"This is way better than whale clean-up.\"</p>\n<p>He clapped his hands free of dust and sticky sinew over the trashcan and took a deep breath before heading back to the van. The pressure hose was his favourite part and the set-up would take a minute. Of course, part of that set-up meant disappearing behind the garage to smoke a joint. There was no way he was going to be away from management's eyes and <em>not</em> have some fun. Besides, the garage was an abattoir after Fernand's performance art and getting stoned would only help him appreciate it more.</p>\n<p>Dee's weed harshed his throat more than he liked, but it was weed in South Dakota, so he really didn't have high expectations. He knew better than to have expectations at all. He'd learned the hard way.</p>\n<p>With a smile on his face and <em>Paper Planes</em> blaring in his ears, Beau set to work. SCP didn't do much fancy in the way of chemicals, from what he could tell. It really was just elbow grease and soap, he was pretty sure. He did get to meet interesting people like Mr. Fernand and knowing that werewolves actually <em>did</em> exist was pretty cool. Then again, he'd kind of always known it, but it was like a war on the other side of the world \u2014 out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>The rhythmic scrape of the broom's hard bristles slowly scrubbed away Fernand's theatrics from the night before as the sun climbed higher in the sky. Beau had worked up a firm sweat despite the winter cold and was taking a break round back with more of his joint when a shadow from the house caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\"Shit!\" He hissed, stubbing the roach dead on the bottom of his shoe, trying to exhale what he could. He was confident Fernand wouldn't smell anything as he clambered out from behind the garage. \"Mr. Fernand, I'm so sorry! I was just taking a look out back to see if that may need attention. You know we have wonderful gardening services, too?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll keep that in mind for the spring!\" Fernand said cheerily, casting his eyes towards the gaping maw of the garage and nodding. \"You're making very good progress. Fritz sure knows how to hire.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, but I just think the mess was pretty controlled, honestly.\" He wasn't a good liar, but what else was there to say? He didn't take compliments well. \"Just needs some elbow grease. I hope you don't mind, I moved the freezer. There was blood behind it that I wanted to get out.\"</p>\n<p>\"You moved the freezer?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I'm pretty good at moving things.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" Fernand's eyes moved between the freezer and Beau for a few seconds before he smiled widely again. \"That's wonderful news! You're very thorough and that is honestly so appreciated. Not enough people take pride in their work these days and it's that kind of dedication that will carry you far young man!\"</p>\n<p>\"You're too kind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like some lemonade? All this work won't be good for you without a refreshment!\"</p>\n<p>\"That'd be \u2014\" A crash came from the nearby second floor window followed immediately by a loud yelp.</p>\n<p>\"That darn dog!\" Fernand snarled and then he set off with urgent steps towards the house before chiming over his shoulder. \"I'll be right back with your lemonade!\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you!\"</p>\n<p>Beau chuckled as he watched the behemoth of a man disappear into the house. He was busy putting his earphones back in, when suddenly a piercing shriek cut through the air from the house. Beau's head swiveled in the direction of the noise and he saw through the open window as Fernand stared down at a flailing mass of hair jittering from just below the window sill. Obviously his dog was quite excitable. Cold fury crossed Fernand's face and just as he looked like he was about to erupt, he saw Beau watching.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Beau! I'm so sorry,\" he cried from through the window, stepping around the agitated animal. \"My dog seems to have gone potty on my rug. I'll have to handle this before I bring you that lemonade, but if you're really quite thirsty you can help yourself to some in the refrigerator.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing, Mr. Fernand! Do you need help with that mess? It's kind of what I'm here for.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no!\" Fernand said, hastily. \"You just listen to your music and keep busy there or you'll never get finished. It's just a small mess. I can handle this.\"</p>\n<p>Without another word, Fernand stepped back and drew the curtains closed with a flourish, which, Beau thought as he put his earphones back in, wasn't going to help with the smell. Especially considering how big that chihuahua was.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The dining room wasn't as bad as it could have been, Beau reckoned. If the prep areas were abattoirs, he had half expected the dining room to have food in places he didn't know were places. One thing he was worried about though was the piece of <em>something</em> that had somehow hit the roof and stayed there. He'd need to get that down, but that was a worry for later and so he turned his attention to the kitchen floors. With Single Ladies on repeat, he set to work.</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand never did come back with that lemonade, but Beau just laughed it off. He was probably having a fit over some dog shit on some too-expensive rug. Thank God the downstairs had wooden floors. He could stomach some of the gross things that the SCProfessionals had to deal with, but fighting to get blood out of a carpet was just a nightmare no matter how you approached it. And Mr. Fernand's obviously expensive taste told Beau that in this house, he was more likely to destroy a rug by cleaning it than anything else.</p>\n<p>He'd been surprised to find wealth like this in Pierre. To be honest he'd been surprised to find anything in Pierre, South Dakota, at all. After his mom forged a path here with a boyfriend who left her a few weeks later and with his own dreams of living in L.A. just refusing to materialize, there hadn't been much choice but to pack up and head north.</p>\n<p>Now here he was, more steadily employed than most of his friends back in Philadelphia but with far less prospects. Proven, he realized, by the fact that he was currently wrestling a large bone out from behind a cabinet in the dining room. Like much of what he'd seen, how it got there was a mystery and from the size of Mr. Fernand, he could only assume his aggressive eating was a persistent threat to the surrounding environment. Somehow this bone (was that a femur?) was lodged between the leg of the heavy wooden cabinet and the wall. It <em>wasn't</em> coming loose.</p>\n<p>\"How the fuck\u2026\" Beau mumbled and he squatted next to the cabinet, gripping the bottom rim with his fingers barely an inch from the floor. Then with well-practiced patience and the fear of throwing his back out sitting on his shoulder, he lifted.</p>\n<p>It took a second of nothing happening before finally he felt that shift that told him he'd won. Just a few centimeters was all he needed. He slowly brought himself to his full height, edging upward bit-by-bit, till he heard the clatter of the bone coming loose. He aimed a few frantic kicks in the direction of the clatter and sent it spinning out from under the cabinet and under the table. He watched it ricochet for a bit, amused, then he slowly set the cabinet down again so he could go retrieve his find.</p>\n<p>The bone was quite large, which was probably why he thought it was a femur, but then he had to ask if elks had femurs? They probably did, but were they this big? How big was an elk? He inspected the bone more closely, seeing the meat had been cleanly stripped from it and it had been gnawed on. He froze.</p>\n<p>Why were these bite marks so blunt? These didn't look like they were made by dog's teeth. Unless\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Beau!\" Mr. Fernand's voice chimed, announcing his entry. He carried a silver tray, tiny in his massive hand, laden with two glasses and a jug of lemonade. \"I see you didn't have any lemonade! You should have helped yourself. I'm so sorry I took so long, but my little baby just went poopy all over and I had to clean it up.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it's no problem!\" Beau said, turning around to find Mr. Fernand standing so close he could smell the sweat mixing with his too-sweet cologne.</p>\n<p>\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Fernand asked through his perpetually gritted teeth. His beady eyes inspected the bone and Beau in turn.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yeah, I found this behind the cabinet.\"</p>\n<p>\"You moved the cabinet?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Yeah, I'm great at moving stuff.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad to hear that, but tell me, you seem confused.\" Mr. Fernand peered closer, almost vivisecting him with his gaze. \"Why's that?\"</p>\n<p>Beau looked from Mr. Fernand to the bone, to the tray of lemonade that looked really welcoming and back to Mr. Fernand and said, \"Well, I just think this isn't an appropriate chew toy for your dog. I don't know if that's rude of me, but I just don't.\"</p>\n<p>\"I-\" Mr. Fernand leaned back to look at Beau from his full height once more, clearly perplexed. \"Why do you say that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, look,\" Beau pointed to the bite marks. \"Your dog's old, isn't it? It's going poopy on the carpet and it's teeth are super blunt. I think these kinds of chew toys are bad for its gums. It may need a softer chewie.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand stood silently watching him for a bit, clearly processing what he'd heard. Beau didn't like giving unsolicited advice, but he just didn't like the idea of a dog hurting itself by accident. Mr. Fernand probably didn't even know it was bad for the dog, which was the only reason Beau had said anything. It'd be very inappropriate for him to speak to customers like that normally, but this was for a dog and he wasn't going to apologize for it.</p>\n<p>\"It had never occurred to me,\" Mr. Fernand said meekly, his expression shifting suddenly. \"I'm so sorry. I'll make sure to get that on the list immediately. I'll go get fresh toys when you're done here today.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You probably didn't even know.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're right, but still, the thought that I've caused my beloved any harm is just too much right now,\" Mr. Fernand held out his hand (more a paw really) and looked suddenly misty-eyed. \"Hand it over. Let me dispose of the foul thing!\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand was taking this very seriously, but if this dramatic Frenchman wanted to atone, who was Beau to stop him? He held the bone out and Fernand snatched it away and disappeared back into the house.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you for the lemonade!\" Beau called after him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The lemonade really was very good and he kept a glass with him as he worked, making sure the old wood was properly polished and the room properly aired after the smell of barbecue sauce (there was definitely smokey-chipotle sauce at play, too) had pervaded the air so thickly Beau felt he could dip a buffalo wing in it. He still hadn't managed to find a way to get whatever was on the roof off and Mr. Fernand had disappeared so while a ladder was out of the question, he moved on.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was his final task and fortunately, the earlier clean-up had helped a lot. Mr. Fernand had also been very conscientious and not added any major mess to the kitchen at all. So with Secondhand Serenade screaming about falling for someone to keep him company, he began to mop the marble.</p>\n<p>Oddly, while being a cleaning service had never been where he saw himself, this was not unlike what he would have ended up doing at a studio in L.A. so, he liked to see something cosmic in that. Each stroke of the mop was pretty therapeutic too. In the garage, he'd worked in short, quick strokes, scrubbing the blood out of the concrete with frenetic vigour.</p>\n<p>Here, his strokes were long and firm, almost languidly heavy, drawing blood and worse off the tiles and making them sparkle more and more as he went. The dishes had already run in the dishwasher, so making this place shine was the last order of business for the day. As his reflection became more clear in the floor beneath him, Beau couldn't help but smile.</p>\n<p>It was during his return to Single Ladies that he nearly twisted an ankle as he did a double-take watching the mystery-whatever that had been stuck to the adjoining dining room's roof suddenly come loose and plopped down onto the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, cool.\" He said and walked over, pulling his earphones out of his ears. Apparently, all he needed was patience, he thought as he bent down to pick up what he could now see looked like skin with long black hair connected to it. \"Weird.\"</p>\n<p>But another word didn't have a chance to cross his lips as the roof above him suddenly shuddered viciously. He stumbled backwards out of the dining room and leaned on the kitchen counter, staring wide-eyed at the roof, now basically rattling the chandelier loose with each pounding shake. Soon, a loud yell from upstairs snatched Beau's attention and without thinking he set off. Something wasn't right!</p>\n<p>He stormed up the stairs, following the sound of a struggle. The upstairs was uncannily dark, but the passage was clear, so Beau followed the noise swiftly. His feet carried him quickly across the soft carpets and he strained his ears to listen for more details before he arrived. Had someone snuck in while Beau hadn't been paying attention? Mr. Fernand was speaking, babbling in French it seemed, but he couldn't hear him clearly over the sound of crashing furniture and the cries of probably the largest dog in the world.</p>\n<p>Beau approached the room at the end of a long hall where the commotion was coming from. Once again, he found the door ajar and he inched closer as he heard the thrashing from inside, mingled with strings of guttural French. \"Mr. Fernand?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't come in!\" Mr. Fernand shrieked and Beau froze as the door slammed shut. \"It's not safe!\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernand, what's that noise? Do you need help?\" Beau leaned closer, trying to hear what was happening. Mr. Fernand was alive, but none of this made sense. If it wasn't safe, why was he still in there then?</p>\n<p>\"No, no! Stay out there. My baby is having a fit. She's just struggling to take her medicine,\" Mr. Fernand's voice strained against the stress of holding back the noisily struggling dog and Beau debated going in. \"It'll be okay. This is normal. Everything is normal!\"</p>\n<p>Beau heard more thudding and then the sudden approached of footsteps. Another crash followed shortly and the door in front of Beau juddered as something was thrown and held against it. It rattled violently for a second and then a single, sudden and sickening crack echoed through the door and all was quiet once again.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernand! Are you okay?\" Beau's voice was loud and clear, just like he'd been taught in drama club, but he never thought he'd be using it for this. \"What was that sound?\"</p>\n<p>\"Massage for my dog,\" Mr. Fernand said and Beau could hear the giant moving toward the door. It swung open and Mr. Fernand towered there with a smile on his reddened face, panting a bit. \"It always calms her down when I click her neck. I'm sorry if I scared you.\"</p>\n<p>Beau looked up at Mr. Fernand's smile and quickly smiled back. \"Nah, it's okay,\" he said with a shrug. \"I was just worried. If you're okay and your dog's okay then that's cool. I can just give you an update on how things are going. I'm almost done, actually.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes! Absolutely, please do!\" Mr. Fernand said, gesturing back down the hall so Beau could lead the way.</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing!\" said Beau, but his eyes trailed off for a second before focusing again. \"I'm sorry, I feel so rude. I never got your dog's name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" Mr. Fernand snickered. \"Tiffany.\"</p>\n<p>Beau processed that for a second then smiled once again. \"That's a real cool name for a dog.\"</p>\n<p>\"Isn't it just?\" Mr. Fernand laughed some more as he stepped into the hall, indicating it was time for them to head downstairs. \"And Beau, would you mind if I arrange short notice for you to come in tomorrow morning, as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean, I don't think the job's gonna take that long.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no,\" Mr. Fernand smiled his toothy smile. \"I've decided to host another impromptu soiree.\"</p>\n<p>Beau blinked for a second and then remembered that whales could take entire days to clean up and he said, \"Sure, thing! I'll call the boss myself! Now, you'll see I've actually made some good progress and I've got some products to recommend to keep your silver looking right.\"</p>\n<p>\"You can tell me all about it over sandwiches. I have some lovely cold-cuts we can have!\"</p>\n<p>\"That's very kind, but I'm actually watching what I eat,\" Beau said, looking over his shoulder. \"I'm trying to get <em>ripped</em> so I only eat at certain times.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand sighed and smiled gently back at him, \"Your loss, but I really should have you for dinner sometime.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"Caleb, don't be mad \u2014\"</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"Beau, you said you were gonna bring pizza.

Alright.\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"...\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"Hey, Beau, what's for dinner?\"//\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBeau wasn't sure what the \"Colonial Revival\" Dee told him to look for was, but as he looked at the latest job location for Customer 082 -- Mr. Fernand -- from the bottom of the driveway, he supposed it had something to do with being rich. High, whitewashed walls lined with pillars and neat blue shutters for the windows smiled at him as he inched the clanking van emblazoned with the words SAFE CLEANUP PROFESSIONALS down the driveway in the early morning sun.\n\n\n\nApparently, Mr. Fernand was a gourmand who hosted parties around town that often left quite a mess -- a mess that only the Foundation was willing to clean up. His mentor, Dee, had told him all the new guys had to do it at least once. Beau didn't mind. If Mr. Fernand hung out in fancy houses like this, he'd clean with a smile on his face. Here, in the wealthy suburbs of Pierre, the stillness of //some// isolation blocked out the noise from the world outside. It was truly peaceful and as Beau approached the front door, he found himself smiling. \n\n\n\nAs Beau ascended the stairs to the door on the chilly morning, he noticed it stood slightly ajar. He froze, staring for a second, wondering why anyone would be so silly. It was freezing and all this cold air wasn't going to be good for a person. At least, that's what his gran had told him. Getting closer, he couldn't help but notice the red fingerprints smeared on the door. He peered at them closely, wondering what it was going to take to get that off.\n\n\n\nAfter a second of considering the problem in front of him, he realised he was being watched from deeper in the house. A looming shadow from the top of the stairs peered down at him and Beau took it as his cue.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" Beau said uncertainly. \"This is Beau from the cleaning agency. SCP - Cleanliness Guaranteed!\"\n\n\n\nThundering footsteps approached the door hurriedly and Beau's stomach knotted, waiting for him to be told he had the wrong house and that he was going to get melted by an old god if he didn't leave immediately. As the door swung open, though, Mr. Fernand beamed down at him from his towering full height. His wide, lopsided mouth approximated a smile, a smile Beau couldn't help but return. Happy clients were always a joy, especially if they were smiling before he even started.\n\n\n\n\"My good friend!\" Mr. Fernand spoke in reedy, heavily-accented English and stood back to let him into the entrance hall. It was a little cramped, but the light from the window above the door bathed the room in a welcoming warmth. The smudges on the floor were going to be a nightmare to deal with, but he was getting the idea it was the least of his worries.\u00a0\u00a0\"It is so good of you to come out on such short notice. Usually I schedule things more comfortably, but last night's affair was so short notice, I didn't have a chance to set anything up with the agency. Thank you so much for your time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all!\" Beau chuckled. \"This is way better than the whale my colleagues have to go scrape up this morning. A dinner party, I can deal with.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's more the prep for the dinner party that needs to get cleaned up,\" Mr. Fernand explained, indicating for Beau to follow as he disappeared into the adjoining living room. \"We had venison and I was preparing the elk and let's just say it got messy. The garage and dining room are going to need some proper work. Don't mind the smudges. There was quite a sticky basting sauce.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not a problem. It's what I'm here for. You'll just need to show me the area of biggest concern for you right now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure, sure!\" said Mr. Fernand. \"I'll be happy to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Also, may I say, nice cravat?\" Beau said, his eye catching another broad smear along a wall.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! You like it? It was a gift from the Prince of Venezuela! We met last week for his birthday and he just handed it to me. What was I to do, say no?\" Mr. Fernand tutted. \"Of course, not.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that you're totally right. You can't look a gift like that in the mouth. The Prince would have been angry.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand didn't stop nattering about the Prince as he led the way through the elegant home. Beau was there to work though, so as much as he was getting lost in the tales Fernand was telling, he made sure to keep scanning the space for marks. There were a lot of them. Fernand's guests, whoever they were, had thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, it seemed. \n\n\n\nA loud thud from upstairs stopped them in their tracks. Mr. Fernand's eyes shot towards the staircase, his ear cocked, listening closely. \n\n\n\n\"Is everything okay?\" Beau asked.\n\n\n\n\"Yes. The dog is just being naughty again.\" Fernand said, his expression relaxing before he slowly nodded and carried on leading the way, satisfied the dog had gone quiet.\n\n\n\n\"What breed are they?\" \n\n\n\n\"Chihuahua,\" said Fernand and signaled for Beau to follow. \"Come. I'll show you where the party starts.\" \n\n\n\nBeau dutifully followed, but he was pretty sure he was getting the idea of what waited for him in the garage from last night's debris scattered about. The kitchen was a mess of blood and viscera -- looked like lungs, to be specific -- marring the sink, stove and counter space. Fernand, to his credit, seemed at least a little embarrassed at the state of the place and Beau wondered if he'd need to call in Dee to help with this one. It was still early, he reminded himself; there would be enough time. \n\n\n\n\"So as part of my show for the guests, I start in here,\" Fernand said, leading the way into the wide garage down a path lined with flowerbeds waiting for spring. \"This is where I gut and clean the animal for the guests. Of course, I keep the killing of the animal for before. It becomes problematic to serve dinner once your guests are emotionally invested in the meal, so to speak.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whoa!\" said Beau as he stepped in to find yet more viscera and blood centered around a stainless steel hook hanging in the center of the room. Unlike the kitchen, there was no control to this mess. Somehow, Fernand had got bits of his pre-cooked dinner on the roof, on the walls and on the floor. \"This is so interactive!\"\n\n\n\n\"You understand!\" Fernand clapped his hands together, delighted. \"I honestly just like putting on a show for my guests and having them choose the parts they'll be eating draws them so much closer to the experience, don't you think?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds pretty immersive, alright!\" Beau smiled, turning to regard the garage. \"I'm going to need to get started, though. It wasn't just your guests that were immersed last night.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course! Of course! Let me get out of your way! If you need anything, anything at all, I'm just upstairs.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks a lot! And it's just in here, the kitchen and dining room, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yes, the housekeeper comes on Monday, but there's just no way I was going to call her in for this,\" he said and a grin spread across his face. \"She doesn't quite have the stomach for my parties.\"\n\n\n\nA long silence hung between them as Fernand's eyes traced lines across Beau's face. But Beau quickly began to feel the weight of his backpack and dumped it on the ground and brightly said, \"Well, I better get to work!\"\n\n\n\n------\n\nIn the words of Mister Fritz Diedrich Williams, Administrator of the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation, \"An SCProfessional's best friend is soap, water and //elbow grease!// Get scrubbing.\"\n\n\n\nSo that's what Beau did. He took a quick sweep of the mess of the house and gathered what he could. Fortunately, Mr. Fernand had put most of the leftovers away already, and Beau had to admit, the crackling looked pretty good. Here and there, the streaks of a cloth made from a shirt that now sat crusted and dried on the edge of the sink told Beau that Mr. Fernand had probably tried to clean up himself before giving up. He couldn't help but chuckle. Some people just needed that extra bit of help, and from how hard Fernand was clenching his jaw, this was all probably pretty overwhelming for him. \n\n\n\n\"Eat shit, Dee,\" he said, dropping the last of some bones, marrow sucked clean, into the trash and heading for the oozing lungs in the sink. \"This is way better than whale clean-up.\"\n\n\n\nHe clapped his hands free of dust and sticky sinew over the trashcan and took a deep breath before heading back to the van. The pressure hose was his favourite part and the set-up would take a minute. Of course, part of that set-up meant disappearing behind the garage to smoke a joint. There was no way he was going to be away from management's eyes and //not// have some fun. Besides, the garage was an abattoir after Fernand's performance art and getting stoned would only help him appreciate it more.\n\n\n\nDee's weed harshed his throat more than he liked, but it was weed in South Dakota, so he really didn't have high expectations. He knew better than to have expectations at all. He'd learned the hard way.\n\n\n\nWith a smile on his face and //Paper Planes// blaring in his ears, Beau set to work. SCP didn't do much fancy in the way of chemicals, from what he could tell. It really was just elbow grease and soap, he was pretty sure. He did get to meet interesting people like Mr. Fernand and knowing that werewolves actually //did// exist was pretty cool. Then again, he'd kind of always known it, but it was like a war on the other side of the world -- out of sight, out of mind.\n\n\n\nThe rhythmic scrape of the broom's hard bristles slowly scrubbed away Fernand's theatrics from the night before as the sun climbed higher in the sky. Beau had worked up a firm sweat despite the winter cold and was taking a break round back with more of his joint when a shadow from the house caught his attention.\n\n\n\n\"Shit!\" He hissed, stubbing the roach dead on the bottom of his shoe, trying to exhale what he could. He was confident Fernand wouldn't smell anything as he clambered out from behind the garage. \"Mr. Fernand, I'm so sorry! I was just taking a look out back to see if that may need attention. You know we have wonderful gardening services, too?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll keep that in mind for the spring!\" Fernand said cheerily, casting his eyes towards the gaping maw of the garage and nodding. \"You're making very good progress. Fritz sure knows how to hire.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you, but I just think the mess was pretty controlled, honestly.\" He wasn't a good liar, but what else was there to say? He didn't take compliments well. \"Just needs some elbow grease. I hope you don't mind, I moved the freezer. There was blood behind it that I wanted to get out.\"\n\n\n\n\"You moved the freezer?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty good at moving things.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see.\" Fernand's eyes moved between the freezer and Beau for a few seconds before he smiled widely again. \"That's wonderful news! You're very thorough and that is honestly so appreciated. Not enough people take pride in their work these days and it's that kind of dedication that will carry you far young man!\"\n\n\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you like some lemonade? All this work won't be good for you without a refreshment!\"\n\n\n\n\"That'd be --\" A crash came from the nearby second floor window followed immediately by a loud yelp. \n\n\n\n\"That darn dog!\" Fernand snarled and then he set off with urgent steps towards the house before chiming over his shoulder. \"I'll be right back with your lemonade!\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you!\" \n\n\n\nBeau chuckled as he watched the behemoth of a man disappear into the house. He was busy putting his earphones back in, when suddenly a piercing shriek cut through the air from the house. Beau's head\u00a0\u00a0swiveled in the direction of the noise and he saw through the open window as Fernand stared down at a flailing mass of hair jittering from just below the window sill. Obviously his dog was quite excitable. Cold fury crossed Fernand's face and just as he looked like he was about to erupt, he saw Beau watching. \n\n\n\n\"Oh, Beau! I'm so sorry,\" he cried from through the window, stepping around the agitated animal. \"My dog seems to have gone potty on my rug. I'll have to handle this before I bring you that lemonade, but if you're really quite thirsty you can help yourself to some in the refrigerator.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Fernand! Do you need help with that mess? It's kind of what I'm here for.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no!\" Fernand said, hastily. \"You just listen to your music and keep busy there or you'll never get finished. It's just a small mess. I can handle this.\"\n\n\n\nWithout another word, Fernand stepped back and drew the curtains closed with a flourish, which, Beau thought as he put his earphones back in, wasn't going to help with the smell. Especially considering how big that chihuahua was.\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe dining room wasn't as bad as it could have been, Beau reckoned. If the prep areas were abattoirs, he had half expected the dining room to have food in places he didn't know were places. One thing he was worried about though was the piece of //something// that had somehow hit the roof and stayed there. He'd need to get that down, but that was a worry for later and so he turned his attention to the kitchen floors. With Single Ladies on repeat, he set to work. \n\n\n\nMr. Fernand never did come back with that lemonade, but Beau just laughed it off. He was probably having a fit over some dog shit on some too-expensive rug. Thank God the downstairs had wooden floors. He could stomach some of the gross things that the SCProfessionals had to deal with, but fighting to get blood out of a carpet was just a nightmare no matter how you approached it. And Mr. Fernand's obviously expensive taste told Beau that in this house, he was more likely to destroy a rug by cleaning it than anything else.\n\n\n\nHe'd been surprised to find wealth like this in Pierre. To be honest he'd been surprised to find anything in Pierre, South Dakota, at all. After his mom forged a path here with a boyfriend who left her a few weeks later and with his own dreams of living in L.A. just refusing to materialize, there hadn't been much choice but to pack up and head north.\n\n\n\nNow here he was, more steadily employed than most of his friends back in Philadelphia but with far less prospects. Proven, he realized, by the fact that he was currently wrestling a large bone out from behind a cabinet in the dining room. Like much of what he'd seen, how it got there was a mystery and from the size of Mr. Fernand, he could only assume his aggressive eating was a persistent threat to the surrounding environment. Somehow this bone (was that a femur?) was lodged between the leg of the heavy wooden cabinet and the wall. It //wasn't// coming loose.\n\n\n\n\"How the fuck...\" Beau mumbled and he squatted next to the cabinet, gripping the bottom rim with his fingers barely an inch from the floor. Then with well-practiced patience and the fear of throwing his back out sitting on his shoulder, he lifted. \n\n\n\nIt took a second of nothing happening before finally he felt that shift that told him he'd won. Just a few centimeters was all he needed. He slowly brought himself to his full height, edging upward bit-by-bit, till he heard the clatter of the bone coming loose. He aimed a few frantic kicks in the direction of the clatter and sent it spinning out from under the cabinet and under the table. He watched it ricochet for a bit, amused, then he slowly set the cabinet down again so he could go retrieve his find.\n\n\n\nThe bone was quite large, which was probably why he thought it was a femur, but then he had to ask if elks had femurs? They probably did, but were they this big? How big was an elk? He inspected the bone more closely, seeing the meat had been cleanly stripped from it and it had been gnawed on. He froze. \n\n\n\nWhy were these bite marks so blunt? These didn't look like they were made by dog's teeth. Unless... \n\n\n\n\"Hello, Beau!\" Mr. Fernand's voice chimed, announcing his entry. He carried a silver tray, tiny in his massive hand, laden with two glasses and a jug of lemonade. \"I see you didn't have any lemonade! You should have helped yourself. I'm so sorry I took so long, but my little baby just went poopy all over and I had to clean it up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, it's no problem!\" Beau said, turning around to find Mr. Fernand standing so close he could smell the sweat mixing with his too-sweet cologne. \n\n\n\n\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Fernand asked through his perpetually gritted teeth. His beady eyes inspected the bone and Beau in turn.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I found this behind the cabinet.\"\n\n\n\n\"You moved the cabinet?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Yeah, I'm great at moving stuff.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that, but tell me, you seem confused.\" Mr. Fernand peered closer, almost vivisecting him with his gaze. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\n\nBeau looked from Mr. Fernand to the bone, to the tray of lemonade that looked really welcoming and back to Mr. Fernand and said, \"Well, I just think this isn't an appropriate chew toy for your dog. I don't know if that's rude of me, but I just don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"I-\" Mr. Fernand leaned back to look at Beau from his full height once more, clearly perplexed. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, look,\" Beau pointed to the bite marks. \"Your dog's old, isn't it? It's going poopy on the carpet and it's teeth are super blunt. I think these kinds of chew toys are bad for its gums. It may need a softer chewie.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand stood silently watching him for a bit, clearly processing what he'd heard. Beau didn't like giving unsolicited advice, but he just didn't like the idea of a dog hurting itself by accident. Mr. Fernand probably didn't even know it was bad for the dog, which was the only reason Beau had said anything. It'd be very inappropriate for him to speak to customers like that normally, but this was for a dog and he wasn't going to apologize for it.\n\n\n\n\"It had never occurred to me,\" Mr. Fernand said meekly, his expression shifting suddenly. \"I'm so sorry. I'll make sure to get that on the list immediately. I'll go get fresh toys when you're done here today.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You probably didn't even know.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're right, but still, the thought that I've caused my beloved any harm is just too much right now,\" Mr. Fernand held out his hand (more a paw really) and looked suddenly misty-eyed. \"Hand it over. Let me dispose of the foul thing!\" \n\n\n\nMr. Fernand was taking this very seriously, but if this dramatic Frenchman wanted to atone, who was Beau to stop him? He held the bone out and Fernand snatched it away and disappeared back into the house. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you for the lemonade!\" Beau called after him.\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe lemonade really was very good and he kept a glass with him as he worked, making sure the old wood was properly polished and the room properly aired after the smell of barbecue sauce (there was definitely smokey-chipotle sauce at play, too) had pervaded the air so thickly Beau felt he could dip a buffalo wing in it. He still hadn't managed to find a way to get whatever was on the roof off and Mr. Fernand had disappeared so while a ladder was out of the question, he moved on.\n\n\n\nThe kitchen was his final task and fortunately, the earlier clean-up had helped a lot. Mr. Fernand had also been very conscientious and not added any major mess to the kitchen at all. So with Secondhand Serenade screaming about falling for someone to keep him company, he began to mop the marble.\n\n\n\nOddly, while being a cleaning service had never been where he saw himself, this was not unlike what he would have ended up doing at a studio in L.A. so, he liked to see something cosmic in that. Each stroke of the mop was pretty therapeutic too. In the garage, he'd worked in short, quick strokes, scrubbing the blood out of the concrete with frenetic vigour. \n\n\n\nHere, his strokes were long and firm, almost languidly heavy, drawing blood and worse off the tiles and making them sparkle more and more as he went. The dishes had already run in the dishwasher, so making this place shine was the last order of business for the day. As his reflection became more clear in the floor beneath him, Beau couldn't help but smile.\n\n\n\nIt was during his return to Single Ladies that he nearly twisted an ankle as he did a double-take watching the mystery-whatever that had been stuck to the adjoining dining room's roof suddenly come loose and plopped down onto the floor. \n\n\n\n\"Oh, cool.\" He said and walked over, pulling his earphones out of his ears. Apparently, all he needed was patience, he thought as he bent down to pick up what he could now see looked like skin with long black hair connected to it. \"Weird.\"\n\n\n\nBut another word didn't have a chance to cross his lips as the roof above him suddenly shuddered viciously. He stumbled backwards out of the dining room and leaned on the kitchen counter, staring wide-eyed at the roof, now basically rattling the chandelier loose with each pounding shake. Soon, a loud yell from upstairs snatched Beau's attention and without thinking he set off. Something wasn't right!\n\n\n\nHe stormed up the stairs, following the sound of a struggle. The upstairs was uncannily dark, but the passage was clear, so Beau followed the noise swiftly. His feet carried him quickly across the soft carpets and he strained his ears to listen for more details before he arrived. Had someone snuck in while Beau hadn't been paying attention? Mr. Fernand was speaking, babbling in French it seemed, but he couldn't hear him clearly over the sound of crashing furniture and the cries of probably the largest dog in the world.\n\n\n\nBeau approached the room at the end of a long hall where the commotion was coming from. Once again, he found the door ajar and he inched closer as he heard the thrashing from inside, mingled with strings of guttural French. \"Mr. Fernand?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't come in!\" Mr. Fernand shrieked and Beau froze as the door slammed shut. \"It's not safe!\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Fernand, what's that noise? Do you need help?\" Beau leaned closer, trying to hear what was happening. Mr. Fernand was alive, but none of this made sense. If it wasn't safe, why was he still in there then?\n\n\n\n\"No, no! Stay out there. My baby is having a fit. She's just struggling to take her medicine,\" Mr. Fernand's voice strained against the stress of holding back the noisily struggling dog and Beau debated going in. \"It'll be okay. This is normal. Everything is normal!\"\n\n\n\nBeau heard more thudding and then the sudden approached of footsteps. Another crash followed shortly and the door in front of Beau juddered as something was thrown and held against it. It rattled violently for a second and then a single, sudden and sickening crack echoed through the door and all was quiet once again.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Fernand! Are you okay?\" Beau's voice was loud and clear, just like he'd been taught in drama club, but he never thought he'd be using it for this. \"What was that sound?\"\n\n\n\n\"Massage for my dog,\" Mr. Fernand said and Beau could hear the giant moving toward the door. It swung open and Mr. Fernand towered there with a smile on his reddened face, panting a bit. \"It always calms her down when I click her neck. I'm sorry if I scared you.\"\n\n\n\nBeau looked up at Mr. Fernand's smile and quickly smiled back. \"Nah, it's okay,\" he said with a shrug. \"I was just worried. If you're okay and your dog's okay then that's cool. I can just give you an update on how things are going. I'm almost done, actually.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes! Absolutely, please do!\" Mr. Fernand said, gesturing back down the hall so Beau could lead the way.\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing!\" said Beau, but his eyes trailed off for a second before focusing again. \"I'm sorry, I feel so rude. I never got your dog's name.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Fernand snickered. \"Tiffany.\"\n\n\n\nBeau processed that for a second then smiled once again. \"That's a real cool name for a dog.\"\n\n\n\n\"Isn't it just?\" Mr. Fernand laughed some more as he stepped into the hall, indicating it was time for them to head downstairs. \"And Beau, would you mind if I arrange short notice for you to come in tomorrow morning, as well?\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean, I don't think the job's gonna take that long.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no,\" Mr. Fernand smiled his toothy smile. \"I've decided to host another impromptu soiree.\"\n\n\n\nBeau blinked for a second and then remembered that whales could take entire days to clean up and he said, \"Sure, thing! I'll call the boss myself! Now, you'll see I've actually made some good progress and I've got some products to recommend to keep your silver looking right.\"\n\n\n\n\"You can tell me all about it over sandwiches. I have some lovely cold-cuts we can have!\"\n\n\n\n\"That's very kind, but I'm actually watching what I eat,\" Beau said, looking over his shoulder. \"I'm trying to get //ripped// so I only eat at certain times.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand sighed and smiled gently back at him, \"Your loss, but I really should have you for dinner sometime.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n= //\"Caleb, don't be mad --\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"Beau, you said you were gonna bring pizza. Where is the pizza?\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"I have beer! Hear me out!\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"We can't eat beer, Beau!\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"We have the ingredients to make pizza -- yeast, flour, water, salt, olive oil. Cheese for the top. We can have a beer, make a pizza. Make a memory.\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"...\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"...\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"That's acceptable. Thank you. Beer me.\"//\n\n------\n", "references": [], "tags": ["black-comedy", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Clean-Up for Customer 082 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/clean-up-for-customer-082", "year": 2025}, "cold-turkey": {"created_at": "2025-01-01T23:49:00", "creator": "Uncle Nicolini", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "hello world", "date": "2025-01-01T23:49:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, bleak, gamers-against-weed, jude-kriyot, slice-of-life, tale.

He was rolling a blunt, as he often did, while wasting away in front of his computer.</p>\n<p>How pathetic.</p>\n<p>A thirty-something year old smoking weed in a dingy apartment, surrounded by empty energy drink cans and roaches. Truly king fuckshit on fuckshit mountain, sitting upon his throne of fuckshit. Fuck. Shit. He coughed. He wasn't even smoking and he was already coughing. This isn't good. He needed to see a doctor. When was the last time he had done that?</p>\n<p>Fuck. Not since he became who he was now. <em>Could</em> he even go to a doctor? The janitors were after him, and probably the feds too. He had killed a few people, and those types weren't ones to simply let that go. Fuck.</p>\n<p>No. Damn it, he shouldn't be cursing so much. He had told that twink at the dispensary that he was trying to cut down on swearing. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Fuck</span>. Damn it. Ah, whatever, he was already going to hell. No number of <em>mea culpas</em> or Hail Marys could save his faggot tranny soul. Maybe if he went to mass more and stopped smoking as much, but alas, it was too late now.</p>\n<p>He sighed, finishing packing his blunt and bringing it up to his lips. He looked around for the shitty BIC lighter he had bought from the dispensary earlier, finding it behind his keyboard. Moments later, the blunt was lit and he was taking a deep drag from it. Smoke filled his lungs, and a violent, hacking cough took over his body, sending aches through his bones and muscles.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Fuck.</span> Damn it. He almost dropped the blunt. Though he doubted it would incinerate his apartment, there was always that danger. Or at least he thought so, being the paranoid <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">fucker</span> he was. In truth, the flame from the blunt was so dull, it was likely to merely singe the carpet beneath him at worst, but again, Jude was as pathetic as he was paranoid. And yet there he was, worried about the flames of hell.</p>\n<p>He exhaled, the smoke leaving his body in one fell swoop. Smoking had always helped him feel more at ease, but as of late, it was turning into something to fill time rather than a tool to relax. As if he deserved to relax. Surely someone as fucked up and evil as him didn't deserve anything more than suffering.</p>\n<p>After all, he had committed murder. The ultimate sin. Paired with his aforementioned sins, he truly felt wicked. He took another drag of his blunt, this time a smaller one. He didn't immediately break out into hacking coughs, so that was a bonus. He thought about his friends. Esther, JJ, bones, Faeowynn, Dahlia, Andressa, everyone else.</p>\n<p>How they looked up to him. It made him sick. He didn't deserve their friendship, much less their admiration. He was just a thirty-something year-old fuck up who spent his entire life stoned to cope with how much of a failure he was.

Quarter. And uh. One sec. Let me check something.\n\n\n\nFuck.\n\n\n\nYeah, and a lighter too.\n\n\n\nHow much will that be?\n\n\n\nFuck. I don't think I have that much. Uhhh...\n\n\n\nFuck. \n\n\n\nSorry, I don't mean to curse so much. It's a really bad habit. I just-- \n\n\n\nYeah. Maybe just an eighth instead.\n\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nHave a great day.\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n-----\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\nJude sat at his desk, bathed in the pale light of his monitor against the darkness enveloping his room. He was rolling a blunt, as he often did, while wasting away in front of his computer. \n\n\n\nHow pathetic. \n\n\n\nA thirty-something year old smoking weed in a dingy apartment, surrounded by empty energy drink cans and roaches. Truly king fuckshit on fuckshit mountain, sitting upon his throne of fuckshit. Fuck. Shit. He coughed. He wasn't even smoking and he was already coughing. This isn't good. He needed to see a doctor. When was the last time he had done that?\n\n\n\nFuck. Not since he became who he was now. //Could// he even go to a doctor? The janitors were after him, and probably the feds too. He had killed a few people, and those types weren't ones to simply let that go. Fuck.\n\n\n\nNo. Damn it, he shouldn't be cursing so much. He had told that twink at the dispensary that he was trying to cut down on swearing. --Fuck--. Damn it. Ah, whatever, he was already going to hell. No number of //mea culpas// or Hail Marys could save his faggot tranny soul. Maybe if he went to mass more and stopped smoking as much, but alas, it was too late now.\n\n\n\nHe sighed, finishing packing his blunt and bringing it up to his lips. He looked around for the shitty BIC lighter he had bought from the dispensary earlier, finding it behind his keyboard. Moments later, the blunt was lit and he was taking a deep drag from it. Smoke filled his lungs, and a violent, hacking cough took over his body, sending aches through his bones and muscles.\n\n\n\n--Fuck.-- Damn it. He almost dropped the blunt. Though he doubted it would incinerate his apartment, there was always that danger. Or at least he thought so, being the paranoid --fucker-- he was. In truth, the flame from the blunt was so dull, it was likely to merely singe the carpet beneath him at worst, but again, Jude was as pathetic as he was paranoid. And yet there he was, worried about the flames of hell.\n\n\n\nHe exhaled, the smoke leaving his body in one fell swoop. Smoking had always helped him feel more at ease, but as of late, it was turning into something to fill time rather than a tool to relax. As if he deserved to relax. Surely someone as fucked up and evil as him didn't deserve anything more than suffering. \n\n\n\nAfter all, he had committed murder. The ultimate sin. Paired with his aforementioned sins, he truly felt wicked. He took another drag of his blunt, this time a smaller one. He didn't immediately break out into hacking coughs, so that was a bonus. He thought about his friends. Esther, JJ, bones, Faeowynn, Dahlia, Andressa, everyone else. \n\n\n\nHow they looked up to him. It made him sick. He didn't deserve their friendship, much less their admiration. He was just a thirty-something year-old fuck up who spent his entire life stoned to cope with how much of a failure he was. Jude put out his blunt on the ashtray on his desk, then stashed the half-smoked reefer in his jeans pocket. \n\n\n\nHe had something to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n-----\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\nHi.\n\n\n\nYeah, me again.\n\n\n\nNo, I don't want to buy any more.\n\n\n\nI was wondering what your return policy was?\n\n\n\nYeah, the, uh, the weed.\n\n\n\nYeah, I smoked some.\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\nOkay, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n\n\nCan I at least return the lighter?\n\n\n\nNo, it's not broken.\n\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\n\nActually, you know what?

The Japanese solder's disappearances were explained by the presence of several thousand saltwater crocodiles in the marshes, who would have attacked and devoured the Japanese, thus explaining the more than mutilated state of the bodies.

Only 58 British soldiers were killed in the combat against --SCP-224-1-- and ---2-- instances before the arrival of bombers urgently requested by Lieutenant Burnett at approximately 03:50.\n\n\n\nTrapped in the middle of \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 where \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were gathered, the Japanese soldiers were quickly overwhelmed and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 combined with the incendiary bomb drop on the area left only \u2588\u2588 survivors, including \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and were successfully neutralized.

The soldiers who came into contact with --SCP-224-2-- instances were isolated and individually inspected for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\u2588 cases were identified and immediately eliminated).\n\n\n\n**__Proposed Protocol:__** The corpses of fallen British soldiers were collected and incinerated. The area affected by --SCP-224-- was heavily bombed in the following days in order to erase all traces of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Unfortunately. these efforts proved to be insufficient to completely destroy the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 bodies of Japanese soldiers, although their condition did not allow for their cause of death to be identified.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dcd-0122/raf.jpg|caption=Group 224's aircraft flying above Ramree Island (D+3).]]\n\n\n\nThe absence of amnestic substances on location and the Burma Campaign's difficult continents didn't allow for the British soldiers to be treated for three weeks. They were retired from combat, isolated from the rest of the troops, and were forbidden to write letters during this period. The Japanese solder's disappearances were explained by the presence of several thousand saltwater crocodiles in the marshes, who would have attacked and devoured the Japanese, thus explaining the more than mutilated state of the bodies. False testimonies by several members of the 3rd Brigade of the Royal Marines who had agreed to join the Foundation were also set up to finish convincing the soldiers.\n\n\n\nLater in the conflict, Group 224 of the Royal Air Force's crew and British India's general staff were also amnestized. The Japanese soldiers were executed.\n\n\n\n**__Addendum:__** [Update 16/08/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588] Numerous historians have questioned the explanation that the Japanese troops were wiped out by crocodiles, arguing that such a concentration of adult crocodiles within the Ramree Island ecosystem was impossible. The specialists of the DCD managed to find a coherent explanation to replace the previous scenario. The currently accepted hypothesis is that the Japanese succumbed to tropical diseases, venomous animals, and crocodiles, as well as a lack of water and food.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["_fr", "international", "tale"], "title": "DCD-0122 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dcd-0122", "year": 2025}, "dead-capitalism-theory": {"created_at": "2025-01-11T01:26:00", "creator": "xexnoncores", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-11T01:26:00"}, {"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "Added tags: absurdist, corporate, marshall-carter-and-dark, poetry, robert-carter, surrealism, tale.

V</span></span></h1>\n<p><em>by Faeowynn Wilson</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div style=\"text-indent: 3em\">\n<p>Alison is aware of onlookers as she knocks on the front door. She turns her head and looks out of the corner of her eye: some shy away or turned their heads.</p>\n<p>A lot of time has passed in New Alison, in comparison to where Bea and Alison sleep. At least one full cycle of the seasons, though the state of things might suggest even several more years. Infrastructure had been erected at impressive speeds. It is a wonder what can be established given ideal circumstances, time to prepare, and the occasional outside aid from a Queen. The settlement of New Alison has gone through its first winter handily, and while they are yet to be entirely self-sufficient, they are moving easily towards that conclusion.</p>\n<p>So the door Alison knocks on, a second time, is of solid construction, wooden though its housing isn't \u2014 the plains are largely devoid of trees, the nearest forest a substantial journey to the east. The rest of the structure is made of mud, and it lacks some finesse that the door has, probably due to an unfamiliarity with the material by the artisans. They will have to learn mud in the coming generations, and become a people of the earth. Until then, there will be growing pangs, or their opposite \u2014 a hollow, aching lack as people who used to be so big learn humility.</p>\n<p>The door is pulled open by a man of man's world. He has washed dirt from skin, kept facial hair short, and most brow-raising of all is his button-up shirt and dress pants fit for an office, donned over bare, calloused feet. Alison can't help but grin, but she clouds the derisive expression with a polite smile of greeting.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Mr. Cheung?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm \u2014 a Black Queen. You can call me Chao.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>No warmth in his tone, nor his expression. Alison changes her face to match, all business.</p>\n<p>\"I'm here hoping to speak with your son?\"</p>\n<p>\"My son? Andrew?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's caught our particular interest. I am hoping to make him an offer. The conversation's contents won't be private, but I want him to hear them first.\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>Alison flinches. She knows she isn't holding her composure to the highest standard, but she had expected more cooperation and yield than this. More open gratitude from the people she had saved. Momentarily at a loss for words, underneath the unfaltering stare of Mr. Cheung, she cocks her head.</p>\n<p>\"Is that everything?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"May I ask your hesitation?\"</p>\n<p>\"There is no hesitation. The answer is no, I won't have you speaking to my son. Anything you want to say to him, you can say to me.\"</p>\n<p>She searches her mind, attempting to change the script to accommodate for this unforeseen resistance, when the man follows up:</p>\n<p>\"<em>You're</em> hesitating. I won't let you come up with some way to fool me. Go find some family more gullible. Good day.\"</p>\n<p>He attempts to slam the door, but it slides against the floor, and he visibly reddens with the exertion necessary to quickly close it.</p>\n<p>She stands there, stunned, while wind whips her hair and bare calves. Her heart feels tight in her chest, and her brow has furrowed deeply. She has to shake herself out of her trance. When she turns around and looks down the path and down the hill, she sees little figures turned her way. They avert their gaze and keep walking, making like they had no intentions but to get home. She shakes her head, and begins to walk back down the path, into the heart of the settlement. As she makes her way down the hill, a woman, coming the other way, seems to move hurriedly to meet her.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" the woman calls, still some distance down the path.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" Alison cries back, mimicking the curious tone.</p>\n<p>She says something back, but Alison can't make it out, unable to tell whether she heard it correctly or not.</p>\n<p>Instead she asks: \"Sorry?\"</p>\n<p>As the woman nears, her voice lowers. She carries a basket full of fruit and grain, and her body looks more used to the new accommodations than Mr. Cheung's \u2014 a deeper brown both from tan and dirt, hands rough with work, clothing made of denser, more durable materials, just as worn as she is.</p>\n<p>\"Were you just talking with my husband?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Cheung?\"</p>\n<p>\"Call me Su. And you\u2026 you're one of the Queens.\"</p>\n<p>Alison nods as she comes to a standstill, next to the woman on the trail.</p>\n<p>\"He didn't turn you away, did he?\"</p>\n<p>Alison pauses and winces slightly as she comes up with a response, which Su seems to take as enough of one. Her expression darkens, and she just says: \"Come.\"</p>\n<p>\"He seemed very adamant \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you get what you needed?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not a need, I assure you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Come,\" Su says, and she's started up the path with determination. \"Come.\"</p>\n<p>Alison hesitates, but at the second beckoning she follows. She returns to the hut, and the woman opens the door with a huff. Almost immediately, words are exchanged as she enters, in a language she doesn't understand or recognize. Su gives Alison one glance and a command to wait outside before closing the door and engaging some spirited conversation with her husband.</p>\n<p>When she returns, she seems to give Alison a suspicious look.</p>\n<p>\"You want to talk to our son?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>The look doesn't go away, but then she retreats back into the home and the conversation continues, lower this time. Alison shifts her weight, clasping her hands in front of her beltline. When Su returns, she brings Mr. Cheung with her, and opens the door wide.</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>The husband begins to say something, gesturing to Alison, but Su loudly cuts him off. He unconvincingly throws his hands up, and Su returns her gaze to Alison, leaning in the doorframe.</p>\n<p>\"I want to make him an offer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh-huh. And we can't know what it is?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was hoping to have a conversation privately with him. Its contents wouldn't be private in the long run, he could tell you, but I wouldn't want you sitting in on it. I would want him to be free from parental pressures as I asked him some questions.\"</p>\n<p>She eyes Alison in a piercing, knowing way that Alison can only think of as motherly.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cheung chimes in. Su responds in English: \"They <em>saved</em> us.\"</p>\n<p>\"Supposedly.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sup\u2014?\" Alison stumbles. They both turn their attention to her. \"Sir, I\u2026\" Her eyes drop. \"I personally watched your world die. I saw the final fights of people trying to get into the bunkers. I saw the clouds go up and I saw everything\u2026 peter out.\" <em>Again, and again, and again.</em> \"There's nothing to go back to,\" she states, raising her head, a little surprised at the thread of emotion pulling in her voice.</p>\n<p>Su's expression hadn't changed, but her eyes were wet. Mr Cheung had half-turned away. Neither speak.</p>\n<p>\"Why our son?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why anyone?\" Alison asks, voice soft. Then she shakes her head. \"He caught my eye. That's all.\"</p>\n<p>\"And why won't you tell us?\"</p>\n<p>She smiles, a little sad. \"I don't want him to experience any outside pressures. I want him to be able to consider the offer, and answer my questions, completely on his own. I'm afraid that if I told you, you'd feel a need to intervene.\" After a moment, she adds: \"Not necessarily stop me, mind you.\"</p>\n<p>Su's expression remains stone, but her eyes don't dry. She looks down, at first inspecting Alison, then back to Alison's eyes, then fully down at the ground.</p>\n<p>\"You and your husband can watch from a distance, ensure I don't do anything but talk to him. Then I'll leave, and he can tell you what we discussed.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's only nine,\" she breathes more than speaks, arms crossed in front of her, eyes still on the low grass.</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>They stand that way, her in the doorframe, Mr. Cheung's back turned, Alison taking the wind.</p>\n<p>Su seems to straighten, and finally return eye contact. She half-turns, and says something to the husband. He doesn't move even as she gives him room for response. She shakes her head slightly, exits the hut, and closes the door behind her.</p>\n<p>\"Come,\" she says, and leads Alison down the path.</p>\n<p>Alison follows close behind as they make their way to the town center. The sun nears the horizon, laying low over the distant hills, leading long shadows across the plains and giving a dark undercoat to the calf-high grasses. Alisonians take note of the two of them as they pass, the crowd of them becoming thicker as they near the main road, but the Queens have become a moderately common sight. No one is as awestruck as they once were. Alison thinks, briefly, about the other New Alisons \u2014 the <em>splits</em> that occur every moment, according to Cobra. How many New Alisons have the experience of expecting the Queens' return, only to find they've been completely abandoned? <em>More than can be counted,</em> Cobra's voice rings in here mind. These New Alisonians don't know that they are living the myth that other New Alisons will chronicle for generations to come. It is, and always will be, commonplace until it all of a sudden isn't.</p>\n<p>Someone says Su's name as they pass in a tone of concern, and Su slows down only long enough to give them a look Alison can't see. Whatever the expression, it strikes the man silent and grim. Su turns back to the path and they move on.</p>\n<p>Alison sees down the streets they pass the closing town plaza, where vendors are packing their wares and heading home, but they travel parallel to that hub, to find themselves at a school.</p>\n<p>They'd honored the school by making it out of wood, and it was of a conspicuously modern construction compared to the state of the reed-and-mud buildings around it. The building doubles as a church, Alison knows, though if she didn't she could have deduced it from the symbols adorning the windows and the pews placed within.</p>\n<p>Su seems to hesitate at the front door as two little girls step out, giggling at the tail end of some conversation before looking and noticing Alison, and gasping in that unabashed way that children can express anything. One of them breathes, \"a Queen,\" and they each take steps back, giving them some berth. Alison flashes a slight, sad smile, and they return only half-agape mouths and unfaltering stares.</p>\n<p>Su moves past them, and Alison follows.</p>\n<p>It's dark inside, save for some hanging rectangles the west windows plaster onto the east wall, which happens to be the far wall from the door \u2014 the design may be intentional, so that the big window behind the priest would be bringing in the sun during the morning, backlighting the clergy and giving diffuse glory to the space.</p>\n<p>Adam was easy to make out. For one, he was just about the only person left in the building, save for an adult that was too busy putting desks away in a closet in preparation for the weekend and Sunday service to notice or care about Su's entrance. He was by the front, at one of the last desks to be left out, with a book and a lantern to read by. He looks up with little interest until he recognizes Su's figure.</p>\n<p>\"Mama!\"</p>\n<p>Her pace slows, and she and Alison walk closer with a calm, intentional stride.</p>\n<p>\"I was almost done, I was going to give the book back to Mrs. Smithy, I wasn't going to stay out past dark \u2014 and I was going to come home and help make dinner like I promise, I \u2014\"</p>\n<p>Su responds to him in another tongue, voice terse for one sentence, before she pauses, collects herself, and speaks at a level volume \u2014 monotone, even, like allowing any emotion would infringe upon the control of her words.</p>\n<p>Adam seems lost for a moment, before he places Alison, standing relatively in the dark, behind his mom. He seems to lose all expression and go entirely still.</p>\n<p>Su finishes speaking, but he doesn't react. She asks something, and he returns his eyes to her, responds with something short. She says more, and his eyes flick between her and Alison, more confusion entering his expression. At some prompt from her, he stands up, nods, and goes to give the book to Mrs. Smithy.</p>\n<p>Su looks anxious as she waits. Mrs. Smithy and Adam have a brief exchange, before Smithy shoos him off and he returns.</p>\n<p>When he does, Adam seems to ask Su something, and in turn, Su looks to Alison.</p>\n<p>\"Where?\" she breathes.</p>\n<p>They make their way out to a lone, gnarled tree to the east of town, nearing the shore. Once they reach it, Su speaks some words, quiet, to Adam. He doesn't respond. She asks him something, and he takes a moment before giving a quick answer, his eyes often lingering on Alison. Alison waits.</p>\n<p>Su kneels, and gives Adam a hug. He says something, but she doesn't respond. When she stands, she shoos him and Alison.</p>\n<p>\"I'll be here,\" Su says, \"go.\"</p>\n<p>\"We'll stay in eyesight,\" Alison reassures.</p>\n<p>\"Go,\" Su repeats.</p>\n<p>So they do. Alison takes the lead, and Adam hesitantly follows. She slows down, so that he falls in step next to her.</p>\n<p>He's big for his age, wide, with a chin that promises to become something strong and jutting in his later years. His trimmed black hair bobs a little as he walks. His eyes look at her, but avoid eye contact, and he's quick to find some other object of his attention whenever she looks directly at him.</p>\n<p>\"What are you feeling?\" she ventures.</p>\n<p>\"Um.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's okay. I won't get offended.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses. \"Scared.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. What of?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't hurt you. We're just going to have a talk, and then I'll hand you back to your mom.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is this something you like doing? Going on walks?\"</p>\n<p>\"I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Reading books?\"</p>\n<p>He pauses. \"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like books, too. I read a lot when I was younger. It was easier to get books back then. I'm sure you know how that feels.\"</p>\n<p>He doesn't reply. The sun has begun to set over the hills, and crickets in the grasses have begun to sing.</p>\n<p>\"Do you like it here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"In New Alison.\"</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \"It's okay.\"</p>\n<p>She smiles, eyes downcast. \"I'm sure it is. Is it just?\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just okay.\"</p>\n<p>He shrugs.</p>\n<p>\"Missing home?\" she tries.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\" he pauses. His head seems to catch up to his thoughts before his mouth does: he starts nodding, and then says, \"yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"We Queens, we can travel to all kinds of places. That's how we saved you, to bring you here.\"</p>\n<p>He nods. \"Mom says so.\"</p>\n<p><em>Dad, not so much,</em> Alison finishes the other half of his thought.</p>\n<p>\"We're very careful about who we bring in, so that we know that our technology is ending up in the right hands. There are a lot of people who could do a lot of vicious things with our ways of travel. But we're always recruiting.\"</p>\n<p>He looks up at her, eyes a bit wide.</p>\n<p>\"What do you see yourself doing when you grow up?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I don't know.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's hard to know. Especially hard, now.\"</p>\n<p>He only nods.</p>\n<p>\"Being a builder, a fisher. A teacher. An engineer, a leader, a warrior. A hunter. A farmer, an explorer. A doctor. A priest. All these and more are paths open to you. They're <em>vital,</em> they keep everyone happy and together. They make the bright days brighter, the dark days manageable. They keep everyone safe and warm and fed. Do you see yourself as any of those?\"</p>\n<p>He shrugs. She lets him sit with it, as they keep walking in a lazy circle around the tree, Su sitting on its roots and looking out, sometimes at them, often just past them, at the ocean.</p>\n<p>\"An explorer?\" she tries.</p>\n<p>He shrugs again, but he looks around as he does it.</p>\n<p>\"A hero?\"</p>\n<p>He looks up at her, eyes bright.</p>\n<p>\"It doesn't look like it does in books, does it?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he says, quick. \"Everything's hard now.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>\"The solstice sucked. We didn't have pie.\"</p>\n<p>Alison grins, privately, about the world of children. \"I know.\"</p>\n<p>\"And, people are saying, that's how it's going to be from now on.\"</p>\n<p>\"The feasts will get bigger, but yes, it will.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not fair.\" His voice trembled.</p>\n<p>\"No. It's not.\"</p>\n<p>\"You say it like how mama says it.\"</p>\n<p>Alison chuckles, and Adam looks hurt. She gives him a sympathetic look in compensation. \"I'm sure I do.\"</p>\n<p>She lets the conversation go silent for a moment. Adam kicks the air occasionally as they walk.</p>\n<p>\"What if I told you that could change?\"</p>\n<p>He looks up again.</p>\n<p>\"You're unsatisfied here.\"</p>\n<p>He nods.</p>\n<p>\"How would you like to be a Queen?\"</p>\n<p>His eyes widen, and he nearly stops walking, then trotting to make up ground he lost as he froze. \"Me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mhmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does that mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"It would mean leaving. It would mean exploring worlds just like the ones you read about, it would mean seeing cities and towns just like the ones you grew up in. Visiting old Alison.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course!\"</p>\n<p>\"If you could, what would you do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd \u2014 I'd go to space, and I'd shoot lasers and kick evil's teeth in, and \u2014\"</p>\n<p>She laughs. He quickly shuts up.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she assures, \"I wasn't laughing at you. That's exactly the kind of thing us Queens do.\"</p>\n<p>He gives the same look he's given twice already, looking up, bright eyes, bushy, swishing tail. \"Really?\"</p>\n<p>\"Really.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why me?\"</p>\n<p><em>Because you don't fit in. Now that I've talked to your dad, maybe I know why, but you're not adjusting.</em></p>\n<p>\"Because you want something that New Alison isn't giving you.\"</p>\n<p>He looks down. When he looks up again, he seems confused. \"Why not Dad?\"</p>\n<p><em>So perceptive.</em> \"Because people rely on your dad.\"</p>\n<p>There was a long pause.</p>\n<p>\"Could I\u2026 bring my parents?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n<p>\"You could come back and visit, but I warn you. It won't be the same.\"</p>\n<p>\"How?\"</p>\n<p>\"You'll be different. They will be different. You will see them differently. They won't mean as much to you \u2014 or they'll mean much, much more, and all the more that they mean, you won't get to have.\"</p>\n<p>She let him sit with that. He kicked the air a few times.</p>\n<p>\"What would happen? If I said yes?\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I'd leave, and the Queens would come back in a decade, and ask you again.\"</p>\n<p>\"A decade!?\"</p>\n<p>She nods.</p>\n<p>\"But \u2014\" words seem to fail him. His face scrunches up, in that way that only children's faces can \u2014 all muscles and features pulled in to the center by fractions.</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>\"No you don't! Why ask?\"</p>\n<p><em>So that you know there is rescue coming.</em> \"To give you a goal.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not fair!\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not. But being a good Queen requires certain things. Dissatisfaction is one of them.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hate you!\"</p>\n<p>\"I expected you would.\"</p>\n<p>\"Our hut is trash. It was so cold in winter. It's too hot in summer. The food is bland. There's nothing to <em>do.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Mhmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't used to care about being dirty and now I do. I'm always dirty. There's so many bugs. I got sick a month ago and they didn't have pills to give me. I can't go anywhere. The best thing to do is read.\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand a lot of those feelings.\"</p>\n<p>\"No you <em>don't!</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"I <em>do.</em> Because, Adam, <em>that</em> is where Queens <em>come</em> from.\"</p>\n<p>He sniffles. She pulls out her handkerchief and hands it to him. He takes it and blows his nose. He moves to hand it back, and she motions for him to keep it. He stuffs it in his pocket.</p>\n<p>\"My pants got a hole in them and I still wear them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you fix them?\"</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \"Then I'd have no pants to wear.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sounds like you need more pants.\"</p>\n<p>\"Used to just get new pants.\"</p>\n<p>He sniffles again.</p>\n<p>\"Why? Why do I have to wait?\"</p>\n<p><em>That's what I was looking for.</em> \"Because to be a hero, you have to know what you're fighting for.\"</p>\n<p>\"To save people,\" he says, as if annoyed at the implication he doesn't know.</p>\n<p>\"You have to <em>know</em> the people.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"If you don't, why are you saving them?\"</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \"That's what the good guy does.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then let me put it a different way. You have to learn what <em>good</em> is, before you can <em>do</em> good. So before you become a hero of the multiverse, you have to be a little hero. Here.\"</p>\n<p>His face scrunches up. Less in anger, this time. \"Why here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why anywhere?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not fair.\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\" Alison sighs. \"It really isn't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then, what? Do I train? Do I fight bad guys?\"</p>\n<p>\"You do what you can. You help. When we come back, to talk to you, we want to know what you've been doing. I want you to leave here knowing what you'd be saving, if you saved it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom. Dad. My friends.\"</p>\n<p>\"More than just them.\"</p>\n<p>\"The\u2026 people who live here?\"</p>\n<p>Alison shakes her head, and her smile shows teeth. \"More than them.\"</p>\n<p>He frowns.</p>\n<p>\"You don't have to know what I mean just yet. That's your task. To learn. To <em>be</em> here. To know what it truly means to leave.\"</p>\n<p>He just keeps frowning.</p>\n<p>\"Why me?\" he asks, again.</p>\n<p>She shrugs. \"Why <em>me</em>?\"</p>\n<p>He looks up at her. She smiles. \"Is that a yes?\"</p>\n<p>He looks out towards the hills, where the sun's peak just barely reaches over the grass.</p>\n<p>He nods.</p>\n<p>She nods with him. \"Good. Walk with me a little longer. We'll make a full circuit, and then we'll bring you back to your mom.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>And so they do, lazily spiraling inwards towards the tree, until Alison hangs back, and Adam keeps walking, reaching Su, who brings him close, into a tight, fierce hug.</p>\n<p>\"She said I could be a Queen,\" Adam says, soft.</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Su speaks through tears.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>* * * * *</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-indent: 3em\">\n<p>Cobra turns in her chair as Alison passes through the lab doors.</p>\n<p>She finishes her sip of coffee before greeting. \"Hey! Where's Bea?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not <em>Bea's.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Cobra's non-coffee-holding hand goes up. \"I didn't mean to \u2014 sorry, it's just that you're a pair. Er, she's always around you, you know, I expected you'd be visiting together.\"</p>\n<p>Alison nods, but gives Cobra no more. The latter rubs her fingers together.</p>\n<p>\"Thought of a name?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm? Oh. Honestly, I haven't been thinking about it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Go long enough like that and people will give you one for you. We try to be nice, but there are some bad actors, and you know, if the name sticks, it sticks.\"</p>\n<p>\"I get it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry,\" Alison shakes her head, \"tense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mm. Fair.\"</p>\n<p>To Cobra's left is a booth, a sleek green exterior with a little door. The door is open, and inside a phone is visible. A mess of wires sprout out the back of the contraption, most of which lead to Cobra's computer console, which she is currently leaning on with the same elbow as the hand holding her coffee. Golden morning light streams through the tall windows of the beat-up concrete building, some of which are empty of glass.</p>\n<p>\"Is it ready?\"</p>\n<p>Cobra gestures. \"At your command.\"</p>\n<p>Alison breathes, heavy.</p>\n<p>\"You good?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine, thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Want coffee?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I'm good. Maybe water, though.\"</p>\n<p>Cobra kicks open a cooler to her left, then leans down and pulls out a water bottle. Alison holds out a hand, Cobra tosses it, Alison catches. She undoes the cap, and swigs cold water. She enjoys the little bits that escape and roll down her chin, onto her chest.</p>\n<p>She sighs as she puts the water down and wipes her lips.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem. You doing alright?\"</p>\n<p>Alison shrugs. \"I'm doing <em>alright.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Wanna try another time?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. This is supposed to help.\"</p>\n<p>Cobra nods, sipping her coffee.</p>\n<p>Alison breathes deep several times.</p>\n<p>\"So, are you <em>avoiding</em> Bea?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't I just have come myself? Why are you so caught up on Bea?\"</p>\n<p>Cobra puts a hand up again. \"No, this time I'm just wondering, is this a secret from her? Not that that's wrong, or anything, I just wanna know if I can bring it up, if this is important and personal or \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"It's fine, I don't really care.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Sorry, that's the last I'll bring up Bea.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks. Sorry myself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pshaw.\"</p>\n<p>Alison redoes her several deep, centering breaths, hoping this time that Cobra won't find a reason to speak up and interrupt. She doesn't. That done, Alison moves towards the booth, and steps inside.</p>\n<p>She picks up the phone, and reaches for the numpad, only to find it missing. She looks low for any buttons she may be missing \u2014</p>\n<p>\"Oh it dials as soon as you pick up, it's already all plugged in, it should be ringing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Hello?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Alison fumbles to stand and get the receiver to her mouth, the speaker to her ear.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Hello?</em>\" the voice repeats.</p>\n<p>\"Hello \u2014 hi.\" She wonders if she should affect her voice, change it from her usual \u2014 does it matter?</p>\n<p>\"Who is this?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm \u2014 I'm paranoid, I don't want to say. Are you\u2026 Alison?\"</p>\n<p>A pause from the other end. \"I am.\"</p>\n<p>Alison fiddles with the telephone wire, and anxiously crosses one leg over the other. \"I was referred to you. By, ah, I never caught his name. Auburn hair, shoulder length.\" <em>Put it together,</em> Alison wills.</p>\n<p>\"Paul?\"</p>\n<p><em>Yes perfect.</em> \"As I said, I never caught his name. He looks like he could have been a Paul.\" It isn't hard to sell the awkward, anxious chuckle.</p>\n<p>\"A new recruit, then!\"</p>\n<p>\"Ahh,\" she breathes through her teeth. \"I\u2026 that's the thing. I don't\u2026\"</p>\n<p>She lets the silence speak for her.</p>\n<p>\"On the fence?\"</p>\n<p>She nods, even if it's only for herself. \"Yes, I\u2026 I was told you would be good to talk to.\"</p>\n<p>There's a silence on the other end of the line, which Alison smiles at. She can imagine the surprise, the flattering. The composing herself, and then: \"What do you want to know?\"</p>\n<p>\"What made you start.\"</p>\n<p>There's a sigh, and a slight huff of a cut-short chuckle. \"That's a big question.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is it?\"</p>\n<p>A consideration. \"If you know it's not, do you really need to hear it?\"</p>\n<p>Alison considers herself. \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"I think\u2026 it's all so many little things. It was seeing the unreported dead on my street. It was\u2026 the lines of stress on mom's face. It's still the people begging for food. It's that we have to wear a mask just to step outside.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's life.\"</p>\n<p>\"It <em>is,</em> but\u2026 it was realizing that nothing good was going to happen, if I didn't do it myself. It was grabbing hold of the controls, because I have bandwidth to grab hold of the controls. It's doing those things that could be done that aren't, because no one dedicates themselves to doing them. And not everyone can, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Any way you can.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes \u2014 yes! Exactly.\"</p>\n<p>\"But\u2026\" she searched for the words.</p>\n<p>\"But?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you putting yourself in the line of fire?\"</p>\n<p>A pause. \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"What lets you do that? How \u2014 how can you make that decision?\"</p>\n<p>\"Life is dangerous already. I realized, at some point, that staying still was just as risky. Doing nothing risks prices rising on you all of a sudden, not being able to make rent, getting evicted, losing food, losing sleep, equipment failing on you suddenly in the street. Nothing is safe. The safest things to do are to lay in wait and let the bad things happen <em>to</em> you, when they find you. This way, rising above the crowd and making myself a target\u2026 I'm meeting those same things on my terms, I'm being proactive. I would rather meet my fate with a straight back than have it find me asleep, defenseless. And what this looks like to everyone is different \u2014 sometimes you are too stuck, too dependent, to move. I'm lucky to not have a family to look out for, I'm lucky to have a job that pays what it does. Any way you can.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any way you can,\" Alison repeats.</p>\n<p>She shifts her feet. She knew all of this already, but it's good to hear. Gets her thoughts straight, centers her.</p>\n<p>\"What if\u2026\" she starts. \"What if you don't make a difference? What if you <em>can't</em>?\"</p>\n<p>\"If you can't, you don't. If you just don't, then you can rest knowing you tried. That was you standing up to meet fate.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, what if\u2026\"</p>\n<p>She struggles. <em>Will this make sense?</em></p>\n<p>\"I have a question, a strange question, but\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Shoot.\"</p>\n<p>\"What if\u2026 you don't <em>have</em> to?\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"What will you do, if\u2026 if it all goes right?\"</p>\n<p>The other Alison laughs. \"Then we celebrate!\"</p>\n<p>\"And after that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ha, hmm\u2026 well, we'll always need <em>something.</em> I figure I'll find out what that thing is, and go there.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you ever rest? Say that it's over, you're done?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\" Pause. \"It's hard to picture. I suppose that if I \u2014 once I got old enough, I'd let people help me for the last little while, having helped more than the help I'd be asking for. But as I said, it's hard to picture.\"</p>\n<p>Alison sighs.</p>\n<p>\"Does that answer your question?\"</p>\n<p>\"What if\u2026\"</p>\n<p>She hesitates. In the silence, the other Alison laughs. \"You do a lot of hypotheticals. What's really eating at you?\"</p>\n<p>\"What if,\" she powers through, \"you could escape, instead.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm? Escape?\"</p>\n<p>\"Say that you're sure nothing you do will change anything, and you have the opportunity to make everything alright, if only for yourself. What would\u2026 what would you do?\"</p>\n<p>Alison turns in the booth until the wire partially wraps around herself, looking up at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\"That's an interesting question. I\u2026 escape to where?\"</p>\n<p>\"Somewhere beyond the city.\"</p>\n<p>Consideration. \"Are there people there?\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's say there are. And it's easy, and clean, the people live longer and they have more control over their lives, what they do, what they eat. But if you go, you can't come back.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a big question.\"</p>\n<p>Alison lets the question hang.</p>\n<p>\"If I could take people with me \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's say you can't. If you leave, you leave it all, exactly as it is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then no.\"</p>\n<p>Alison's heartrate quickens. \"No?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I would.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why\u2026 why not, exactly?\"</p>\n<p>\"I believe in what I do here. I believe in helping people.\"</p>\n<p>\"There will be people there, to help.\"</p>\n<p>\"But it sounds like they won't need <em>as</em> much help, will they?\"</p>\n<p>Alison wonders. \"Then let's say there's somewhere worse, and you can go there and help those people.\"</p>\n<p>The other Alison laughs again. \"Worse than here!\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean it.\"</p>\n<p>Something in her tone erases the warmth of the other Alison's response. \"Hmm\u2026 I\u2026 no, I would stay here, I think.\"</p>\n<p>\"You would?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not sure. But\u2026 there are people here who need help. Other people also needing help won't change that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wouldn't it? If others were dying of starvation and you had food to offer \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Then if they came, I'd offer it. But I'm very sure I'd stay.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because I know these people. I know their problems. I know how to help them. They have a need, and I know I can answer it. And I don't believe in a world where that will ever truly stop. I think they'll need my help for as long as I can give it, just like I'll need theirs. And if I left, well\u2026 I'm taking all the help they gave me and I'm taking it away, aren't I? I have an obligation to be here. No, I'm really certain. I don't think there's anything that could make me leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not paradise?\" Alison surprises herself with the faint crack on the word.</p>\n<p>\"What's 'paradise'?\"</p>\n<p>It's her own turn to laugh. It comes out strange with her throat closed up. \"Nevermind,\" she clears her throat, \"nevermind about that. Thank you. I\u2026 I think I understand something better now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank <em>you.</em> I hadn't ever thought of that. It's\u2026 strengthening, to put to words exactly how I feel.\"</p>\n<p>Alison flushes, and chuckles. \"Yeah. Yeah, it is. Um\u2026 thank you. Again.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did that answer your questions?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it did.\"</p>\n<p>\"Glad to have helped.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any way you can.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any way I can.\"</p>\n<p>\"Be seeing you, maybe.\"</p>\n<p>She hangs up, regretting the statement and unable to face a response.</p>\n<p>Alison composes herself, and steps outside the booth.</p>\n<p>Cobra, at her terminal, is holding a headphone up to her ear. She quickly puts it down as Alison turns her attention Cobra's way, leaning back in her chair and throwing her eyebrows up, belatedly giving a little grin.</p>\n<p>\"It's alright. As I said, it wasn't private.\"</p>\n<p>\"I figured.\" Cobra gave her chair a lazy spin. \"So\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Alison takes a deep breath. \"So?\"</p>\n<p>Cobra's chair slowly turns to let her face Alison again, and she gives a quizzical look. \"Will we be seeing you? Again?\"</p>\n<p>Alison shrugs. \"I'm not sure. I guess you would have to come and visit me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn,\" Cobra mutters. \"But, you know, and don't tell Bea \u2014 ah I said I wouldn't bring Bea up again \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"It's alright.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2014 but I did think you were kind of an odd fit. Happy to have you around, of course. Just, y'know.\"</p>\n<div id=\"u-blink-bar\">\n<p>Alison sighs, again. \"Trust me, Cobes.

She turns her head and looks out of the corner of her eye: some shy away or turned their heads.\n\n\n\nA lot of time has passed in New Alison, in comparison to where Bea and Alison sleep. At least one full cycle of the seasons, though the state of things might suggest even several more years. Infrastructure had been erected at impressive speeds. It is a wonder what can be established given ideal circumstances, time to prepare, and the occasional outside aid from a Queen. The settlement of New Alison has gone through its first winter handily, and while they are yet to be entirely self-sufficient, they are moving easily towards that conclusion.\n\n\n\nSo the door Alison knocks on, a second time, is of solid construction, wooden though its housing isn't -- the plains are largely devoid of trees, the nearest forest a substantial journey to the east. The rest of the structure is made of mud, and it lacks some finesse that the door has, probably due to an unfamiliarity with the material by the artisans. They will have to learn mud in the coming generations, and become a people of the earth. Until then, there will be growing pangs, or their opposite -- a hollow, aching lack as people who used to be so big learn humility.\n\n\n\nThe door is pulled open by a man of man's world. He has washed dirt from skin, kept facial hair short, and most brow-raising of all is his button-up shirt and dress pants fit for an office, donned over bare, calloused feet. Alison can't help but grin, but she clouds the derisive expression with a polite smile of greeting.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Cheung?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm him.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm -- a Black Queen. You can call me Chao.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\nNo warmth in his tone, nor his expression. Alison changes her face to match, all business.\n\n\n\n\"I'm here hoping to speak with your son?\"\n\n\n\n\"My son? Andrew?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"He's caught our particular interest. I am hoping to make him an offer. The conversation's contents won't be private, but I want him to hear them first.\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\nAlison flinches. She knows she isn't holding her composure to the highest standard, but she had expected more cooperation and yield than this. More open gratitude from the people she had saved. Momentarily at a loss for words, underneath the unfaltering stare of Mr. Cheung, she cocks her head.\n\n\n\n\"Is that everything?\" he asks.\n\n\n\n\"May I ask your hesitation?\"\n\n\n\n\"There is no hesitation. The answer is no, I won't have you speaking to my son. Anything you want to say to him, you can say to me.\"\n\n\n\nShe searches her mind, attempting to change the script to accommodate for this unforeseen resistance, when the man follows up:\n\n\n\n\"//You're// hesitating. I won't let you come up with some way to fool me. Go find some family more gullible. Good day.\"\n\n\n\nHe attempts to slam the door, but it slides against the floor, and he visibly reddens with the exertion necessary to quickly close it.\n\n\n\nShe stands there, stunned, while wind whips her hair and bare calves. Her heart feels tight in her chest, and her brow has furrowed deeply. She has to shake herself out of her trance. When she turns around and looks down the path and down the hill, she sees little figures turned her way. They avert their gaze and keep walking, making like they had no intentions but to get home. She shakes her head, and begins to walk back down the path, into the heart of the settlement. As she makes her way down the hill, a woman, coming the other way, seems to move hurriedly to meet her.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" the woman calls, still some distance down the path.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" Alison cries back, mimicking the curious tone.\n\n\n\nShe says something back, but Alison can't make it out, unable to tell whether she heard it correctly or not.\n\n\n\nInstead she asks: \"Sorry?\"\n\n\n\nAs the woman nears, her voice lowers. She carries a basket full of fruit and grain, and her body looks more used to the new accommodations than Mr. Cheung's -- a deeper brown both from tan and dirt, hands rough with work, clothing made of denser, more durable materials, just as worn as she is.\n\n\n\n\"Were you just talking with my husband?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mrs. Cheung?\"\n\n\n\n\"Call me Su. And you... you're one of the Queens.\"\n\n\n\nAlison nods as she comes to a standstill, next to the woman on the trail.\n\n\n\n\"He didn't turn you away, did he?\"\n\n\n\nAlison pauses and winces slightly as she comes up with a response, which Su seems to take as enough of one. Her expression darkens, and she just says: \"Come.\"\n\n\n\n\"He seemed very adamant --\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you get what you needed?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not a need, I assure you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Come,\" Su says, and she's started up the path with determination. \"Come.\"\n\n\n\nAlison hesitates, but at the second beckoning she follows. She returns to the hut, and the woman opens the door with a huff. Almost immediately, words are exchanged as she enters, in a language she doesn't understand or recognize. Su gives Alison one glance and a command to wait outside before closing the door and engaging some spirited conversation with her husband.\n\n\n\nWhen she returns, she seems to give Alison a suspicious look.\n\n\n\n\"You want to talk to our son?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nThe look doesn't go away, but then she retreats back into the home and the conversation continues, lower this time. Alison shifts her weight, clasping her hands in front of her beltline. When Su returns, she brings Mr. Cheung with her, and opens the door wide.\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\nThe husband begins to say something, gesturing to Alison, but Su loudly cuts him off. He unconvincingly throws his hands up, and Su returns her gaze to Alison, leaning in the doorframe.\n\n\n\n\"I want to make him an offer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh-huh. And we can't know what it is?\"\n\n\n\n\"I was hoping to have a conversation privately with him. Its contents wouldn't be private in the long run, he could tell you, but I wouldn't want you sitting in on it. I would want him to be free from parental pressures as I asked him some questions.\"\n\n\n\nShe eyes Alison in a piercing, knowing way that Alison can only think of as motherly.\n\n\n\nMr. Cheung chimes in. Su responds in English: \"They //saved// us.\"\n\n\n\n\"Supposedly.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sup--?\" Alison stumbles. They both turn their attention to her. \"Sir, I...\" Her eyes drop. \"I personally watched your world die. I saw the final fights of people trying to get into the bunkers. I saw the clouds go up and I saw everything... peter out.\" //Again, and again, and again.// \"There's nothing to go back to,\" she states, raising her head, a little surprised at the thread of emotion pulling in her voice.\n\n\n\nSu's expression hadn't changed, but her eyes were wet. Mr Cheung had half-turned away. Neither speak.\n\n\n\n\"Why our son?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why anyone?\" Alison asks, voice soft. Then she shakes her head. \"He caught my eye. That's all.\"\n\n\n\n\"And why won't you tell us?\"\n\n\n\nShe smiles, a little sad. \"I don't want him to experience any outside pressures. I want him to be able to consider the offer, and answer my questions, completely on his own. I'm afraid that if I told you, you'd feel a need to intervene.\" After a moment, she adds: \"Not necessarily stop me, mind you.\"\n\n\n\nSu's expression remains stone, but her eyes don't dry. She looks down, at first inspecting Alison, then back to Alison's eyes, then fully down at the ground.\n\n\n\n\"You and your husband can watch from a distance, ensure I don't do anything but talk to him. Then I'll leave, and he can tell you what we discussed.\"\n\n\n\n\"He's only nine,\" she breathes more than speaks, arms crossed in front of her, eyes still on the low grass.\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\nThey stand that way, her in the doorframe, Mr. Cheung's back turned, Alison taking the wind.\n\n\n\nSu seems to straighten, and finally return eye contact. She half-turns, and says something to the husband. He doesn't move even as she gives him room for response. She shakes her head slightly, exits the hut, and closes the door behind her.\n\n\n\n\"Come,\" she says, and leads Alison down the path.\n\n\n\nAlison follows close behind as they make their way to the town center. The sun nears the horizon, laying low over the distant hills, leading long shadows across the plains and giving a dark undercoat to the calf-high grasses. Alisonians take note of the two of them as they pass, the crowd of them becoming thicker as they near the main road, but the Queens have become a moderately common sight. No one is as awestruck as they once were. Alison thinks, briefly, about the other New Alisons -- the //splits// that occur every moment, according to Cobra. How many New Alisons have the experience of expecting the Queens' return, only to find they've been completely abandoned? //More than can be counted,// Cobra's voice rings in here mind. These New Alisonians don't know that they are living the myth that other New Alisons will chronicle for generations to come. It is, and always will be, commonplace until it all of a sudden isn't.\n\n\n\nSomeone says Su's name as they pass in a tone of concern, and Su slows down only long enough to give them a look Alison can't see. Whatever the expression, it strikes the man silent and grim. Su turns back to the path and they move on.\n\n\n\nAlison sees down the streets they pass the closing town plaza, where vendors are packing their wares and heading home, but they travel parallel to that hub, to find themselves at a school.\n\n\n\nThey'd honored the school by making it out of wood, and it was of a conspicuously modern construction compared to the state of the reed-and-mud buildings around it. The building doubles as a church, Alison knows, though if she didn't she could have deduced it from the symbols adorning the windows and the pews placed within.\n\n\n\nSu seems to hesitate at the front door as two little girls step out, giggling at the tail end of some conversation before looking and noticing Alison, and gasping in that unabashed way that children can express anything. One of them breathes, \"a Queen,\" and they each take steps back, giving them some berth. Alison flashes a slight, sad smile, and they return only half-agape mouths and unfaltering stares.\n\n\n\nSu moves past them, and Alison follows.\n\n\n\nIt's dark inside, save for some hanging rectangles the west windows plaster onto the east wall, which happens to be the far wall from the door -- the design may be intentional, so that the big window behind the priest would be bringing in the sun during the morning, backlighting the clergy and giving diffuse glory to the space.\n\n\n\nAdam was easy to make out. For one, he was just about the only person left in the building, save for an adult that was too busy putting desks away in a closet in preparation for the weekend and Sunday service to notice or care about Su's entrance. He was by the front, at one of the last desks to be left out, with a book and a lantern to read by. He looks up with little interest until he recognizes Su's figure.\n\n\n\n\"Mama!\"\n\n\n\nHer pace slows, and she and Alison walk closer with a calm, intentional stride.\n\n\n\n\"I was almost done, I was going to give the book back to Mrs. Smithy, I wasn't going to stay out past dark -- and I was going to come home and help make dinner like I promise, I --\"\n\n\n\nSu responds to him in another tongue, voice terse for one sentence, before she pauses, collects herself, and speaks at a level volume -- monotone, even, like allowing any emotion would infringe upon the control of her words.\n\n\n\nAdam seems lost for a moment, before he places Alison, standing relatively in the dark, behind his mom. He seems to lose all expression and go entirely still.\n\n\n\nSu finishes speaking, but he doesn't react. She asks something, and he returns his eyes to her, responds with something short. She says more, and his eyes flick between her and Alison, more confusion entering his expression. At some prompt from her, he stands up, nods, and goes to give the book to Mrs. Smithy.\n\n\n\nSu looks anxious as she waits. Mrs. Smithy and Adam have a brief exchange, before Smithy shoos him off and he returns.\n\n\n\nWhen he does, Adam seems to ask Su something, and in turn, Su looks to Alison.\n\n\n\n\"Where?\" she breathes.\n\n\n\nThey make their way out to a lone, gnarled tree to the east of town, nearing the shore. Once they reach it, Su speaks some words, quiet, to Adam. He doesn't respond. She asks him something, and he takes a moment before giving a quick answer, his eyes often lingering on Alison. Alison waits.\n\n\n\nSu kneels, and gives Adam a hug. He says something, but she doesn't respond. When she stands, she shoos him and Alison.\n\n\n\n\"I'll be here,\" Su says, \"go.\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll stay in eyesight,\" Alison reassures.\n\n\n\n\"Go,\" Su repeats.\n\n\n\nSo they do. Alison takes the lead, and Adam hesitantly follows. She slows down, so that he falls in step next to her.\n\n\n\nHe's big for his age, wide, with a chin that promises to become something strong and jutting in his later years. His trimmed black hair bobs a little as he walks. His eyes look at her, but avoid eye contact, and he's quick to find some other object of his attention whenever she looks directly at him.\n\n\n\n\"What are you feeling?\" she ventures.\n\n\n\n\"Um.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's okay. I won't get offended.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Scared.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay. What of?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\"I won't hurt you. We're just going to have a talk, and then I'll hand you back to your mom.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is this something you like doing? Going on walks?\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Reading books?\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\"I like books, too. I read a lot when I was younger. It was easier to get books back then. I'm sure you know how that feels.\"\n\n\n\nHe doesn't reply. The sun has begun to set over the hills, and crickets in the grasses have begun to sing.\n\n\n\n\"Do you like it here?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"In New Alison.\"\n\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"It's okay.\"\n\n\n\nShe smiles, eyes downcast. \"I'm sure it is. Is it just?\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Just okay.\"\n\n\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\n\n\"Missing home?\" she tries.\n\n\n\n\"I...\" he pauses. His head seems to catch up to his thoughts before his mouth does: he starts nodding, and then says, \"yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"We Queens, we can travel to all kinds of places. That's how we saved you, to bring you here.\"\n\n\n\nHe nods. \"Mom says so.\"\n\n\n\n//Dad, not so much,// Alison finishes the other half of his thought.\n\n\n\n\"We're very careful about who we bring in, so that we know that our technology is ending up in the right hands. There are a lot of people who could do a lot of vicious things with our ways of travel. But we're always recruiting.\"\n\n\n\nHe looks up at her, eyes a bit wide.\n\n\n\n\"What do you see yourself doing when you grow up?\"\n\n\n\n\"I... I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's hard to know. Especially hard, now.\"\n\n\n\nHe only nods.\n\n\n\n\"Being a builder, a fisher. A teacher. An engineer, a leader, a warrior. A hunter. A farmer, an explorer. A doctor. A priest. All these and more are paths open to you. They're //vital,// they keep everyone happy and together. They make the bright days brighter, the dark days manageable. They keep everyone safe and warm and fed. Do you see yourself as any of those?\"\n\n\n\nHe shrugs. She lets him sit with it, as they keep walking in a lazy circle around the tree, Su sitting on its roots and looking out, sometimes at them, often just past them, at the ocean.\n\n\n\n\"An explorer?\" she tries.\n\n\n\nHe shrugs again, but he looks around as he does it.\n\n\n\n\"A hero?\"\n\n\n\nHe looks up at her, eyes bright.\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't look like it does in books, does it?\"\n\n\n\n\"No,\" he says, quick. \"Everything's hard now.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\n\"The solstice sucked. We didn't have pie.\"\n\n\n\nAlison grins, privately, about the world of children. \"I know.\"\n\n\n\n\"And, people are saying, that's how it's going to be from now on.\"\n\n\n\n\"The feasts will get bigger, but yes, it will.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not fair.\" His voice trembled.\n\n\n\n\"No. It's not.\"\n\n\n\n\"You say it like how mama says it.\"\n\n\n\nAlison chuckles, and Adam looks hurt. She gives him a sympathetic look in compensation. \"I'm sure I do.\"\n\n\n\nShe lets the conversation go silent for a moment. Adam kicks the air occasionally as they walk.\n\n\n\n\"What if I told you that could change?\"\n\n\n\nHe looks up again.\n\n\n\n\"You're unsatisfied here.\"\n\n\n\nHe nods.\n\n\n\n\"How would you like to be a Queen?\"\n\n\n\nHis eyes widen, and he nearly stops walking, then trotting to make up ground he lost as he froze. \"Me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mhmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"It would mean leaving. It would mean exploring worlds just like the ones you read about, it would mean seeing cities and towns just like the ones you grew up in. Visiting old Alison.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\n\n\n\"If you could, what would you do?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'd -- I'd go to space, and I'd shoot lasers and kick evil's teeth in, and --\"\n\n\n\nShe laughs. He quickly shuts up.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" she assures, \"I wasn't laughing at you. That's exactly the kind of thing us Queens do.\"\n\n\n\nHe gives the same look he's given twice already, looking up, bright eyes, bushy, swishing tail. \"Really?\"\n\n\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why me?\"\n\n\n\n//Because you don't fit in. Now that I've talked to your dad, maybe I know why, but you're not adjusting.//\n\n\n\n\"Because you want something that New Alison isn't giving you.\"\n\n\n\nHe looks down. When he looks up again, he seems confused. \"Why not Dad?\"\n\n\n\n//So perceptive.// \"Because people rely on your dad.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n\n\n\"Could I... bring my parents?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\n\n\"You could come back and visit, but I warn you. It won't be the same.\"\n\n\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\n\n\"You'll be different. They will be different. You will see them differently. They won't mean as much to you -- or they'll mean much, much more, and all the more that they mean, you won't get to have.\"\n\n\n\nShe let him sit with that. He kicked the air a few times.\n\n\n\n\"What would happen? If I said yes?\"\n\n\n\n\"Then I'd leave, and the Queens would come back in a decade, and ask you again.\"\n\n\n\n\"A decade!?\"\n\n\n\nShe nods.\n\n\n\n\"But --\" words seem to fail him. His face scrunches up, in that way that only children's faces can -- all muscles and features pulled in to the center by fractions.\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\n\"No you don't! Why ask?\"\n\n\n\n//So that you know there is rescue coming.// \"To give you a goal.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not fair!\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not. But being a good Queen requires certain things. Dissatisfaction is one of them.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hate you!\"\n\n\n\n\"I expected you would.\"\n\n\n\n\"Our hut is trash. It was so cold in winter. It's too hot in summer. The food is bland. There's nothing to //do.//\"\n\n\n\n\"Mhmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't used to care about being dirty and now I do. I'm always dirty. There's so many bugs. I got sick a month ago and they didn't have pills to give me. I can't go anywhere. The best thing to do is read.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand a lot of those feelings.\"\n\n\n\n\"No you //don't!//\"\n\n\n\n\"I //do.// Because, Adam, //that// is where Queens //come// from.\"\n\n\n\nHe sniffles. She pulls out her handkerchief and hands it to him. He takes it and blows his nose. He moves to hand it back, and she motions for him to keep it. He stuffs it in his pocket.\n\n\n\n\"My pants got a hole in them and I still wear them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you fix them?\"\n\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"Then I'd have no pants to wear.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sounds like you need more pants.\"\n\n\n\n\"Used to just get new pants.\"\n\n\n\nHe sniffles again.\n\n\n\n\"Why? Why do I have to wait?\"\n\n\n\n//That's what I was looking for.// \"Because to be a hero, you have to know what you're fighting for.\"\n\n\n\n\"To save people,\" he says, as if annoyed at the implication he doesn't know.\n\n\n\n\"You have to //know// the people.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"If you don't, why are you saving them?\"\n\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"That's what the good guy does.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then let me put it a different way. You have to learn what //good// is, before you can //do// good. So before you become a hero of the multiverse, you have to be a little hero. Here.\"\n\n\n\nHis face scrunches up. Less in anger, this time. \"Why here?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why anywhere?\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not fair.\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\" Alison sighs. \"It really isn't.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then, what? Do I train? Do I fight bad guys?\"\n\n\n\n\"You do what you can. You help. When we come back, to talk to you, we want to know what you've been doing. I want you to leave here knowing what you'd be saving, if you saved it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom. Dad. My friends.\"\n\n\n\n\"More than just them.\"\n\n\n\n\"The... people who live here?\"\n\n\n\nAlison shakes her head, and her smile shows teeth. \"More than them.\"\n\n\n\nHe frowns.\n\n\n\n\"You don't have to know what I mean just yet. That's your task. To learn. To //be// here. To know what it truly means to leave.\"\n\n\n\nHe just keeps frowning.\n\n\n\n\"Why me?\" he asks, again.\n\n\n\nShe shrugs. \"Why //me//?\"\n\n\n\nHe looks up at her. She smiles. \"Is that a yes?\"\n\n\n\nHe looks out towards the hills, where the sun's peak just barely reaches over the grass.\n\n\n\nHe nods.\n\n\n\nShe nods with him. \"Good. Walk with me a little longer. We'll make a full circuit, and then we'll bring you back to your mom.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\nAnd so they do, lazily spiraling inwards towards the tree, until Alison hangs back, and Adam keeps walking, reaching Su, who brings him close, into a tight, fierce hug.\n\n\n\n\"She said I could be a Queen,\" Adam says, soft.\n\n\n\n\"I know,\" Su speaks through tears.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n= *** * * * ***\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"text-indent: 3em\"]]\n\nCobra turns in her chair as Alison passes through the lab doors.\n\n\n\nShe finishes her sip of coffee before greeting. \"Hey! Where's Bea?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not //Bea's.//\"\n\n\n\nCobra's non-coffee-holding hand goes up. \"I didn't mean to -- sorry, it's just that you're a pair. Er, she's always around you, you know, I expected you'd be visiting together.\"\n\n\n\nAlison nods, but gives Cobra no more. The latter rubs her fingers together.\n\n\n\n\"Thought of a name?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm? Oh. Honestly, I haven't been thinking about it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Go long enough like that and people will give you one for you. We try to be nice, but there are some bad actors, and you know, if the name sticks, it sticks.\"\n\n\n\n\"I get it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry,\" Alison shakes her head, \"tense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mm. Fair.\"\n\n\n\nTo Cobra's left is a booth, a sleek green exterior with a little door. The door is open, and inside a phone is visible. A mess of wires sprout out the back of the contraption, most of which lead to Cobra's computer console, which she is currently leaning on with the same elbow as the hand holding her coffee. Golden morning light streams through the tall windows of the beat-up concrete building, some of which are empty of glass.\n\n\n\n\"Is it ready?\"\n\n\n\nCobra gestures. \"At your command.\"\n\n\n\nAlison breathes, heavy.\n\n\n\n\"You good?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm fine, thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Want coffee?\"\n\n\n\n\"No. I'm good. Maybe water, though.\"\n\n\n\nCobra kicks open a cooler to her left, then leans down and pulls out a water bottle. Alison holds out a hand, Cobra tosses it, Alison catches. She undoes the cap, and swigs cold water. She enjoys the little bits that escape and roll down her chin, onto her chest.\n\n\n\nShe sighs as she puts the water down and wipes her lips.\n\n\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\n\"No problem. You doing alright?\"\n\n\n\nAlison shrugs. \"I'm doing //alright.//\"\n\n\n\n\"Wanna try another time?\"\n\n\n\n\"No. This is supposed to help.\"\n\n\n\nCobra nods, sipping her coffee.\n\n\n\nAlison breathes deep several times.\n\n\n\n\"So, are you //avoiding// Bea?\"\n\n\n\n\"Can't I just have come myself? Why are you so caught up on Bea?\"\n\n\n\nCobra puts a hand up again. \"No, this time I'm just wondering, is this a secret from her? Not that that's wrong, or anything, I just wanna know if I can bring it up, if this is important and personal or --\"\n\n\n\n\"It's fine, I don't really care.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay. Sorry, that's the last I'll bring up Bea.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks. Sorry myself.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pshaw.\"\n\n\n\nAlison redoes her several deep, centering breaths, hoping this time that Cobra won't find a reason to speak up and interrupt. She doesn't. That done, Alison moves towards the booth, and steps inside.\n\n\n\nShe picks up the phone, and reaches for the numpad, only to find it missing. She looks low for any buttons she may be missing --\n\n\n\n\"Oh it dials as soon as you pick up, it's already all plugged in, it should be ringing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh --\"\n\n\n\n\"//Hello?//\"\n\n\n\nAlison fumbles to stand and get the receiver to her mouth, the speaker to her ear.\n\n\n\n\"//Hello?//\" the voice repeats.\n\n\n\n\"Hello -- hi.\" She wonders if she should affect her voice, change it from her usual -- does it matter?\n\n\n\n\"Who is this?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm -- I'm paranoid, I don't want to say. Are you... Alison?\"\n\n\n\nA pause from the other end. \"I am.\"\n\n\n\nAlison fiddles with the telephone wire, and anxiously crosses one leg over the other. \"I was referred to you. By, ah, I never caught his name. Auburn hair, shoulder length.\" //Put it together,// Alison wills.\n\n\n\n\"Paul?\"\n\n\n\n//Yes perfect.// \"As I said, I never caught his name. He looks like he could have been a Paul.\" It isn't hard to sell the awkward, anxious chuckle.\n\n\n\n\"A new recruit, then!\"\n\n\n\n\"Ahh,\" she breathes through her teeth. \"I... that's the thing. I don't...\"\n\n\n\nShe lets the silence speak for her.\n\n\n\n\"On the fence?\"\n\n\n\nShe nods, even if it's only for herself. \"Yes, I...\u00a0\u00a0I was told you would be good to talk to.\"\n\n\n\nThere's a silence on the other end of the line, which Alison smiles at. She can imagine the surprise, the flattering. The composing herself, and then: \"What do you want to know?\"\n\n\n\n\"What made you start.\"\n\n\n\nThere's a sigh, and a slight huff of a cut-short chuckle. \"That's a big question.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\n\n\nA consideration. \"If you know it's not, do you really need to hear it?\"\n\n\n\nAlison considers herself. \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think... it's all so many little things. It was seeing the unreported dead on my street. It was... the lines of stress on mom's face. It's still the people begging for food. It's that we have to wear a mask just to step outside.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's life.\"\n\n\n\n\"It //is,// but... it was realizing that nothing good was going to happen, if I didn't do it myself. It was grabbing hold of the controls, because I have bandwidth to grab hold of the controls. It's doing those things that could be done that aren't, because no one dedicates themselves to doing them. And not everyone can, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Any way you can.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes -- yes! Exactly.\"\n\n\n\n\"But...\" she searched for the words.\n\n\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\n\n\"Aren't you putting yourself in the line of fire?\"\n\n\n\nA pause. \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"What lets you do that? How -- how can you make that decision?\"\n\n\n\n\"Life is dangerous already. I realized, at some point, that staying still was just as risky. Doing nothing risks prices rising on you all of a sudden, not being able to make rent, getting evicted, losing food, losing sleep, equipment failing on you suddenly in the street. Nothing is safe. The safest things to do are to lay in wait and let the bad things happen //to// you, when they find you. This way, rising above the crowd and making myself a target... I'm meeting those same things on my terms, I'm being proactive. I would rather meet my fate with a straight back than have it find me asleep, defenseless. And what this looks like to everyone is different -- sometimes you are too stuck, too dependent, to move. I'm lucky to not have a family to look out for, I'm lucky to have a job that pays what it does. Any way you can.\"\n\n\n\n\"Any way you can,\" Alison repeats.\n\n\n\nShe shifts her feet. She knew all of this already, but it's good to hear. Gets her thoughts straight, centers her.\n\n\n\n\"What if...\" she starts. \"What if you don't make a difference? What if you //can't//?\"\n\n\n\n\"If you can't, you don't. If you just don't, then you can rest knowing you tried. That was you standing up to meet fate.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, what if...\"\n\n\n\nShe struggles. //Will this make sense?//\n\n\n\n\"I have a question, a strange question, but...\"\n\n\n\n\"Shoot.\"\n\n\n\n\"What if... you don't //have// to?\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"What will you do, if... if it all goes right?\"\n\n\n\nThe other Alison laughs. \"Then we celebrate!\"\n\n\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ha, hmm... well, we'll always need //something.// I figure I'll find out what that thing is, and go there.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you ever rest? Say that it's over, you're done?\"\n\n\n\n\"I...\" Pause. \"It's hard to picture. I suppose that if I -- once I got old enough, I'd let people help me for the last little while, having helped more than the help I'd be asking for. But as I said, it's hard to picture.\"\n\n\n\nAlison sighs.\n\n\n\n\"Does that answer your question?\"\n\n\n\n\"What if...\"\n\n\n\nShe hesitates. In the silence, the other Alison laughs. \"You do a lot of hypotheticals. What's really eating at you?\"\n\n\n\n\"What if,\" she powers through, \"you could escape, instead.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm? Escape?\"\n\n\n\n\"Say that you're sure nothing you do will change anything, and you have the opportunity to make everything alright, if only for yourself. What would... what would you do?\"\n\n\n\nAlison turns in the booth until the wire partially wraps around herself, looking up at the ceiling.\n\n\n\n\"That's an interesting question. I... escape to where?\"\n\n\n\n\"Somewhere beyond the city.\"\n\n\n\nConsideration. \"Are there people there?\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's say there are. And it's easy, and clean, the people live longer and they have more control over their lives, what they do, what they eat. But if you go, you can't come back.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's a big question.\"\n\n\n\nAlison lets the question hang.\n\n\n\n\"If I could take people with me --\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's say you can't. If you leave, you leave it all, exactly as it is.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then no.\"\n\n\n\nAlison's heartrate quickens. \"No?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I would.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why... why not, exactly?\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe in what I do here. I believe in helping people.\"\n\n\n\n\"There will be people there, to help.\"\n\n\n\n\"But it sounds like they won't need //as// much help, will they?\"\n\n\n\nAlison wonders. \"Then let's say there's somewhere worse, and you can go there and help those people.\"\n\n\n\nThe other Alison laughs again. \"Worse than here!\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean it.\"\n\n\n\nSomething in her tone erases the warmth of the other Alison's response. \"Hmm... I... no, I would stay here, I think.\"\n\n\n\n\"You would?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure. But... there are people here who need help. Other people also needing help won't change that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wouldn't it? If others were dying of starvation and you had food to offer --\"\n\n\n\n\"Then if they came, I'd offer it. But I'm very sure I'd stay.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because I know these people. I know their problems. I know how to help them. They have a need, and I know I can answer it. And I don't believe in a world where that will ever truly stop. I think they'll need my help for as long as I can give it, just like I'll need theirs. And if I left, well... I'm taking all the help they gave me and I'm taking it away, aren't I? I have an obligation to be here. No, I'm really certain. I don't think there's anything that could make me leave.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not paradise?\" Alison surprises herself with the faint crack on the word.\n\n\n\n\"What's 'paradise'?\"\n\n\n\nIt's her own turn to laugh. It comes out strange with her throat closed up. \"Nevermind,\" she clears her throat, \"nevermind about that. Thank you. I... I think I understand something better now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank //you.// I hadn't ever thought of that. It's... strengthening, to put to words exactly how I feel.\"\n\n\n\nAlison flushes, and chuckles. \"Yeah. Yeah, it is. Um... thank you. Again.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did that answer your questions?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think it did.\"\n\n\n\n\"Glad to have helped.\"\n\n\n\n\"Any way you can.\"\n\n\n\n\"Any way I can.\"\n\n\n\n\"Be seeing you, maybe.\"\n\n\n\nShe hangs up, regretting the statement and unable to face a response.\n\n\n\nAlison composes herself, and steps outside the booth.\n\n\n\nCobra, at her terminal, is holding a headphone up to her ear. She quickly puts it down as Alison turns her attention Cobra's way, leaning back in her chair and throwing her eyebrows up, belatedly giving a little grin.\n\n\n\n\"It's alright. As I said, it wasn't private.\"\n\n\n\n\"I figured.\" Cobra gave her chair a lazy spin. \"So...\"\n\n\n\nAlison takes a deep breath. \"So?\"\n\n\n\nCobra's chair slowly turns to let her face Alison again, and she gives a quizzical look. \"Will we be seeing you? Again?\"\n\n\n\nAlison shrugs. \"I'm not sure. I guess you would have to come and visit me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn,\" Cobra mutters. \"But, you know, and don't tell Bea -- ah I said I wouldn't bring Bea up again --\"\n\n\n\n\"It's alright.\"\n\n\n\n\"-- but I did think you were kind of an odd fit. Happy to have you around, of course. Just, y'know.\"\n\n\n\n[[div id=\"blink-bar\"]]\n\nAlison sighs, again. \"Trust me, Cobes.

Towering spires of glass and steel reflected golden light, casting long shadows across the bustling streets below. Dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes moved through the streets, their claws tapping against polished stone roads.</p>\n<p>In a secluded laboratory atop the tallest spire, Dr. Kaarn, a wiry dromaeosaur, hunched over his workstation. His clawed hands deftly manipulated a holographic interface, streams of data cascading across the air before him. The room was cluttered with half-assembled devices, glowing crystals, and the faint hum of energy fields. Kaarn was on the verge of a breakthrough\u2014a way to pierce the veil of time and glimpse into the distant past.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaarn, you\u2019ve been here for days,\u201d came a soft voice from the entrance. Kaarn\u2019s mate, Lyra, stood there, his normally stoic eyes full of concern. \u201cThe hatchlings miss you. They keep asking when you\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaarn sighed, barely looking up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this Lyra. I\u2019m close, so close. Do you understand what this means? If I can stabilize the temporal aperture, we could learn the secrets of our ancestors. We could find the missing link, get irrefutable evidence on the origin of life, answer literally all of life\u2019s biggest mysteries. With this breakthrough, we could even discover where the <a href=\"/scp-3834\">traveler</a> came from!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd at what cost?\u201d Lyra\u2019s voice was heavy with frustration. \u201cYour family needs you now, the past will be fine, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaarn sighed again, but didn\u2019t respond. Lyra lingered for a moment before turning and walking away, his tail swishing with disappointment. Kaarn\u2019s eyes flicked toward the door, but he quickly forced himself back to his work. There would be time to make amends later, he told himself. There was always time.</p>\n<p>Hours turned into days as Kaarn experimented and puzzled over his console. Time was stubborn, and fancied itself immutable. His scanners had detected old weaknesses, likely <a href=\"/scp-4003\">distortions in time</a> from past, but he needed a distortion in the present, or else he wouldn\u2019t be able to establish a connection. Right when he was about to give up, the resistance suddenly gave way.</p>\n<p>Kaarn was stunned, this didn't make sense. He had spent hours looking for any kind of weakness, something he could work with, and encountered nothing but the same unchanging barrier. It was like he spent hours trying to jimmy open a locked door, only to have that door vanish without a trace.</p>\n<p>But he didn't have time to dwell on this. The machine hummed to life, a swirling vortex of light and energy forming in the center of the room. He had to act fast, he couldn't waste this opportunity. Kaarn\u2019s claws trembled as he adjusted the controls, stabilizing the aperture. The swirling chaos resolved into an image.</p>\n<p>Kaarn\u2019s breath caught in his throat. There, in the shimmering portal, was a humanoid figure. It stood alone on a barren plain, its pale, emaciated body devoid of feathers or scales. Its arms hung unnaturally long at its sides, and its face\u2026 its face was grotesque. Kaarn felt an involuntary shiver run down his spine.</p>\n<p>The air in the room seemed to grow colder, and shadows in the corners of the laboratory almost seemed to stretch and writhe. He instinctively reached for the capture device, a crystalline recorder designed to preserve images from the temporal stream. With a press of a button, the image was frozen in the crystal. Kaarn leaned closer to examine the figure, his curiosity overriding his unease.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>Far above the planet, in the cold void of space, something stirred. A pale hand twitched. Empty eyes turned towards a distant speck.</p>\n<p>The next day, Kaarn stood before the High Council of Zarnix, his discovery projected onto a grand display. The chamber was filled with the most brilliant minds of their age, each one eager to witness Kaarn\u2019s achievement. As the image of the creature appeared, a murmur of awe and confusion rippled through the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis creature,\u201d Kaarn began, \u201cis unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen. It predates our species, perhaps predates all known life. It\u2019s a glimpse into the unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p>But as the council members stared at the image, the atmosphere began to shift. A sense of unease seeped into the room, a primal fear none could explain. The creature\u2019s face seemed to draw them in, a black hole for their thoughts. Suddenly, alarms pierced through the silence. Technicians rushed into the chamber, their faces pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something approaching the planet,\u201d one of them stammered. \u201cAn object, and it\u2019s moving fast!\u201d</p>\n<p>Panic erupted. Council members shouted over one another as the image of the creature flickered and distorted on the display. Kaarn\u2019s heart sank.</p>\n<p>Over the next 24 hours, the inhabitants of Zarnix Prime panicked as information trickled out. Scientists scrambled to devise solutions, some were trying to set up weapons that could intercept it, some were trying to draft up plans to evacuate underground. But nothing could be done. The object\u2019s trajectory was unerring, its intent clear.</p>\n<p>Rumors spread like wildfire. Some claimed to hear faint wails emanating from the sky, an otherworldly sound that sent chills down spines. A few claimed it was a hoax, in utter disbelief that this could happen with no warning. Many tried to leave the city, the bustling streets being filled beyond capacity. A shadow seemed to hang over the city, an oppressive force that made the air itself feel heavier. The collective fear became a living thing, a suffocating presence that hung over the city like a storm cloud.</p>\n<p>As the second day dawned, the ground began to tremble. Buildings swayed, cracks spiderwebbed across the polished stone streets, and chaos consumed the city. Kaarn fled the council chamber, his mind racing. He had to get home. He had to see his family.</p>\n<p>The streets were a nightmare. Dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes ran in every direction, trampling smaller dinosaurs underfoot, their cries of fear echoing through the crumbling city. Kaarn pushed through the crowd, his claws scraping against the stone as he sprinted. The air was thick with smoke and dust, the acrid scent of destruction burning his nostrils. He could not tell if it was from the cataclysm, or from the citizens. The sky was wrong, the object's descent casting the world in an eerie twilight.</p>\n<p>The sounds of the city were drowned out by an otherworldly wail, a sound so vast and mournful it seemed to come from the earth itself. Some dinosaurs collapsed to the ground, clutching their heads, trying to convince themselves this wasn\u2019t real. Others ran blindly, their eyes wide with terror.</p>\n<p>When he finally reached his home, he found Lyra and their hatchlings huddled together, their eyes wide with fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kaarn said, his voice breaking. \u201cI should have been here. I should have\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lyra pulled him close, his warmth grounding him for a brief moment. But their reunion was short-lived. Above them, the sky burned as the creature slammed into their world, its descent creating a trail of fire and destruction. The sheer force of its arrival shook the planet to its core.</p>\n<p>Kaarn held his family tightly as a blinding light engulfed the world. In his final moments, he thought not of his work, but of the time he had wasted\u2014time he could never get back.</p>\n<p>When the dust settled, their age of civilization, technology, and wonders was over. The impact had unleashed a cataclysm, wiping out nearly all life on Earth. The instrument of this grim conclusion had embedded itself miles beneath the planet\u2019s surface, its pale hands covering its face. It let out a mournful wail that echoed through the tectonic plates, then fell silent, hidden and waiting.</p>\n<p>Life would begin again, in time. But the memory of that <a href=\"/scp-096\">ancient, unknowable force</a> would remain buried, waiting to be uncovered by the next curious species to walk the Earth.</p>\n<div class=\"danke site\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><tt>&gt;LOADING\u2026</tt></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><tt>&gt;LOADING\u2026</tt></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><tt>&gt;LOADING\u2026</tt></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><tt><a href=\"/scp-7368\">&gt;SK-CLASS DOMINANCE SHIFT SUCCESSFUL</a></tt></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/extinction-event\">Extinction Event</a>\" by Dr DeSanta, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The mood is grim.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoki failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The one who speaks first has hands of gold. As he talks, his fingers quietly scrape against each other- <em>skntch skntch skntch</em>- and gleaming slivers fall, tinkling against the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cCause?\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the monitors responds, SCUFFLE filter rendering its voice dull, anonymous, and utterly banal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a deviation. Someone <em>interfered</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scraping stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamnation. Are we looking at an XK?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman, thin blonde hair pulled back into a tight knot, clears her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThankfully, no, not yet. Forensics says we got lucky. Population density along the crash zone was just below minimum viability. Initial casualty projections-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to keep you all waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Faces turn. A man is in the doorway. There\u2019s soot on his clothes, and his footsteps leave the floor blackened. Not burnt- a careful distinction, that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne. Good to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man takes his seat, brushing ash off of the shoulders of his overcoat, and the others orient towards him, turning in place. It is a round table, this quorum of the Overseers, but it has a head nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are, at this moment, theoretically in violation of the Montreal Protocol<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman in white lets her glasses drop from shaking fingers. \u201cPENTAGRAM has made overtures, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>One shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet. Notice I said <em>theoretically</em>. Although a failure to maintain Shoki is grounds for the nullification of the protections afforded to us under Montreal, that provision assumes that said failure would\u2019ve either resulted in an XK, or in the detonation of nuclear devices over major American population centers. To my knowledge, neither of those events have taken place.\u201d</p>\n<p>O5-6 frowns, golden fingers clenching rigidly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a thin fucking line to rely on, One. Borders on <em>technicality</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI disagree. As I understand it, the situation at the crash site is\u2026 uncertain, but practically amenable. Seven?\u201d</p>\n<p>Heads turn. The woman in white rubs at her temples, hair coming undone.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotentially- potentially yes. At this point, the hellgate should be self-sustaining, diminished but self-sustaining. There couldn\u2019t have been enough souls close enough to the crash site to have immediately allowed for first or second-order traversal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p>\n<p>She almost smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, last I checked, the sky isn\u2019t bleeding, so yes. Reasonably certain. At this point it\u2019s still possible for the aperture to be sealed, but it\u2019d take, god- it\u2019d take every mage we have in North America. Me included. The logistical considerations alone-\u201d</p>\n<p>Gold fingers tap against glass, rhythm inscrutable.</p>\n<p>\u201c-and we\u2019d have to be guarded throughout the process. There\u2019s no telling how many lower-grade entities are coming through as we speak, and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be willing to authorize usage of the Helian Door.\u201d</p>\n<p>Murmurs rise from the monitors, overlapping atonal voices blending into staticky incomprehension. Seven stops mid-sentence, brushing strands of blonde hair out of her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Six.\u201d</p>\n<p>One steeples his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cReturning to the subject at hand, it seems to me that we are facing, at the moment, a containment breach. One of significant proportions, yes, but a simple containment breach nonetheless. Part of the status quo- a status quo <em>protected</em> under the Montreal Protocols. I believe that if we act quickly and decisively to resolve this crisis, PENTAGRAM will not pursue annulment.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou cannot be certain.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Impossibly, the interjection cuts through SCUFFLE as a vitriolic hiss.

Would you have us resort to Ganymede while a hellgate escalates in plain daylight? Turtle up to weather against hypothetical retaliation when a very real threat to our mandate is right there to be dealt with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Six scowls. \u201cI do not like the shape of this.

An eighth monitor rises soundlessly from the floor, black and featureless, a column of basalt. It serves no real purpose other than conversational courtesy. The thing it represents no longer has use for such frivolities as <em>perspective</em>. One turns to address it nonetheless, dipping his head politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree. Glad you could make it.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"president\">\n<p>|&gt;TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OPERATIONAL CAPACITY PRESENT AND RECORDING</p>\n</div>\n<p>The last man in the room twitches. Copper-corded limbs convulse and dead eyes shift subtly in a chalk-white face, pulled too taut over the skull.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the opinion of the Counterintelligence Directorate that there has been no significant compromise of deterrence systems concurrent to the present incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>The factotum\u2019s voice is baritonal, deep and gravelly.

The monitors turn to follow his movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would remind this chamber that the Foundation\u2019s continued existence has always been dependent on remaining, in the eyes of the world, slightly more palatable than the alternative. Part of that is due to our deterrence doctrine, yes, but, I\u2019d like to think a larger part is due to the work that we do, the sacrifices that every person here has made and continues to make towards the cause. We are presented with an opportunity, gentlemen, to once again demonstrate our value- to persevere against the darkness that none other dare to touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s emphatic now, gesticulating, in his element.</p>\n<p>A monitor chimes in, corroborating.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does seem particularly unlikely that PENTAGRAM would arrange for the creation of an active hellgate on American soil solely to fabricate casus belli to act against us. And even so, why <em>now</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Six turns towards One.

Grid-squares are secured block by block, chthonic wails silenced by suppressed weaponry and muttered incantations.</p>\n<p>The noose tightens.</p>\n<p>On a whispered signal, the Helian Door hisses open in a plume of superheated gas. Walls of plasma bloom on the outskirts of Meeker, golden gates bright as the inside of the sun disgorging soldiers, vehicles, prefab watchtowers and concertainer.</p>\n<p>Cast in the blood-light of the hellgate\u2019s shadow, they look almost like heroes.</p>\n<p>Above them the sky bleeds and below them the earth distends with horror but they are the Foundation at war. Demons howl and hellfire rains from the scarlet sky in hissing droplets but they are the Foundation at war, and so their fire is steady and their maneuver is swift.</p>\n<p>Walls erupt from the blood-mist, knife edged, topped with concertina wire and spotlights. Hard-helmeted men with blue coveralls and determined expressions drive iron stakes into the flagellated earth as black-kevlar regiments hold the line with tactical sacrament and blessed gunfire mere feet away. There is none of the mechanized brutality of a Coalition fire mission, the esotericism of a Psychotronics intervention, the heedless overkill that is PENTAGRAM\u2019s penchant.</p>\n<p>The perimeter forms, the perimeter holds, and the perimeter expands.</p>\n<p>This is the Foundation at war.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc1\"><span><span style=\"color: red\">2. UNDER THE GUN</span></span></h2>\n<hr/>\n<p>O5-7 ducks out of the helicopter, brushing thin blonde hair out of her eyes as the dry wind snags at her ponytail. The air stinks, petrochemical reek and gunpowder fumes mixing into an eye-watering miasma that has her retching, coughing into her fist, almost doubling over. Footsteps hurry towards her across the tamped dirt, and a black-gloved hand presses a respirator into her fingers.</p>\n<p>She accepts it gratefully, clipping the mask on over her nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about the, ah, atmospheric situation, ma\u2019am. The techies say the skip\u2019s mucking with the airflow. Something about environmental resonance.\u201d</p>\n<p>The trooper shuffles apologetically, gas-masked gaze scrupulously avoiding her face. There\u2019s a distinct unease to his stance, and his arm hovers awkwardly at his side, as if unsure whether or not to offer her a hand.</p>\n<p>She gives him a reassuring smile, following him down the makeshift staging ground towards the first of the barricades. Periodically, chattering gunfire cuts through the scarlet smog, followed by echoing, resonant shrieks that linger uncomfortably in the black between her eyes. She grits her teeth, shaking her head irritably.</p>\n<p>The command tent is a buzzing hive of fluttering white coats and blue coveralls punctuated by the shrill screams of power tools and the bassy thrum of thaumoelectric generators. Two guards flank the entrance flap, snapping to attention as she approaches. She takes a moment to shrug off her heavy greatcoat, nodding gratefully as the trooper considerately moves to receive the mass of warded fabric. Stretching her shoulders, she reaches for nonspace with a twist of will, pulling against the air. Laminated white polyester slides into her hand from the gap between atoms.</p>\n<p>Slipping on her labcoat, O5-7 steps into the command post.</p>\n<p>\u201cOVERSEER ON DECK!\u201d</p>\n<p>The shout ripples through the room. A hundred pairs of feet stand at attention, a ring of stoic faces following her every move, encircling her like sunflowers facing the sun. Bile rises in her throat, but Seven bites it back down. She gives them what she hopes is a winning smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould I have a word with Commander Jefferson? Everyone else, back to your stations.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room mutedly resumes movement, voices hushed, a hundred pairs of ears straining to grasp at the edict of a demigod, the command of an Overseer. Even the power tools sound sullen, whirring anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be me, ma\u2019am.\u201d A voice calls from the back of the room, deep and baritonal.</p>\n<p>Seven turns to take his measure. Dark brown eyes set in an alert, clean-shaven face, marred by an impressive scar distorting the corner of his mouth into an exaggerated, downturned scowl. Nondescript Foundation BDUs, ironed crisp, polished boots and a holstered pistol at his hip. She knows the type. She's seen a thousand of him in her tenure, across a dozen different sites and half a hundred task forces.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, she wondered if the Foundation really was cloning people.</p>\n<p>One had never quite given her a straight answer when she\u2019d asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is the situation on the ground?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jefferson\u2019s face sours.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be frank? Not great.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sustained burst of gunfire, followed by a succession of concussive blasts that rattle the tent, as if to punctuate his point. More ephemeral screaming. Seven tries to keep the wince off of her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve secured the perimeter, constructed defenses, gotten basic operational infrastructure up and running. The boys from Nu-7 are working on bringing the nuclear contingency online.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates, shoulders slumping slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to encounter insurmountable logistical issues. They\u2019re coming from the gate at a rate that\u2019s eventually going to outpace our ammunition supply. I\u2019ve had the suppression teams working in shifts since day one, but everyone\u2019s on edge. It feels like we\u2019re going to be overrun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jefferson meets her gaze fully for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be honest, ma\u2019am, I think the men are expecting you to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a beat, he blanches, quickly looking down. \u201cN-no offense.\u201d Seven notices sudden perspiration gleaming on his forehead and sighs internally.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d</p>\n<p>The entrance flap rustles. A balding, potbellied man in a disheveled black rubber apron bursts through, scanning the tent apprehensively. Jefferson waves him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019d be Doctor Jameson from Beta-77. To my understanding, he and his team have been waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Commander. That\u2019ll be all.\u201d</p>\n<p>He salutes her again, snapping his heels together.</p>\n<p>Seven turns to go, then hesitates. Facing the room, she raises her voice, trying her best to sound authoritative, calm, to project control the way One does so effortlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told that some of you here have been expecting a miracle. The good news is, that is my department. Carry on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her voice sounds wavering, even to her, but the room gives an appreciative cheer nonetheless. Swallowing nausea, Seven follows the doctor out of the tent.</p>\n<p>There is work to be done.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A demon\u2019s severed head drips orange ichor onto the blue tarping of the lab bench. It\u2019s vaguely selachian, mottled gray skin streaked with phosphorescent blue stripes. Two jagged arcs of obsidian curve from its forehead like antlers, glistening wetly. As Seven watches, serpentine pupils dilate in lidless sockets, swiveling up to look at her. The thing\u2019s mouth twitches.</p>\n<p>Seven slides another silver needle into its skull.</p>\n<p>Jameson stands next to her, bearded face furrowed. Sweat pours off of his bald scalp and runs down his face in perspicuous droplets. Occasionally, he mops at his face with a yellow handkerchief, though it barely seems to help. Seven doesn\u2019t mind. At least he hasn\u2019t tried to salute her yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re uh, pretty sure that the instances coming through the gate are, for all intents and purposes, fully substantiated. If you would let go of the probe, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p>\n<p>Seven nods, stepping back from the desk. Jameson taps rapidly on the keyboard cradled to his chest, then hits enter.</p>\n<p>The lights of the mobile laboratory flicker, the background hum of ventilation fans sputtering to a halt. The demon\u2019s head twitches, eyes rolling back as each of the seven silver spikes buried in its skull flare a brilliant, blinding blue. There is a smell like rotting eggs and abscesses. Seven turns away, sleeve pulled over her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that thing had been a normal manifestation, it would've been disintegrated by the disvocation matrix we just pumped into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The head is still there, faintly steaming, clotted orange ichor leaking slowly from each eye. It no longer twitches. Jameson\u2019s mouth curls with distaste, and he moves to dislodge the silver spikes, sliding each out of the demon\u2019s flesh with a wet squelch.</p>\n<p>Seven nods, comprehending.</p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of being matter from our reality held together by will from the outside, the demon has crossed over fully, body and bowel. The hellgate isn\u2019t just manifesting them. It\u2019s translating them into our dimension.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jameson slides the head into a biowaste crate and sighs, sealing the lid.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecisely, ma'am. I'm sure you see where the problem is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just seal off the breach. They\u2019d just force their way through, regardless of the warding schema. We actually have to close it altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seven peels off ichor-slick gloves, rubbing her hands together, beginning to pace the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want this laboratory to myself for the next twelve hours. Access to every scrap of data you\u2019ve collected about the hellgate, about Meeker, local geological and thaumaturgic readings. A thaumoelectric generator. As much coffee as can reasonably be had. And a whiteboard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jameson looks up from wiping down the bench, face pale. Seven realizes a slow grin has spread across her face. She lets it sit there until Jameson looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am, uh, O5-7 ma\u2019am, of-of course. Right away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more thing, Jameson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring me more of their <span style=\"color: #b200ed\">heads</span>.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color: red\">The little things are running.</span></p>\n<p>Asveth Korgaul, twenty-eighth to taste the true blood of the Tree, nineteenth of the Mighty, <span style=\"color: red\">he-who-is-favored-in-murder</span> lifts a head the size of minor moons and sniffs at the bloodsoaked air of Upper Megiddo.

Liquid fire, silky smooth, trickles achingly down his throat. Golden fingers fiddle with the plastic safety cap of the Armageddon Button, flicking it up, then down, up, then down.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not actually a button, of course, more of a switch, really, and truth be told not particularly apocalyptic compared to some of the other ones at his immediate disposal. He sits nestled at the center of Site-01, enshrined in the shining, sterile, utterly secure heart of the Foundation. He is the only living, breathing thing within \u2588\u2588\u2588 kilometers. He is, practically speaking, the loneliest man alive.</p>\n<p>Seven left by apportation thirty minutes after the meeting ended. One had kept him company for a little while longer, gossiping of this and that matter of state, before cheerfully stepping into the fireplace and turning to ash. Off to his bunker in the Mojave no doubt, off to beat gods at dice and host devils for dinner and delegate everything actually important to everyone else.</p>\n<p>Wiping at his mouth, Six reaches for the nearest keyboard.</p>\n<div class=\"elaimal\">\n<p>INITIALIZING O5COM_v14.3 SECURE TELECOM INTERFACE<br/>\nINSTANCE 3455 LOGGED<br/>\nWELCOME, O5-6</p>\n<p>O5-6: Just received hourlies from Meeker.

Something in his chest pops and deflates.</p>\n<p>A figure stares down at him from the breach, black on red, bipedal, covered with a dense carpet of wriggling tendrils like the underbelly of a millipede. Six insectoid arms grip the edges of the cut, pulling.

Privately, he doubts that even ten times their number would\u2019ve been enough to make a difference.</p>\n<p>If he survived, Jefferson resolves, clenching his teeth, he\u2019d have the Logistics Division lined up against the wall and shot. He\u2019d do it himself if he had to.</p>\n<p>There had simply been too many of them. Sheer volume of bodies had nearly instantaneously overwhelmed the output of the first killzones, a red wave pouring over concertina wire and trenches to slam liquidly against the first set of palisades. Almost half of the Bradleys had been lost in those frantic first minutes, dug-in outside the walls. There simply had been nowhere to retreat them to, not after the primary fallback routes had become entirely inundated by swarms of blue-feathered, multi-headed pangolins that spit acid, ate metal and ran at highway speeds. He\u2019d ordered them abandoned instead, scuttled with blessed thermite and satchel charges, and personally watched from atop the concertainer as the bonfires flared up one by one, each briefly illuminating the scuttling, crawling stream of bodies before snuffing out.</p>\n<p>Not a single crewman had belayed the order.</p>\n<p>Not a single one had made it back behind the walls.</p>\n<p>The emplacement itself would hold for a while longer, at least. He\u2019d ordered the M113s, alongside the remaining Bradleys, up onto dirt ramps, depressing their Vulcans over the palisade to fire point-blank into the horde as they scrabbled and scratched at the base of the walls. Jefferson was confident that they\u2019d manage to keep the demons at bay for as long as the ammo held out.</p>\n<p>By his most generous estimates, they\u2019d last for another half-hour.</p>\n<p>Staring through the blood-mist at his crumbling frontline, Commander Lionel Jefferson comes to the terrible realization that the Montana National Guard genuinely might\u2019ve done better in his position.

Her thin blonde hair is unwound, falling around her shoulders in scraggly streams, and she\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing nervous about it this time, no hint of uncertainty or doubt. It\u2019s a smile that casts a shadow, balanced on the knife\u2019s edge of wild, unconscious charisma and cackling madness.

There is a garrison left behind, token perimeter security and a squad of glum-faced researchers who, having drawn short straws, will stay on-site for another three months, monitoring spacetime integrity and any lingering tartarean contamination. Seven attempts a pep talk, reciting the platitudes One bade her memorize by rote. The words feel plastic, artificial, but she sees their backs straighten nonetheless. She walks away before they can attempt a salute.</p>\n<p>Seven stretches out in the mercifully empty backseat of the Humvee, letting out a shuddering breath. Thaumic exhaustion roils beneath her skin, flaring into painful spasms that leave her wincing, rubbing at her arms. She wonders at the lengths Jefferson must have gone to reserve an entire vehicle for her personal use, stifling a guilty smirk as she pictures a squad of grim-faced operators sitting stoically in each other\u2019s laps.</p>\n<p>Her eyes slip shut, just for a moment.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"omalley\">\n<p>Cigarette smoke curls dimly in the blue light, spun into a slow vortex by the ceiling fan.

There\u2019s a cot and desk bolted into the concrete floor and a fisheye lens gleaming in the corner of the ceiling.

There\u2019s less pain than she expected: a dim ache in the pit of her stomach coupled to a sense of comprehensive <em>emptiness</em>, and a gnawing hunger grown to proportions beyond simple sensation. Her hands are bound behind her back, and something cool and metal presses loosely around her neck, shifting as she moves her shoulders.</p>\n<p>The walls of the cell shine with a steady sheen of running water, cascading from floor to ceiling in laminar sheets that splash into grates lining the perimeter of the room. The air is heavy with geomancy, aether tainted with the runoff of a dozen cascading wards.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of faint irony.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s familiar with the theory behind the cell. She wrote most of it herself.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud thrum that echoes through the cement floor, and the flow trickles to a stop, leaving the walls glistening with moisture. The door to the cell opens, swinging on heavy hinges.</p>\n<p>A woman walks in, flanked by two grim-faced men in plainclothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders.

The mood is grim. \n\n\n\n\u201cShoki failed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe one who speaks first has hands of gold. As he talks, his fingers quietly scrape against each other- //skntch skntch skntch//- and gleaming slivers fall, tinkling against the table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cCause?\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the monitors responds, SCUFFLE filter rendering its voice dull, anonymous, and utterly banal.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a deviation. Someone //interfered//.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe scraping stops.\n\n\n\n\u201cDamnation. Are we looking at an XK?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman, thin blonde hair pulled back into a tight knot, clears her throat. \n\n\n\n\u201cThankfully, no, not yet. Forensics says we got lucky. Population density along the crash zone was just below minimum viability. Initial casualty projections-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry to keep you all waiting.\u201d\n\n\n\nFaces turn. A man is in the doorway. There\u2019s soot on his clothes, and his footsteps leave the floor blackened. Not burnt- a careful distinction, that. \n\n\n\n\u201cOne. Good to see you.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man takes his seat, brushing ash off of the shoulders of his overcoat, and the others orient towards him, turning in place. It is a round table, this quorum of the Overseers, but it has a head nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are, at this moment, theoretically in violation of the Montreal Protocol[[footnote]]Treaty governing mutual aid and non-aggression between the SCP Foundation and the US Government in North America.[[/footnote]].\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman in white lets her glasses drop from shaking fingers. \u201cPENTAGRAM has made overtures, then?\u201d\n\n\n\nOne shakes his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot yet. Notice I said //theoretically//. Although a failure to maintain Shoki is grounds for the nullification of the protections afforded to us under Montreal, that provision assumes that said failure would\u2019ve either resulted in an XK, or in the detonation of nuclear devices over major American population centers. To my knowledge, neither of those events have taken place.\u201d\n\n\n\nO5-6 frowns, golden fingers clenching rigidly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thin fucking line to rely on, One. Borders on //technicality//.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI disagree. As I understand it, the situation at the crash site is\u2026 uncertain, but practically amenable. Seven?\u201d\n\n\n\nHeads turn. The woman in white rubs at her temples, hair coming undone. \n\n\n\n\u201cPotentially- potentially yes. At this point, the hellgate should be self-sustaining, diminished but self-sustaining. There couldn\u2019t have been enough souls close enough to the crash site to have immediately allowed for first or second-order traversal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe almost smiles.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, last I checked, the sky isn\u2019t bleeding, so yes. Reasonably certain. At this point it\u2019s still possible for the aperture to be sealed, but it\u2019d take, god- it\u2019d take every mage we have in North America. Me included. The logistical considerations alone-\u201d\n\n\n\nGold fingers tap against glass, rhythm inscrutable. \n\n\n\n\u201c-and we\u2019d have to be guarded throughout the process. There\u2019s no telling how many lower-grade entities are coming through as we speak, and-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be willing to authorize usage of the Helian Door.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurmurs rise from the monitors, overlapping atonal voices blending into staticky incomprehension. Seven stops mid-sentence, brushing strands of blonde hair out of her eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Six.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne steeples his fingers.\n\n\n\n\u201cReturning to the subject at hand, it seems to me that we are facing, at the moment, a containment breach. One of significant proportions, yes, but a simple containment breach nonetheless. Part of the status quo- a status quo //protected// under the Montreal Protocols. I believe that if we act quickly and decisively to resolve this crisis, PENTAGRAM will not pursue annulment.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cYou cannot be certain.\u201d// \n\n\n\nImpossibly, the interjection cuts through SCUFFLE as a vitriolic hiss. Seven winces, clutching at her head, turning to stare daggers at the offending monitor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou would trust PENTAGRAM to act in good faith?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI would trust PENTAGRAM to act //in its own self-interest//.\u201d\n\n\n\nSix laughs, golden fingers running through thinning hair.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s almost as bad, One.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI see no alternative. Would you have us resort to Ganymede while a hellgate escalates in plain daylight? Turtle up to weather against hypothetical retaliation when a very real threat to our mandate is right there to be dealt with?\u201d\n\n\n\nSix scowls. \u201cI do not like the shape of this.

An eighth monitor rises soundlessly from the floor, black and featureless, a column of basalt. It serves no real purpose other than conversational courtesy. The thing it represents no longer has use for such frivolities as //perspective//. One turns to address it nonetheless, dipping his head politely.\n\n\n\n\u201cThree.

Extraordinary Mobilization.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are calling for the expenditure of our entire North American rapid response capability on a single anomaly.\u201d Six scoffs, incredulous. \n\n\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou of all people should understand how //singularly vulnerable// of a position that\u2019d put us in.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne stands, beginning to pace the room. The monitors turn to follow his movements.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would remind this chamber that the Foundation\u2019s continued existence has always been dependent on remaining, in the eyes of the world, slightly more palatable than the alternative. Part of that is due to our deterrence doctrine, yes, but, I\u2019d like to think a larger part is due to the work that we do, the sacrifices that every person here has made and continues to make towards the cause. We are presented with an opportunity, gentlemen, to once again demonstrate our value- to persevere against the darkness that none other dare to touch.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s emphatic now, gesticulating, in his element. \n\n\n\nA monitor chimes in, corroborating.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt does seem particularly unlikely that PENTAGRAM would arrange for the creation of an active hellgate on American soil solely to fabricate casus belli to act against us. And even so, why //now//?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d\n\n\n\nSix turns towards One.

Grid-squares are secured block by block, chthonic wails silenced by suppressed weaponry and muttered incantations. \n\n\n\nThe noose tightens.\n\n\n\nOn a whispered signal, the Helian Door hisses open in a plume of superheated gas. Walls of plasma bloom on the outskirts of Meeker, golden gates bright as the inside of the sun disgorging soldiers, vehicles, prefab watchtowers and concertainer. \n\n\n\nCast in the blood-light of the hellgate\u2019s shadow, they look almost like heroes.\n\n\n\nAbove them the sky bleeds and below them the earth distends with horror but they are the Foundation at war. Demons howl and hellfire rains from the scarlet sky in hissing droplets but they are the Foundation at war, and so their fire is steady and their maneuver is swift. \n\n\n\nWalls erupt from the blood-mist, knife edged, topped with concertina wire and spotlights. Hard-helmeted men with blue coveralls and determined expressions drive iron stakes into the flagellated earth as black-kevlar regiments hold the line with tactical sacrament and blessed gunfire mere feet away. There is none of the mechanized brutality of a Coalition fire mission, the esotericism of a Psychotronics intervention, the heedless overkill that is PENTAGRAM\u2019s penchant. \n\n\n\nThe perimeter forms, the perimeter holds, and the perimeter expands. \n\n\n\nThis is the Foundation at war.\n\n------\n\n++ ##red |2. UNDER THE GUN##\n\n------\n\nO5-7 ducks out of the helicopter, brushing thin blonde hair out of her eyes as the dry wind snags at her ponytail. The air stinks, petrochemical reek and gunpowder fumes mixing into an eye-watering miasma that has her retching, coughing into her fist, almost doubling over. Footsteps hurry towards her across the tamped dirt, and a black-gloved hand presses a respirator into her fingers. \n\n\n\nShe accepts it gratefully, clipping the mask on over her nose. \n\n\n\n\u201cSorry about the, ah, atmospheric situation, ma\u2019am. The techies say the skip\u2019s mucking with the airflow. Something about environmental resonance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe trooper shuffles apologetically, gas-masked gaze scrupulously avoiding her face. There\u2019s a distinct unease to his stance, and his arm hovers awkwardly at his side, as if unsure whether or not to offer her a hand.\n\n\n\nShe gives him a reassuring smile, following him down the makeshift staging ground towards the first of the barricades. Periodically, chattering gunfire cuts through the scarlet smog, followed by echoing, resonant shrieks that linger uncomfortably in the black between her eyes. She grits her teeth, shaking her head irritably. \n\n\n\nThe command tent is a buzzing hive of fluttering white coats and blue coveralls punctuated by the shrill screams of power tools and the bassy thrum of thaumoelectric generators. Two guards flank the entrance flap, snapping to attention as she approaches. She takes a moment to shrug off her heavy greatcoat, nodding gratefully as the trooper considerately moves to receive the mass of warded fabric. Stretching her shoulders, she reaches for nonspace with a twist of will, pulling against the air. Laminated white polyester slides into her hand from the gap between atoms.\n\n\n\nSlipping on her labcoat, O5-7 steps into the command post.\n\n\n\n\u201cOVERSEER ON DECK!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe shout ripples through the room. A hundred pairs of feet stand at attention, a ring of stoic faces following her every move, encircling her like sunflowers facing the sun. Bile rises in her throat, but Seven bites it back down. She gives them what she hopes is a winning smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cCould I have a word with Commander Jefferson? Everyone else, back to your stations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe room mutedly resumes movement, voices hushed, a hundred pairs of ears straining to grasp at the edict of a demigod, the command of an Overseer. Even the power tools sound sullen, whirring anxiously. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat would be me, ma\u2019am.\u201d A voice calls from the back of the room, deep and baritonal. \n\n\n\nSeven turns to take his measure. Dark brown eyes set in an alert, clean-shaven face, marred by an impressive scar distorting the corner of his mouth into an exaggerated, downturned scowl. Nondescript Foundation BDUs, ironed crisp, polished boots and a holstered pistol at his hip. She knows the type. She's seen a thousand of him in her tenure, across a dozen different sites and half a hundred task forces. \n\n\n\nSometimes, she wondered if the Foundation really was cloning people. \n\n\n\nOne had never quite given her a straight answer when she\u2019d asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow is the situation on the ground?\u201d\n\n\n\nJefferson\u2019s face sours.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo be frank? Not great.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a sustained burst of gunfire, followed by a succession of concussive blasts that rattle the tent, as if to punctuate his point. More ephemeral screaming. Seven tries to keep the wince off of her face.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve secured the perimeter, constructed defenses, gotten basic operational infrastructure up and running. The boys from Nu-7 are working on bringing the nuclear contingency online.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe hesitates, shoulders slumping slightly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to encounter insurmountable logistical issues. They\u2019re coming from the gate at a rate that\u2019s eventually going to outpace our ammunition supply. I\u2019ve had the suppression teams working in shifts since day one, but everyone\u2019s on edge. It feels like we\u2019re going to be overrun.\u201d\n\n\n\nJefferson meets her gaze fully for the first time. \n\n\n\n\u201cTo be honest, ma\u2019am, I think the men are expecting you to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\u201d \n\n\n\nAfter a beat, he blanches, quickly looking down. \u201cN-no offense.\u201d Seven notices sudden perspiration gleaming on his forehead and sighs internally.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe entrance flap rustles. A balding, potbellied man in a disheveled black rubber apron bursts through, scanning the tent apprehensively. Jefferson waves him over. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be Doctor Jameson from Beta-77. To my understanding, he and his team have been waiting for you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Commander. That\u2019ll be all.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe salutes her again, snapping his heels together.\n\n\n\nSeven turns to go, then hesitates. Facing the room, she raises her voice, trying her best to sound authoritative, calm, to project control the way One does so effortlessly. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told that some of you here have been expecting a miracle. The good news is, that is my department. Carry on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer voice sounds wavering, even to her, but the room gives an appreciative cheer nonetheless. Swallowing nausea, Seven follows the doctor out of the tent. \n\n\n\nThere is work to be done.\n\n------\n\nA demon\u2019s severed head drips orange ichor onto the blue tarping of the lab bench. It\u2019s vaguely selachian, mottled gray skin streaked with phosphorescent blue stripes. Two jagged arcs of obsidian curve from its forehead like antlers, glistening wetly. As Seven watches, serpentine pupils dilate in lidless sockets, swiveling up to look at her. The thing\u2019s mouth twitches.\n\n\n\nSeven slides another silver needle into its skull.\n\n\n\nJameson stands next to her, bearded face furrowed. Sweat pours off of his bald scalp and runs down his face in perspicuous droplets. Occasionally, he mops at his face with a yellow handkerchief, though it barely seems to help. Seven doesn\u2019t mind. At least he hasn\u2019t tried to salute her yet.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re uh, pretty sure that the instances coming through the gate are, for all intents and purposes, fully substantiated. If you would let go of the probe, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\n\nSeven nods, stepping back from the desk. Jameson taps rapidly on the keyboard cradled to his chest, then hits enter. \n\n\n\nThe lights of the mobile laboratory flicker, the background hum of ventilation fans sputtering to a halt. The demon\u2019s head twitches, eyes rolling back as each of the seven silver spikes buried in its skull flare a brilliant, blinding blue. There is a smell like rotting eggs and abscesses. Seven turns away, sleeve pulled over her mouth. \n\n\n\n\u201cIf that thing had been a normal manifestation, it would've been disintegrated by the disvocation matrix we just pumped into it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe head is still there, faintly steaming, clotted orange ichor leaking slowly from each eye. It no longer twitches. Jameson\u2019s mouth curls with distaste, and he moves to dislodge the silver spikes, sliding each out of the demon\u2019s flesh with a wet squelch. \n\n\n\nSeven nods, comprehending. \n\n\n\n\u201cInstead of being matter from our reality held together by will from the outside, the demon has crossed over fully, body and bowel. The hellgate isn\u2019t just manifesting them. It\u2019s translating them into our dimension.\u201d\n\n\n\nJameson slides the head into a biowaste crate and sighs, sealing the lid.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely, ma'am. I'm sure you see where the problem is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just seal off the breach. They\u2019d just force their way through, regardless of the warding schema. We actually have to close it altogether.\u201d \n\n\n\nSeven peels off ichor-slick gloves, rubbing her hands together, beginning to pace the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want this laboratory to myself for the next twelve hours. Access to every scrap of data you\u2019ve collected about the hellgate, about Meeker, local geological and thaumaturgic readings. A thaumoelectric generator. As much coffee as can reasonably be had. And a whiteboard.\u201d\n\n\n\nJameson looks up from wiping down the bench, face pale. Seven realizes a slow grin has spread across her face. She lets it sit there until Jameson looks away.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, uh, O5-7 ma\u2019am, of-of course. Right away.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne more thing, Jameson.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBring me more of their ###B200ED| heads##.\u201d\n\n------\n\n##red| The little things are running.##\n\n\n\nAsveth Korgaul, twenty-eighth to taste the true blood of the Tree, nineteenth of the Mighty, ##red| he-who-is-favored-in-murder## lifts a head the size of minor moons and sniffs at the bloodsoaked air of Upper Megiddo.

TRAUMA RESPONSE##\n\n------\n\nO5-6 watches the latest numbers scrolling across his screen and decides to take another shot. Liquid fire, silky smooth, trickles achingly down his throat. Golden fingers fiddle with the plastic safety cap of the Armageddon Button, flicking it up, then down, up, then down. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not actually a button, of course, more of a switch, really, and truth be told not particularly apocalyptic compared to some of the other ones at his immediate disposal. He sits nestled at the center of Site-01, enshrined in the shining, sterile, utterly secure heart of the Foundation. He is the only living, breathing thing within\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0\u00a0kilometers. He is, practically speaking, the loneliest man alive. \n\n\n\nSeven left by apportation thirty minutes after the meeting ended. One had kept him company for a little while longer, gossiping of this and that matter of state, before cheerfully stepping into the fireplace and turning to ash. Off to his bunker in the Mojave no doubt, off to beat gods at dice and host devils for dinner and delegate everything actually important to everyone else. \n\n\n\nWiping at his mouth, Six reaches for the nearest keyboard.\n\n\n\n[[div class =\"elaimal\"]]\n\nINITIALIZING O5COM_v14.3 SECURE TELECOM INTERFACE\n\nINSTANCE 3455 LOGGED\n\nWELCOME, O5-6\n\n\n\nO5-6: Just received hourlies from Meeker.

Old springs, long gone stiff, dig sharply into his back. He winces. \n\n\n\nThe damned things were relics, dredged up from the dying days of the Cold War. Their arthritic engines had practically given the pit crew a nervous conniption upon inspection, and traversing the turret for any length of time filled the basket with the agonized screeching of neglected servos. There was a reason Hammer Down hadn\u2019t deployed in force since the eighties: the arsenal beneath Ruby Mountain was practically a boneyard, half of it stolen from other boneyards. \n\n\n\nAt least the bushmasters still worked.\n\n\n\nThe backline clamors with activity, vast auto-censers vaporizing industrial quantities of frankincense and myrrh over a pyramid of piled ammunition crates as black flocks of conscripted vestry recite tactical sacrament with a fervor comprehensible only to the damned. Gun crews scramble up and down the palisades, skidding into foxholes, rapping atop sigil-touched turrets rotating as one to face the very mouth of Hell, white-hot on their thermals.\n\n\n\nMorris counters up and down the line simultaneously crescendo into ear-splitting screeches that rise into frequencies inaudible, before shorting out altogether in sparking bursts of static.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFreedman looks towards the burning horizon, swallows his Zyn, and pre-sights the main gun.\n\n\n\nThe last belts are loaded, the last hatches are sealed, the last pieces of chewing tobacco spat ignominiously into the rusty earth. \n\n\n\nThere is a terrible, breathless, aching silence. \n\n\n\nThe earth shifts, boils, shatters. \n\n\n\n\u201cWeapons free.\u201d\n\n\n\nHell follows.\n\n------\n\nAsveth Korgaul is close now, so terribly, achingly close. The plain beneath him writhes with a living carpet of the ##red| lesser##, like red water flowing over and under his limbs, biting at adamantite scales, crushed by the millions beneath every quaking step. \n\n\n\nHe sees now the reason for their congregation.\n\n\n\nThere is a ##red| tear##. \n\n\n\nA small one, a pale bloom of pink stretched against the undersky, a galactic teratoma compressed into a pulsing, wrathful singularity by exquisite agony. It leads, he sees now, it leads to a ##red| lesser## world, already spindled by threads of ##red| red## and black, balanced on the very precipice of **order**. \n\n\n\nHe bends his head in supplication to the Wounded Lord of Heaven and his prayer sounds with the thundering chorus of high-altitude thermonuclear detonation, with the hiss of cosmic background radiation, with the cries of children in pain. \n\n\n\nHe sheds many of his arms, for the ##red| lesser## world cannot bear them as they are. He sheds his adamantite scales for ones of mere graphene, his supernova claws for ones of base enchantment. He sheds his black crown and places it reverently on the ground, where it immediately begins melting its way down into the crust of Upper Megiddo. \n\n\n\nNaked, supplicant, purified, he ascends towards the undersky upon winds of slaughter. \n\n\n\nHis pilgrimage awaits. \n\n\n\n##red| tamarin tesh asham korgath turnal tamarin tesh avashin tomath vaten ela ela ela tamarin tesh##\n\n\n\nBefore him, the ##red| lesser## flee, maddened with terror, and behind him they flock in untold billions.

Sgt Calvin Freedman feels it slice through his plate carrier, hook up into his ribcage, and //pull//.\n\n\n\nHe coughs, a small, surprised noise. His face feels sticky and warm and blood runs down the plastic screen of the FCS display in front of him in black rivulets. Offhandedly, he feels a moment of sympathy for the cleanup crew.\n\n\n\nGolden claws gleam through the gash in the hull, widening the gap in a screech of tortured metal. He coughs again, wetly. Something in his chest pops and deflates. \n\n\n\nA figure stares down at him from the breach, black on red, bipedal, covered with a dense carpet of wriggling tendrils like the underbelly of a millipede. Six insectoid arms grip the edges of the cut, pulling. The side of the Bradley falls away into ribbons of twisted steel. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s grinning at him.\n\n\n\nHe grins back.\n\n\n\nBlood-slick fingers reach for the detcord of the claymore mine strapped across his chest, pulling the pin.\n\n------\n\nFifteen minutes into the battle sees Commander Lionel Jefferson realize that all is lost. \n\n\n\nThe command tent rattles with the blast of the handful of ancient Paladins that consist of the sum total of the Foundation\u2019s artillery corps. Privately, he doubts that even ten times their number would\u2019ve been enough to make a difference.\n\n\n\nIf he survived, Jefferson resolves, clenching his teeth, he\u2019d have the Logistics Division lined up against the wall and shot. He\u2019d do it himself if he had to.\n\n\n\nThere had simply been too many of them. Sheer volume of bodies had nearly instantaneously overwhelmed the output of the first killzones, a red wave pouring over concertina wire and trenches to slam liquidly against the first set of palisades. Almost half of the Bradleys had been lost in those frantic first minutes, dug-in outside the walls. There simply had been nowhere to retreat them to, not after the primary fallback routes had become entirely inundated by swarms of blue-feathered, multi-headed pangolins that spit acid, ate metal and ran at highway speeds. He\u2019d ordered them abandoned instead, scuttled with blessed thermite and satchel charges, and personally watched from atop the concertainer as the bonfires flared up one by one, each briefly illuminating the scuttling, crawling stream of bodies before snuffing out.\n\n\n\nNot a single crewman had belayed the order. \n\n\n\nNot a single one had made it back behind the walls.\n\n\n\nThe emplacement itself would hold for a while longer, at least. He\u2019d ordered the M113s, alongside the remaining Bradleys, up onto dirt ramps, depressing their Vulcans over the palisade to fire point-blank into the horde as they scrabbled and scratched at the base of the walls. Jefferson was confident that they\u2019d manage to keep the demons at bay for as long as the ammo held out. \n\n\n\nBy his most generous estimates, they\u2019d last for another half-hour. \n\n\n\nStaring through the blood-mist at his crumbling frontline, Commander Lionel Jefferson comes to the terrible realization that the Montana National Guard genuinely might\u2019ve done better in his position. For the first time in twenty years of honorable service, despair sets in. \n\n\n\nThere was only so much you could do with a scalpel, however sharp, when arrayed against an exploding volcano.\n\n\n\n\u201cPriority one is making sure the Overseer makes it out alive. Send five men from my alpha company to the lab. Make sure she\u2019s on the first truck out of here. Start evacuating the backline staff to the minimum viable fallback distance alongside the remaining garrison force. Send anyone left to the front. Ping Overwatch, flag STARFIRE BRAVO NOVA, and tell the nukies to get the bomb ready. We\u2019re going to take out as many of these fuckers-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOVERSEER ON DECK!\u201d\n\n\n\nThrough the din, through the artillery, the sounds of slaughter, and the screeching of Hell, those three words cut like a prayer. \n\n\n\nJefferson turns towards the entrance of the command post. \n\n\n\nO5-7 is standing there, a flock of white coats trailing reverently in her wake, faces cast in supplicant admiration. Her thin blonde hair is unwound, falling around her shoulders in scraggly streams, and she\u2019s smiling. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing nervous about it this time, no hint of uncertainty or doubt. It\u2019s a smile that casts a shadow, balanced on the knife\u2019s edge of wild, unconscious charisma and cackling madness. It\u2019s a smile that cuts like a tungsten rod dropped from orbit.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the smile of one about to do the impossible.\n\n\n\nAgainst all experience, all rational belief, all smatterings of common sense, Jefferson feels his heart beating with wild hope. His arm is raised in salute. He doesn\u2019t even remember doing it. The tent is quiet. The battle is quiet. Hell itself seems to have gone quiet. \n\n\n\nThe Overseer\u2019s command rings out like the edict of a demigod. \n\n\n\n\u201cI need to borrow your nuclear bomb.\u201d\n\n------\n\n++ ##red |4.

The earth roils and fractures. Sections of the barricade are brought to ruin, its defenders dismayed, dismounting their vehicles and running for shelter, knowing themselves as ants in a titanomachy. High above, in the upper atmosphere, the air crackles and snaps with thaumoelectric discharge. The wind comes, dry and hot, smelling of ozone and blood. Some of the white-coats drop to their knees, crumpling to the ground like paper dolls. The rest continue the incantation, blinking sweat from bloodshot eyes.

What concertainer segments remain intact are recovered, the rest reduced to rubble by acetylene torches and demolition charges. Concertina wire is respooled, foxholes and earthworks concealed and flattened by a small squadron of bulldozers. \n\n\n\nIn the end, the hellgate itself proves almost a mercy. Burnt out Bradleys and brass casings are collected, then piled en masse into the gaping maw. The first shovelful of dirt falls into the pit accompanied by rousing cheers. It\u2019s bitter work, but spirits are high. \n\n\n\nAfter all, they\u2019ve just saved the world.\n\n\n\nFoundation webcrawlers scour the internet, corrupting data, erasing files, deleting photos.

There is a garrison left behind, token perimeter security and a squad of glum-faced researchers who, having drawn short straws, will stay on-site for another three months, monitoring spacetime integrity and any lingering tartarean contamination. Seven attempts a pep talk, reciting the platitudes One bade her memorize by rote. The words feel plastic, artificial, but she sees their backs straighten nonetheless. She walks away before they can attempt a salute.\n\n\n\nSeven stretches out in the mercifully empty backseat of the Humvee, letting out a shuddering breath. Thaumic exhaustion roils beneath her skin, flaring into painful spasms that leave her wincing, rubbing at her arms.\u00a0\u00a0She wonders at the lengths Jefferson must have gone to reserve an entire vehicle for her personal use, stifling a guilty smirk as she pictures a squad of grim-faced operators sitting stoically in each other\u2019s laps. \n\n\n\nHer eyes slip shut, just for a moment.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"omalley\"]]\n\nCigarette smoke curls dimly in the blue light, spun into a slow vortex by the ceiling fan.

The armed wing and its command will take a couple of meetings to establish, besides-\" Mikhail was cut off as his partner pulled him in for a hug.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the two awoke in each other's embrace while the first rays of sunshine crept into the stalinist-era apartment. Both were hungover, an empty bottle of vodka still resting on the table next to the bed-couch. Outside their apartment, the first snow of the year fell.</p>\n<p>The two sobered up by the next hour, threw their trash out, showered and both got ready to leave. Mikhail for his desk job, Volya to the repair shop. As the two were about to go, however, Mikhail heard the question.</p>\n<p>\"So, Comrade Che, what are our first targets?\" His partner asked, putting on a coat. \"I know, still working on it, but we will have to start with something\u2026you know, a commander, or other important guy\".</p>\n<p>\"Well, we\u2026do not have much intelligence. We'd go to Portland's, but\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"But? Thought they hate the Gock's there. Plus everyone there knows everything!\"</p>\n<p>Mikhail audibly sighed at that and looked down, sliding a shoehorn into his boot. \"Coalition got Portlands. They're shooting anyone who goes in or out. It might as well just be a big concentration camp in there\".</p>\n<p>\"Ah.\" Volya nodded, seemingly unfazed. \"Any other sources?\"</p>\n<p>\"Enu said she knows of a few Coalition informers in La Rue. We've got a plan to take them prisoner and make them tell us where other units are. Aside from that\u2026\" Mikhail looked down, at his shoe. An idea ever so slowly crept into his mind. He smiled, then looked up. \"Well, I was contacted by the\u2026Security Protectorate, I think they call themselves? A large anti-GOC group. They told me a member of them could meet me in three weeks and provide intelligence.\"</p>\n<p>\"And when were you planning on tackling those informers in La Rue? I assume you want to \"interview\" them yourself.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Also in three weeks.\"</p>\n<p>Mikhail paused, only now realizing how the dates lined up. He had to either delay the operation, or the meeting. Neither of which he could allow, given how precious the time was. That is, until Volya spoke.</p>\n<p>\"I could take care of it. I'm sure you're tired of all this diplomacy, eh?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em><strong>THREE MONTHS LATER</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Once more, he had to say goodbye. For a shorter time, of course, but Mikhail's heart still hurt as he waved back to his partner, unsure if he will return in one piece. At least he knew Volya will, for the first time in a good while, not be putting his life in danger.</p>\n<p>The tunnel was moist and cramped, as before, though rather than the relatively cool and prestine meeting room, it led to a place of the same warmth and humidity. At least Mikhail wasn't being crushed from all sides by meat, however. Having escaped the tunnel, he looks again, seeing the near-endless swamp.</p>\n<p>\"You are Mr. Kurdin, yes?\"</p>\n<p>A young man, dressed in rags and with a ritual knife attached to his belt, approached him. Mikhail responded with a weak nod, at which the youngester turned around and gestured for him to follow. Stepping onto a small, wooden dock below which floated a collection of bone-crafted canoe sat.</p>\n<p>\"Are there crocodiles here?\" Mikhail asked, as he lowered he very carefully lowered his right leg onto the canoe and carefully establishing balance. A second later, his left leg lifted off the ground\u2026only for him to loose balance and land right in the swampy water below.</p>\n<p>\"Of course there are!\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Volya made his way down the streets of Moscow, having no idea where he was meant to go or be. He wasn't the one for playing a detective, but it seemed like that was exactly what they wanted from him now. \"Find an unremarkable man, in a trenchcoat, you'll know when you see him. Near Prospekt Mira\". Pfft! Everyone in this city was unremarkable.</p>\n<p>\"This is some bullshit\u2026\"</p>\n<p>He said, sitting down at a bench overlooking the nearby medical university. He was more than exhausted, and here he thought being a diplomat for once would be relaxing. And he hasn't even found the one he was meant to talk with yet! He sighed and looked upwards, at the rapidly descending sun.</p>\n<p>\"You seem exhausted, young gentleman. Care for a smoke?\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh? Sure.\" Volodymyr answered, not even looking at the one asking him that. Their british accent was odd, yes, but this was probably a tourist. Pulling a lighter out of his pocket, he snatched the offered cigarette and took a good, long whiff.</p>\n<p>\"Beautiful city you have here. The Kremlin is so\u2026impressive, up close.\" The man said, grabbing his own stick of cancer and putting it in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I'm from Saint Petersburg. Who are you, anyways?\"</p>\n<p>To that, the man smiled. Volya could see him in the corner of his vision now. \"You are are aware that could be spiked, right?\" THe tall figure, dressed in a dark coat and a grey high hat chuckled as they saw him spit it right out. \"But me? I'm Nobody.\"</p>\n<p>Confused, Volya raised his eyebrow and looked more closely at the man. A light stubble on his chin, brown eyes, the face of someone in their late 40's. The most average man he could imagine. He opened his mouth, unsure if he wanted to insult the stranger or ask him what's his purpose, before he was cut off early.</p>\n<p>\"And you're Volodymyr Udovychenko, I assume?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"So, Mr. Legba, you are sure these are Coalition infiltrators?\"</p>\n<p>The old man across from Mikhail shook his head, a smile on his face as he does so. He looks Mikhail straight in the eyes. \"You doubtin' me, sonny? Yeah, I saw them weirdos snoopin' around, stickin' they noses where they don't belong. So I go up the one of them' shacks, and guess what? All there, talkin' about sendin' photos to some \"Undersecretary\". Ain't that what they call the one in charge of the coalition, hm?\"</p>\n<p>Mikhail nodded in response. \"It is. In that case, we can't thank you enough, Mr. Le-\"</p>\n<p>\"Ain't no Mister around here. Papa Legba, they call me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Understood.\"</p>\n<p>Mikhail turned back to his \"party\". It was made up of members of both the Natau family, as well as Sabatier's from the Dark Lodge. There were 6 of them, 7 if he was to include himself. He struck a mosquito that landed on his shoulder, before taking a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone remembers the plan?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course! Joules and I hold the Nol\u00e4nya, Aledai guards us, Julie, Elise and Adrien wait on the other side.\"</p>\n<p>Mikhail look at the two in frustration, as they swung around the mass of flesh with a barnacle-like opening at the top, its brown and slimy tentacles still flailing around. \"You don't hold it, you'll paralyze yourselves. You point it at the blue's, then you let go of it. Is that clear?\"</p>\n<p>The 20-something Natau member rolled his eyes and let out a simple \"fine\", before laying the creature down. Mikhail really didn't like how they were handling it, he knew how much trouble they would have with Abraxas should they damage one of their toys.</p>\n<p>\"Before ya go, young man, have this\" He handed Mikhail a large, metallic object. Looking down, he saw a revolver. It was an old looking one, clearly with at least a hundred years. Together with it, Lega handed him a packet of ammunition. He was about to decline, before the elder shushed him. \"Now, now. Know what'cha gonna say. As I told'ya, I don't want no mess around these parts. But if it turns to one, I'd rather have ya people walking out in one piece, than in a dozen, and ya don't seem like one to go swordfightin' and stabbin'. Understood?\"</p>\n<p>Mikhail simply nodded, eyes still fixed on the gun. It was true, he didn't know how to use bone spear or other traditional weapons. Neither had he any idea on on how to shoot.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"An interesting story you have told me, Mr. Udovychenko. This Ion fella seems like a noble gentleman\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Hearing that produced an annoyed groan from the man. \"Just call me Volya, sir\" He said, throwing the half-burn cigarette onto the sidewalk before them. \"Some of us think he's still here, or that he's gonna return soon. He's sure taking his sweet time if so, blyat\"</p>\n<p>\"It's funny, Mister Volya, this is not the first time I have met those who use the magic of their ancestors and await patiently for the return of their leader. Those folk in Obskura sure are-\"</p>\n<p>Volya looked at Nobody with a killer's expression, hearing that. If he was caught in any worse mood, he would have punched this \"Nobody\" right there and then. Instead, he looked as the man slowly raised his hand in a defensive gesture.</p>\n<p>\"I am sorry, I did not mean to offen\" He shook his head, extinguishing his own smoke against the bench, before throwing it into the nearby bin. \"I have to say, up until now, you didn't seem like the most\u2026devout man, why is that?\"</p>\n<p>\"We're not a religion you're \"devout\" to, we're a movement\" A chuckle escaped Volya, before he looked down. \"My partner convinced me to join, those 6 years ago. It seemed\u2026very weird, at first. Cannibalism, flesh magic, living temples. But\u2026they're good people! I would say.\"</p>\n<p>Nobody gave him an uncomfortably warm, long smile as he said that, before shaking his head. Placing his hand on Volya's shoulder, he finally spoke. \"Not the first time we've heard of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, Mr. Volya\"</p>\n<p>He furrowed his brow at that, waiting for Nobody to follow up on that. Instead, the mysterious man just took his hand off of Volya's shoulder and reached under the bench, putting a briefcase on his lap. \"But I see we've made some assumptions we shouldn't have. Seems bias can't escape even our enlightened few, can it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh? Thought we kept ourselves from people well enough. Didn't know half of the veil knows ud already\"</p>\n<p>Nobody shook his head. \"Just one of us knows anything in specific. He calls himself a \"Mekhanite\", I believe\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Night in La Rue was even worse than the day, Mikhail now realized. Walking through the vermin infested swamp with just a single flashlight, he was bitten by more mosquitos than his regenerating body could handle, and that was after covering himself in mosquito spray! The others didn't seem to suffer the same fate, their bodies flesh-shaped in order to repell the insects of the swamp. He should have asked them what rituals they used for it.</p>\n<p>Finally, they saw it. The shack of the spies, surrounded by trees and standing right at the edge of the endless swamp that surrounded the pocket dimension. All 7 dropped down and began to slowly crawl towards it. Out of the group, he wasn't the only armed member, others carrying their blades and spears. All were to be used as backup. \"This will be a bloodless affair\", he kept repeating like a mantra.</p>\n<p>A man and a woman sat around the campfire, while two more figures were visible inside the shack. The group slowly surrounded them, leaving the only opening in front of the shack. Mikhail waited, with a branch in his hand, ready to break it as the signal to release the Nol\u00e4nya. In the meantime, he attempted to listen to the conversation before him.</p>\n<p>\"Got that brew Legba said he'd give?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, yeah. You know, he's a fun one. It sucks we've gotta-\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Luke, come on. Don't be saying that, someone's gonna record it and leadership will whoop our asses again\"</p>\n<p>Just like that, the dialogue was cut short as the two other men exited the shack into the backyard, proclaiming that \"Alright! Update sent\". Arms shaking, Mikhail put all his strength into breaking the branch. Seconds later, as the group turned in his direction, a screech could be heard behind them. A cloud of yellow spores burst in the air, flying right towards the infiltrators.</p>\n<p>The man the group has identified as Luke fell face first onto the ground, without time to run or call for help. Seconds later\u2026nothing happened. The creature let out another screech, but another burst of the yellow fog was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>\"Fucking Abraxas!\" Was all Mikhail got to say before shots rang out across the forest, the remaining trio pulling out pistols and spreading out. Just as Mikhail spotted a piece of cover nearby, they began shooting at the tree line. \"Retreat!\"</p>\n<p>As he ducked behind a tree, he could hear that his command fell on deaf ears. Or maybe his team didn't hear him among the gunshots? Whatever was the case, he could see the boy he had scolded before, weilding a knife and having abandoned the unreliable biological weapon, running among the trees and closer to the GOC personnel. Trying to gesture for him to go back, he finds himself under more fire, the tree giving him cover rapidly falling apart.</p>\n<p>\"Wha-FUCK!\"</p>\n<p>He heard a yell, followed by the sight of the injured and bleeding Natau member running back, without their knife. The shots cease, allowing him to peak over the cover. The sight of the rapidly swelling and bleeding body of the female GOC infiltrator, running towards her comrades, fills him with equal parts disgust and relief. He could still see the weapon lodged in her back. Seconds later, the body slumps over as it is shot by one of the combatants.</p>\n<p>Just as they attempt to withdraw into the shack, a bone-spear impacts one of them, right in the neck and creating a fountain of blood as it tore clean through an artery. Mikhail stands stunned for a moment, before he looks back at the shack, into its windows. The inside is filled with cables and monitors, one showing the words \"booting\" on its screen. \"Of course\", he thought to himself, \"they're trying to call for backup\". And so, he gave chase.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"I see. It's not that you are enemies, but that one side had assumed the other was. Is that correct?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose.\" Volya shrugged. It did take a lot of mental strength not to go into a rant about those god-worshippers and stay objective. \"But your ally uh, what was his name?\"</p>\n<p>\"Gibson.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that machine worshipper, he agreed to work with us already, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"After much convincing, yes. On a basis of having a common enemy.\" Nobody answered, resulting in an awkward few seconds of silence. Finally, he reached under the bench, pulling out a Brown suitcase and sitting it on his lap. \"If I may, Mister, what does \"N\u00e4lk\u00e4\" mean to you?\"</p>\n<p>He found himself at a loss for words at that question. He never really considered it since joining NNM.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose\u2026brotherhood?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm?\"</p>\n<p>\"Knowing there are others, with the same goals. You know, making people immortal, healthy, feeding everyone. It's just good to know others want that, and are trying to get that, too. Right?\" He chuckled. \"I'd join even if it wasn't based on the words of some 4 thousand year old anarchist.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see\" Nobody nodded his head, before looking down at the suitcase. \"I believe that is everything I need to know from you, Volya. I will have to discuss it with other members of the council. But until then, I have something for you.\"</p>\n<p>Volya raised his eyebrow.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Mikhail dropped the gun, his hands still shaking and his ears still ringing. The room was filled with the smell of gunpowder, illuminated by the light of error screens and stained with blood. In front of him laid the body of a GOC agent, hand still on the keyboard, with a single gunshot wound to the head. The PC was sho cleanly through as well, while the rest of the bullets broke through they shack's wall</p>\n<p>He was broken out of his trance as suddenly, someone touched his shoulder. It was Adonis, the same young Man he saw with bullets lodged into his body, standing in front of him now. His flesh seems to have mended much faster than one would expect.<br/>\n-<br/>\n\"Is everything okay? I am sorry we didn't-\"</p>\n<p>\"It is okay, I\u2026\" Mikhail shook his head. \"I just need a moment. Is that one alive?\"</p>\n<p>He stepped over to the window as he asked, seeing the team pick up the paralyzed GOC agent. His arm twitched as they carried him away, seemingly a sign of life.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, I think?\"</p>\n<p>He shook his head, \"I am sorry, you've done a great job, you all did. Tell that to the team, alright?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Volya opened the suitcase in front of him, finding a lot inside. Much more than his brain could process. Coordinates, photos, names and maps. He looked up at Nobody, then back at the suitcase.</p>\n<p>\"This\u2026we're getting all of this from you, for free?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not exactly. The Protectorate would like to have some sort of guarantee that this won't fall into the hands of the GOC. Where your people are located, where their influence extends, what the Congress' long term goal are. The usual stuff\"</p>\n<p>\"Here and now?\" He didn't know the answers to most of that. Mikhail was the one who dealt with history and paperwork. And he was now out there in some swamp on the other side of the globe, working as a guerilla.</p>\n<p>\"Pardon?\"</p>\n<p>He shoudn't have asked to switch roles.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em><strong>THE NEXT DAY</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"I'm ho-\"</p>\n<p>Before the tired Mikhail could finish, he would be met with a hug, his face shoved right into his partner's beard and his body almost crushed under his muscle. He gasped for air after being released a moment later.</p>\n<p>\"Man, I missed you so much. How was it there, Subcomandante?\"</p>\n<p>To that, Mikhail just gave him a tired smile, before collapsing on a nearby couch.</p>\n<p>\"Man, I'm not built for military.\"</p>\n<p>Volya sat down next to him, wrapping a hand around him, the laughed.</p>\n<p>\"Neither am I for diplomacy.\"</p>\n<div class=\"earthworm earthworm--old-syntax-first-false earthworm--old-syntax-last-false earthworm--old-syntax-hub-false {$class}\">\n<div class=\"first earthworm__previous\" data-title=\"A Union of N\u00e4lk\u00e4\">\n\n<p><a href=\"/nalka-union\">A Union of N\u00e4lk\u00e4</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub earthworm__hub\" data-title=\"Mundus, Liberari\">\n<p><a href=\"/mundus-liberari\">Mundus, Liberari</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last earthworm__next\" data-title=\"To be continued\">\n\n<p><a href=\"/Pa\">To be continued</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-highlighter-theme\">:scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:onko-sinulla-nalka-theme\">:scp-wiki:theme:onko-sinulla-nalka-theme</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n:root {\n\n\n\n--body-font: \"recursive\";\n\n--title-font: \"recursive\" ;\n\n--header-font:\u00a0\u00a0\"recursive\";\n\n--UI-font: \"recursive\";\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--header-title: \"PAN-N\u00c4LK\u00c4 CONGRESS\";\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--header-subtitle: \"\";\n\n}\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#content-wrap {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0background-image: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aonko-sinulla-nalka-theme/PaperTextureSarkic.png), url(\"\");\n\nbackground-size: auto, 28%;\n\n\u00a0background-position: left top, right top;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0background-repeat: repeat, no-repeat;\n\n\n\n#main-content hr{\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0display: block;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0border:0px;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0height:2px;\n\nbackground-color: black;\n\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat;\n\nbackground-position: center;\n\nbackground-size: 1%;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0background-image:url('');\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"code\" style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n\n\n**Author's Note:** This is the third part in a 4 chapter series.

The armed wing and its command will take a couple of meetings to establish, besides-\" Mikhail was cut off as his partner pulled him in for a hug.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, the two awoke in each other's embrace while the first rays of sunshine crept into the stalinist-era apartment. Both were hungover, an empty bottle of vodka still resting on the table next to the bed-couch. Outside their apartment, the first snow of the year fell.\n\n\n\nThe two sobered up by the next hour, threw their trash out, showered and both got ready to leave. Mikhail for his desk job, Volya to the repair shop. As the two were about to go, however, Mikhail heard the question.\n\n\n\n\"So, Comrade Che, what are our first targets?\" His partner asked, putting on a coat. \"I know, still working on it, but we will have to start with something...you know, a commander, or other important guy\".\n\n\n\n\"Well, we...do not have much intelligence. We'd go to Portland's, but...\"\n\n\n\n\"But? Thought they hate the Gock's there. Plus everyone there knows everything!\"\n\n\n\nMikhail audibly sighed at that and looked down, sliding a shoehorn into his boot. \"Coalition got Portlands. They're shooting anyone who goes in or out. It might as well just be a big concentration camp in there\".\n\n\n\n\"Ah.\" Volya nodded, seemingly unfazed. \"Any other sources?\"\n\n\n\n\"Enu said she knows of a few Coalition informers in La Rue. We've got a plan to take them prisoner and make them tell us where other units are. Aside from that...\" Mikhail looked down, at his shoe. An idea ever so slowly crept into his mind. He smiled, then looked up. \"Well, I was contacted by the...Security Protectorate, I think they call themselves? A large anti-GOC group. They told me a member of them could meet me in three weeks and provide intelligence.\"\n\n\n\n\"And when were you planning on tackling those informers in La Rue? I assume you want to \"interview\" them yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\"...Also in three weeks.\"\n\n\n\nMikhail paused, only now realizing how the dates lined up. He had to either delay the operation, or the meeting. Neither of which he could allow, given how precious the time was. That is, until Volya spoke.\n\n\n\n\"I could take care of it. I'm sure you're tired of all this diplomacy, eh?\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n//**THREE MONTHS LATER**//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOnce more, he had to say goodbye. For a shorter time, of course, but Mikhail's heart still hurt as he waved back to his partner, unsure if he will return in one piece. At least he knew Volya will, for the first time in a good while, not be putting his life in danger.\n\n\n\nThe tunnel was moist and cramped, as before, though rather than the relatively cool and prestine meeting room, it led to a place of the same warmth and humidity. At least Mikhail wasn't being crushed from all sides by meat, however. Having escaped the tunnel, he looks again, seeing the near-endless swamp.\n\n\n\n\"You are Mr. Kurdin, yes?\"\n\n\n\nA young man, dressed in rags and with a ritual knife attached to his belt, approached him. Mikhail responded with a weak nod, at which the youngester turned around and gestured for him to follow. Stepping onto a small, wooden dock below which floated a collection of bone-crafted canoe sat. \n\n\n\n\"Are there crocodiles here?\" Mikhail asked, as he lowered he very carefully lowered his\u00a0\u00a0right leg onto the canoe and carefully establishing balance. A second later, his left leg lifted off the ground...only for him to loose balance and land right in the swampy water below.\n\n\n\n\"Of course there are!\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nVolya made his way down the streets of Moscow, having no idea where he was meant to go or be. He wasn't the one for playing a detective, but it seemed like that was exactly what they wanted from him now. \"Find an unremarkable man, in a trenchcoat, you'll know when you see him. Near Prospekt Mira\". Pfft! Everyone in this city was unremarkable.\n\n\n\n\"This is some bullshit...\"\n\n\n\nHe said, sitting down at a bench overlooking the nearby medical university. He was more than exhausted, and here he thought being a diplomat for once would be relaxing. And he hasn't even found the one he was meant to talk with yet! He sighed and looked upwards, at the rapidly descending sun.\n\n\n\n\"You seem exhausted, young gentleman. Care for a smoke?\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh? Sure.\" Volodymyr answered, not even looking at the one asking him that. Their british accent was odd, yes, but this was probably a tourist. Pulling a lighter out of his pocket, he snatched the offered cigarette and took a good, long whiff.\n\n\n\n\"Beautiful city you have here. The Kremlin is so...impressive, up close.\" The man said, grabbing his own stick of cancer and putting it in his mouth.\n\n\n\n\"I'm from Saint Petersburg. Who are you, anyways?\"\n\n\n\nTo that, the man smiled. Volya could see him in the corner of his vision now. \"You are are aware that could be spiked, right?\" THe tall figure, dressed in a dark coat and a grey high hat chuckled as they saw him spit it right out. \"But me? I'm Nobody.\"\n\n\n\nConfused, Volya raised his eyebrow and looked more closely at the man. A light stubble on his chin, brown eyes, the face of someone in their late 40's. The most average man he could imagine. He opened his mouth, unsure if he wanted to insult the stranger or ask him what's his purpose, before he was cut off early.\n\n\n\n\"And you're Volodymyr Udovychenko, I assume?\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"So, Mr. Legba, you are sure these are Coalition infiltrators?\"\n\n\n\nThe old man across from Mikhail shook his head, a smile on his face as he does so. He looks Mikhail straight in the eyes. \"You doubtin' me, sonny? Yeah, I saw them weirdos snoopin' around, stickin' they noses where they don't belong. So I go up the one of them' shacks, and guess what? All there, talkin' about sendin' photos to some \"Undersecretary\". Ain't that what they call the one in charge of the coalition, hm?\"\n\n\n\nMikhail nodded in response. \"It is. In that case, we can't thank you enough, Mr. Le-\"\n\n\n\n\"Ain't no Mister around here. Papa Legba, they call me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Understood.\" \n\n\n\nMikhail turned back to his \"party\". It was made up of members of both the Natau family, as well as Sabatier's from the Dark Lodge. There were 6 of them, 7 if he was to include himself. He struck a mosquito that landed on his shoulder, before taking a deep breath.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone remembers the plan?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course! Joules and I hold the Nol\u00e4nya, Aledai guards us, Julie, Elise and Adrien wait on the other side.\"\n\n\n\nMikhail look at the two in frustration, as they swung around the mass of flesh with a barnacle-like opening at the top, its brown and slimy tentacles still flailing around. \"You don't hold it, you'll paralyze yourselves. You point it at the blue's, then you let go of it. Is that clear?\"\n\n\n\nThe 20-something Natau member rolled his eyes and let out a simple \"fine\", before laying the creature down. Mikhail really didn't like how they were handling it, he knew how much trouble they would have with Abraxas should they damage one of their toys.\n\n\n\n\"Before ya go, young man, have this\" He handed Mikhail a large, metallic object. Looking down, he saw a revolver. It was an old looking one, clearly with at least a hundred years. Together with it, Lega handed him a packet of ammunition. He was about to decline, before the elder shushed him. \"Now, now. Know what'cha gonna say. As I told'ya, I don't want no mess around these parts. But if it turns to one, I'd rather have ya people walking out in one piece, than in a dozen, and ya don't seem like one to go swordfightin' and stabbin'. Understood?\"\n\n\n\nMikhail simply nodded, eyes still fixed on the gun. It was true, he didn't know how to use bone spear or other traditional weapons. Neither had he any idea on on how to shoot.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"An interesting story you have told me, Mr. Udovychenko. This Ion fella seems like a noble gentleman...\"\n\n\n\nHearing that produced an annoyed groan from the man. \"Just call me Volya, sir\" He said, throwing the half-burn cigarette onto the sidewalk before them. \"Some of us think he's still here, or that he's gonna return soon. He's sure taking his sweet time if so, blyat\"\n\n\n\n\"It's funny, Mister Volya, this is not the first time I have met those who use the magic of their ancestors and await patiently for the return of their leader. Those folk in Obskura sure are-\"\n\n\n\nVolya looked at Nobody with a killer's expression, hearing that. If he was caught in any worse mood, he would have punched this \"Nobody\" right there and then. Instead, he looked as the man slowly raised his hand in a defensive gesture.\n\n\n\n\"I am sorry, I did not mean to offen\" He shook his head, extinguishing his own smoke against the bench, before throwing it into the nearby bin. \"I have to say, up until now, you didn't seem like the most...devout man, why is that?\"\n\n\n\n\"We're not a religion you're \"devout\" to, we're a movement\" A chuckle escaped Volya, before he looked down. \"My partner convinced me to join, those 6 years ago. It seemed...very weird, at first. Cannibalism, flesh magic, living temples. But...they're good people! I would say.\"\n\n\n\nNobody gave him an uncomfortably warm, long smile as he said that, before shaking his head. Placing his hand on Volya's shoulder, he finally spoke. \"Not the first time we've heard of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, Mr. Volya\"\n\n\n\nHe furrowed his brow at that, waiting for Nobody to follow up on that. Instead, the mysterious man just took his hand off of Volya's shoulder and reached under the bench, putting a briefcase on his lap. \"But I see we've made some assumptions we shouldn't have. Seems bias can't escape even our enlightened few, can it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh? Thought we kept ourselves from people well enough. Didn't know half of the veil knows ud already\"\n\n\n\nNobody shook his head. \"Just one of us knows anything in specific. He calls himself a \"Mekhanite\", I believe\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nNight in La Rue was even worse than the day, Mikhail now realized. Walking through the vermin infested swamp with just a single flashlight, he was bitten by more mosquitos than his regenerating body could handle, and that was after covering himself in mosquito spray! The others didn't seem to suffer the same fate, their bodies flesh-shaped in order to repell the insects of the swamp. He should have asked them what rituals they used for it.\n\n\n\nFinally, they saw it. The shack of the spies, surrounded by trees and standing right at the edge of the endless swamp that surrounded the pocket dimension. All 7 dropped down and began to slowly crawl towards it. Out of the group, he wasn't the only armed member, others carrying their blades and spears. All were to be used as backup. \"This will be a bloodless affair\", he kept repeating like a mantra.\n\n\n\nA man and a woman sat around the campfire, while two more figures were visible inside the shack. The group slowly surrounded them, leaving the only opening in front of the shack. Mikhail waited, with a branch in his hand, ready to break it as the signal to release the Nol\u00e4nya. In the meantime, he attempted to listen to the conversation before him.\n\n\n\n\"Got that brew Legba said he'd give?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. You know, he's a fun one. It sucks we've gotta-\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Luke, come on. Don't be saying that, someone's gonna record it and leadership will whoop our asses again\"\n\n\n\nJust like that, the dialogue was cut short as the two other men exited the shack into the backyard, proclaiming that \"Alright! Update sent\". Arms shaking, Mikhail put all his strength into breaking the branch. Seconds later, as the group turned in his direction, a screech could be heard behind them. A cloud of yellow spores burst in the air, flying right towards the infiltrators.\n\n\n\nThe man the group has identified as Luke fell face first onto the ground, without time to run or call for help. Seconds later...nothing happened. The\u00a0\u00a0creature let out another screech, but another burst of the yellow fog was nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n\"Fucking Abraxas!\" Was all Mikhail got to say before shots rang out across the forest, the remaining trio pulling out pistols and spreading out. Just as Mikhail spotted a piece of cover nearby, they began shooting at the tree line. \"Retreat!\"\n\n\n\nAs he ducked behind a tree, he could hear that his command fell on deaf ears. Or maybe his team didn't hear him among the gunshots? Whatever was the case, he could see the boy he had scolded before, weilding a knife and having abandoned the unreliable biological weapon, running among the trees and closer to the GOC personnel. Trying to gesture for him to go back, he finds himself under more fire, the tree giving him cover rapidly falling apart.\n\n\n\n\"Wha-FUCK!\"\n\n\n\nHe heard a yell, followed by the sight of the injured and bleeding Natau member running back, without their knife. The shots cease, allowing him to peak over the cover. The sight of the rapidly swelling and bleeding body of the female GOC infiltrator, running towards her comrades, fills him with equal parts disgust and relief. He could still see the weapon lodged in her back. Seconds later, the body slumps over as it is shot by one of the combatants. \n\n\n\nJust as they attempt to withdraw into the shack, a bone-spear impacts one of them, right in the neck and creating a fountain of blood as it tore clean through an artery. Mikhail stands stunned for a moment, before he looks back at the shack, into its windows. The inside is filled with cables and monitors, one showing the words \"booting\" on its screen. \"Of course\", he thought to himself, \"they're trying to call for backup\". And so, he gave chase.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"I see. It's not that you are enemies, but that one side had assumed the other was. Is that correct?\" \n\n\n\n\"I suppose.\" Volya shrugged. It did take a lot of mental strength not to go into a rant about those god-worshippers and stay objective. \"But your ally uh, what was his name?\"\n\n\n\n\"Gibson.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that machine worshipper, he agreed to work with us already, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"After much convincing, yes. On a basis of having a common enemy.\" Nobody answered, resulting in an awkward few seconds of silence. Finally, he reached under the bench, pulling out a Brown suitcase and sitting it on his lap. \"If I may, Mister, what does \"N\u00e4lk\u00e4\" mean to you?\"\n\n\n\nHe found himself at a loss for words at that question. He never really considered it since joining NNM.\n\n\n\n\"I suppose...brotherhood?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Knowing there are others, with the same goals. You know, making people immortal, healthy, feeding everyone. It's just good to know others want that, and are trying to get that, too. Right?\" He chuckled. \"I'd join even if it wasn't based on the words of some 4 thousand year old anarchist.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see\" Nobody nodded his head, before looking down at the suitcase. \"I believe that is everything I need to know from you, Volya. I will have to discuss it with other members of the council. But until then, I have something for you.\"\n\n\n\nVolya raised his eyebrow.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMikhail dropped the gun, his hands still shaking and his ears still ringing. The room was filled with the smell of gunpowder, illuminated by the light of error screens and stained with blood. In front of him laid the body of a GOC agent, hand still on the keyboard, with a single gunshot wound to the head. The PC was sho cleanly through as well, while the rest of the bullets broke through they shack's wall\n\n\n\nHe was broken out of his trance as suddenly, someone touched his shoulder. It was Adonis, the same young Man he saw with bullets lodged into his body, standing in front of him now. His flesh seems to have mended much faster than one would expect.\n\n-\n\n\"Is everything okay? I am sorry we didn't-\"\n\n\n\n\"It is okay, I...\" Mikhail shook his head. \"I just need a moment. Is that one alive?\"\n\n\n\nHe stepped over to the window as he asked, seeing the team pick up the paralyzed GOC agent. His arm twitched as they carried him away, seemingly a sign of life.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, I think?\"\n\n\n\nHe shook his head, \"I am sorry, you've done a great job, you all did. Tell that to the team, alright?\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nVolya opened the suitcase in front of him, finding a lot inside. Much more than his brain could process. Coordinates, photos, names and maps. He looked up at Nobody, then back at the suitcase.\n\n\n\n\"This...we're getting all of this from you, for free?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not exactly. The Protectorate would like to have some sort of guarantee that this won't fall into the hands of the GOC. Where your people are located, where their influence extends, what the Congress' long term goal are. The usual stuff\"\n\n\n\n\"Here and now?\" He didn't know the answers to most of that. Mikhail was the one who dealt with history and paperwork. And he was now out there in some swamp on the other side of the globe, working as a guerilla. \n\n\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\n\nHe shoudn't have asked to switch roles.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n//**THE NEXT DAY**//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"I'm ho-\"\n\n\n\nBefore the tired Mikhail could finish, he would be met with a hug, his face shoved right into his partner's beard and his body almost crushed under his muscle. He gasped for air after being released a moment later.\n\n\n\n\"Man, I missed you so much. How was it there, Subcomandante?\"\n\n\n\nTo that, Mikhail just gave him a tired smile, before collapsing on a nearby couch.\n\n\n\n\"Man, I'm not built for military.\"\n\n\n\nVolya sat down next to him, wrapping a hand around him, the laughed.\n\n\n\n\"Neither am I for diplomacy.\"\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=false | last=false | hub=false\n\n| previous-url=/nalka-union | previous-title=A Union of N\u00e4lk\u00e4\n\n| next-url=/Pa | next-title=To be continued\n\n| hub-url=/mundus-liberari | hub-title=Mundus, Liberari\n\n]]\n", "references": ["collective-punishment", "nalka-union", "mundus-liberari", "Pa"], "tags": ["adventure", "la-rue-macabre", "mundus-liberari", "sarkic", "tale"], "title": "First Shots - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/first-shots", "year": 2025}, "firstdayrestoflife": {"created_at": "2025-01-16T17:10:00", "creator": "AstersQuill", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-16T17:10:00"}, {"author": "AstersQuill", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/astersquill", "comment": "Added tags: _licensebox, agent-adams, agent-strelnikov, bittersweet, doctor-clef, doctor-glass, eventyr, fantasy, iris-thompson, tale, teenage-gaea.

Flight. Freeze. Fawn?</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p>When Hana Thompson first picked up photography as a hobby, her parents used to joke with her that \"a picture was worth a thousand words.\" Standing on the edge of the shoreline, she wished that her parents would be there beside her, if only so that she could show them how wrong they truly were.</p>\n<p>But she was alone, and had all the words in the world.</p>\n<p>With the push of a button, and the <em>click</em> of her camera, Hana does her best to capture the scene before her, to have something to remember her brief excursion outside the walls of her containment chamber before the door closes, the light fades, and her world once again fades away to darkness, if they decided to let her out again at all. The mechanics of the camera <em>whir</em>, and the dull plastic polygon spits out a photo. She holds it out before her, side-by-side with the natural vista.</p>\n<p>Ancient evergreens stretch themselves upwards, as if reaching for the low hanging clouds of the morning. Their old needles sprinkle the ground, shedding themselves of last season's coat for something newer, fresher, to wrap around themselves for the winter. A sprinkling of thin maples add the first drops of fall to the forest's palette, their bottom leaves like chameleons to the cooling nights, morph into tones of red and yellow. She captures a few rays of the sun peeking through the canopy, as well as a pair of songbirds. One sits on a branch, watching the other take flight towards another tree. A hawk circles overhead, watching for an out of place blade of grass or mistimed splash. The water lapping against the stony shore is nearly clear, far cleaner than the muddy docks of Site-19. Tiny fish sit under lily pads in piecemeal schools, waiting for the clouds to block out the sun before the collective travels elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It was\u2026 peaceful, and Hana could have sat forever, simply resting on the shore, listening to the natural beauty of it all. But as Hana's eyes move towards the horizon, she is met only with the clean white border of the picture's frame. There was no world for her anymore, nowhere else to go. She takes one last look at the photo, at the frame, at the box, and places it in her pocket. She had a mission to do, and there was only one path to lead her forward.</p>\n<p>She was whisked away from her room in the late afternoon, long after any of her usual testing or check-ups would take place, and was brought to the docks of Site-19. It was somewhat pitiful compared to the few memories Hana had of the waterfront growing up, with an army of rowboats and rubber dinghies where fishing vessels should have been. Dr. Glass was waiting at the far side of the dock, reading a collection of files, in a boat whose hull was patchwork with duct tape and slimy with green algae.</p>\n<p>Hana leaned over the side and dipped her hand in the water as the boat crawled across the lake with its sputtering engine. It had been so long, too long, and she swore she could see a younger version of herself in the wake, smiling as she chased impossibly fast minnows. Her daydreaming was cut short with a bump, and the clearing of Glass' throat.</p>\n<p>\"After reviewing your performance in <a href=\"/scp-6342\">Providence</a>, Director Light and I discussed your attendance for the upcoming fall semester. We're both on board with the idea, as well as your interest in becoming a full field agent, but we just wanted to see how you would handle yourself in a less\u2026 dangerous situation.\" He handed her a file, motioning for her to open it. After a few pages of neat, black highlighted text, she found what he wanted her to see.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><strong>\u00abSCP-8166-2 Case File\u00bb</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Age:</strong> 19</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8166-2 possesses physical characteristics similar to <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><em>Rangifer Tarandus</em></span> <em>Odocoileus virginianus</em> (White-tail deer) including: hooved feet, antlers, large ears, nose, and short tail. It is believed to possess a similar, docile nature.</p>\n<p>SCP-8166-2 possesses innate reality bending abilities. In present time, these abilities have only provided minimal damage to Foundation facilities, with observations noting minor appearance changes and the creation of food as a majority of ability usage.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\"As such, your mission today is retrieval,\" he adjusts his glasses. \"Just be sure to do your best, alright. If you're unable to complete this now, we can give it another try in a few months when you're ready,\" he explained.</p>\n<p><em>Fight. Flight. Freeze. Come on, Hana, you have a job to do. Don't let yourself get stuck here.</em></p>\n<p>\"If this means being able to leave this place, I'm as ready as I'll ever be,\" Hana says, looking at the treeline ahead of her. A ray of light cuts through the canopy, reflecting a prismatic hue off of rain droplets from what must have been a recent storm.</p>\n<p><em>Truly</em>, Hana thinks, <em>truly they couldn't be hiding something <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">this</span> beautiful in their prison.</em></p>\n<p>But, the moment of awe passes, and Hana Thompson bows her head before stepping deeper into the woods.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>After tripping on a web of roots, getting caught in the arm-like grasp of sapling branches, and swearing she passed the same tree three times, Hana arrives at a small stream she believes to be situated at the center of the island. The area looks somewhat well-travelled, littered with small tracks nearly indistinguishable in the soil, but also with much larger tracks that causes Hana to swallow down a wave of anxiety.</p>\n<p><em>Deer tracks are small, right? There's no way they dropped me off on an island with a monster.</em> She takes a deep breath. <em>Fight. Flight. Freeze. Keep going.</em></p>\n<p>A trail of grass intermingled with hoof marks leads to a log that rests by a small body of water with a scatter of similar marks imprinted in the mud and scratching white the tops of the flat stream rocks. As Hana approaches the log, she notices a collection of flowers blooming beneath it, with large, plate-like mushrooms seemingly anchoring it to the ground. The bark is smooth, uniform, and there's no sign of rot outside of it. She takes a seat at one end with a <em>huff</em>, and dips her hand in the stream, splashing some of its water on her forehead. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices a golden shine from within the log, and sticks her hand in to try to grab it. Her fingers brush the spine of a book, feeling out the words \"Fairy Tales and Stories, Translated.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, at least if anything comes after me now, I have something to protect myself with.\"</p>\n<p>She brings the heavy book up to her lap and carefully opens it, cautiously skimming through the pages until she reaches one titled <em>The Little Mermaid.</em> After reading a few paragraphs, she stops and turns her head.</p>\n<p>\"Huh. This isn't the Ariel I dressed up as. This version is so much\u2026 darker? Where are Sebastian and Flounder? Where are the singing fish?\"</p>\n<p>A bush shuffles behind her. Hana freezes, careful not to blink or even breathe enough to give her away.</p>\n<p>\"Fish do not sing, at least they have not to me. I do not think I would enjoy that in my story.\"</p>\n<p>Hana jumps straight up from the log, turning to face the unknown voice behind her. She takes her camera out from her pocket, thumb hovering over the shutter button. The figure is slightly taller than her and wears a white, patchy dress that doesn't look <a href=\"/hoovesandantlers\">quite correct on its body</a>. Its eyes, antlers, and the fawn spots freckling its face begin to dimly glow. It squeaks at her reaction, raising its hands and falling to the ground.</p>\n<p><em>Fight. Flight. Freeze.</em> Hana repeats. But she pauses. <em>Or fawn?</em></p>\n<p>\"I am sorry. Please do not harm me, I do not intend to hurt you.\" It says, with a voice slightly deeper than Hana was expecting. \"I know I look like a creature, but please, do not slay me as one.\"</p>\n<p>Fear wells in the creature's big eyes, its pupils dilated. Hana stares confused for a moment, probably a moment more than would be considered polite, fixated on the creature's winding antlers and alert ears. She places a hand on her chest, taking a deep breath and laughing.</p>\n<p>\"You're\u2026 not at all how I thought you would look from the file,\" Hana lowers her camera, allowing it to hang from its sling. She kneels and holds out a hand. \"Hello\u2026 deer woman? I am Hana Thompson, but a humble visitor to your island, an anomaly like yourself. I promise to bring you no harm.\"</p>\n<p>The clearing goes silent, as if every other living thing besides the pair had disappeared. The figure eyes her hand, though its expression softens to one of confusion rather than fear.</p>\n<p>\"What's your name?\" Hana continues, attempting to fill the dead air.</p>\n<p>The creature looks at her with surprise.</p>\n<p>\"M-Meri. My name is Meri Clef.\" Meri chokes out, her voice dry.</p>\n<p>\"Meri.\" Hana repeats. Meri's ears flick at the sound. \"I like that name. It's a happy name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hana,\" Meri repeats. \"I like your name too.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks! It means 'flower' where my dad is from.\" Hana takes a seat on the log, motioning for Meri to join her. After a second of hesitation, she does, though a comfortable distance away. The two sit in silence for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"Do you feel strongly around me?\" Meri shuffles her hands around. \"Sorry. There is something about you that is familiar. Like we have met in one of my dreams or at some point in the past.\"</p>\n<p>Hana pauses for a moment, observing her new acquaintance on the log. Her big eyes scan Hana, lingering just too long before looking elsewhere in the woods. She's constantly shifting her hands and legs. Hana can swear that Meri's appearance changes slightly, subtly, before returning to as it was.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry, Meri. Everything before these\u2026 past few years is a blur to me. Even now, I can't remember much of the past few months. It was a half life, a way for Hana to dig deeper. \"What do you mean you saw me in a dream?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes, I see flashes of images while I am in the Garden.\" She pauses. \"That is the place I go to when I dream. There I can see many stories, both those that have happened and those that have not happened yet.\" Meri holds out her hand, shaking as she moves it towards Hana. \"Maybe I can see yours too?\"</p>\n<p>Hana's shoulders tense. \"I'm, uh, not sure about that. I doubt you'll even find anything interesting there.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I would like to read your story. All stories are interesting to me. Each and every one of them has worth, has a place to be remembered.\"</p>\n<p><em>Remembered. Remember.</em></p>\n<p>Hana sighs. \"Alright, fine. How does this work exactly?\"</p>\n<p>\"All you need to do is take my hand and close your eyes. We will both enter the dream after that.\"</p>\n<p>Hana smirks. \"Hold your hand, huh? Do you do this with all the people who come to your island, or am I special?\"</p>\n<p>\"No one else like you has come to my island before. Usually people do not get this close to me unless I am asleep.\"</p>\n<p><em>Oh.</em></p>\n<p>Hana rolls up her sleeve and begins moving her hand towards Meri. Meri flinches as it approaches, but she steadies it when their fingers meet. She begins to glow much brighter now, and she shuts her eyes while whispering words Hana can make out. Shortly after, Hana closes her eyes, and reality slips away around her.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"storybook-hca\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Water, both necessary for life and<br/>\nbringer of silent death, washes over a <span style=\"color: #83a2c8\">pearl</span>.<br/>\nThere was a time when people would remember this <span style=\"color: #83a2c8\">pearl</span><br/>\nas a queen, clad in dress and colorful pigment, the ideal.<br/>\nThrough windfall she obtained the source of her power, but<br/>\nshe was too young to see that this blade cut two ways,<br/>\nthat it would ultimately unmake her, as it unmade others before her.</p>\n<p>It's easier to notice an End in retrospect, but impossible<br/>\nfor those blinded by ideals to see an End at all.<br/>\nHer subjects slipped away in droves, no longer coming to see her,<br/>\ninstead forming a massless crowd before her.<br/>\nThey sit in silence, for who can remember their voice?

She stares straight ahead of her at her acquaintance on the log. <em>Flee. I think now is the time to flee before she wakes up.</em> But she is unable to move. Meri physically strains, fighting to keep her eyes shut, and gripping onto Hana's hand much harder than Hana thinks she means to. After some time, Meri opens her eyes again, bringing a hand up to her forehead. She sways a little, and small beads of sweat dot her face.</p>\n<p>\"I am sorry if you did not see much, I am not very good at this. I practice with my <a href=\"/scp-8166\">Uncle</a>, but it has been a while. I see water in my dreams too.\" She begins to shake.</p>\n<p>\"Meri, I think we should get you something to drink,\" Hana says, snapping out of her trance. She slowly helps Meri up from the log and walks her a few steps to the stream. Meri cups her hands and begins to drink as Hana holds her steady. \"Did you want some as well?\" she looks up to Hana meekly, offering a handful of water.</p>\n<p>\"No thank you, I brought my own,\" Hana replies, pulling a canteen from her pocket and sitting next to Meri, who scoots away slightly and pulls her legs up to her chest.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2014 think you smell really nice.\"</p>\n<p>Hana laughs and rolls up her sleeve, offering her wrist to Meri. She leans forward to take a few sniffs before her face scrunches up. She sneezes.</p>\n<p>\"Bless you.\" She retracts her arm and rolls her sleeve back down. \"Thanks. It's a pomegranate perfume with just a hint of rose. You smell\u2026 nice as well. Like rain almost. Petrichor.\"</p>\n<p>Meri blushes, turning her face away from Hana. Her tail flicks. \"T-thanks.\" She looks back at the log and the book open atop it. \"I am sorry you did not like the story in my book.\"</p>\n<p>\"You don't have to apologize. I'm just used to the newer version. It's a little bit more light hearted. They made an animated movie about it before I was born.\"</p>\n<p>\"Moo-vies?\" Meri sounds out. \"The visitors have mentioned them in passing, but I do not know what those are.\"</p>\n<p>\"Meri, how long have you been here?\"</p>\n<p>\"The visitors tell me I have been here since <a href=\"/it-s-hard-to-be-a-kid-in-containment\">October of 1999</a>.\" She begins counting with her fingers, resetting once she reaches '10'. \"I am 19 years old, if I counted correctly. Did you grow up here too?\"</p>\n<p>Hana's heart drops, hoping it doesn't show on her face. <em>A whole life in containment. I'm barely surviving after less than 2 years.</em></p>\n<p>\"I was brought here a couple of years ago after\u2014 \" Hana pauses. She doesn't need to know what you did. Don't let her think you're a monster.</p>\n<p>\"\u2014they found out I could magically edit photographs. That's actually why I'm here today. Do you know what those are?\"</p>\n<p>Meri nods. \"<a href=\"/tinkertailorsoldierjailor\">My father</a> told me he carries a small picture around of me.\" She mimes the dimensions of it. \"I do not know how it works, but it is something truly wondrous.\"</p>\n<p>Hana squints her eyes. \"Right\u2026\"</p>\n<p>She's so\u2026 tragic. How has she lived like this for so long?</p>\n<p>\"You also seem knowledgeable about stories, Hana. How would you describe yourself? In terms of my stories?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmmmm.\" Hana pauses for a moment. \"Well, I'm not nearly cool enough to be a wizard, don't get out enough to be an adventurer\u2026 oh! I did kill a monster once, if that means anything.\"</p>\n<p>\"Monsters\u2026\" Meri repeats, flinching.</p>\n<p>Hana stands up and brushes the dirt and loose plants off of her. \"Well, if we're talking stories, would you be interested to hear about my first adventure?\"</p>\n<p>Meri nods and unfurls herself. She leans forward, intrigued.</p>\n<p>\"Once upon a time,\" Hana begins, \"I travelled to this place called Providence. It's somewhat far from here, months if you walk but only a few hours by flight. In Providence there's this magical school, and it was there I learned about a creature called <em>The Crimson Pincer</em>.\" She lets her words hang in the air a moment before continuing. \"My new companion\u2014 their name is <a href=\"/nevertellneverhear\">Vesper</a> and they can tell the future, and I travelled to an island during a storm and found the creature, a massive crab the size of a car\u2026\" She pauses. \"Think of a crab the size of a really large rock.\"</p>\n<p>Meri nods and mimics the shape of a crab with her hands.</p>\n<p>\"Anyways, I was able to capture the crab with this!\" she motions to the camera, pulling the picture she took earlier from her pocket. \"After that, the crab shrunk to a normal size and a bird ate it. The end!\"</p>\n<p>Hana stops to catch her breath. Meri softly claps her hands.</p>\n<p>\"That must have been really scary to see a crab that large. When I was younger, they used to grab my fingers when I stuck my hands in the water. You are really brave to have faced that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh it was nothing, just a normal day, you know?\" Hana replies. \"What about you, Meri? What do you see yourself as?\"</p>\n<p>Meri looks to the ground at her hooves, and balls her fists on her lap.</p>\n<p>\"There is a <span style=\"text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #BC3030;\"><span style=\"color: red\">scary creature</span></span> that haunts me, one that looks exactly like me. I see it in my reflection, and I think that I am that\u2026 creature. A monster.\" She looks at Hana. \"That is why they keep me on this island. To make sure everyone stays safe from me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so. You sound more like a princess to me, fit the description too.\"</p>\n<p>Meri's ears perk up. \"Y-you think I am a princess?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah of course. I mean you lived on an island and read books all your life, all you need to do is talk to animals. I think you're beautiful like a princess too, inside and out.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I do speak to the animals and insects that I call my friends on the island, although, they do not make very good conversation.\"</p>\n<p>\"See? What did I say, you really are a princess.\"</p>\n<p>Meri grips the ground and turns away, causing Hana to laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Why does my face feel this way? Why are my cheeks burning?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it's because I've put you on the spot,\" Hana explains. \"I'm sorry.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I am okay. I have never spoken to anyone my age before. This is all very new to me.\"</p>\n<p>\"No worries, Meri.\" Hana leans back. \"For a while, the only people I talked to were the same few doctors and guards before I went to school, and even then, I don't really fit in with anyone there. You'll get used to it, though. One day.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think I could come to school with you?\" Meri tilts her head. \"Maybe then we can not fit in together?\"</p>\n<p>Hana laughs. \"Maybe one day.\" Meri smiles, and the two sit for a moment.</p>\n<p><em>They're never going to let her out of here. They barely let <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">me</span> out of here, and I'm not even half-deer.</em></p>\n<p>\"What do your stories say about knights, Meri?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, in some stories knights go out to slay monsters. They are usually in service of someone, though, and act in accordance with the code of chivalry.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think I could be a knight?\"</p>\n<p>Meri pauses to think for a moment. \"Well, you slayed a monster, but I am not sure if you follow any codes.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't see why I couldn't, though that doesn't really fix the problem of not having someone to serve.\"</p>\n<p>\"W-well, I\u2014 \" Meri stammers. \"Maybe you could be my knight? They do often try to win the favor of princesses, and since you said I\u2014 and you have certainly won\u2014 \"</p>\n<p>Hana grins.</p>\n<p>\"Of course. I promise to uphold justice and order and\u2026 whatever else. I promise to be your sword against your enemies.\" Hana bows deeply, giggling as she does. \"My life is yours, my lady.\" Hana sits back down on the log, motioning a now frozen Meri to join her. She offers Meri the heavy book.</p>\n<p>For the next few hours, the pair sits as the sun slowly travels from zenith to just above the horizon. The forest glows with the warm hues of a summer evening, orange and pink intermingling with the verdant leaves and umber pines. But no good thing can last forever, and just as Hana reaches to turn the page\u2014</p>\n<p>A voice chimes over the radio. <span class=\"comptext\">\"Hana, it's going to be getting dark soon. I'm going to circle back to the shore to pick you up, alright?\"</span></p>\n<p><em>Oh shit, the photo.</em></p>\n<p>\"My princess, may I ask a small, simple favor?\" Hana smiles. \"I am in need of a keepsake, something to remember our meeting by today.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm? What can I help out with?\"</p>\n<p>Hana takes her camera in her hands. \"Just need to snap a photo of you. All you need to do is stand still, alright?\"</p>\n<p>\"Will it hurt?\" Meri asks, hesitation evident in her voice. \"The snapping, that is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not at all, just stand in front of the log, and it'll be over before you blink.\"</p>\n<p>Meri awkwardly stands in front of the log, while Hana steps back to get a better view. The longer she stands, the more she fusses with her hair and the dress, until finally\u2014</p>\n<p>\"Alright, just look at me.\" Hana brings the camera to her eye. \"Say cheese!\"</p>\n<p>\"Cheese?\"</p>\n<p><em>Click!</em></p>\n<p>A flash illuminates the clearing, followed by the sound of a picture printing from the front of the camera. Hana grabs the photo and sticks it in her pocket. \"Thank you for the\u2014\" she looks down, in the grass to Meri doubled over, her hands over her ears. When she finally recovers, Hana offers a hand, but Meri does not accept.</p>\n<p>\"S-sorry. It is just a thing I do when I get startled. The visitors tell me it is natural and nothing to worry about. Sorry.\"</p>\n<p>The pair walk in near silence to the treeline before Meri stops abruptly, her hooves planted on the edge of the grass and rocky sand.</p>\n<p>\"Well, Meri. It was nice meeting you. Maybe if we both play nice, they'll let us see each other again.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was nice meeting you too, Hana. Please visit again when you can. There are more stories I want to tell you about.\"</p>\n<p>Hana smiles and bows, making her way back towards the shore.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The boat ride back is fairly uneventful. Hana endures a long debrief from Glass, but it's lost on her. All she can think about is Meri. In a way, she reminded Hana of herself when she first arrived on site, at least from what others have told her. There was a profound fear in the faun's eyes, and the way she held and spoke of the stories during their meeting made it seem like all the beasts and villains she read about were going to jump out of the pages to get her.</p>\n<p><em>Will you be my knight?</em> The question replays over and over in Hana's head.</p>\n<p>For the girl's sake, Hana couldn't say no. It wasn't like she would actually have to protect her from danger; she would remain on that island for who knows how long, and Hana would be a field agent. Odds are the two would never see each other again.</p>\n<p>Hana snaps back to reality as she disembarks the boat, and turns her attention towards the site.</p>\n<p><em>Back to the real world, Hana. No more fairy tales. You're never going to see each other again.</em></p>\n<p>The faint glows of cigarettes further down the docks catches her eyes. Two figures stand talking to one another. One has a scoped rifle slung over his shoulder, while the other's form shift's slightly, causing Hana to squint through the waves of heat of the cooling summer night. He turns his gaze to her, piercing. He turns around, a third eye staring back at her from his neck, and just as quickly as she notices him, he disappears.</p>\n<p><em>Vesper wouldn't have mentioned her if she wasn't important, though. Maybe they're wrong about this one. Vesper doesn't know the Foundation. It would be easier to move a mountain than it would be to put us in the same place again\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\"Congratulations, <em>6317</em>, you passed.\"</p>\n<p>Hana cringes as she hears her designation.</p>\n<p>A woman, clad in black combat vest and tactical pants, stands before Hana, imposing. Her hair is short, slicked back with what Hana can only assume to be the same grease she uses to maintain the service pistol on her hip. Hana looks at Glass, who has already entered into conversation with the woman.</p>\n<p>\"\u2014 she successfully made contact with 8166-2 and collected evidence. For her first official operation, I think she did a good job.\" Glass says, his back turned to Hana.</p>\n<p>\"There's still one more test, Dr. Glass, if I may.\" The woman says, receiving a nod back from Glass. She turns her attention to Hana once more.</p>\n<p>\"<em>SCP-6317, formerly known as Hana Thompson. Has the ability to modify aspects of photography to alter the perception of those as the subject. Came into Foundation care after all but one of her classmates were affected by her abilities.</em>\" The figure coldly recites, as if they were reading it directly from her file. \"Are you aware of the punishment for the unsanctioned neutralization of an anomaly?\"</p>\n<p>\"N-no, ma'a\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"No, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, ma\u2014 sir. Sorry, sir. Look, I didn't mean to do anything wrong.\" Hana laughs nervously. \"It was a storm, and I\u2014 it attacked me first and I didn't actually think I would kill it.\" The button on one of the woman's pouches <em>click</em>s, and Hana takes a deep breath. <em>Fuck, is she going to kill me?</em> The woman holds a single, orange pill in her hand, motioning for Hana to take it.</p>\n<p>\"Some consider this a mercy,\" she says. \"Though I wouldn't necessarily call it pleasant either.\"</p>\n<p>Hana shakily picks up the capsule, slowly bringing it to her mouth. She thinks about running, but she knows the woman would have her on the ground after her first step. So, reluctantly, Hana resigns herself to her fate, letting the capsule dissolve in her tongue. It tastes sweet, almost orangey. She closes her eyes, waiting for her throat to dissolve or a million other terrible ways her life could have ended\u2026 but nothing does.</p>\n<p>The woman struggles to hold back her laughter, the figure with the rifle joining her in a much more controlled chuckle.</p>\n<p>He holds out a cigarette to her.</p>\n<p>\"For first successful mission. Is cause for celebration!\"</p>\n<p>Hana takes the cigarette, still shell-shocked from her near death. \"T-thanks?\" She rotates the cylinder in her hand, unsure of what to do with it. The figure laughs. \"Old soldier's habit. Death on battlefield is unexpected, but cigarette is death you can control. Poetic, \u0434\u0430?\" He mouths something to the woman, and begins making his way back to the site.</p>\n<p>She feels a strong hand on her back.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Senior Special Agent Andrea Adams, Andrea is fine, but I'm still \"sir\" to you. I'm also your new boss! I'll be responsible for making sure you don't die.\" She pauses. \"Well, while you're not at school, that is. You're more valuable there than you are here, apparently.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know, I felt like someone would be talking to me about the crab eventually, but I didn't think it would be like this.\"</p>\n<p>\"What? You didn't think that the slap on your wrist would be Vitamin-C?\" Andrea leans forward slightly. \"Listen,\" she scans the dock, \"if this were a real disciplinary hearing, Clef would be sitting in front of you, not me. Clef's a bastard, and you seem like a good kid, so I thought some ribbing would suffice for punishment. Word of advice: try not to mess up again or else you'll have to meet the old man.\"</p>\n<p><em>That name again? Could he be?</em></p>\n<p>\"Be sure to get some rest, Hana. Tomorrow you're going to learn what it means to be an agent for the Foundation.\" The hand leaves her shoulder, and Andrea gives her a wide grin.</p>\n<p>\"Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life.\"</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/firstdayrestoflife\">The First Day of the Rest of Your Life</a>\" by AstersQuill, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The mechanics of the camera //whir//, and the dull plastic polygon spits out a photo. She holds it out before her, side-by-side with the natural vista.\n\n\n\nAncient evergreens stretch themselves upwards, as if reaching for the low hanging clouds of the morning. Their old needles sprinkle the ground, shedding themselves of last season's coat for something newer, fresher, to wrap around themselves for the winter. A sprinkling of thin maples add the first drops of fall to the forest's palette, their bottom leaves like chameleons to the cooling nights, morph into tones of red and yellow. She captures a few rays of the sun peeking through the canopy, as well as a pair of songbirds. One sits on a branch, watching the other take flight towards another tree. A hawk circles overhead, watching for an out of place blade of grass or mistimed splash. The water lapping against the stony shore is nearly clear, far cleaner than the muddy docks of Site-19. Tiny fish sit under lily pads in piecemeal schools, waiting for the clouds to block out the sun before the collective travels elsewhere.\n\n\n\nIt was\u2026 peaceful, and Hana could have sat forever, simply resting on the shore, listening to the natural beauty of it all. But as Hana's eyes move towards the horizon, she is met only with the clean white border of the picture's frame. There was no world for her anymore, nowhere else to go. She takes one last look at the photo, at the frame, at the box, and places it in her pocket. She had a mission to do, and there was only one path to lead her forward.\n\n\n\nShe was whisked away from her room in the late afternoon, long after any of her usual testing or check-ups would take place, and was brought to the docks of Site-19. It was somewhat pitiful compared to the few memories Hana had of the waterfront growing up, with an army of rowboats and rubber dinghies where fishing vessels should have been. Dr. Glass was waiting at the far side of the dock, reading a collection of files, in a boat whose hull was patchwork with duct tape and slimy with green algae.\n\n\n\nHana leaned over the side and dipped her hand in the water as the boat crawled across the lake with its sputtering engine. It had been so long, too long, and she swore she could see a younger version of herself in the wake, smiling as she chased impossibly fast minnows. Her daydreaming was cut short with a bump, and the clearing of Glass' throat.\n\n\n\n\"After reviewing your performance in [[[scp-6342|Providence]]], Director Light and I discussed your attendance for the upcoming fall semester. We're both on board with the idea, as well as your interest in becoming a full field agent, but we just wanted to see how you would handle yourself in a less\u2026 dangerous situation.\" He handed her a file, motioning for her to open it. After a few pages of neat, black highlighted text, she found what he wanted her to see.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-2 Case File>>**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n**Name:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Age:** 19\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-8166-2 possesses physical characteristics similar to --//Rangifer Tarandus//-- //Odocoileus virginianus// (White-tail deer) including: hooved feet, antlers, large ears, nose, and short tail. It is believed to possess a similar, docile nature.\n\n\n\nSCP-8166-2 possesses innate reality bending abilities. In present time, these abilities have only provided minimal damage to Foundation facilities, with observations noting minor appearance changes and the creation of food as a majority of ability usage.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\"As such, your mission today is retrieval,\" he adjusts his glasses. \"Just be sure to do your best, alright. If you're unable to complete this now, we can give it another try in a few months when you're ready,\" he explained.\n\n\n\n//Fight. Flight. Freeze. Come on, Hana, you have a job to do. Don't let yourself get stuck here.//\n\n\n\n\"If this means being able to leave this place, I'm as ready as I'll ever be,\" Hana says, looking at the treeline ahead of her. A ray of light cuts through the canopy, reflecting a prismatic hue off of rain droplets from what must have been a recent storm.\n\n\n\n//Truly//, Hana thinks, //truly they couldn't be hiding something __this__ beautiful in their prison.//\n\n\n\nBut, the moment of awe passes, and Hana Thompson bows her head before stepping deeper into the woods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nAfter tripping on a web of roots, getting caught in the arm-like grasp of sapling branches, and swearing she passed the same tree three times, Hana arrives at a small stream she believes to be situated at the center of the island. The area looks somewhat well-travelled, littered with small tracks nearly indistinguishable in the soil, but also with much larger tracks that causes Hana to swallow down a wave of anxiety.\n\n\n\n//Deer tracks are small, right? There's no way they dropped me off on an island with a monster.// She takes a deep breath. //Fight. Flight. Freeze. Keep going.//\n\n\n\nA trail of grass intermingled with hoof marks leads to a log that rests by a small body of water with a scatter of similar marks imprinted in the mud and scratching white the tops of the flat stream rocks. As Hana approaches the log, she notices a collection of flowers blooming beneath it, with large, plate-like mushrooms seemingly anchoring it to the ground. The bark is smooth, uniform, and there's no sign of rot outside of it. She takes a seat at one end with a //huff//, and dips her hand in the stream, splashing some of its water on her forehead. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices a golden shine from within the log, and sticks her hand in to try to grab it. Her fingers brush the spine of a book, feeling out the words \"Fairy Tales and Stories, Translated.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, at least if anything comes after me now, I have something to protect myself with.\"\n\n\n\nShe brings the heavy book up to her lap and carefully opens it, cautiously skimming through the pages until she reaches one titled //The Little Mermaid.// After reading a few paragraphs, she stops and turns her head.\n\n\n\n\"Huh. This isn't the Ariel I dressed up as. This version is so much\u2026 darker? Where are Sebastian and Flounder? Where are the singing fish?\"\n\n\n\nA bush shuffles behind her. Hana freezes, careful not to blink or even breathe enough to give her away.\n\n\n\n\"Fish do not sing, at least they have not to me. I do not think I would enjoy that in my story.\"\n\n\n\nHana jumps straight up from the log, turning to face the unknown voice behind her. She takes her camera out from her pocket, thumb hovering over the shutter button. The figure is slightly taller than her and wears a white, patchy dress that doesn't look [[[hoovesandantlers|quite correct on its body]]]. Its eyes, antlers, and the fawn spots freckling its face begin to dimly glow. It squeaks at her reaction, raising its hands and falling to the ground.\n\n\n\n//Fight. Flight. Freeze.// Hana repeats. But she pauses. //Or fawn?//\n\n\n\n\"I am sorry. Please do not harm me, I do not intend to hurt you.\" It says, with a voice slightly deeper than Hana was expecting. \"I know I look like a creature, but please, do not slay me as one.\"\n\n\n\nFear wells in the creature's big eyes, its pupils dilated. Hana stares confused for a moment, probably a moment more than would be considered polite, fixated on the creature's winding antlers and alert ears. She places a hand on her chest, taking a deep breath and laughing.\n\n\n\n\"You're\u2026 not at all how I thought you would look from the file,\" Hana lowers her camera, allowing it to hang from its sling. She kneels and holds out a hand. \"Hello\u2026 deer woman? I am Hana Thompson, but a humble visitor to your island, an anomaly like yourself. I promise to bring you no harm.\"\n\n\n\nThe clearing goes silent, as if every other living thing besides the pair had disappeared. The figure eyes her hand, though its expression softens to one of confusion rather than fear.\n\n\n\n\"What's your name?\" Hana continues, attempting to fill the dead air.\n\n\n\nThe creature looks at her with surprise.\n\n\n\n\"M-Meri. My name is Meri Clef.\" Meri chokes out, her voice dry.\n\n\n\n\"Meri.\" Hana repeats. Meri's ears flick at the sound. \"I like that name. It's a happy name.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hana,\" Meri repeats. \"I like your name too.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks! It means 'flower' where my dad is from.\" Hana takes a seat on the log, motioning for Meri to join her. After a second of hesitation, she does, though a comfortable distance away. The two sit in silence for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"Do you feel strongly around me?\" Meri shuffles her hands around. \"Sorry. There is something about you that is familiar.\u00a0\u00a0Like we have met in one of my dreams or at some point in the past.\"\n\n\n\nHana pauses for a moment, observing her new acquaintance on the log. Her big eyes scan Hana, lingering just too long before looking elsewhere in the woods. She's constantly shifting her hands and legs. Hana can swear that Meri's appearance changes slightly, subtly, before returning to as it was.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, Meri. Everything before these\u2026 past few years is a blur to me. Even now, I can't remember much of the past few months. It was a half life, a way for Hana to dig deeper. \"What do you mean you saw me in a dream?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes, I see flashes of images while I am in the Garden.\" She pauses. \"That is the place I go to when I dream. There I can see many stories, both those that have happened and those that have not happened yet.\" Meri holds out her hand, shaking as she moves it towards Hana. \"Maybe I can see yours too?\"\n\n\n\nHana's shoulders tense. \"I'm, uh, not sure about that. I doubt you'll even find anything interesting there.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I would like to read your story. All stories are interesting to me. Each and every one of them has worth, has a place to be remembered.\"\n\n\n\n//Remembered. Remember.//\n\n\n\nHana sighs. \"Alright, fine. How does this work exactly?\"\n\n\n\n\"All you need to do is take my hand and close your eyes. We will both enter the dream after that.\"\n\n\n\nHana smirks. \"Hold your hand, huh? Do you do this with all the people who come to your island, or am I special?\"\n\n\n\n\"No one else like you has come to my island before. Usually people do not get this close to me unless I am asleep.\"\n\n\n\n//Oh.//\n\n\n\nHana rolls up her sleeve and begins moving her hand towards Meri. Meri flinches as it approaches, but she steadies it when their fingers meet. She begins to glow much brighter now, and she shuts her eyes while whispering words Hana can make out. Shortly after, Hana closes her eyes, and reality slips away around her.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"storybook-hca\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\nWater, both necessary for life and\n\nbringer of silent death, washes over a ##83A2C8|pearl##.\n\nThere was a time when people would remember this ##83A2C8|pearl##\n\nas a queen, clad in dress and colorful pigment, the ideal.\n\nThrough windfall she obtained the source of her power, but\n\nshe was too young to see that this blade cut two ways,\n\nthat it would ultimately unmake her, as it unmade others before her.\n\n\n\nIt's easier to notice an End in retrospect, but impossible\n\nfor those blinded by ideals to see an End at all.\n\nHer subjects slipped away in droves, no longer coming to see her,\n\ninstead forming a massless crowd before her.\n\nThey sit in silence, for who can remember their voice?

She stares straight ahead of her at her acquaintance on the log. //Flee. I think now is the time to flee before she wakes up.// But she is unable to move. Meri physically strains, fighting to keep her eyes shut, and gripping onto Hana's hand much harder than Hana thinks she means to. After some time, Meri opens her eyes again, bringing a hand up to her forehead. She sways a little, and small beads of sweat dot her face.\n\n\n\n\"I am sorry if you did not see much, I am not very good at this. I practice with my [[[scp-8166|Uncle]]], but it has been a while. I see water in my dreams too.\" She begins to shake.\n\n\n\n\"Meri, I think we should get you something to drink,\" Hana says, snapping out of her trance. She slowly helps Meri up from the log and walks her a few steps to the stream. Meri cups her hands and begins to drink as Hana holds her steady. \"Did you want some as well?\" she looks up to Hana meekly, offering a handful of water.\n\n\n\n\"No thank you, I brought my own,\" Hana replies, pulling a canteen from her pocket and sitting next to Meri, who scoots away slightly and pulls her legs up to her chest.\n\n\n\n\"I-- think you smell really nice.\"\n\n\n\nHana laughs and rolls up her sleeve, offering her wrist to Meri. She leans forward to take a few sniffs before her face scrunches up. She sneezes.\n\n\n\n\"Bless you.\" She retracts her arm and rolls her sleeve back down. \"Thanks. It's a pomegranate perfume with just a hint of rose. You smell\u2026 nice as well. Like rain almost. Petrichor.\"\n\n\n\nMeri blushes, turning her face away from Hana. Her tail flicks. \"T-thanks.\" She looks back at the log and the book open atop it. \"I am sorry you did not like the story in my book.\"\n\n\n\n\"You don't have to apologize. I'm just used to the newer version. It's a little bit more light hearted. They made an animated movie about it before I was born.\"\n\n\n\n\"Moo-vies?\" Meri sounds out. \"The visitors have mentioned them in passing, but I do not know what those are.\"\n\n\n\n\"Meri, how long have you been here?\"\n\n\n\n\"The visitors tell me I have been here since [[[it-s-hard-to-be-a-kid-in-containment|October of 1999]]].\" She begins counting with her fingers, resetting once she reaches '10'. \"I am 19 years old, if I counted correctly. Did you grow up here too?\"\n\n\n\nHana's heart drops, hoping it doesn't show on her face. //A whole life in containment. I'm barely surviving after less than 2 years.//\n\n\n\n\"I was brought here a couple of years ago after\u2014 \" Hana pauses. She doesn't need to know what you did. Don't let her think you're a monster.\n\n\n\n\"\u2014they found out I could magically edit photographs. That's actually why I'm here today. Do you know what those are?\"\n\n\n\nMeri nods. \"[[[tinkertailorsoldierjailor|My father]]] told me he carries a small picture around of me.\" She mimes the dimensions of it. \"I do not know how it works, but it is something truly wondrous.\"\n\n\n\nHana squints her eyes. \"Right\u2026\"\n\n\n\nShe's so\u2026 tragic. How has she lived like this for so long?\n\n\n\n\"You also seem knowledgeable about stories, Hana. How would you describe yourself? In terms of my stories?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmmmm.\" Hana pauses for a moment. \"Well, I'm not nearly cool enough to be a wizard, don't get out enough to be an adventurer\u2026 oh! I did kill a monster once, if that means anything.\"\n\n\n\n\"Monsters\u2026\" Meri repeats, flinching.\n\n\n\nHana stands up and brushes the dirt and loose plants off of her. \"Well, if we're talking stories, would you be interested to hear about my first adventure?\"\n\n\n\nMeri nods and unfurls herself. She leans forward, intrigued.\n\n\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" Hana begins, \"I travelled to this place called Providence. It's somewhat far from here, months if you walk but only a few hours by flight. In Providence there's this magical school, and it was there I learned about a creature called //The Crimson Pincer//.\" She lets her words hang in the air a moment before continuing. \"My new companion-- their name is [[[nevertellneverhear|Vesper]]] and they can tell the future, and I travelled to an island during a storm and found the creature, a massive crab the size of a car\u2026\" She pauses. \"Think of a crab the size of a really large rock.\"\n\n\n\nMeri nods and mimics the shape of a crab with her hands.\n\n\n\n\"Anyways, I was able to capture the crab with this!\" she motions to the camera, pulling the picture she took earlier from her pocket. \"After that, the crab shrunk to a normal size and a bird ate it. The end!\"\n\n\n\nHana stops to catch her breath. Meri softly claps her hands.\n\n\n\n\"That must have been really scary to see a crab that large. When I was younger, they used to grab my fingers when I stuck my hands in the water. You are really brave to have faced that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh it was nothing, just a normal day, you know?\" Hana replies. \"What about you, Meri? What do you see yourself as?\"\n\n\n\nMeri looks to the ground at her hooves, and balls her fists on her lap.\n\n\n\n\"There is a [[span style=\"text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #BC3030;\"]]##red|scary creature##[[/span]] that haunts me, one that looks exactly like me. I see it in my reflection, and I think that I am that\u2026 creature. A monster.\" She looks at Hana. \"That is why they keep me on this island. To make sure everyone stays safe from me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't think so. You sound more like a princess to me, fit the description too.\"\n\n\n\nMeri's ears perk up. \"Y-you think I am a princess?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah of course. I mean you lived on an island and read books all your life, all you need to do is talk to animals. I think you're beautiful like a princess too, inside and out.\"\n\n\n\n\"I... I do speak to the animals and insects that I call my friends on the island, although, they do not make very good conversation.\"\n\n\n\n\"See? What did I say, you really are a princess.\"\n\n\n\nMeri grips the ground and turns away, causing Hana to laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Why does my face feel this way? Why are my cheeks burning?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think it's because I've put you on the spot,\" Hana explains. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, I am okay. I have never spoken to anyone my age before. This is all very new to me.\"\n\n\n\n\"No worries, Meri.\" Hana leans back. \"For a while, the only people I talked to were the same few doctors and guards before I went to school, and even then, I don't really fit in with anyone there. You'll get used to it, though. One day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you think I could come to school with you?\" Meri tilts her head. \"Maybe then we can not fit in together?\"\n\n\n\nHana laughs. \"Maybe one day.\" Meri smiles, and the two sit for a moment.\n\n\n\n//They're never going to let her out of here. They barely let __me__ out of here, and I'm not even half-deer.//\n\n\n\n\"What do your stories say about knights, Meri?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, in some stories knights go out to slay monsters. They are usually in service of someone, though, and act in accordance with the code of chivalry.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you think I could be a knight?\"\n\n\n\nMeri pauses to think for a moment. \"Well, you slayed a monster, but I am not sure if you follow any codes.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't see why I couldn't, though that doesn't really fix the problem of not having someone to serve.\"\n\n\n\n\"W-well, I-- \" Meri stammers. \"Maybe you could be my knight? They do often try to win the favor of princesses, and since you said I-- and you have certainly won-- \"\n\n\n\nHana grins.\n\n\n\n\"Of course. I promise to uphold justice and order and... whatever else. I promise to be your sword against your enemies.\" Hana bows deeply, giggling as she does. \"My life is yours, my lady.\" Hana sits back down on the log, motioning a now frozen Meri to join her. She offers Meri the heavy book.\n\n\n\nFor the next few hours, the pair sits as the sun slowly travels from zenith to just above the horizon. The forest glows with the warm hues of a summer evening, orange and pink intermingling with the verdant leaves and umber pines. But no good thing can last forever, and just as Hana reaches to turn the page--\n\n\n\nA voice chimes over the radio. [[span class=\"comptext\"]]\"Hana, it's going to be getting dark soon. I'm going to circle back to the shore to pick you up, alright?\"[[/span]]\n\n\n\n//Oh shit, the photo.//\n\n\n\n\"My princess, may I ask a small, simple favor?\" Hana smiles. \"I am in need of a keepsake, something to remember our meeting by today.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm? What can I help out with?\"\n\n\n\nHana takes her camera in her hands. \"Just need to snap a photo of you. All you need to do is stand still, alright?\"\n\n\n\n\"Will it hurt?\" Meri asks, hesitation evident in her voice. \"The snapping, that is.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all, just stand in front of the log, and it'll be over before you blink.\"\n\n\n\nMeri awkwardly stands in front of the log, while Hana steps back to get a better view. The longer she stands, the more she fusses with her hair and the dress, until finally--\n\n\n\n\"Alright, just look at me.\" Hana brings the camera to her eye. \"Say cheese!\"\n\n\n\n\"Cheese?\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n//Click!//\n\n\n\nA flash illuminates the clearing, followed by the sound of a picture printing from the front of the camera. Hana grabs the photo and sticks it in her pocket. \"Thank you for the--\" she looks down, in the grass to Meri doubled over, her hands over her ears. When she finally recovers, Hana offers a hand, but Meri does not accept.\n\n\n\n\"S-sorry. It is just a thing I do when I get startled. The visitors tell me it is natural and nothing to worry about. Sorry.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair walk in near silence to the treeline before Meri stops abruptly, her hooves planted on the edge of the grass and rocky sand.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Meri. It was nice meeting you. Maybe if we both play nice, they'll let us see each other again.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was nice meeting you too, Hana. Please visit again when you can. There are more stories I want to tell you about.\"\n\n\n\nHana smiles and bows, making her way back towards the shore.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe boat ride back is fairly uneventful. Hana endures a long debrief from Glass, but it's lost on her. All she can think about is Meri. In a way, she reminded Hana of herself when she first arrived on site, at least from what others have told her. There was a profound fear in the faun's eyes, and the way she held and spoke of the stories during their meeting made it seem like all the beasts and villains she read about were going to jump out of the pages to get her.\n\n\n\n//Will you be my knight?// The question replays over and over in Hana's head.\n\n\n\nFor the girl's sake, Hana couldn't say no. It wasn't like she would actually have to protect her from danger; she would remain on that island for who knows how long, and Hana would be a field agent. Odds are the two would never see each other again.\n\n\n\nHana snaps back to reality as she disembarks the boat, and turns her attention towards the site.\n\n\n\n//Back to the real world, Hana. No more fairy tales. You're never going to see each other again.//\n\n\n\nThe faint glows of cigarettes further down the docks catches her eyes. Two figures stand talking to one another. One has a scoped rifle slung over his shoulder, while the other's form shift's slightly, causing Hana to squint through the waves of heat of the cooling summer night. He turns his gaze to her, piercing. He turns around, a third eye staring back at her from his neck, and just as quickly as she notices him, he disappears.\n\n\n\n//Vesper wouldn't have mentioned her if she wasn't important, though. Maybe they're wrong about this one. Vesper doesn't know the Foundation. It would be easier to move a mountain than it would be to put us in the same place again--//\n\n\n\n\"Congratulations, //6317//, you passed.\"\n\n\n\nHana cringes as she hears her designation.\n\n\n\nA woman, clad in black combat vest and tactical pants, stands before Hana, imposing. Her hair is short, slicked back with what Hana can only assume to be the same grease she uses to maintain the service pistol on her hip. Hana looks at Glass, who has already entered into conversation with the woman.\n\n\n\n\"-- she successfully made contact with 8166-2 and collected evidence. For her first official operation, I think she did a good job.\" Glass says, his back turned to Hana.\n\n\n\n\"There's still one more test, Dr. Glass, if I may.\" The woman says, receiving a nod back from Glass. She turns her attention to Hana once more.\n\n\n\n\"//SCP-6317, formerly known as Hana Thompson. Has the ability to modify aspects of photography to alter the perception of those as the subject. Came into Foundation care after all but one of her classmates were affected by her abilities.//\" The figure coldly recites, as if they were reading it directly from her file. \"Are you aware of the punishment for the unsanctioned neutralization of an anomaly?\"\n\n\n\n\"N-no, ma'a\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, ma\u2014 sir. Sorry, sir. Look, I didn't mean to do anything wrong.\" Hana laughs nervously. \"It was a storm, and I-- it attacked me first and I didn't actually think I would kill it.\" The button on one of the woman's pouches //click//s, and Hana takes a deep breath. //Fuck, is she going to kill me?// The woman holds a single, orange pill in her hand, motioning for Hana to take it.\n\n\n\n\"Some consider this a mercy,\" she says. \"Though I wouldn't necessarily call it pleasant either.\"\n\n\n\nHana shakily picks up the capsule, slowly bringing it to her mouth. She thinks about running, but she knows the woman would have her on the ground after her first step. So, reluctantly, Hana resigns herself to her fate, letting the capsule dissolve in her tongue. It tastes sweet, almost orangey. She closes her eyes, waiting for her throat to dissolve or a million other terrible ways her life could have ended\u2026 but nothing does.\n\n\n\nThe woman struggles to hold back her laughter, the figure with the rifle joining her in a much more controlled chuckle.\n\n\n\nHe holds out a cigarette to her.\n\n\n\n\"For first successful mission. Is cause for celebration!\"\n\n\n\nHana takes the cigarette, still shell-shocked from her near death. \"T-thanks?\" She rotates the cylinder in her hand, unsure of what to do with it. The figure laughs. \"Old soldier's habit. Death on battlefield is unexpected, but cigarette is death you can control. Poetic, \u0434\u0430?\" He mouths something to the woman, and begins making his way back to the site.\n\n\n\nShe feels a strong hand on her back.\n\n\n\n\"I'm Senior Special Agent Andrea Adams, Andrea is fine, but I'm still \"sir\" to you. I'm also your new boss! I'll be responsible for making sure you don't die.\" She pauses. \"Well, while you're not at school, that is. You're more valuable there than you are here, apparently.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know, I felt like someone would be talking to me about the crab eventually, but I didn't think it would be like this.\"\n\n\n\n\"What? You didn't think that the slap on your wrist would be Vitamin-C?\" Andrea leans forward slightly. \"Listen,\" she scans the dock, \"if this were a real disciplinary hearing, Clef would be sitting in front of you, not me. Clef's a bastard, and you seem like a good kid, so I thought some ribbing would suffice for punishment. Word of advice: try not to mess up again or else you'll have to meet the old man.\"\n\n\n\n//That name again? Could he be?//\n\n\n\n\"Be sure to get some rest, Hana. Tomorrow you're going to learn what it means to be an agent for the Foundation.\" The hand leaves her shoulder, and Andrea gives her a wide grin.\n\n\n\n\"Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life.\"\n\n[[/==]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| previous-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nevertellneverhear\n\n| previous-title = Never to Tell, Never to Hear\n\n| next-url = /\n\n| next-title = Coming Soon...\n\n| hub-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/eventyr-hub\n\n| hub-title = Echoes of a Forgotten Shutter\n\n]]\n", "references": ["scp-6342", "hoovesandantlers", "scp-8166", "it-s-hard-to-be-a-kid-in-containment", "tinkertailorsoldierjailor", "nevertellneverhear", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide", "eventyr-hub"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "agent-adams", "agent-strelnikov", "bittersweet", "doctor-clef", "doctor-glass", "eventyr", "fantasy", "iris-thompson", "tale", "teenage-gaea"], "title": "The First Day of the Rest of Your Life - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/firstdayrestoflife", "year": 2025}, "fishskin": {"created_at": "2025-01-12T07:16:00", "creator": "Rounderhouse", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Rounderhouse", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rounderhouse", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-12T07:16:00"}, {"author": "Rounderhouse", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rounderhouse", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-12T07:19:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "Staff timers aren't allowed for non-staff purposes.

I\u2019d never used it, of course \u2014 the others were the ones who handled that sort of thing. But I had brought it here, and it was the only thing I could be sure I owned, and in any case mechanisms should always be maintained. So once a week, I would bring some tools from my workshop, sit on the rickety card table next to the aquarium, and clean it.</p>\n<p>The aquarium had been there when I\u2019d first arrived. It made for a bizarre sight; the rest of the safehouse was barren of any personal effects, decorations, or human touches. All concrete and plywood on the windows, hospital linens and simple metal cutlery. The two floors of the squat building in Tangier were connected by a rickety staircase, and the outside held an imposing iron gate. It was a place of work, of purpose.</p>\n<p>Even if any of us had wanted to decorate this place that we had lived in, some of us for years, we would have no idea what to decorate it with. I did not know what I liked, what I disliked. I had faint memories of enjoying rock bands, though trying to remember which was like grasping at smoke. Maybe I\u2019d been in one? Probably not, I thought, getting back to cleaning the half-disassembled pistol on the felt table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHard at work?\u201d</p>\n<p>I turned to look. The fish was staring right at me. It was an ugly, black thing, with a bulbous head and oily scales. The eyes were like dark pearls on either side of its head, glossy and milky and black as the rest of it. There were other fish in the tank, too, goldfish and bettas and a small eel. They were bright, colorful, darting about between fake plants and gravel. But this fish was stock-still, staring right at me, sucking the color from its surroundings. I felt a familiar buzzing in the back of my head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked you a question, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clearly some kind of hallucination, I reasoned. Not the first I had felt since the surgery, but easily the most intrusive. I ignored it and returned to cleaning my weapon. It didn\u2019t say anything more then, but I could feel it staring.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Life in the safehouse was an exercise in ennui, occasionally interrupted by periods of intense excitement. My arrival was a period of intense excitement for the others. I showed up on the step of the iron gate, a scrap of paper in one hand and brown paper bag in the other. I was wearing a suit that didn\u2019t fit me. The Surgeon had been the one on guard duty that night, the orange end of a cigarette hanging out of her mouth. She approached, eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked in Russian.</p>\n<p>I was surprised to learn I spoke Russian. It didn\u2019t seem natural, though \u2014 off-kilter on my tongue and ears. A second or third language, maybe. But I answered honestly: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked at the paper, at my suit, at the bag, and then motioned me after her. I was ushered past the triple-locked door into the safehouse so the others could inspect me. There were five of us, including me. The Surgeon, a diminutive Russian woman, whom I had already met. The Contact, a curly-haired Mexican who shook my hand like he meant to tear it off. The Pilot, who was on the French side of French-Algerian. The Chemist, another American \u2014 she took a liking to me, I suppose because of familiarity. They passed my scrap of paper around before showing it to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cYOU ARE A NEW RECRUIT FOR MOBILE TASK FORCE DELTA-1. FOLLOWING YOUR ASSENT TO YOUR NEW ASSIGNMENT, YOUR IDENTITY WAS SURGICALLY SEVERED FROM YOUR PHYSICAL BODY TO BETTER FACILITATE YOUR NEW MISSION. UPON SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF YOUR MISSION DIRECTIVES, YOUR IDENTITY AND MEMORIES WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU. AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. CODE: 4759\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found that, indeed, I could not remember anything about who I was. My name, where I had been born, whether I had a family, all seemed fuzzy and immaterial. I reached out to them, looking for crumbs of memory, and I found nothing at all \u2014 just a wet, burning mass. The dull ache in my head turned into a painful buzzing, and I let my mind retreat.</p>\n<p>I opened the brown paper bag clutched in my hand instead. It was wrinkled and dirtied, but inside was a simple Colt 1911. I flipped it over. The serial numbers had been filed off. I dimly registered that I recognized the model and knew where to look for the serials; I clearly had some familiarity with weapons. The Chemist showed me to my bed \u2014 a simple metal bunk in a room with eight of them. I set the gun down and slept.</p>\n<p>I fell into routine the next day. Check the alarms around the safehouse, ensure none of them were tripped. The others disappeared for their respective duties; we exchanged few words, but they were friendly. Having no tasks, I took it open myself to cook our nightly meals from the ingredients the Contact brought in. I noticed the aquarium, sitting on the counter, and the dark fish inside of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d I asked the Chemist one day.</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \u201cThey were here when I came in. I kept feeding them when everyone else left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re their names?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFish don\u2019t have names,\u201d she informed me.</p>\n<p>We would eat in comfortable silence, I would clean up, one of us would take the night watch, and the rest would sleep.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The packages were delivered at night, to whoever was keeping the watch. That was the purpose of standing outside all night smoking. We were never informed when a package would be coming; some nights, in the hours before sunrise, someone would walk by and slip a cardboard box over the gate. Sometimes a familiar figure, more often a new one.</p>\n<p>We would open it in the morning, so we could all see. The first few were for the others \u2014 it was easy to determine who. The unlabelled amber bottles of chemicals were for the Chemist. The Surgeon received samples of something or other, or manilla folders with x-rays and medical records. I don\u2019t know what the Contact received; he seemed to simply know when one was his, and none of us cared to argue.</p>\n<p>My first came two months after my arrival. The hallucinations were minor, then \u2014 spiders in the corner or a soft sonata playing over the wind. The Surgeon cut through the duct tape, looked inside, and then pushed it over to me.</p>\n<p>It was a number of materials \u2014 pipes, pre-fabricated parts, a welding iron, wires. Sitting atop a number of Xeroxed manuals and diagrams. I looked at them and found I understood them fairly well, and that was that. I took them to a free desk and worked for a few hours, fingers acting by themselves, only realizing midway through that a pipe bomb was taking shape in my hands. I looked at the Chemist, who nodded encouragingly.</p>\n<p>When it was complete, the Contact came by and clapped my shoulders, complimenting it. He took it and was gone. My part in the play was finished, and now his had begun.</p>\n<p>The assignments came steadily after that. I would inspect the parts I was given, the manuals and diagrams, and build what I was expected to. I found I always had the requisite knowledge, of how these wires would fit together and how to seal two pieces of metal and fix the mechanism. I would place the finished product back in the cardboard box and give it to whoever took the night watch. Without fail, someone would be there to pick it up, no matter how long it took for me to finish.</p>\n<p>I rarely understood what I was building \u2014 sometimes bombs, but sometimes a false lock or optic spike. Often they were simply components of a larger machine. Occasionally I was given a number of these components to assemble into something partial, incomplete, to send off to someone else. It was a chain, and I had no idea where in it I lay.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pipe bomb was a test, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>I ignored the fish, driving the screw into place.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey want to see if you can shut up and follow directions without knowing what the consequences will be. Be a good cog in the machine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do?\u201d I asked, looking behind me.</p>\n<p>The fish was looking at me with that dark eye. Its mouth was hanging open, tiny white teeth showing.</p>\n<p>Then the Pilot entered, and I went silent. No need for the others to know I was losing my mind.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The others disappeared from time to time, sometimes for days or weeks. Their assignments took them outside of the safehouse. Mine rarely did, for those first few months. Then one day the package was a set of papers detailing an assignment. The Surgeon looked over them, and then showed them to me. My first foray into the outside.</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t nervous. I had no way of knowing, but I had the sensation I had done this many times. I checked my weapon, stuffed it under my shirt, and left the safehouse. The Chemist rubbed my shoulder before I left and reassured me I would do fine.</p>\n<p>Istanbul is a city overflowing with warmth and color. I was not surprised by any of it, and found myself recognizing several streets as I pushed through the crowds. I had been here before, evidently. The instructions only listed an address and I found my way there. It was a small, nondescript office building. The lobby had no security guard behind the desk. I took the elevator to the second floor; the place was deserted, but as the instructions had stated, a small round machine the size of my palm was tucked inside the houseplant. The digital screen displayed the time.</p>\n<p>I took the elevator down to the underground garage. There were a handful of cars in the greenish light. The one bearing the given license plate number was an expensive black Mercedes. A driver was leaning against the hood. He watched me approach. He had an ugly scar on his face \u2014 a branding or mark of a spiraling circle.</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t say anything. He simply straightened himself, leaned around, and opened the back door of the car. I looked inside, placed the machine gently out of sight underneath the seat, grasped the black briefcase on the floor, and walked away. I exchanged nods with the driver as I walked away and he returned to smoking against the hood of the car. I saw his face flicker, malform, and reshape into the features of a handsome young man, unscarred.</p>\n<p>I looked away and left. The briefcase went into the package, and the package went into the Pilot\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to do much of anything to you at all, did they, buddy? You\u2019re a glutton for the punishment. You love this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fish was drifting lazily in his aquarium. I looked at him askance, into those black pearls, and went to bed.</p>\n<p>That night, I dreamt for the first time since I arrived at Tangier.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I didn't find myself worried about the lack of dreaming, ascribing it to a combination of long-term insomnia and the surgery. After all, there is no subconscious to draw from anymore, its guts neatly tossed aside over a year ago.</p>\n<p>And yet I dreamt.</p>\n<p>I stand over an ocean, in the dark. I can't feel the air run through my hair, the sun on my skin. Beneath my feet, a pitch black liquid lies completely motionless.</p>\n<p>Moving takes effort; all of my energy is spent turning my head to look around. Around me, endless black. Directly above me, a ring of pure white provides little comfort. Exhausted, I stare at the ring.</p>\n<p>It stares back at me.</p>\n<p>\"What do you got there, buddy?\"</p>\n<p>The familiar voice of the fish reaches out across an impossibly vast distance.</p>\n<p>I feel a weight on my hands. I instinctively try to look down, feeling every muscle in my body tense, attempting to resist my own brain. A defense mechanism. All time passes and no time passes, and I find myself looking down.</p>\n<p>A sphere of black glass sits between my hands, roughly the size of my torso. It feels fragile, and yet, immense.</p>\n<p>\"So?\"</p>\n<p>The voice echoes again.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know.\"</p>\n<p>My mouth does not move as I speak.</p>\n<p>\"You don't know much, do you?\"</p>\n<p>The ocean beneath me ripples for just a second, and I fall beneath the surface. The sphere is ripped from my hands, floating on the surface as I sink. I try to scream, and the liquid gets into my lungs.</p>\n<p>The dark recedes.</p>\n<p>Swirling shades of purple and blue.</p>\n<p>Wave after wave.</p>\n<p>Around and around.</p>\n<p>Thick. Heavy. Further and further down.</p>\n<p>You can't move.</p>\n<p>Slowly, your mind starts drifting. The sphere, on the surface, becomes all you can picture.</p>\n<p>As you continue sinking, you picture it growing in size, until it encompasses the ocean, and everything within.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When I woke up the fish was dead. It was floating belly-up in the top of the fishtank, the others ignoring it. I scooped it out and threw it into the trash, thankful to be rid of it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>One day, after waking up as usual, we found our count was one short. The Pilot was gone. His bunk had been cleaned up, the meager locker emptied of what few possessions he\u2019d collected. He left no note and we did not look for one. We assumed his time was up; he\u2019d finished his term and gone back to whatever life he\u2019d been living before this. I asked the Chemist how long he\u2019d been here.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe arrived a year after me, so four years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for five years?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled wryly. \u201cTime flies.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thought was disturbing. It had already been over a year. I didn\u2019t want to be here for four more. Part of whatever mechanism this was. But the Pilot gave me hope; evidently there was some condition which, upon fulfillment, would allow us to leave. The notes we came with gave no indication to our mission parameters \u2014 perhaps I would be here for years on years, like the Chemist, like the fish.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The first mission I went on with another was with the Surgeon. The package was delivered to the Contact. We opened it up in the kitchen as the fish stared. It was a larger one; these came by occasionally, and generally required two or more of our number to fulfill. One box for the Surgeon, and one box for me. We looked over the papers, looked at each other, and then looked at the third package inside the cardboard box.</p>\n<p>It was a mailer filled with glossy eight-by-tens of a man and a woman. They were in their forties, educated-looking. The photographs were candids, taken from several meters away while they ate at a table in some cafe, unaware they were being watched. I was confused for a moment on what we were to do with these, and watched the Surgeon.</p>\n<p>She stared intently at her photo for several minutes, the scar on her face shifting, all of her features shifting and melding until she was the doppelganger of the woman in the photo. She licked her lips, feeling out her new face. Then she looked at me expectantly.</p>\n<p>I did the same, staring at my photo of the man \u2014 clean shaven, close-cropped salt and pepper hair, brown-skinned, a sharp jawline and a slightly bent nose. I felt my own scar grow warm, and was dimly aware of my face shifting about before it settled. It took a glance in the mirror, confirming what I already knew.</p>\n<p>We took a taxi to the address in the documents. We were wearing scrubs, carrying our packages in our laps. We did not speak until we arrived. It was a private clinic, some sort of surgical boutique; the lobby exuded wealth. The receptionist greeted us as Drs. Mouhlaki and Revyan, and rushed us into an operating theater after letting us scrub up.</p>\n<p>The patient was wheeled in, unconscious and on a gurney. Pale skin under the operating lights of the theater. The nurse with us nodded, and I saw her features flicker for the slightest moment. I stepped away and let the doctors work, speaking in terse language while they cut into the patient\u2019s chest over the course of an hour.</p>\n<p>Finally, when he was open and exposed, they called me. I unlatched my package.</p>\n<p>Inside, nestled in foam, lay the same pipe bomb I had crafted so many months ago. Except now it was attached to another mechanism, some sort of amplifier. It was a crystal that was softly glowing, wires wrapped around it and attaching it to the bomb. The product of the chain. I dropped the entire thing into a plastic bag, armed the bomb, and brought it to the patient. Their chest cavity lay exposed, and I nestled the bomb inside among their organs. I didn\u2019t know how they would close it up; I left that to the surgeon over the next hour.</p>\n<p>When we were done, the nurse nodded; she would handle the rest. We left the clinic and burned our scrubs in an alley several miles away. We let the faces drop for the journey to the safehouse.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I kept dreaming.</p>\n<p>I found myself suspended in a vacuum, alone. Movement, like before, was extremely taxing, and had little point in the dark. I was not underwater, and I was not on the ground. For eternities, I fell.</p>\n<p>Then I would hear the whispers. From any direction, at irregular intervals, the slightest sound grew deafening in total isolation. In hushed tones, the abyss would tell me its secrets. The sound was clear yet indiscernible. Unknowable, unthinkable.</p>\n<p>Through it all, an image would intrude my thoughts, as if beckoned by the lullaby of the empty. A glass sphere, immense, black as the water surrounding it, somewhere far beneath me.</p>\n<p>Night by night, it grew closer.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sometimes, we had flashes of who we might've been in the past. Small flashes of what might've been cherished memories taunted us from time to time.</p>\n<p>Watching the small television we had, an advertisement would play, and I would feel a sudden pull, trying to connect to a portion of myself that refused to show itself. Although it couldn't feel familiar, that pull let me know everything I needed to know. That there was another me out there, waiting.</p>\n<p>It happened to the rest of them too\u2013 their eyes would also glaze over ever so slightly, their concentration broken. The Chemist stared intently at an advertisement for a fast food restaurant, frozen by the image of a discontinued menu item brought back for a limited time. It was only on screen for seconds, and yet her eyes remained affixed to the screen. Their expression was unreadable, her mouth hanging slightly agape.</p>\n<p>Until she noticed me.</p>\n<p>We exchanged sad smiles, knowing all of us had felt that pull. And life went on.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Exchanging faces grew easier and easier. The work required it. I\u2019d shadow someone for a week, learning their routine and recognizing the small details of their face: the little contours and the nearly-faded scars. And then I would wear them like a mask as I strolled into a facility and acted out my instructions. Nobody ever noticed; people would greet me like a friend and I let the role swallow me up, returning their greetings in kind.</p>\n<p>And then I would slip into an office and tape a small bug to the underside of a couch, or quickly drill through a wall safe and snatch the papers contained inside. The days dragged on.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I kept dreaming. Kept falling. Further and further down, towards the sphere.</p>\n<p>The abyss kept whispering, desperately now. Faster and faster, the sound becoming shrill and unintelligible. The noise devolved into static, droning as I fell.</p>\n<p>The first thing to react is my limbic system. A singular signal is transmitted to every fiber of my being.</p>\n<p><em>Fear.</em></p>\n<p>Fear beyond reason, beyond thought. In the center of my vision, even though there was no distinction between my surroundings and the ground, I could feel it.</p>\n<p>I had arrived. The sphere, its size obscured by the absence of light, greets me.</p>\n<p>I hear myself cry out, far away. Loud enough to break through the static. Loud enough to force me awake.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Chemist woke me up. Immediately, nausea took over. A pit in my stomach prevented me from moving. My hair was matted to my forehead, my body covered in cold sweats.</p>\n<p>\"You were screaming.\" A statement laced with worry, judging by her expression.</p>\n<p>My heart kept pounding, slowly returning to normal. I took this time to calm myself.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry,\" I said curtly.</p>\n<p>She motioned to the door, and we slipped out of the bunks and towards the common area. The only source of light came from the fishtank, LEDs refracting through the water and projecting waves onto the walls.</p>\n<p>\"Nightmares?\"</p>\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey come. I think it\u2019s your brain trying to knit itself back together.\u201d</p>\n<p>We sat in silence for a while, staring at the fishtank. A disassembled gun sat on the counter. Eventually, she patted my cheek and slipped away back to her bunk. I stayed up, adrenaline still coursing through my veins.</p>\n<p>I studied the fishtank. Spots of darkness danced across the water.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The packages sped up. If anyone but me noticed, they didn\u2019t mention it. Every few days now, we would get a set of assignments, along with a box of ammunition. It was too large for our pistols, so we set it to the side. The assignments came with deadlines, now; a date and time roughly scrawled with permanent marker on the inside flap of the box. We found ourselves busier than we had been before, reduced in number and with more work to do. Machines constructed or reverse-engineered. People abducted and delivered to colleagues we didn\u2019t recognize.</p>\n<p>At some point, I realized it was possible everyone I had dealt with was the same person wearing many faces. That didn\u2019t seem very likely, but it meant that the scale of this operation was unknown to me or to anyone else in it. We were all parts in the machine, clueless to its purpose.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The fish started talking to me again.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d been preparing dinner. It shocked me quite badly, because I remembered throwing it away. And looking back, it was indeed absent from the fishtank. The voice was coming from inside my head, this time. Or maybe it always had been? It was difficult to remember.</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful with that, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>My hand jolted with the knife. It came down, just barely missing my fingertip \u2014 but skinned off a section of my thumb. I winced, sucking on the wound as the blood mixed with the water on the cutting board, spreading out. Sucking my finger also meant I wouldn\u2019t accidentally respond to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought you got rid of me, huh? Yeah, doesn\u2019t quite work like that. I dunno why you\u2019d want to, anyway. I can be real helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shook my head at the others who offered to help wrap the wound.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a man, and I\u2019m just a fish.\u201d</p>\n<p>He put emphasis on the \u2018fish\u2019 and the \u2018man\u2019. I couldn\u2019t tell why.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>By then, I think all of us could tell something was coming to a head. Missions became about shadowing targets, surveilling the same place and handful of people for days and weeks. A small group of six or seven individuals of variable age, gender, ethnicity. And a small, squat facility on the outskirts of town. It was marked as a corporate office, mostly concrete with a few windows. You couldn\u2019t see inside them.</p>\n<p>We sat in the building across the street with binoculars for hours at a time, watching who entered and exited. For the few moments the doors slid open, an armed guard could be seen inside. But then the door shut. I would peer through the binoculars, trying to get a better look while ignoring the fish\u2019s taunts. I could feel it swimming around my head, whining.</p>\n<p>Shipments would come like clockwork every few nights, an unmarked box truck rolling in after being waved through the gate. It would go down the back towards the secluded delivery dock and return an hour later. We weren\u2019t sure whether they were moving things in, out, or both. But regardless of the weather, the temperature, the time, the truck came. The machine kept moving.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>One day the package was different. Contained in a sealed metal crate with a small keypad on the front. The Chemist and the Contact both tried their numbers before they got to me. I entered in the digits on my note. The latches unclicked.</p>\n<p>Inside were four smaller cardboard containers. Each contained a uniform of some kind and a black M4 carbine. The uniform was grey with a black vest over it and an orange visor. The uniform the guards inside the building had worn. We looked at the papers; blueprints. The building in them was much larger than the facility, a labyrinth of rooms and corridors, but a route had been drawn in using red marker. There were four glossy eight-by-tens of some of the figures we had been surveilling. And there was a paper with instructions on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGAIN ACCESS TO TESTING CHAMBER L5. LOCATE EXPERIMENT D456. PERFORM THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS TO IT.\u201d Followed by a long list of minute adjustments.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The night before, I was awoken by someone sitting at the foot of my bed. I peeked my eye open in silence. It was the Chemist, staring at me like she was trying to see what lay underneath my skin. I didn't speak, and neither did she. She sat there for an hour, just staring. And then she stood up in a daze, and whispered something I turned over and over in my mind as she wandered away back to her bunk and back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\"You hear it too.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>We met at a parking garage. An unmarked box truck was waiting for us, the back open and the engine running. We clambered inside. There were three more figures already inside, wearing the same face-obscuring uniform and carrying the same carbines. We didn\u2019t speak. They nodded at us. The Surgeon closed us inside, and the truck began to move.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really tell me you\u2019re happy about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>It slowed down again some time later and I heard a gate being opened. The others began to move into place, arranging themselves into a formation with rifles raised. I followed; the motion came easily and naturally.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t just want to burn it all down.\u201d</p>\n<p>I felt the truck curving around the road as it slipped into the delivery dock. Then footsteps, and the door being pulled open.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know which one of us shot, but someone did, dropping the worker to the floor. We were in some kind of loading area, workers snapping around to look and screaming before dropping to the floor.</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t waste time, flowing in and moving across to the stairs. They would kill power to the elevators immediately after realizing they were under attack. We slipped down the stairs, guns raised. All of us had the route memorized and committed to memory, but even then, the hallways of this place were strangely familiar.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not <em>angry</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>I shook the voice away. He kept swimming circles around my brain, perfect darkness of my cerebrospinal fluid. The building on the surface was hiding a vast underground facility, and we moved through it. There were people wearing labcoats with confused expressions on their faces at us marching down the hallways. They recognized our faces, asked us what was going on. One of us roughly shouted for them to return to their offices.</p>\n<p>We ran into a security team, wearing the same uniforms as us. I didn\u2019t even realize I had squeezed the trigger until the gun kicked back in my hand. We gunned them down and kept moving as the klaxons began to sound and the fluorescent white light was replaced by a deep red.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a killer now. Or maybe you already were.\u201d</p>\n<p>I read the doors we walked by. Lab L3\u2026 L4\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of us kicked in the door and I slipped inside. The lab had lockers all along the wall. I found D456 and wrenched it open. A machine was inside. Something inside me told me it was a modified reality core. I set it down on the lab table, unrolled my tools, and set to work. The others were outside.</p>\n<p>Move this wire here. Cut this wire.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re doing. Maybe you\u2019re making a nuke. Killing innocent people, buddy. You agree with that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remove this component, replace it with that.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, you don\u2019t even know what you agree with. You don\u2019t know anything about you. Maybe the old you was a pacifist. And now you shot some poor dumb fuck for the sake of the machine.\u201d</p>\n<p>My finger twitched. The screw slipped and clattered to the linoleum. It danced and echoed like gunshots.</p>\n<p>My jaw tensed. I told the fish it wasn't real.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm served over lemon on a beach somewhere. But you dreamed me up. You knew that it didn't make sense.\"</p>\n<p>My breath caught up to me. My vision was hazy. It was buzzing, now, a dull buzzing in my ears and blocking out the sound of screaming and of gunshots and of death. The fish spoke over it.</p>\n<p>\"You're an engineer. Look at it. See it. Understand it.\"</p>\n<p>I looked down at the gutted machine, vivisected across the countertop. Microchips and cables and wires and pipes going every this way and that, perfect order; all things with a place, and a place for all things.</p>\n<p>And then a fin flapped, and the water shifted, and I saw it for what it was: confusion, desperate attempts to make things fit where they could not possibly have been meant to. Haphazardly designed and re-designed, aborted components left half-complete in a machine that would, given a mouth, beg for the mercy of death. It looked up at me, empty silicon eyes reflecting my face.</p>\n<p>\"I'm natural, kid. This is natural.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is?\"</p>\n<p>\"You can't force order onto the world. Order doesn't come from that.\"</p>\n<p>I whispered. \"Where does it come from?\"</p>\n<p>\"Chaos.\"</p>\n<p>It reached out, pushed, and sent the device smashing to the floor. I watched as the components broke, shattered, smashed and mangled and compressed in perfect silence, explosions and shorts, little metal pieces spraying and falling in every direction for a lifetime until it all settled. And then, in that pile of destroyed junk, I saw nirvana.</p>\n<p>\"It makes its own order.\"</p>\n<p>From the maelstrom of destruction, everything had found its place. Where it was meant to be. It was so, so beautiful.</p>\n<p>I smiled, and deep in my head where a hole had been cut and left to fill with rainwater, the fish spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Now do what you need to.\"</p>\n<p>I lifted the screwdriver, and carefully, so, so carefully, reached up, and slid it through skin, through bone, and through brain. I speared the fish until the screaming stopped and everything went black.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>I dream, I dream about falling face-first into an endless, empty ocean. The waters are dark, cold, suffocating, but I can still just breathe. I flap my arms for a little bit, trying to establish my order, but I sink, and sink, and sink, and sink.</p>\n<p>I feel like there should be something here to guide me, to tell me what it means, but no. There never has been. Eventually my feet hit something hard, glassy. I struggle to right myself against the water-slick surface, and grasping hands find it to be a sphere. I trace the edges, and \u2014</p>\n<p>\"Everett?\"</p>\n<p>I blink awake.</p>\n<p>\"I'm\u2026 sorry?\"</p>\n<p>It's Seven. She's sitting across from my seat, white dress on paler skin and strange-flecked hair. She's staring at me with concern.</p>\n<p>\"I asked if the Atreus Array satellites are ready to be put into position over eastern China with the new ground-penetrating radar next year. Parahistory feels that that's the current best shot at locating Black Adytum.\"</p>\n<p>I nod, give a few trite details of how the engineering is coming along, and soon enough the table loses interest and goes onto the next. Onto the next, always the next. Projects and facts and figures and data, analysis, turning our impossible world into something we can try to make sense of.</p>\n<p>I try not to think about the missing year of my life. It feels like staring into an inky blackness. I don't know what's down there. But sometimes, when I'm alone in my workshop at night, poring over schematics that feel impossibly familiar, I hear something whispering to me from down there. Whispering instructions to build something vast and great and dredge it from the depths.</p>\n<p>When meetings run long, we have them prepare something. I look down at my appetizer, untouched. I've developed a taste for the luxuries recently. Little crackers topped with spinach and a dollop of caviar.</p>\n<p>Minuscule fish eggs, absorbing the light, shining like so many little black moons.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"rnb-navbar\">\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\">\n<p><a href=\"/daemon\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rnb-supertitle\">PREVIOUS</span><br/>\n\u00ab DAEMON \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current\">\n<p><a href=\"/redtape\">REDTAPE</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next boneproposal\">\n<p><a href=\"/rounderhouse-bone-proposal\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rnb-supertitle\">NEXT</span><br/>\n\u00ab THE BONE PROPOSAL \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/fishskin\">Bone Prelude: FISHSKIN</a>\" by Rounderhouse and Fishish, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I\u2019d never used it, of course \u2014 the others were the ones who handled that sort of thing. But I had brought it here, and it was the only thing I could be sure I owned, and in any case mechanisms should always be maintained. So once a week, I would bring some tools from my workshop, sit on the rickety card table next to the aquarium, and clean it.\n\n\n\nThe aquarium had been there when I\u2019d first arrived. It made for a bizarre sight; the rest of the safehouse was barren of any personal effects, decorations, or human touches. All concrete and plywood on the windows, hospital linens and simple metal cutlery. The two floors of the squat building in Tangier were connected by a rickety staircase, and the outside held an imposing iron gate. It was a place of work, of purpose.\n\n\n\nEven if any of us had wanted to decorate this place that we had lived in, some of us for years, we would have no idea what to decorate it with. I did not know what I liked, what I disliked. I had faint memories of enjoying rock bands, though trying to remember which was like grasping at smoke. Maybe I\u2019d been in one? Probably not, I thought, getting back to cleaning the half-disassembled pistol on the felt table.\n\n\n\n\u201cHard at work?\u201d\n\n\n\nI turned to look. The fish was staring right at me. It was an ugly, black thing, with a bulbous head and oily scales. The eyes were like dark pearls on either side of its head, glossy and milky and black as the rest of it. There were other fish in the tank, too, goldfish and bettas and a small eel. They were bright, colorful, darting about between fake plants and gravel. But this fish was stock-still, staring right at me, sucking the color from its surroundings. I felt a familiar buzzing in the back of my head.\n\n\n\n\u201cI asked you a question, buddy.\u201d\n\n\n\nClearly some kind of hallucination, I reasoned. Not the first I had felt since the surgery, but easily the most intrusive. I ignored it and returned to cleaning my weapon. It didn\u2019t say anything more then, but I could feel it staring.\n\n----\n\n\n\nLife in the safehouse was an exercise in ennui, occasionally interrupted by periods of intense excitement. My arrival was a period of intense excitement for the others. I showed up on the step of the iron gate, a scrap of paper in one hand and brown paper bag in the other. I was wearing a suit that didn\u2019t fit me. The Surgeon had been the one on guard duty that night, the orange end of a cigarette hanging out of her mouth. She approached, eyes narrowed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked in Russian.\n\n\n\nI was surprised to learn I spoke Russian. It didn\u2019t seem natural, though \u2014 off-kilter on my tongue and ears. A second or third language, maybe. But I answered honestly: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe looked at the paper, at my suit, at the bag, and then motioned me after her. I was ushered past the triple-locked door into the safehouse so the others could inspect me. There were five of us, including me. The Surgeon, a diminutive Russian woman, whom I had already met. The Contact, a curly-haired Mexican who shook my hand like he meant to tear it off. The Pilot, who was on the French side of French-Algerian. The Chemist, another American \u2014 she took a liking to me, I suppose because of familiarity. They passed my scrap of paper around before showing it to me.\n\n\n\n> \u201cYOU ARE A NEW RECRUIT FOR MOBILE TASK FORCE DELTA-1. FOLLOWING YOUR ASSENT TO YOUR NEW ASSIGNMENT, YOUR IDENTITY WAS SURGICALLY SEVERED FROM YOUR PHYSICAL BODY TO BETTER FACILITATE YOUR NEW MISSION. UPON SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF YOUR MISSION DIRECTIVES, YOUR IDENTITY AND MEMORIES WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU. AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. CODE: 4759\u201d \n\n\n\nI found that, indeed, I could not remember anything about who I was. My name, where I had been born, whether I had a family, all seemed fuzzy and immaterial. I reached out to them, looking for crumbs of memory, and I found nothing at all \u2014 just a wet, burning mass. The dull ache in my head turned into a painful buzzing, and I let my mind retreat. \n\n\n\nI opened the brown paper bag clutched in my hand instead. It was wrinkled and dirtied, but inside was a simple Colt 1911. I flipped it over. The serial numbers had been filed off. I dimly registered that I recognized the model and knew where to look for the serials; I clearly had some familiarity with weapons. The Chemist showed me to my bed \u2014 a simple metal bunk in a room with eight of them. I set the gun down and slept.\n\n\n\nI fell into routine the next day. Check the alarms around the safehouse, ensure none of them were tripped. The others disappeared for their respective duties; we exchanged few words, but they were friendly. Having no tasks, I took it open myself to cook our nightly meals from the ingredients the Contact brought in. I noticed the aquarium, sitting on the counter, and the dark fish inside of it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d I asked the Chemist one day.\n\n\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cThey were here when I came in. I kept feeding them when everyone else left.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re their names?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFish don\u2019t have names,\u201d she informed me.\n\n\n\nWe would eat in comfortable silence, I would clean up, one of us would take the night watch, and the rest would sleep.\n\n----\n\nThe packages were delivered at night, to whoever was keeping the watch. That was the purpose of standing outside all night smoking. We were never informed when a package would be coming; some nights, in the hours before sunrise, someone would walk by and slip a cardboard box over the gate. Sometimes a familiar figure, more often a new one.\n\n\n\nWe would open it in the morning, so we could all see. The first few were for the others \u2014 it was easy to determine who. The unlabelled amber bottles of chemicals were for the Chemist. The Surgeon received samples of something or other, or manilla folders with x-rays and medical records. I don\u2019t know what the Contact received; he seemed to simply know when one was his, and none of us cared to argue.\n\n\n\nMy first came two months after my arrival. The hallucinations were minor, then \u2014 spiders in the corner or a soft sonata playing over the wind. The Surgeon cut through the duct tape, looked inside, and then pushed it over to me.\n\n\n\nIt was a number of materials \u2014 pipes, pre-fabricated parts, a welding iron, wires. Sitting atop a number of Xeroxed manuals and diagrams. I looked at them and found I understood them fairly well, and that was that. I took them to a free desk and worked for a few hours, fingers acting by themselves, only realizing midway through that a pipe bomb was taking shape in my hands. I looked at the Chemist, who nodded encouragingly. \n\n\n\nWhen it was complete, the Contact came by and clapped my shoulders, complimenting it. He took it and was gone. My part in the play was finished, and now his had begun. \n\n\n\nThe assignments came steadily after that. I would inspect the parts I was given, the manuals and diagrams, and build what I was expected to. I found I always had the requisite knowledge, of how these wires would fit together and how to seal two pieces of metal and fix the mechanism. I would place the finished product back in the cardboard box and give it to whoever took the night watch. Without fail, someone would be there to pick it up, no matter how long it took for me to finish.\n\n\n\n\u00a0I rarely understood what I was building \u2014 sometimes bombs, but sometimes a false lock or optic spike. Often they were simply components of a larger machine. Occasionally I was given a number of these components to assemble into something partial, incomplete, to send off to someone else. It was a chain, and I had no idea where in it I lay.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pipe bomb was a test, buddy.\u201d\n\n\n\nI ignored the fish, driving the screw into place. \n\n\n\n\u201cThey want to see if you can shut up and follow directions without knowing what the consequences will be. Be a good cog in the machine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do?\u201d I asked, looking behind me. \n\n\n\nThe fish was looking at me with that dark eye. Its mouth was hanging open, tiny white teeth showing.\n\n\n\nThen the Pilot entered, and I went silent. No need for the others to know I was losing my mind.\n\n----\n\nThe others disappeared from time to time, sometimes for days or weeks. Their assignments took them outside of the safehouse. Mine rarely did, for those first few months. Then one day the package was a set of papers detailing an assignment. The Surgeon looked over them, and then showed them to me. My first foray into the outside. \n\n\n\nI wasn\u2019t nervous. I had no way of knowing, but I had the sensation I had done this many times. I checked my weapon, stuffed it under my shirt, and left the safehouse. The Chemist rubbed my shoulder before I left and reassured me I would do fine.\n\n\n\nIstanbul is a city overflowing with warmth and color. I was not surprised by any of it, and found myself recognizing several streets as I pushed through the crowds. I had been here before, evidently. The instructions only listed an address and I found my way there. It was a small, nondescript office building. The lobby had no security guard behind the desk. I took the elevator to the second floor; the place was deserted, but as the instructions had stated, a small round machine the size of my palm was tucked inside the houseplant. The digital screen displayed the time. \n\n\n\nI took the elevator down to the underground garage. There were a handful of cars in the greenish light. The one bearing the given license plate number was an expensive black Mercedes. A driver was leaning against the hood. He watched me approach. He had an ugly scar on his face \u2014 a branding or mark of a spiraling circle.\n\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t say anything. He simply straightened himself, leaned around, and opened the back door of the car. I looked inside, placed the machine gently out of sight underneath the seat, grasped the black briefcase on the floor, and walked away. I exchanged nods with the driver as I walked away and he returned to smoking against the hood of the car. I saw his face flicker, malform, and reshape into the features of a handsome young man, unscarred.\n\n\n\nI looked away and left. The briefcase went into the package, and the package went into the Pilot\u2019s hands. \n\n\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to do much of anything to you at all, did they, buddy? You\u2019re a glutton for the punishment. You love this.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe fish was drifting lazily in his aquarium. I looked at him askance, into those black pearls, and went to bed.\n\n\n\nThat night, I dreamt for the first time since I arrived at Tangier.\n\n----\n\n\n\nI didn't find myself worried about the lack of dreaming, ascribing it to a combination of long-term insomnia and the surgery. After all, there is no subconscious to draw from anymore, its guts neatly tossed aside over a year ago.\n\n\n\nAnd yet I dreamt. \n\n\n\nI stand over an ocean, in the dark. I can't feel the air run through my hair, the sun on my skin. Beneath my feet, a pitch black liquid lies completely motionless.\n\n\n\nMoving takes effort; all of my energy is spent turning my head to look around. Around me, endless black. Directly above me, a ring of pure white provides little comfort. Exhausted, I stare at the ring. \n\n\n\nIt stares back at me.\n\n\n\n\"What do you got there, buddy?\"\n\n\n\nThe familiar voice of the fish reaches out across an impossibly vast distance.\n\n\n\nI feel a weight on my hands. I instinctively try to look down, feeling every muscle in my body tense, attempting to resist my own brain. A defense mechanism. All time passes and no time passes, and I find myself looking down.\n\n\n\nA sphere of black glass sits between my hands, roughly the size of my torso. It feels fragile, and yet, immense. \n\n\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\n\nThe voice echoes again. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nMy mouth does not move as I speak.\n\n\n\n\"You don't know much, do you?\"\n\n\n\nThe ocean beneath me ripples for just a second, and I fall beneath the surface. The sphere is ripped from my hands, floating on the surface as I sink. I try to scream, and the liquid gets into my lungs.\n\n\n\nThe dark recedes. \n\n\n\nSwirling shades of purple and blue. \n\n\n\nWave after wave.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Around and around. \n\n\n\nThick. Heavy. Further and further down.\n\n\n\nYou can't move. \n\n\n\nSlowly, your mind starts drifting. The sphere, on the surface, becomes all you can picture. \n\n\n\nAs you continue sinking, you picture it growing in size, until it encompasses the ocean, and everything within.\n\n\n\n----\n\nWhen I woke up the fish was dead. It was floating belly-up in the top of the fishtank, the others ignoring it. I scooped it out and threw it into the trash, thankful to be rid of it.\n\n----\n\nOne day, after waking up as usual, we found our count was one short. The Pilot was gone. His bunk had been cleaned up, the meager locker emptied of what few possessions he\u2019d collected. He left no note and we did not look for one. We assumed his time was up; he\u2019d finished his term and gone back to whatever life he\u2019d been living before this. I asked the Chemist how long he\u2019d been here.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe arrived a year after me, so four years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for five years?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe smiled wryly. \u201cTime flies.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe thought was disturbing. It had already been over a year. I didn\u2019t want to be here for four more. Part of whatever mechanism this was. But the Pilot gave me hope; evidently there was some condition which, upon fulfillment, would allow us to leave. The notes we came with gave no indication to our mission parameters \u2014 perhaps I would be here for years on years, like the Chemist, like the fish.\n\n----\n\nThe first mission I went on with another was with the Surgeon. The package was delivered to the Contact. We opened it up in the kitchen as the fish stared. It was a larger one; these came by occasionally, and generally required two or more of our number to fulfill. One box for the Surgeon, and one box for me. We looked over the papers, looked at each other, and then looked at the third package inside the cardboard box.\n\n\n\nIt was a mailer filled with glossy eight-by-tens of a man and a woman. They were in their forties, educated-looking. The photographs were candids, taken from several meters away while they ate at a table in some cafe, unaware they were being watched. I was confused for a moment on what we were to do with these, and watched the Surgeon.\n\n\n\nShe stared intently at her photo for several minutes, the scar on her face shifting, all of her features shifting and melding until she was the doppelganger of the woman in the photo. She licked her lips, feeling out her new face. Then she looked at me expectantly.\n\n\n\nI did the same, staring at my photo of the man \u2014 clean shaven, close-cropped salt and pepper hair, brown-skinned, a sharp jawline and a slightly bent nose. I felt my own scar grow warm, and was dimly aware of my face shifting about before it settled. It took a glance in the mirror, confirming what I already knew.\n\n\n\nWe took a taxi to the address in the documents. We were wearing scrubs, carrying our packages in our laps. We did not speak until we arrived. It was a private clinic, some sort of surgical boutique; the lobby exuded wealth. The receptionist greeted us as Drs. Mouhlaki and Revyan, and rushed us into an operating theater after letting us scrub up.\n\n\n\nThe patient was wheeled in, unconscious and on a gurney. Pale skin under the operating lights of the theater. The nurse with us nodded, and I saw her features flicker for the slightest moment. I stepped away and let the doctors work, speaking in terse language while they cut into the patient\u2019s chest over the course of an hour.\n\n\n\nFinally, when he was open and exposed, they called me. I unlatched my package.\n\n\n\nInside, nestled in foam, lay the same pipe bomb I had crafted so many months ago. Except now it was attached to another mechanism, some sort of amplifier. It was a crystal that was softly glowing, wires wrapped around it and attaching it to the bomb. The product of the chain. I dropped the entire thing into a plastic bag, armed the bomb, and brought it to the patient. Their chest cavity lay exposed, and I nestled the bomb inside among their organs. I didn\u2019t know how they would close it up; I left that to the surgeon over the next hour. \n\n\n\nWhen we were done, the nurse nodded; she would handle the rest. We left the clinic and burned our scrubs in an alley several miles away. We let the faces drop for the journey to the safehouse.\n\n----\n\n\n\nI kept dreaming. \n\n\n\nI found myself suspended in a vacuum, alone. Movement, like before, was extremely taxing, and had little point in the dark. I was not underwater, and I was not on the ground. For eternities, I fell.\n\n\n\nThen I would hear the whispers. From any direction, at irregular intervals, the slightest sound grew deafening in total isolation. In hushed tones, the abyss would tell me its secrets. The sound was clear yet indiscernible. Unknowable, unthinkable.\n\n\n\nThrough it all, an image would intrude my thoughts, as if beckoned by the lullaby of the empty. A glass sphere, immense, black as the water surrounding it, somewhere far beneath me. \n\n\n\nNight by night, it grew closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\nSometimes, we had flashes of who we might've been in the past. Small flashes of what might've been cherished memories taunted us from time to time. \n\n\n\nWatching the small television we had, an advertisement would play, and I would feel a sudden pull, trying to connect to a portion of myself that refused to show itself. Although it couldn't feel familiar, that pull let me know everything I needed to know. That there was another me out there, waiting.\n\n\n\nIt happened to the rest of them too\u2013 their eyes would also glaze over ever so slightly, their concentration broken. The Chemist stared intently at an advertisement for a fast food restaurant, frozen by the image of a discontinued menu item brought back for a limited time. It was only on screen for seconds, and yet her eyes remained affixed to the screen. Their expression was unreadable, her mouth hanging slightly agape.\n\n\n\nUntil she noticed me.\n\n\n\nWe exchanged sad smiles, knowing all of us had felt that pull. And life went on.\n\n----\n\nExchanging faces grew easier and easier. The work required it. I\u2019d shadow someone for a week, learning their routine and recognizing the small details of their face: the little contours and the nearly-faded scars. And then I would wear them like a mask as I strolled into a facility and acted out my instructions. Nobody ever noticed; people would greet me like a friend and I let the role swallow me up, returning their greetings in kind.\n\n\n\nAnd then I would slip into an office and tape a small bug to the underside of a couch, or quickly drill through a wall safe and snatch the papers contained inside. The days dragged on.\n\n----\n\n\n\nI kept dreaming. Kept falling. Further and further down, towards the sphere.\n\n\n\nThe abyss kept whispering, desperately now. Faster and faster, the sound becoming shrill and unintelligible. The noise devolved into static, droning as I fell.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to react is my limbic system. A singular signal is transmitted to every fiber of my being. \n\n\n\n//Fear.//\n\n\n\nFear beyond reason, beyond thought. In the center of my vision, even though there was no distinction between my surroundings and the ground, I could feel it.\n\n\n\nI had arrived. The sphere, its size obscured by the absence of light, greets me. \n\n\n\nI hear myself cry out, far away. Loud enough to break through the static. Loud enough to force me awake.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe Chemist woke me up. Immediately, nausea took over. A pit in my stomach prevented me from moving. My hair was matted to my forehead, my body covered in cold sweats. \n\n\n\n\"You were screaming.\" A statement laced with worry, judging by her expression.\n\n\n\nMy heart kept pounding, slowly returning to normal. I took this time to calm myself. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said curtly.\n\n\n\nShe motioned to the door, and we slipped out of the bunks and towards the common area. The only source of light came from the fishtank, LEDs refracting through the water and projecting waves onto the walls.\n\n\n\n\"Nightmares?\"\n\n\n\nI nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey come. I think it\u2019s your brain trying to knit itself back together.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe sat in silence for a while, staring at the fishtank. A disassembled gun sat on the counter. Eventually, she patted my cheek and slipped away back to her bunk. I stayed up, adrenaline still coursing through my veins.\n\n\n\nI studied the fishtank. Spots of darkness danced across the water.\n\n\n\n----\n\nThe packages sped up. If anyone but me noticed, they didn\u2019t mention it. Every few days now, we would get a set of assignments, along with a box of ammunition. It was too large for our pistols, so we set it to the side. The assignments came with deadlines, now; a date and time roughly scrawled with permanent marker on the inside flap of the box. We found ourselves busier than we had been before, reduced in number and with more work to do. Machines constructed or reverse-engineered. People abducted and delivered to colleagues we didn\u2019t recognize. \n\n\n\nAt some point, I realized it was possible everyone I had dealt with was the same person wearing many faces. That didn\u2019t seem very likely, but it meant that the scale of this operation was unknown to me or to anyone else in it. We were all parts in the machine, clueless to its purpose.\n\n----\n\nThe fish started talking to me again.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d been preparing dinner. It shocked me quite badly, because I remembered throwing it away. And looking back, it was indeed absent from the fishtank. The voice was coming from inside my head, this time. Or maybe it always had been? It was difficult to remember.\n\n\n\n\u201cCareful with that, buddy.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy hand jolted with the knife. It came down, just barely missing my fingertip \u2014 but skinned off a section of my thumb. I winced, sucking on the wound as the blood mixed with the water on the cutting board, spreading out. Sucking my finger also meant I wouldn\u2019t accidentally respond to it.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou thought you got rid of me, huh? Yeah, doesn\u2019t quite work like that. I dunno why you\u2019d want to, anyway. I can be real helpful.\u201d\n\n\n\nI shook my head at the others who offered to help wrap the wound.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a man, and I\u2019m just a fish.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe put emphasis on the \u2018fish\u2019 and the \u2018man\u2019. I couldn\u2019t tell why.\n\n----\n\nBy then, I think all of us could tell something was coming to a head. Missions became about shadowing targets, surveilling the same place and handful of people for days and weeks. A small group of six or seven individuals of variable age, gender, ethnicity. And a small, squat facility on the outskirts of town. It was marked as a corporate office, mostly concrete with a few windows. You couldn\u2019t see inside them. \n\n\n\nWe sat in the building across the street with binoculars for hours at a time, watching who entered and exited. For the few moments the doors slid open, an armed guard could be seen inside. But then the door shut. I would peer through the binoculars, trying to get a better look while ignoring the fish\u2019s taunts. I could feel it swimming around my head, whining.\n\n\n\nShipments would come like clockwork every few nights, an unmarked box truck rolling in after being waved through the gate. It would go down the back towards the secluded delivery dock and return an hour later. We weren\u2019t sure whether they were moving things in, out, or both. But regardless of the weather, the temperature, the time, the truck came. The machine kept moving.\n\n----\n\nOne day the package was different. Contained in a sealed metal crate with a small keypad on the front. The Chemist and the Contact both tried their numbers before they got to me. I entered in the digits on my note. The latches unclicked.\n\n\n\nInside were four smaller cardboard containers. Each contained a uniform of some kind and a black M4 carbine. The uniform was grey with a black vest over it and an orange visor. The uniform the guards inside the building had worn. We looked at the papers; blueprints. The building in them was much larger than the facility, a labyrinth of rooms and corridors, but a route had been drawn in using red marker. There were four glossy eight-by-tens of some of the figures we had been surveilling. And there was a paper with instructions on it.\n\n\n\n\u201cGAIN ACCESS TO TESTING CHAMBER L5. LOCATE EXPERIMENT D456. PERFORM THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS TO IT.\u201d Followed by a long list of minute adjustments.\n\n----\n\nThe night before, I was awoken by someone sitting at the foot of my bed. I peeked my eye open in silence. It was the Chemist, staring at me like she was trying to see what lay underneath my skin. I didn't speak, and neither did she. She sat there for an hour, just staring. And then she stood up in a daze, and whispered something I turned over and over in my mind as she wandered away back to her bunk and back to sleep.\n\n\n\n\"You hear it too.\"\n\n----\n\nWe met at a parking garage. An unmarked box truck was waiting for us, the back open and the engine running. We clambered inside. There were three more figures already inside, wearing the same face-obscuring uniform and carrying the same carbines. We didn\u2019t speak. They nodded at us. The Surgeon closed us inside, and the truck began to move. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really tell me you\u2019re happy about this.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt slowed down again some time later and I heard a gate being opened. The others began to move into place, arranging themselves into a formation with rifles raised. I followed; the motion came easily and naturally.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat you don\u2019t just want to burn it all down.\u201d\n\n\n\nI felt the truck curving around the road as it slipped into the delivery dock. Then footsteps, and the door being pulled open.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know which one of us shot, but someone did, dropping the worker to the floor. We were in some kind of loading area, workers snapping around to look and screaming before dropping to the floor.\n\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t waste time, flowing in and moving across to the stairs. They would kill power to the elevators immediately after realizing they were under attack. We slipped down the stairs, guns raised. All of us had the route memorized and committed to memory, but even then, the hallways of this place were strangely familiar. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not //angry//?\u201d\n\n\n\nI shook the voice away. He kept swimming circles around my brain, perfect darkness of my cerebrospinal fluid. The building on the surface was hiding a vast underground facility, and we moved through it. There were people wearing labcoats with confused expressions on their faces at us marching down the hallways. They recognized our faces, asked us what was going on. One of us roughly shouted for them to return to their offices. \n\n\n\nWe ran into a security team, wearing the same uniforms as us. I didn\u2019t even realize I had squeezed the trigger until the gun kicked back in my hand. We gunned them down and kept moving as the klaxons began to sound and the fluorescent white light was replaced by a deep red.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a killer now. Or maybe you already were.\u201d\n\n\n\nI read the doors we walked by. Lab L3\u2026 L4\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of us kicked in the door and I slipped inside. The lab had lockers all along the wall. I found D456 and wrenched it open. A machine was inside. Something inside me told me it was a modified reality core. I set it down on the lab table, unrolled my tools, and set to work. The others were outside. \n\n\n\nMove this wire here. Cut this wire. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re doing. Maybe you\u2019re making a nuke. Killing innocent people, buddy. You agree with that?\u201d\n\n\n\nRemove this component, replace it with that.\n\n\n\n\u201cShit, you don\u2019t even know what you agree with. You don\u2019t know anything about you. Maybe the old you was a pacifist. And now you shot some poor dumb fuck for the sake of the machine.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy finger twitched. The screw slipped and clattered to the linoleum. It danced and echoed like gunshots.\n\n\n\nMy jaw tensed. I told the fish it wasn't real.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm served over lemon on a beach somewhere. But you dreamed me up. You knew that it didn't make sense.\"\n\n\n\nMy breath caught up to me. My vision was hazy. It was buzzing, now, a dull buzzing in my ears and blocking out the sound of screaming and of gunshots and of death. The fish spoke over it.\n\n\n\n\"You're an engineer. Look at it. See it. Understand it.\"\n\n\n\nI looked down at the gutted machine, vivisected across the countertop. Microchips and cables and wires and pipes going every this way and that, perfect order; all things with a place, and a place for all things.\n\n\n\nAnd then a fin flapped, and the water shifted, and I saw it for what it was: confusion, desperate attempts to make things fit where they could not possibly have been meant to. Haphazardly designed and re-designed, aborted components left half-complete in a machine that would, given a mouth, beg for the mercy of death. It looked up at me, empty silicon eyes reflecting my face.\n\n\n\n\"I'm natural, kid. This is natural.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\n\n\"You can't force order onto the world. Order doesn't come from that.\"\n\n\n\nI whispered. \"Where does it come from?\"\n\n\n\n\"Chaos.\"\n\n\n\nIt reached out, pushed, and sent the device smashing to the floor. I watched as the components broke, shattered, smashed and mangled and compressed in perfect silence, explosions and shorts, little metal pieces spraying and falling in every direction for a lifetime until it all settled. And then, in that pile of destroyed junk, I saw nirvana.\n\n\n\n\"It makes its own order.\"\n\n\n\nFrom the maelstrom of destruction, everything had found its place. Where it was meant to be. It was so, so beautiful.\n\n\n\nI smiled, and deep in my head where a hole had been cut and left to fill with rainwater, the fish spoke.\n\n\n\n\"Now do what you need to.\"\n\n\n\nI lifted the screwdriver, and carefully, so, so carefully, reached up, and slid it through skin, through bone, and through brain. I speared the fish until the screaming stopped and everything went black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 100px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 70px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 50px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 30px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 15px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 10px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 5px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 3px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: #000; height: 1px\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n\n\nI dream, I dream about falling face-first into an endless, empty ocean. The waters are dark, cold, suffocating, but I can still just breathe. I flap my arms for a little bit, trying to establish my order, but I sink, and sink, and sink, and sink.\n\n\n\nI feel like there should be something here to guide me, to tell me what it means, but no. There never has been. Eventually my feet hit something hard, glassy. I struggle to right myself against the water-slick surface, and grasping hands find it to be a sphere. I trace the edges, and --\n\n\n\n\"Everett?\"\n\n\n\nI blink awake.\n\n\n\n\"I'm... sorry?\"\n\n\n\nIt's Seven. She's sitting across from my seat, white dress on paler skin and strange-flecked hair. She's staring at me with concern. \n\n\n\n\"I asked if the Atreus Array satellites are ready to be put into position over eastern China with the new ground-penetrating radar next year. Parahistory feels that that's the current best shot at locating Black Adytum.\"\n\n\n\nI nod, give a few trite details of how the engineering is coming along, and soon enough the table loses interest and goes onto the next. Onto the next, always the next. Projects and facts and figures and data, analysis, turning our impossible world into something we can try to make sense of.\n\n\n\nI try not to think about the missing year of my life. It feels like staring into an inky blackness. I don't know what's down there. But sometimes, when I'm alone in my workshop at night, poring over schematics that feel impossibly familiar, I hear something whispering to me from down there. Whispering instructions to build something vast and great and dredge it from the depths.\n\n\n\nWhen meetings run long, we have them prepare something. I look down at my appetizer, untouched. I've developed a taste for the luxuries recently. Little crackers topped with spinach and a dollop of caviar.\n\n\n\nMinuscule fish eggs, absorbing the light, shining like so many little black moons.\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-navbar\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/daemon\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]PREVIOUS[[/span]]\n\n<< DAEMON >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/redtape\"]]REDTAPE[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next boneproposal\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/rounderhouse-bone-proposal\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]NEXT[[/span]]\n\n<< THE BONE PROPOSAL >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Rounderhouse and Fishish]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:info-ayers", "daemon", "redtape", "rounderhouse-bone-proposal", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["chaos-insurgency", "co-authored", "doctor-mann", "first-person", "military-fiction", "spy-fiction", "surrealism", "tale"], "title": "Bone Prelude: FISHSKIN - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fishskin", "year": 2025}, "gravecall-memory-exploit": {"created_at": "2025-01-05T05:14:00", "creator": "Pedantique", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"0.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:14:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-05T05:14:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"6.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"5.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"4.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"2.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"3.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"1.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:15:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"12.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:16:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"11.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:16:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"10.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:16:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"9.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:16:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"8.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:16:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"7.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:16:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-05T05:17:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"GraveCall.pdf\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:17:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Uploaded file \"13.png\".", "date": "2025-01-05T05:17:00"}, {"author": "Pedantique", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedantique", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

One that explained why their Anderson Robotics prosthetic arm wasn't working anymore. One that explained why the Breach hadn't happened this year.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, one that explained why Jay Everwood's partner, Ilse Reynders, had been so ill as of late.</p>\n<p>They made a mad dash from their office and onto the Inter-Sectional Subway System, leaving the terminal on their office open. Jay was able to catch the shuttle right before it left the station. They reached into their lab coat pocket in search of their Foundation-issue miniature tablet to re-read the email, only to find that they had left it in their office.</p>\n<p>\"Shit,\" they muttered. It didn't make a difference. It wasn't going to help Ilse get better.</p>\n<p>It happened suddenly one night a few weeks ago. Jay and Ilse were sitting on their back porch drinking tea and watching James play in the sandbox. She suddenly dropped her cup of matcha and went catatonic. She spilled her tea all over herself and started muttering incoherently. Jay and James tried to snap her out of it to no avail.</p>\n<p>Jay had to call the Site for help since they couldn't move her due to them being literally shorthanded. Billie Forsythe had come down to their home, and she wanted to take Ilse into the Site's medical wing. They forbade it, since Ilse would have hated being forced to go back underground. Billie eventually relented, and she became the at-home care nurse for her.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Jay had heard rumors that Phillip Deering's \"friend\" Doug had disappeared. Udo lost her spark. The Breach came and went without anything happening. More and more dominoes continued to fall until eventually, that email confirming what Jay had been dreading arrived.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/quiet-days\" target=\"_blank\">\"Anomalous activity worldwide has ceased.\"</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After what felt like the longest trip to Grand Bend ever, Jay ran as fast as their legs could carry them to the home they had built their family in. They felt they were abandoning their wife and child every day they went into the Site, but the Foundation would not allow them to work from home. Bursting through the door, Jay rushed upstairs to their bedroom and left the portal open.</p>\n<p>Billie sat at her bedside, holding Ilse's hand. The room was full of \"get well soon\" cards, flowers, and stuffed animals from everyone at the Site. The black curtains flapped in the incoming breeze from the open window, which Billie had opened to air out the scent of urine and aerosol.</p>\n<p>\"How is she?\" Jay gasped out between breaths.</p>\n<p>\"She's been in and out of consciousness, but she's awake now. I changed her half an hour ago. Breathing is getting labored though.\" She sighed.</p>\n<p>\"Ilse? Ilse, can you hear me? How do you feel?\" They approached, taking the ailing woman's hand in their own.</p>\n<p><em>\"\u2026Mama? Ben jij dat?\"</em> Ilse coughed out, eyes cloudy.</p>\n<p>\"No, it's me, Jay.\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Ik ben zo moe\u2026\"</em> Her voice drifted off as she spoke.</p>\n<p>Jay's eyes were swelling as they desperately clutched Ilse's hand in theirs.</p>\n<p>\"You know I barely speak your made-up language\u2026 But it's okay. Everything is going to be okay.\"</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>Billie grimaced. She got up and moved towards Jay, putting a hand on their shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"I'll go check on James,\" she said, to which Jay nodded.</p>\n<p><em>\"Ik voel me zo zwakjes, Lys\u2026\"</em></p>\n<p>Jay's face was the same color as Ilse's hair. They knelt down and began sobbing, desperately clutching her hand.</p>\n<p>\"The O5 sent an email today,\" they hiccuped between sobs. \"I don't want to talk about work with you while you're like this, but\u2026 Ilse, the magic is gone.\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Wat? Waar ben ik? Ik moet naar huis.\"</em></p>\n<p>\"Your age finally caught up to you, dear.\" Jay broke down sobbing as Ilse shut her eyes.</p>\n<p><em>\"Ik denk dat ik een dutje nodig heb\u2026\"</em></p>\n<p>Jay remained in position. They continued to weep until suddenly, Ilse's chest stopped moving. A brief, reticent death rattle escaped her lips. It was only barely audible to Jay, who stopped their crying upon hearing it. They sighed and got back up, letting go of their partner's hand.</p>\n<p>A soft, yet cold breeze entered through the open window, making the black curtains float for a moment. Jay approached the window and considered shutting it for the briefest of moments before remembering a story Ilse had told them a while back. Deciding against it, they merely watched the curtains dance in the wind.</p>\n<p>They turned to face the standing mirror where Ilse would experiment with makeup and her hair and remembered another story Director Leiner had told them. Jay grabbed the spare bed sheet Billie had left on the nightstand and used it to cover the mirror. A sigh escaped their lips as they turned to face the bed Ilse's body rested on, and tears welled in their eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Until we meet again.\"</p>\n<p>They exited the room and made their way down the stairs. Billie had shut the front door and was sitting with James in the living room across the hallway. Jay and Billie exchanged glances, to which the latter nodded and got up, hugged them, and then made her way upstairs again.</p>\n<p>James, for his part, was playing on his Switch. Jay approached him and took a seat beside him on the couch, putting their only arm around him.</p>\n<p>\"James. Mom\u2026 is dead.\" They sighed.</p>\n<p>\"I thought mom was immoral, like me,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Immortal, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's what I said!\" The boy stopped, putting down his game system. He turned to face his parent, a confused expression on his face. \"What does dead mean?\"</p>\n<p>There was a brief silence, during which Jay nearly broke out into tears again.</p>\n<p>\"It's\u2026 when someone goes to sleep and never wakes up.\"</p>\n<p>\"But mom always wakes up.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not this time.\"</p>\n<p>Silence once more.</p>\n<p>James seemed to be processing what Jay had just said. He picked up his Switch again and turned it off.</p>\n<p>\"What are we going to do?\" he asked in a tone that Jay couldn't quite read.</p>\n<p>\"Come, let's take you to go see your mom one last time before the Site coroner comes.\" Jay's eyes overflowed with tears at the thought of their son now also being mortal. They weren't as concerned about their own death before, since they knew he would have Ilse as a fellow immortal. But there was no telling what would happen next.</p>\n<p>James, upon seeing his parent begin to openly start crying, began sniffling and crying himself.

One that explained why their Anderson Robotics prosthetic arm wasn't working anymore. One that explained why the Breach hadn't happened this year.\n\n\n\nBut more importantly, one that explained why Jay Everwood's partner, Ilse Reynders, had been so ill as of late. \n\n\n\nThey made a mad dash from their office and onto the Inter-Sectional Subway System, leaving the terminal on their office open. Jay was able to catch the shuttle right before it left the station. They reached into their lab coat pocket in search of their Foundation-issue miniature tablet to re-read the email, only to find that they had left it in their office. \n\n\n\n\"Shit,\" they muttered. It didn't make a difference. It wasn't going to help Ilse get better.\n\n\n\nIt happened suddenly one night a few weeks ago. Jay and Ilse were sitting on their back porch drinking tea and watching James play in the sandbox. She suddenly dropped her cup of matcha and went catatonic. She spilled her tea all over herself and started muttering incoherently. Jay and James tried to snap her out of it to no avail. \n\n\n\nJay had to call the Site for help since they couldn't move her due to them being literally shorthanded. Billie Forsythe had come down to their home, and she wanted to take Ilse into the Site's medical wing. They forbade it, since Ilse would have hated being forced to go back underground. Billie eventually relented, and she became the at-home care nurse for her. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, Jay had heard rumors that Phillip Deering's \"friend\" Doug had disappeared. Udo lost her spark. The Breach came and went without anything happening. More and more dominoes continued to fall until eventually, that email confirming what Jay had been dreading arrived.\n\n\n\n> **[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/quiet-days \"Anomalous activity worldwide has ceased.\"]**\n\n\n\nAfter what felt like the longest trip to Grand Bend ever, Jay ran as fast as their legs could carry them to the home they had built their family in. They felt they were abandoning their wife and child every day they went into the Site, but the Foundation would not allow them to work from home. Bursting through the door, Jay rushed upstairs to their bedroom and left the portal open. \n\n\n\nBillie sat at her bedside, holding Ilse's hand. The room was full of \"get well soon\" cards, flowers, and stuffed animals from everyone at the Site. The black curtains flapped in the incoming breeze from the open window, which Billie had opened to air out the scent of urine and aerosol.\n\n\n\n\"How is she?\" Jay gasped out between breaths.\n\n\n\n\"She's been in and out of consciousness, but she's awake now. I changed her half an hour ago. Breathing is getting labored though.\" She sighed.\n\n\n\n\"Ilse? Ilse, can you hear me? How do you feel?\" They approached, taking the ailing woman's hand in their own.\n\n\n\n//\"...Mama? Ben jij dat?\"// Ilse coughed out, eyes cloudy.\n\n\n\n\"No, it's me, Jay.\"\n\n\n\n//\"Ik ben zo moe...\"// Her voice drifted off as she spoke.\n\n\n\nJay's eyes were swelling as they desperately clutched Ilse's hand in theirs. \n\n\n\n\"You know I barely speak your made-up language... But it's okay. Everything is going to be okay.\"\n\n\n\nSilence. \n\n\n\nBillie grimaced. She got up and moved towards Jay, putting a hand on their shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"I'll go check on James,\" she said, to which Jay nodded.\n\n\n\n//\"Ik voel me zo zwakjes, Lys...\"//\n\n\n\nJay's face was the same color as Ilse's hair. They knelt down and began sobbing, desperately clutching her hand.\n\n\n\n\"The O5 sent an email today,\" they hiccuped between sobs. \"I don't want to talk about work with you while you're like this, but... Ilse, the magic is gone.\"\n\n\n\n//\"Wat? Waar ben ik? Ik moet naar huis.\"//\n\n\n\n\"Your age finally caught up to you, dear.\" Jay broke down sobbing as Ilse shut her eyes.\n\n\n\n//\"Ik denk dat ik een dutje nodig heb...\"// \n\n\n\nJay remained in position. They continued to weep until suddenly, Ilse's chest stopped moving. A brief, reticent death rattle escaped her lips. It was only barely audible to Jay, who stopped their crying upon hearing it. They sighed and got back up, letting go of their partner's hand. \n\n\n\nA soft, yet cold breeze entered through the open window, making the black curtains float for a moment. Jay approached the window and considered shutting it for the briefest of moments before remembering a story Ilse had told them a while back. Deciding against it, they merely watched the curtains dance in the wind.\n\n\n\nThey turned to face the standing mirror where Ilse would experiment with makeup and her hair and remembered another story Director Leiner had told them. Jay grabbed the spare bed sheet Billie had left on the nightstand and used it to cover the mirror. A sigh escaped their lips as they turned to face the bed Ilse's body rested on, and tears welled in their eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Until we meet again.\" \n\n\n\nThey exited the room and made their way down the stairs. Billie had shut the front door and was sitting with James in the living room across the hallway. Jay and Billie exchanged glances, to which the latter nodded and got up, hugged them, and then made her way upstairs again. \n\n\n\nJames, for his part, was playing on his Switch. Jay approached him and took a seat beside him on the couch, putting their only arm around him.\n\n\n\n\"James. Mom... is dead.\" They sighed.\n\n\n\n\"I thought mom was immoral, like me,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Immortal, James.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's what I said!\" The boy stopped, putting down his game system. He turned to face his parent, a confused expression on his face. \"What does dead mean?\"\n\n\n\nThere was a brief silence, during which Jay nearly broke out into tears again.\n\n\n\n\"It's... when someone goes to sleep and never wakes up.\" \n\n\n\n\"But mom always wakes up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not this time.\"\n\n\n\nSilence once more. \n\n\n\nJames seemed to be processing what Jay had just said. He picked up his Switch again and turned it off. \n\n\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" he asked in a tone that Jay couldn't quite read.\n\n\n\n\"Come, let's take you to go see your mom one last time before the Site coroner comes.\" Jay's eyes overflowed with tears at the thought of their son now also being mortal. They weren't as concerned about their own death before, since they knew he would have Ilse as a fellow immortal. But there was no telling what would happen next.\n\n\n\nJames, upon seeing his parent begin to openly start crying, began sniffling and crying himself. He launched himself at their side, clinging to them in a tight embrace.\n\n\n\n\"I love you,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I love you too, James.\" \n\n\n\n\"Am I still immortal?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's going to happen to me?\"\n\n\n\n\"... I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm scared.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm scared too, but everything is going to be okay. I promise.\"\n\n\n\nJust like Jay had promised Ilse.\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nThe World Kept Turning **|** **__[[[A Passing Rain]]]__** **>>**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wikimodule\">:scp-wiki:component:wikimodule</a> |normal= --]]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Uncle Nicolini]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["quiet-days", "a-passing-rain", "scp-admonition-j", "scp-4726", "scp-4934", "scp-5148", "scp-4206", "scp-3297", "scp-4003", "scp-7926", "scp-7337", "scp-pl-274", "scp-3867", "scp-6467", "scp-3756", "scp-3874", "scp-8984", "raisa-6147", "spc-446", "cool-guys-dont-look-at-explosions", "september-eleven-prequel", "scp-wiki-discussion-page-simulator", "the-case-of-the-bathroom-cheese-labels", "paralytic-states", "clef-goes-to-the-dmv", "phoenix-a-la-mode", "chicago-factory", "nicos-stupid-proposal", "divine-intervention", "halloween-anthology-boring-2021", "parawatch-intro-thread", "nobody-likes-having-enemies", "uncle-nicolini-author-page", "sciptember-2022-art", "ode-to-the-unknown-author", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bleak", "doctor-everwood", "doctor-reynders", "lgbtq", "researcher-james", "tale"], "title": "I Told You That I Was Afraid - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-told-you-that-i-was-afraid", "year": 2025}, "killing-dracula": {"created_at": "2025-01-21T17:54:00", "creator": "AnActualCrow", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "AnActualCrow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anactualcrow", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-21T17:54:00"}, {"author": "AnActualCrow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anactualcrow", "comment": "Uploaded file \"morningcabin.png\".", "date": "2025-01-21T17:55:00"}, {"author": "AnActualCrow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anactualcrow", "comment": "Uploaded file \"dawn.png\".", "date": "2025-01-21T17:55:00"}, {"author": "AnActualCrow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anactualcrow", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-21T18:16:00"}, {"author": "Diogene_s", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/diogene-s", "comment": "Added tags: _image, _licensebox, action, art-exchange, global-occult-coalition, military-fiction, tale.

I was running security for a meeting in Beijing's shared Foundation/GOC building. Some negotiation regarding anomalous metals. It was an inch taller than me and wore a suit too thin and fitting to hide any sort of armor. It only gave me half a glance as it stepped through the door. Even in the sweltering heat, it wore maroon gloves. Smiling softly, letting the tension in that room slide off it, the beast looked less and less human and more like an image, like a human in a perfume ad or a sculpture made of marble. It had the appearance of flesh without it's psychology \u2014 a sense of unshakability that any creature that falls ill and loses sleep and must not be abandoned cannot possess. In its eyes, every person in that room was merely decoration, a rock one kicks down the street as they walk. That beast was born to be an Overseer, if it was ever born at all.</p>\n<p>It's commonly believed that the vampyre takes the form of a human or a bat. This, while plausible, is ultimately misleading. The vampyre takes the form of whatever creature it drinks, such that it may better blend in with the population of its prey. We think about vampyres that feast on people because they are the most threatening to us. Our target \u2014 the Overseer \u2014 was once such a creature. Youthful, powerful, it leveraged its position to feed on an immaculate selection of humans.</p>\n<p>It must be longing for that now, damned thing. We've been stalking it for months, cutting off every lifeline, upending every hideout. God willing, this is the last one.</p>\n<p>I'm eating fish with the other Nightwalkers. Grilled salmon. Verne cooks them near to perfection and Austen keeps making bad jokes that I'm starting to think came out of a book. \"What's a vampyre's least favorite fish? <em>Gar</em>-lic! Why did the vampyre get hit by a car? It didn't use the <em>cross</em>-walk!\" I can't tell if they're starting to grow on me or driving me mad. Shelley thinks they're a nice change of pace. She's too nice like that. If they were a change of pace, they'd be about anything else. But if I told her that, she'd say I'm too bitter.</p>\n<p>I move the food around my plate with a knife, partitioning it so that every forkful is exactly the same. We'd expected the Foundation to stand their ground. Instead, the vampyre has faced us alone, retreating further and further into this quiet corner of the Earth. Now, our intelligence says the beast is in a small, one-story house out here in Sicily. We don't know anything else. Any drone that could deep-scan the place for subterranean floors would be flying too low to go unnoticed. We're assuming there is a subterranean section: unknown size, unknown depth, unknown layout. No external security, which could mean just about anything.</p>\n<p>Surely, we're being led into a trap. And yet \u2014 I find myself staring at a frame of footage from Verne's visor. It was taken three or four weeks ago, back in Kazakhstan. A lot of the frame is covered by the muzzle flash on Verne's gun, but you can see the beast on the left side, the flash reflected in its eyes.</p>\n<p>It's scared. It has a goat's skull and a pig's snout, but that expression can't be anything but fear.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dawn. A quick breakfast of fried eggs on toast and everyone is getting ready. Night vision, thermals, flashbangs, first-aid, door ram, plates and plates and redundant plates of armor. It never shoots back, but we wear them as if it will. I don't know how effective armor is against the things the beast <em>does</em> use against us. All I know is that we're alive and Dickens, Kafka, Joyce, Melville, and Borges aren't. We can't rely on killing it with gunfire, so we pack submachine guns. Light, fast, loaded with incendiary rounds. Austen has the vampyre killer. It's slung over her back, a single nylon strap escaping the grey tarp covering the device.</p>\n<p>I pray before we leave, mostly to the five we've lost. I've been becoming more agnostic lately.</p>\n<p>We approach the house without incident. The curtains are drawn and the door is locked. It shudders with each strike of the ram, breaking open on the third. Flashbang. Silence. We file in. There are a couple cushioned chairs. A modest kitchen, a round table with a chunk of quartz. There's dust in the air, but things have clearly been swept. It's hard to imagine the beast tidying up, reading a book, hanging that forest painting on the wall.</p>\n<p>\"Look out for booby traps\" Austen says. She opens the door and there's a staircase going down. <em>The subterranean</em>. We prop the door open with a chair in case it tries to shut us in.</p>\n<p>The walls underground look just like the ones in the kitchen, closed blinds replaced with weak, bare light bulbs. We descend single-file, walking sideways down stairs that are too tall, too narrow, too thin. I'm first. As we approach the bottom step, I can see something on the floor wading in its own soft shadows. A metal ball, evenly holed and studded.</p>\n<p>\"Is that a 184-clone?\" Shelley asks. We all stop. <a href=\"/scp-184\">SCP-184</a> had always been too dangerous to be useful. The Foundation admitted so themselves. \"They should have been destroyed after the Kyoto Conference. I ran intelligence to <em>make sure</em> they were destroyed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, clearly\u2026\" Verne and I say. But she's right. They should have been destroyed. The Foundation had shared their attempts to neuter the anomaly's effects, like turning a virus into a vaccine. Every duplicate still made labyrinths that grew as one tried to escape them or impassable indoor expanses or furniture that exploded and caught fire and broke down into toxic gas as it oxidized. It would have revolutionized facility construction if only they could get it under control.</p>\n<p>\"So they did get it right.\" Verne says.</p>\n<p>\"No. Every inside source we have says they didn't. They also say the last clone was destroyed two years ago.\" Shelley says. We thought we were so clever propping open that door. When we leave, if we leave, how many more rooms will be between that door and the outside world?</p>\n<p>\"So then we're all trapped? Us and Overseer Two.\" Austen says what we've been thinking. For a moment, the only sound is a light bulb humming below us.</p>\n<p>\"We don't know yet if our intelligence is correct.\" I say, \"What we do know is that the vampyre is down here and it's probably not skulking around somewhere we can't survive. We stay cautious \u2014 we stay focused \u2014 and we will make it out.\" I try to sound confident, the way one does when they know someone is watching over them. I've been becoming more agnostic lately. I keep going down the steps. The team follows.</p>\n<p>I'm at the bottom step. The sole of my boot touches the floor just before my whole body is swept off it. One claw covers my visor. The other forces me around the corner, away from the team. Away from the light. I can't get a shot in while I'm being knocked to the ground. Gunfire covers the radio chatter in my ears. My night vision is calibrating. Still calibrating. The beast comes into picture as it bites down on my shoulder. I scream. The silhouettes of my team turn the corner, Austen reaching for the vampire killer on her back. Shelley and Verne fire, but the beast's fangs only leave my shoulder when Austen's hand reaches into the device. Shelley and Verne fire. For a sweet moment, we might be able to kill it here. But the beast turns, bolting away in a spray of burning bullets.</p>\n<p>Dust and smoke mingle in the air. Austen is the last one to lose the tension in her shoulders, the vampire killer eager in her arms. I can't see the skin beneath her gloves, but I know her trigger hand is pruned like she spent too long in a hot tub</p>\n<p>The team fans around me. First-aid. \"Was that the Overseer?\" Those fangs went deep. Leave the gun. All I can do is throw flashbangs left-handed. What the hell blood was he drinking? Austen has the vampyre killer under her arm, ready to fire on anything that so much as taps her shoulder. How could I have been distracted?</p>\n<p>A rat scurries in the next room and three guns point at it. We start moving, clearing room after room after room. Wine cellar to bathroom to garage to attic, every room has the appearance of a real, lived-in space without any sort of cohesion. Windows open to the backs of bookshelves. The cups on a kitchen shelf are all full of water. There's a bedroom with a toaster on the nightstand. My shoulder burns, and I wonder if the beast drank away part of me.</p>\n<p>The deeper we go, the less air is circulating, the more we can smell the rot. We keep findings packets of ground meat, torn open and devoured raw. Verne, the group pescetarian, looks away when we find a refrigerated room full of dead pigs, bleeding into buckets on the floor.</p>\n<p>A burst of gunfire. The beast slams Verne into a painting. Glass shards bounce off his helmet and he dives to the floor. We shoot, splitting shards on the beast's cloak into smaller pieces. It bears its teeth at Verne, feels the fire digging into its hide. It drops to all fours. Its bolts away, its cloak and loose, snarling mass both tattered.</p>\n<p>We continue down another path, a hallway with windows that expose nothing but insulation and wiring. We file into a dining room lit only by blacklight. The beast hits Verne again. Glass cups spray across the floor as it pounces. Fangs bared, wounds exposed. I throw my flashbang at it. The grenade explodes between the beast's jaw and its shoulder. Austen doesn't hesitate readying the vampyre killer. Its already yelping, scrambling over Verne's body. Even after it's run off, I can smell burning underneath the rot.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Verne gets up.</p>\n<p>\"We should turn around.\" When we're all okay, maybe we'll come back with a bomb and collapse that damn staircase. Until then, we're playing on the beast's terms.</p>\n<p>Verne has a limp, but at least he isn't bleeding. We walk back slowly for him, retracing our steps through uncanny rooms. Our visors are supposed to help us navigate back, but their geolocation doesn't work within the impossible geometry. The space is changing. The bedroom with the toaster has been expanded from a twin to a California king. A bathroom with a single toilet and small shower now also has a bathtub. We can hear running and panting, but we never see its source.</p>\n<p>I think back to that bottom step and the room with the cloned anomaly. How many new rooms will be between it and the outside world? What if the staircase is just a path to a new maze?</p>\n<p>We're going the right way until we enter a room we've never seen before. It's some kind of basement, long and wide with a short ceiling. There's old paint on the walls and the two mismatched couches joined together in a corner. There's a pool table with no balls or pockets and a dartboard with dozens of darts stuck into it. There's an old TV and half a dozen exits.</p>\n<p>\"Which way're we thinking?\" Shelley asks. My shoulder is throbbing, rubbing against the grime in my torn clothing. I take a deep breath, but it's still throbbing faster, faster, faster. The pulses aren't matching my heart rate. The pulses aren't matching my heart.</p>\n<p>The beast barrels into Shelley, refusing to stop when she shoots it. It's face is burnt and cut, it's cloak falling off in chunks as it claws the gun out of her hand. It feels like watching Borges die again. Like watching those claws dig into his chest.</p>\n<p>I want to save Shelley \u2014 jump on top of the beast and yank its crusty horsehair with my one good arm, but that would mean diving into the line of fire. Instead I stand and watch it try and get a claw under her helmet. It's trying to pull off her neck cover.</p>\n<p>I don't have another flashbang. No one had any left to give to me. I stand and watch.</p>\n<p>Austen drops her gun mid-spray. A runaway bullet hits the ceiling as the weapon falls to the floor. She swings the vampyre killer around her body. She's got it under her armpit. The beast knows, turning towards her with all manner of fangs bared. She reaches under the tarp and it leaps. Leaps like a creature scared it'll die for all the things it's done. Leaps like we can kill it.</p>\n<p>But we aren't killing it. Austen's eyes meet mine as her head hits the ground. Her hand falls out of the vampyre killer. I run over, dive over, try and shove a hand onto the device. Austen is trying to protect her face. Kafka's face had been filleted when we found him, every drop of blood licked clean. Next time we found it, the vampyre had his smile.</p>\n<p>I'm down on the ground, scrambling around for the device. There's too much weight on my bleeding shoulder, but my other arm goes under the tarp. Going and going until my elbow has almost disappeared. The beast swipes at Austen a final time. It's mouth opens. Melville's arm had shattered in its jaws.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can hear is my own breathing. I grab a handle deep in the machine and turn it, but I can't find the leverage to yank the cord. Shelley runs to me, ribs clutched, gasping. Grasping that single nylon strap. She yanks the whole device. I hold on for our lives.</p>\n<p>It activates.</p>\n<p>I can't hear my breathing. Everything is blue. Then sky blue. Then Carolina blue. Blues so precise you lose track of what they're coloring. And then\u2014</p>\n<p>I inhale. There's no dust in the air. There's no dust on the floor or the walls or our clothes. I touch my forehead and there's no sweat. The scabs on Verne's chin are perfectly open, too-fresh skin breathing in the immaculate air. Shelley's eyebrows are gone.</p>\n<p>\"Poe?\" Shelley nudges me with her boot, makes sure I can still move. I look at her. I look at everyone. We are bruised and bleeding and beaten. But beyond us, there is only the hum of a light bulb and the loose smell of saltpeter.</p>\n<p>Dracula is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/killing-dracula\">Killing Dracula</a>\" by AnActualCrow, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I was running security for a meeting in Beijing's shared Foundation/GOC building. Some negotiation regarding anomalous metals. It was an inch taller than me and wore a suit too thin and fitting to hide any sort of armor. It only gave me half a glance as it stepped through the door. Even in the sweltering heat, it wore maroon gloves. Smiling softly, letting the tension in that room slide off it, the beast looked less and less human and more like an image, like a human in a perfume ad or a sculpture made of marble. It had the appearance of flesh without it's psychology -- a sense of unshakability that any creature that falls ill and loses sleep and must not be abandoned cannot possess. In its eyes, every person in that room was merely decoration, a rock one kicks down the street as they walk. That beast was born to be an Overseer, if it was ever born at all.\n\n\n\nIt's commonly believed that the vampyre takes the form of a human or a bat. This, while plausible, is ultimately misleading. The vampyre takes the form of whatever creature it drinks, such that it may better blend in with the population of its prey. We think about vampyres that feast on people because they are the most threatening to us. Our target -- the Overseer -- was once such a creature. Youthful, powerful, it leveraged its position to feed on an immaculate selection of humans. \n\n\n\nIt must be longing for that now, damned thing. We've been stalking it for months, cutting off every lifeline, upending every hideout. God willing, this is the last one. \n\n\n\nI'm eating fish with the other Nightwalkers. Grilled salmon. Verne cooks them near to perfection and Austen keeps making bad jokes that I'm starting to think came out of a book. \"What's a vampyre's least favorite fish? //Gar//-lic! Why did the vampyre get hit by a car? It didn't use the //cross//-walk!\" I can't tell if they're starting to grow on me or driving me mad. Shelley thinks they're a nice change of pace. She's too nice like that. If they were a change of pace, they'd be about anything else. But if I told her that, she'd say I'm too bitter. \t\n\n\n\nI move the food around my plate with a knife, partitioning it so that every forkful is exactly the same. We'd expected the Foundation to stand their ground. Instead, the vampyre has faced us alone, retreating further and further into this quiet corner of the Earth. Now, our intelligence says the beast is in a small, one-story house out here in Sicily. We don't know anything else. Any drone that could deep-scan the place for subterranean floors would be flying too low to go unnoticed. We're assuming there is a subterranean section: unknown size, unknown depth, unknown layout. No external security, which could mean just about anything. \n\n\n\nSurely, we're being led into a trap. And yet -- I find myself staring at a frame of footage from Verne's visor. It was taken three or four weeks ago, back in Kazakhstan. A lot of the frame is covered by the muzzle flash on Verne's gun, but you can see the beast on the left side, the flash reflected in its eyes. \n\n\n\nIt's scared. It has a goat's skull and a pig's snout, but that expression can't be anything but fear. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nDawn. A quick breakfast of fried eggs on toast and everyone is getting ready. Night vision, thermals, flashbangs, first-aid, door ram, plates and plates and redundant plates of armor. It never shoots back, but we wear them as if it will. I don't know how effective armor is against the things the beast //does// use against us. All I know is that we're alive and Dickens, Kafka, Joyce, Melville, and Borges aren't. We can't rely on killing it with gunfire, so we pack submachine guns. Light, fast, loaded with incendiary rounds. Austen has the vampyre killer. It's slung over her back, a single nylon strap escaping the grey tarp covering the device. \n\n\n\nI pray before we leave, mostly to the five we've lost. I've been becoming more agnostic lately.\n\n\n\nWe approach the house without incident. The curtains are drawn and the door is locked. It shudders with each strike of the ram, breaking open on the third. Flashbang. Silence. We file in. There are a couple cushioned chairs. A modest kitchen, a round table with a chunk of quartz. There's dust in the air, but things have clearly been swept. It's hard to imagine the beast tidying up, reading a book, hanging that forest painting on the wall. \n\n\n\n\"Look out for booby traps\" Austen says. She opens the door and there's a staircase going down. //The subterranean//. We prop the door open with a chair in case it tries to shut us in. \n\n\n\nThe walls underground look just like the ones in the kitchen, closed blinds replaced with weak, bare light bulbs. We descend single-file, walking sideways down stairs that are too tall, too narrow, too thin. I'm first. As we approach the bottom step, I can see something on the floor wading in its own soft shadows. A metal ball, evenly holed and studded. \n\n\n\n\"Is that a 184-clone?\" Shelley asks. We all stop. [[[SCP-184]]] had always been too dangerous to be useful. The Foundation admitted so themselves. \"They should have been destroyed after the Kyoto Conference. I ran intelligence to //make sure// they were destroyed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, clearly...\" Verne and I say. But she's right. They should have been destroyed. The Foundation had shared their attempts to neuter the anomaly's effects, like turning a virus into a vaccine. Every duplicate still made labyrinths that grew as one tried to escape them or impassable indoor expanses or furniture that exploded and caught fire and broke down into toxic gas as it oxidized. It would have revolutionized facility construction if only they could get it under control. \n\n\n\n\"So they did get it right.\" Verne says.\n\n\n\n\"No. Every inside source we have says they didn't. They also say the last clone was destroyed two years ago.\" Shelley says. We thought we were so clever propping open that door. When we leave, if we leave, how many more rooms will be between that door and the outside world? \n\n\n\n\"So then we're all trapped? Us and Overseer Two.\" Austen says what we've been thinking. For a moment, the only sound is a light bulb humming below us. \n\n\n\n\"We don't know yet if our intelligence is correct.\" I say, \"What we do know is that the vampyre is down here and it's probably not skulking around somewhere we can't survive. We stay cautious -- we stay focused -- and we will make it out.\" I try to sound confident, the way one does when they know someone is watching over them. I've been becoming more agnostic lately. I keep going down the steps. The team follows.\n\n\n\nI'm at the bottom step. The sole of my boot touches the floor just before my whole body is swept off it. One claw covers my visor. The other forces me around the corner, away from the team. Away from the light. I can't get a shot in while I'm being knocked to the ground. Gunfire covers the radio chatter in my ears. My night vision is calibrating. Still calibrating. The beast comes into picture as it bites down on my shoulder. I scream. The silhouettes of my team turn the corner, Austen reaching for the vampire killer on her back. Shelley and Verne fire, but the beast's fangs only leave my shoulder when Austen's hand reaches into the device. Shelley and Verne fire. For a sweet moment, we might be able to kill it here. But the beast turns, bolting away in a spray of burning bullets. \n\n\n\nDust and smoke mingle in the air. Austen is the last one to lose the tension in her shoulders, the vampire killer eager in her arms. I can't see the skin beneath her gloves, but I know her trigger hand is pruned like she spent too long in a hot tub\n\n\n\nThe team fans around me. First-aid. \"Was that the Overseer?\" Those fangs went deep. Leave the gun. All I can do is throw flashbangs left-handed. What the hell blood was he drinking? Austen has the vampyre killer under her arm, ready to fire on anything that so much as taps her shoulder. How could I have been distracted?\n\n\n\nA rat scurries in the next room and three guns point at it. We start moving, clearing room after room after room. Wine cellar to bathroom to garage to attic, every room has the appearance of a real, lived-in space without any sort of cohesion. Windows open to the backs of bookshelves. The cups on a kitchen shelf are all full of water. There's a bedroom with a toaster on the nightstand. My shoulder burns, and I wonder if the beast drank away part of me. \n\n\n\nThe deeper we go, the less air is circulating, the more we can smell the rot. We keep findings packets of ground meat, torn open and devoured raw. Verne, the group pescetarian, looks away when we find a refrigerated room full of dead pigs, bleeding into buckets on the floor. \n\n\n\nA burst of gunfire. The beast slams Verne into a painting. Glass shards bounce off his helmet and he dives to the floor. We shoot, splitting shards on the beast's cloak into smaller pieces. It bears its teeth at Verne, feels the fire digging into its hide. It drops to all fours. Its bolts away, its cloak and loose, snarling mass both tattered. \n\n\n\nWe continue down another path, a hallway with windows that expose nothing but insulation and wiring.

The grenade explodes between the beast's jaw and its shoulder. Austen doesn't hesitate readying the vampyre killer. Its already yelping, scrambling over Verne's body.

My shoulder is throbbing, rubbing against the grime in my torn clothing. I take a deep breath, but it's still throbbing faster, faster, faster. The pulses aren't matching my heart rate. The pulses aren't matching my heart.\n\n\n\nThe beast barrels into Shelley, refusing to stop when she shoots it. It's face is burnt and cut, it's cloak falling off in chunks as it claws the gun out of her hand. It feels like watching Borges die again. Like watching those claws dig into his chest. \n\n\n\nI want to save Shelley -- jump on top of the beast and yank its crusty horsehair with my one good arm, but that would mean diving into the line of fire. Instead I stand and watch it try and get a claw under her helmet. It's trying to pull off her neck cover. \n\n\n\nI don't have another flashbang. No one had any left to give to me.

As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> attachment-end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n|attachment= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/SCP-1213-1.jpeg\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n\n\n]]\n\nSounds good.

Between work, work and\u2026 <em>work</em>, he didn\u2019t have much time left in the week. How much of that was true and how much of it was a bad excuse in order to nor confront reality, he didn\u2019t even know, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because ever since he came back from Afghanistan, every year on the exact same day, Ibarra took the time to visit his friends.</p>\n<img alt=\"lazos1.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/lazos/lazos1.jpg\"/>\n<p>The agent stared at the piece of stone in front of him with an expression that was difficult to read. This was the last one he was going to visit this morning. The one he saved for last every year. He kneeled in front of it, noticing a bouquet of flowers he hadn\u2019t left. He faintly smiled at that.</p>\n<p>\"I see they are still visiting you, huh?\" He talked to the tomb. He paused, the subtle whistle of the light morning breeze being the only sound in the place. It was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\"Your little sister must be all grown\u2026 How old is she turning this year? Seventeen? Eighteen? Mich told me she was thinking of studying photography.\" His voice began to fade alongside his smile.</p>\n<p>\"You\u2019d be\u2026 proud of her.\" The expression of the agent turned hollow and distant. He observed the tombstone in silence, clenching his teeth and frowning.</p>\n<p>Every year was the same. He avoided the topic, he tried to face it on November 11th, he talked to some pieces of stone, and he left more hollow than he arrived. It infuriated him. With a growl and a scowl, the man balled his fist with force and hit the grass, looking away from the tombstone. He was mad. At the circumstances, at the world, at God, even. But, above all, at himself. Because of him, the mothers of his friends were left without sons. Because of him, his friend wouldn\u2019t see his sister grow. Because of him, there were less good men in the world. Simple, <em>he didn\u2019t do enough.</em></p>\n<p>Fragments of the incident were repeated in his mind over and over again like a movie, always thinking how he could have done things differently. He changed what happened in his memory, took a different step, took a different path. But even in every scenario he made up, he couldn\u2019t escape the blood, nor the screams.</p>\n<p>His head started to feel heavy and unstable, leaving him dizzy.</p>\n<p>Ibarra closed his eyes, trying to focus. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t do things differently, and that was it. Now he had to deal with the consequences, even if he didn\u2019t know how to.</p>\n<p>His hands and lips trembled, his breathing started to accelerate.</p>\n<p>When he returned from Afghanistan and got offered a job at the Foundation he didn\u2019t think twice, he needed some kind of redemption for his acts, and the job description fit the bill. But above all, he needed to <em>get away.</em> His position as an agent and emergency doctor forced him to move constantly. He would never have permanent housing, and he never had a fixed team. His work was getting showing up, helping, and then disengaging completely, then repeat the next week. And that worked for him. No time to form bonds meant he didn\u2019t have to add names to the list of visitors. He would never again be responsible for\u2026</p>\n<p>Ibarra started to feel every beat of his heart thump in his ears. He felt his throat closing, at the same time that his erratic and irregular heartbeats caused him a strong and sudden sensation of nausea.</p>\n<p>The agent raised his head slightly, reading the epitaph on the tombstone.</p>\n<p><em>The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.</em></p>\n<p>The knot in his throat and chest tightened, and he felt like the world was about to crush him with invisible walls.</p>\n<p>\u201cFigured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The agent standing in front of the tomb turned his face around suddenly, the unexpected voice snapped him out of his thoughts and his mental turmoil. Swallowing his emotions, he placed his narrow sunglasses to hide the storm that was about to unfold. The owner of the voice was a tattooed man with long hair tied in a messy ponytail, a bit taller than Ibarra and with an Argentinian accent.</p>\n<p>Ibarra offered a light smile as a greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Steffano.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano approached ibarra with a calm gesture, stopping at his side and in front of the tombstone. An elegant, grey formal vest overlayed with a black shirt matched a black pair of trousers, accompanied vy a pair of shoes that oscillated between a sporty and formal look. The agent's sleeves were rolled up, leaving a contrast between the formal and the aggressiveness that his tattoos implicitly radiated.</p>\n<p>In between his hands he brought a pair of folders, light in color, coated in plastic.</p>\n<p>\"Am I interrupting?\" Steffano asked with caution \"Finding you outside working hours was more difficult than I expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dark-skinned man sighed, observing with certain regret the tombstone in front of him, trying to clear the thoughts that made noise inside of his head. Eventually, he shook his head and stood up</p>\n<p>\"Nah, I was just finishing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano stood still in silence for a second alongside Ibarra. He never knew the soldier in the tombstone, but he knew they were someone important to his friend, so the least he could do was show some empathy and respect. He looked Ibarra out of the corner of his eye, noticing the clear tension in his hands and shoulders, speaking:</p>\n<p>\"You can\u2019t keep blaming yourself for this kind of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra smiled slightly, his gaze fixed on the tombstone.</p>\n<p>\"I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you keep doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra took a moment to reply.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Because I could\u2019ve done more. Because I should\u2019ve done more. Because I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I had to help them. Because they had a family. Because they didn\u2019t deserve to die. Because they should\u2019ve been saved. Because I should\u2019ve died with them.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano pursed his lips lightly and nodded in an understanding gesture to his friend, giving him a firm pat on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I get you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra directed his gaze towards his teammate, feeling for just a brief second how the walls that tightened against him eased a bit. He knew that he understood, and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t ask more at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pero bueno,</em> are you visiting anyone, Steffano?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano let out a slight chuckle, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, mine aren\u2019t here. I was looking for you, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra arched a brow, intrigued. He pointed to the folders that Steffano carried with a nod.</p>\n<p>\"Does it have anything to do with the folders you have there? Don\u2019t tell me you came here to give me paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano smirked, extending the folder towards Ibarra so he would take it.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra adjusted his glasses and took the folders, opening them. They contained a multitude of documents: budget estimates, agent's profiles, authorization letters, among other files. The documentation looked a lot like what's needed to authorize a new unit. The dark-skinned man looked at his friend over his glasses, waiting for him to tell him more while he reviewed in detail the information.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2019m building a team. I want my <em>own</em> squadron to play by my <em>own</em> rules, I feel that part of being stuck on the other side of the veil means cutting off your legs, if that makes any sense. I\u2019ve decided that if I\u2019m going to work for these people and their purposes, might as well do it in the way I deem correct. We are going to trip over and over again as we manage to reach something similar to stability, but until then I want my people near me. People I believe are worth having around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra looked at his friend with certain doubt.</p>\n<p>\"You don\u2019t sound too sure of all of this. You usually are more painstaking, Steffano. This is the first time since we\u2019ve met that you try to make something in a hasty manner, I don\u2019t really know how to react.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Maybe, the only thing I can admit is that you\u2019re right, it\u2019s something new. Neither you, nor me are used to work other way that isn\u2019t a fucking chain of command formed by a pretentious general that has been in power behind a desk for 40 years, without getting a single damned scratch. And you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra laughed with certain bitterness towards Steffano\u2019s comment, nodding. \"I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d His expression changed when his gaze stopped for a second in the profile of an agent that caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\"This boy\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\"Is this the one you\u2019ve been training personally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano smirked when he saw who Ibarra was pointing at.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. V\u00edctor Penz,\u201d Steffano sighed. \"The kid is quite the case, but he has potential. <em>A lot</em> of potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"It\u2019s\u2026 Just a kid.\u201d There was a certain worry in the agent\u2019s tone. \u201cThere must be something in him for you to even consider having him around. He looks like a rookie, a problematic brat without any valid records.\u201d Ibarra searched between V\u00edctor\u2019s file over and over again, as if he was trying to gather some secret information in between the papers.</p>\n<p>\"He has it. Trust me. In fact, I was thinking of assigning him to an operation soon. I\u2019m not sure what kind of operation, but I\u2019d like for him to grow used to the kind of shit one can see in this weird world. The creatures and all that shit. And when that happens, you\u2019ll be there to see it, sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"My God, Steffano,\u201d The agent was conflicted by the idea. \u201cI don't know if it's a very good idea or if age and field work are driving you crazy, and it seems that you want to drive the kid crazy on the way too by throwing him head-first into these things. You not working for national intelligence agencies anymore doesn\u2019t mean you can throw away all cover and risk your personal reputation for a crazy midnight idea. I mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The tattooed man interrupted him.</p>\n<p>\"Do you trust me?\u201d Steffano looked directly into Ibarra\u2019s eyes, trying to look further from his gaze.</p>\n<p>Ibarra blinked a few times, bewildered because of the question.</p>\n<p>\"What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Do you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\u201d Ibarra meditated for a few seconds. \u201cYeah, of course I trust you, dude. You\u2019re only old and crazy, but I\u2019ll be there when you get shot by a few dudes with no arms nor face.\u201d Ibarra began laughing resignedly.</p>\n<p>\"Fantastic. That\u2019s all I needed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano gave Ibarra a moment for him to finish looking at the documentation and processing the information.</p>\n<p>\"Your support in this would mean a lot, old man. I need people who are committed, capable, and whom I can trust. You are all three of those.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ibarra sighed deeply. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea. A unit like this could be of great help for the Foundation. Most importantly, it could be of great help for <em>people</em>. A large number of losses, both civilian and from personnel in operations were due to a lack of rapid response in emergency situations. A large number of losses were due to <em>a lack of support.</em></p>\n<p>But joining a unit like that would signify stability. He would no longer be sent only to isolated jobs where his role was to appear and then bid farewell.

Between work, work and\u2026 //work//, he didn\u2019t have much time left in the week. How much of that was true and how much of it was a bad excuse in order to nor confront reality, he didn\u2019t even know, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because ever since he came back from Afghanistan, every year on the exact same day, Ibarra took the time to visit his friends.\n\n\n\n[[image lazos1.jpg]]\n\n\n\nThe agent stared at the piece of stone in front of him with an expression that was difficult to read. This was the last one he was going to visit this morning. The one he saved for last every year. He kneeled in front of it, noticing a bouquet of flowers he hadn\u2019t left. He faintly smiled at that.\n\n\n\n\"I see they are still visiting you, huh?\" He talked to the tomb. He paused, the subtle whistle of the light morning breeze being the only sound in the place. It was overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\"Your little sister must be all grown\u2026 How old is she turning this year? Seventeen? Eighteen? Mich told me she was thinking of studying photography.\" His voice began to fade alongside his smile.\n\n\n\n\"You\u2019d be\u2026 proud of her.\" The expression of the agent turned hollow and distant. He observed the tombstone in silence, clenching his teeth and frowning.\n\n\n\nEvery year was the same. He avoided the topic, he tried to face it on November 11th, he talked to some pieces of stone, and he left more hollow than he arrived. It infuriated him. With a growl and a scowl, the man balled his fist with force and hit the grass, looking away from the tombstone. He was mad. At the circumstances, at the world, at God, even. But, above all, at himself. Because of him, the mothers of his friends were left without sons. Because of him, his friend wouldn\u2019t see his sister grow. Because of him, there were less good men in the world. Simple, //he didn\u2019t do enough.//\n\n\n\nFragments of the incident were repeated in his mind over and over again like a movie, always thinking how he could have done things differently. He changed what happened in his memory, took a different step, took a different path. But even in every scenario he made up, he couldn\u2019t escape the blood, nor the screams.\n\n\n\nHis head started to feel heavy and unstable, leaving him dizzy.\n\n\n\nIbarra closed his eyes, trying to focus. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t do things differently, and that was it. Now he had to deal with the consequences, even if he didn\u2019t know how to.\n\n\n\nHis hands and lips trembled, his breathing started to accelerate.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned from Afghanistan and got offered a job at the Foundation he didn\u2019t think twice, he needed some kind of redemption for his acts, and the job description fit the bill. But above all, he needed to //get away.// His position as an agent and emergency doctor forced him to move constantly. He would never have permanent housing, and he never had a fixed team. His work was getting showing up, helping, and then disengaging completely, then repeat the next week. And that worked for him. No time to form bonds meant he didn\u2019t have to add names to the list of visitors. He would never again be responsible for\u2026\n\n\n\nIbarra started to feel every beat of his heart thump in his ears. He felt his throat closing, at the same time that his erratic and irregular heartbeats caused him a strong and sudden sensation of nausea.\n\n\n\nThe agent raised his head slightly, reading the epitaph on the tombstone.\n\n\n\n//The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.//\n\n\n\nThe knot in his throat and chest tightened, and he felt like the world was about to crush him with invisible walls.\n\n\n\n\u201cFigured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[=image lazos2.jpg]]\n\n\n\nThe agent standing in front of the tomb turned his face around suddenly, the unexpected voice snapped him out of his thoughts and his mental turmoil. Swallowing his emotions, he placed his narrow sunglasses to hide the storm that was about to unfold. The owner of the voice was a tattooed man with long hair tied in a messy ponytail, a bit taller than Ibarra and with an Argentinian accent.\n\n\n\nIbarra offered a light smile as a greeting.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Steffano.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano approached ibarra with a calm gesture, stopping at his side and in front of the tombstone. An elegant, grey formal vest overlayed with a black shirt matched a black pair of trousers, accompanied vy a pair of shoes that oscillated between a sporty and formal look. The agent's sleeves were rolled up, leaving a contrast between the formal and the aggressiveness that his tattoos implicitly radiated.\n\n\n\nIn between his hands he brought a pair of folders, light in color, coated in plastic.\n\n\n\n\"Am I interrupting?\" Steffano asked with caution \"Finding you outside working hours was more difficult than I expected.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe dark-skinned man sighed, observing with certain regret the tombstone in front of him, trying to clear the thoughts that made noise inside of his head. Eventually, he shook his head and stood up\n\n\n\n\"Nah, I was just finishing.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano stood still in silence for a second alongside Ibarra. He never knew the soldier in the tombstone, but he knew they were someone important to his friend, so the least he could do was show some empathy and respect. He looked Ibarra out of the corner of his eye, noticing the clear tension in his hands and shoulders, speaking:\n\n\n\n\"You can\u2019t keep blaming yourself for this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra smiled slightly, his gaze fixed on the tombstone.\n\n\n\n\"I know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you keep doing so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"I know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra took a moment to reply.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n//Because I could\u2019ve done more. Because I should\u2019ve done more. Because I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I had to help them. Because they had a family. Because they didn\u2019t deserve to die. Because they should\u2019ve been saved. Because I should\u2019ve died with them.//\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano pursed his lips lightly and nodded in an understanding gesture to his friend, giving him a firm pat on the shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I get you.\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra directed his gaze towards his teammate, feeling for just a brief second how the walls that tightened against him eased a bit. He knew that he understood, and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t ask more at the moment.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Pero bueno,// are you visiting anyone, Steffano?\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano let out a slight chuckle, shaking his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, mine aren\u2019t here. I was looking for you, actually.\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra arched a brow, intrigued. He pointed to the folders that Steffano carried with a nod.\n\n\n\n\"Does it have anything to do with the folders you have there? Don\u2019t tell me you came here to give me paperwork.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano smirked, extending the folder towards Ibarra so he would take it.\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps.\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra adjusted his glasses and took the folders, opening them. They contained a multitude of documents: budget estimates, agent's profiles, authorization letters, among other files. The documentation looked a lot like what's needed to authorize a new unit. The dark-skinned man looked at his friend over his glasses, waiting for him to tell him more while he reviewed in detail the information.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m building a team. I want my //own// squadron to play by my //own// rules, I feel that part of being stuck on the other side of the veil means cutting off your legs, if that makes any sense. I\u2019ve decided that if I\u2019m going to work for these people and their purposes, might as well do it in the way I deem correct. We are going to trip over and over again as we manage to reach something similar to stability, but until then I want my people near me. People I believe are worth having around.\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra looked at his friend with certain doubt.\n\n\n\n\"You don\u2019t sound too sure of all of this. You usually are more painstaking, Steffano. This is the first time since we\u2019ve met that you try to make something in a hasty manner, I don\u2019t really know how to react.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Maybe, the only thing I can admit is that you\u2019re right, it\u2019s something new. Neither you, nor me are used to work other way that isn\u2019t a fucking chain of command formed by a pretentious general that has been in power behind a desk for 40 years, without getting a single damned scratch. And you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\nIbarra laughed with certain bitterness towards Steffano\u2019s comment, nodding. \"I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d His expression changed when his gaze stopped for a second in the profile of an agent that caught his attention.\n\n\n\n\"This boy\u2026\u201d\n\n[[=image lazos3.jpg]]\n\n\n\n\"Is this the one you\u2019ve been training personally?\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano smirked when he saw who Ibarra was pointing at.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. V\u00edctor Penz,\u201d Steffano sighed. \"The kid is quite the case, but he has potential. //A lot// of potential.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s\u2026 Just a kid.\u201d There was a certain worry in the agent\u2019s tone. \u201cThere must be something in him for you to even consider having him around. He looks like a rookie, a problematic brat without any valid records.\u201d Ibarra searched between V\u00edctor\u2019s file over and over again, as if he was trying to gather some secret information in between the papers.\n\n\n\n\"He has it. Trust me. In fact, I was thinking of assigning him to an operation soon. I\u2019m not sure what kind of operation, but I\u2019d like for him to grow used to the kind of shit one can see in this weird world. The creatures and all that shit. And when that happens, you\u2019ll be there to see it, sooner or later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"My God, Steffano,\u201d The agent was conflicted by the idea. \u201cI don't know if it's a very good idea or if age and field work are driving you crazy, and it seems that you want to drive the kid crazy on the way too by throwing him head-first into these things. You not working for national intelligence agencies anymore doesn\u2019t mean you can throw away all cover and risk your personal reputation for a crazy midnight idea. I mean--\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tattooed man interrupted him.\n\n\n\n\"Do you trust me?\u201d Steffano looked directly into Ibarra\u2019s eyes, trying to look further from his gaze.\n\n\n\nIbarra blinked a few times, bewildered because of the question.\n\n\n\n\"What?\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Do you trust me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\"I\u2026\u201d Ibarra meditated for a few seconds. \u201cYeah, of course I trust you, dude. You\u2019re only old and crazy, but I\u2019ll be there when you get shot by a few dudes with no arms nor face.\u201d Ibarra began laughing resignedly.\n\n\n\n\"Fantastic. That\u2019s all I needed.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteffano gave Ibarra a moment for him to finish looking at the documentation and processing the information.\n\n\n\n\"Your support in this would mean a lot, old man. I need people who are committed, capable, and whom I can trust. You are all three of those.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[=image lazos4.jpg]]\n\n\n\nIbarra sighed deeply. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea. A unit like this could be of great help for the Foundation. Most importantly, it could be of great help for //people//. A large number of losses, both civilian and from personnel in operations were due to a lack of rapid response in emergency situations. A large number of losses were due to //a lack of support.//\n\n\n\nBut joining a unit like that would signify stability. He would no longer be sent only to isolated jobs where his role was to appear and then bid farewell. He would go back to having some type of squadron, Ibarra would have to coexist with the same people constantly. He would have to //take care// of the same people constantly. Inevitably, he would form //bonds// with those people, because he was like that, he couldn\u2019t disconnect. And given the nature of the work, those people would be at risk of dying //constantly.//\n\n\n\nThe agent took his eyes off the documentation that was in his hands, redirecting his sight towards the tombstone that was forgotten in the conversation until this moment. He looked at it for a few seconds, ones that felt like minutes to him. He read the name. //Douglas Daniels.//\n\n\n\n//The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.//\n\n\n\nIbarra spoke in a serious tone, without taking his eyes off the phrase.\n\n\n\n\"Did you come just for work? It's not something you usually do, it's not your kind of deal.\"\n\n\n\n\"No. I came because I knew that if I found you here, you\u2019d need a friend to keep you company.\u201d Steffano crossed his arms slowly, not expecting a fixed answer.\n\n\n\nAfter a couple of seconds, Ibarra sighed, decided, and looked back at Steffano.\n\n\n\nWith a smile on his face, and his sunglasses now hiding his watery eyes, he offered his hand in a handshake.\n\n\n\n\"Count me in.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=true | last=false| hub=yes\n\n| previous-url=/ | previous-title=/\n\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/distracciones | next-title=Distractions\n\n| hub-url=http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hub-shrp | hub-title=Special Hazards Response Protocol\n\n]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=XenOGax]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** lazos1.jpg, lazos2.jpg, lazos3.jpg, lazos4.jpg\n\n> **Author:** [[*user XenOGax]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/distracciones SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["distracciones", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_es", "international", "tale"], "title": "Bonds - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lazos", "year": 2025}, "nobody-came-to-the-funeral": {"created_at": "2025-01-09T18:51:00", "creator": "Grigori Karpin", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Grigori Karpin", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/grigori-karpin", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-09T18:51:00"}, {"author": "Grigori Karpin", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/grigori-karpin", "comment": "Added tags: black-queen, fantasy, man-who-wasnt-there, no-return, nobody, spy-fiction, tale, wanderers-library.

style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p><strong>2 August, 2021</strong> - <em>I think?</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI\u2019m staring at a military base with a pair of binoculars. Watching a crew of GOC types load up a series of suits of armor onto a truck. I\u2019m here for a reason. This is the next step in our little war against the Foundation. But I find myself drifting back to a few days ago. Or what I assume was a few days ago.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nTime is hard to pay attention to in a world of endless books. You try living in an infinite library containing all books ever written or that would be written across the bleeding multiverse \u2013 whatever that is \u2013 and try keeping time.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThere ain\u2019t no sun or moon or stars. Just books. And people fucking live here, there are whole ass communities in between the stacks. I ate ramen last night at a free-standing cart like they do in Japan, and it was situated in between sections for the occult philosophies of Alagadda and the histories of some place called Leng. You\u2019d think an open flame would be something the librarians discouraged here, but apparently people live their whole lives in the stacks.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nMe, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of reading. Good way to get in trouble, I\u2019ve found. It was reading what brought me to this confluence of <a href=\"/nobody-likes-a-sneak\">insurgency against the Foundation</a> and <a href=\"/nobody-s-looking-for-trouble\">aiding the escape of a four-armed person</a> what <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">knows</span> the unknown from the depths of Foundie prison. O5-0 is the only name they\u2019ll give me. Which I don\u2019t need to explain to you, isn\u2019t a fucking name. Apparently, some big shit magic guru what helped start the Foundation then got kicked out. Basically a myth until we broke them out.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSaid four-armed myth slurped down two bowls of tonkatsu in front of me, so I\u2019d say they\u2019re very real. But then, no one remembers I exist after I leave their eyeline. Who am I? I\u2019m Lou. Ms. Nobody. But then, the only people who get to read this are me, myself, and I. So why the fuck am I introducing myself? Future me reading this, you\u2019ll have to forgive the meandering tone here. I haven\u2019t had much time to record my thoughts and I\u2019m trying to get into the swing of it again. Sue me.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBack to the subject at hand, it\u2019s fascinating to me that O5-0 \u2013 <em>seriously, that\u2019s going to get annoying, gonna be Zero from here on out</em> \u2013 has no trouble seeing me or remembering me. Hell, they even remember my name. I didn\u2019t think that was a thing anymore. Few years on now I\u2019ve been a miasma of imperceptiveness, only lightening up when I concentrate. Sure, the odd duck has noticed me here or there, but I just put the whammy on em and that\u2019s that. S\u2019alright? S\u2019alright.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBut this one, they know me. Sees me from across a room and waves me down. Been right disconcerting.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhy am I going on about this? Other than tamping down on the raging imposter syndrome and churning mass of anxiety that is my life? Zero has been around me a lot lately. \u2018Bout a month ago, me and these other blokes sneak into Site-01. Yeah, that Site-01. Big bad Foundation prison for everything they want even their own people to forget about. We go in for the express purpose of busting this fucker out. Turns out, they knows the Impasse and they knows what caused it. And if anyone can do something about it, it\u2019s them. Hence why them overwatch types locked Zero up.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSo here we is, in the heart of multiversal knowledge and resistance to all things Jailer, with the Black Queen (<em>Don\u2019t love that name, me darling. Feels a bit up your arse.</em>) and some others, and another Nobody. Oh yeah, I\u2019m not alone. Don\u2019t have a name for him, he don\u2019t remember one \u2013 or so he says \u2013 but I call him Barry. Hates it, he does.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nGot plans we do. Or at least, they do. Don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still here. Well\u2026 that\u2019s not expressly true. I do know why I\u2019m still here.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nDRAMATIC MUSIC. THE SCREEN GOES DARK. THE CROWD GOES ALL GOOEY WITH ANTICIPATION. CUE THE FLASHBACK.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Wanderers\u2019 Library \u2013 The Depository</strong><br/>\n<em>31 July, 2021</em><br/>\n<em>One week after the raid on Site-01</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>The Depository stood in the center of a sea of books, the stacks arrayed around it like a forest of the written word. But this building was different than most in the Library. Although a variety of building materials are used in the Library, the Depository is built of roughhewn stone like something out of time immemorial. A central courtyard surrounded by an oblong ring wall and a two-story building house the collection of magic and knowledge gained by this Alison Chao and others to be used as an asset in the Hand\u2019s long quiet war against the Foundation. This isn\u2019t a story about that war, not today.</p>\n<p>The structure is older than most know or care to think of. It pre-dates the Eighth Archivist\u2019s tenure. It predates the Roman Empire on most worlds. How the Black Queen came to own the building is a story in and of itself, but that is not the story we are here for today. Today is about remembrance.</p>\n<p>The Black Queen stood on a balcony overlooking the modest courtyard and the surrounding area of the stacks. She looked down on nearly a thousand mages, operatives of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, Library docents, and even the large centipede that governed the Library. They had all gathered for one thing. A funeral. She started to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not strangers to death. In our calling to fight against the oppression of the Jailers, to free magic from their iron grip, we have all lost colleagues and loved ones. I have personally lost friends and family in this conflict. But rarely do we have the wherewithal and motivation to hold a gathering such as this. In the last month, we have seen magic start to return. We know that the Jailers, against type, were the deciding factor in reversing the Impasse. We know there were teams all over the world trying to secure every advantage, totem or relic that could have made a difference. His August Personage, the Eighth Archivist, has graced us with his presence today and he tells me that members of the Jailers were even here in the Library not five weeks past, looking for a way into Alagadda.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison Chao paused here to let that fact sink in. It was common knowledge that the multiverse over, the Foundation was not to be trusted in these sacred halls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat has not been common knowledge, is the reason behind this death of magic they have called the Impasse. The Jailers might have fought to stop the entropic destruction of all things touched by magic or the anomalous, but they had good reason to. They were covering for their own sins. The Jailers are the cause of the Impasse. Their century or more of containment has weakened the natural state of the worlds, and so almost brought about the collapse. As so many of us know, without the anomalous there is no world. And for once, the Jailers saw it the same. But their actions in light of this catastrophe were to paper over their complicity. And even so, what actions they\u2019ve taken have only stemmed the tide. The Impasse is not reversed. The dead will not come back. The relics taken by the Jailers are being used to blunt the damage. We will see some return to the old powers, yes. But how long before it happens again? The Jailers might have changed ever so slightly. They may have freed some of their prisoners that posed the least threat to their Veil. But containment \u2013 slavery \u2013 is still their status quo. If it caused the Impasse once before, then it will surely do so again.\u201d</p>\n<p>She scanned the mass of bodies, looking into the eyes of hundreds as she panned left and right. Two Nobodies stood in the crowd, next to a four-armed individual of indecipherable gender. All three were impossibly hard to focus on, so Chao did not bother to.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is for that reason that I have authorized a number of operations against the Jailers in the past weeks. Operations that at one time would have been considered suicide. But we have been informed of the Jailers\u2019 weakness. Their disorganization. Their self-doubt. Their internal strife. Although their cabal of overlords has kept the truth to themselves about the cause of the Impasse, it is an open secret. We even have seen new resistance from within. And so, we committed to operations that would not even have been considered before. Because now is the time to bring them into the light, so they can die where we all see them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chao lowered her gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, despite the Jailers\u2019 disorganization in the wake of the crisis, they still present a serious danger to our people. We are gathered here to mourn our fallen. And one more who fell due to the Impasse as a whole. We say their names so we might remember their deeds and their contribution to the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKimori Quan Chi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMelissa Acherman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShalid Margossian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChlo\u00e9 Allard.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd intoned each name after her, a thousand voices strong. And then she paused again before the fifth and final name.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd one more we do not know the name of. Many of us have called him <a href=\"/scp-4999\">Thanatos</a>, as the Greeks might have called him. But he was the Grim Reaper and Charon too. Not a figure to be shunned or hated or feared, but a source of hope in the darkness of dying. We have recovered documentation from the Jailers that he too has fallen, disincorporated by the entropic effect of the Impasse. Many a dying soul has been shown the comfort of a caring universe by his presence in their last moments. But, most likely, there was no one to welcome him into the pale lands when it was his time. I wanted to honor his memory, because like so many things and people made up of wonder, they are gone from us now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent, most of which with bowed heads.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf any of you want to come up and speak of those we are here to remember, I welcome you to do so now. This has been a hard time for us all, and will be harder still. I wanted to come together and show us all what we\u2019re fighting for. So no more of us are locked away by the Jailers. So no more dead and forgotten gods are cemented over by the Jailers\u2019 endless hunger for their arbitrary status quo. Thank you all for coming. It means the world to me.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>The two Nobodies broke off from the crowd and met the Black Queen on her descent of the stone steps within the library. The individual known as O5-0 trailed behind, along with <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/of-an-endless-hunt\">Amy Corvin</a>. They follow the Queen into a side room away from the stream of people starting up the stairs to share their memories of the fallen.</p>\n<p>The room contained a sleek conference table, already covered with tomes and documents. The Queen sat at the head of the table and indicated the rest to find seats.</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate you coming to this. Especially you,\u201d she said, nodding to Zero.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe very least I could do, given your assistance in freeing me from my wayward colleagues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this has been a lot for you, I can\u2019t imagine your perspective, but I need to know you\u2019re in this fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have been <em>in the fight</em> for longer than you\u2019ve been alive, Ms. Chao.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I just need to know where we\u2019re all at. Getting you out was only a first step in a new facet of this long war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was imprisoned by Overwatch for my activities in trying to stem the tide of the Impasse.\u201d</p>\n<p>The female Nobody spoke, reminding Chao she was there. She shook her head slightly, as if trying to shake out the disorientation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d the Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>Zero, with apparently no difficulty, focused their eyes on the woman.</p>\n<p>\u201cI stole one of their artifacts and was in the process of stealing more. The Council gathered four artifacts of prodigious thaumaturgical potency. They did this in an end run gambit to stymie the worst of the Impasse. Despite my clear warnings that it was the systemic containment of the anomalous that was the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did they find these artifacts?\u201d Corvin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told them about them, in a round about manner. Many years ago I had an office within the organization, and many materials were left behind when I fled from the Council. I did that because I knew they would not take my warnings seriously. And I will admit, when I realized that my notes on several artifacts that could be used to dampen the entropy and slow, possibly even halt, the death of the anomalous, I thought it was a good thing they were in their hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit, why would that be a good thing?\u201d Corvin asked, half rising from her seat. Chao placed a hand on her young friend\u2019s shoulder and gently pushed her back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmy has the mouth of a sailor, but she has similar concerns as I do,\u201d Chao said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that if anyone could hunt down four legendary prisms of unrestrained thaumaturgy, it was the Foundation. And I was right. When the Impasse started to show its effect on the world, when things started to quietly die that should not ever do so, I wormed my way back into the Foundation. I infiltrated and made myself appear as a researcher. I clued in the Council to the existence of the notes, as they had sealed up my office and pretended I never existed, and planted the seed of a plan. I thought to sweep in, gather up the artifacts under their noses and use them for my own purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t work as well as you hoped,\u201d Nobody said.</p>\n<p>Chao noticed the other Nobody was silent in his reverie; despite his impetus in forming this little cabal \u2013 having called all those here together in the first place \u2013 he was strangely quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d Zero said. They placed two of their palms flat on the table, crossing the other two arms across their chest. \u201cI wanted to use the artifacts to stem the entropy, and that is what the Council is doing. As potent as these artifacts are as weapons, and they are without a doubt weapons, their greatest utility is damming up the flow of the Impasse. So, it worked in the sense that the Council is using them for the purposes I foresaw their potential to be. But they discovered me and imprisoned me. I got through to some of them, sat in the room with them and convinced nearly half the Council to walk away from containment. To shut down the Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think those you convinced would be willing to work against the organization?\u201d Chao asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. My gut says no, that voting against the Foundation is not the same as betraying it. But it might be worth some reconnaissance of those who voted in favor of dissolution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know who voted against?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO5s three, six, seven, nine, eleven and twelve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about them as individuals,\u201d Corvin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can fill you in to some extent, at least enough to get started,\u201d Zero responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore research. Great,\u201d the female Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have something in mind, Lou?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chao narrowed her eyes at this. Wondered how Zero knew a name for Nobody. The woman also found it obviously disconcerting, and that confusion cleared up a little more of the fog around her. Chao could see the Nobody clearly for a moment, ringed in red curls. But when she spoke, she did not comment on Zero\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we got you out, you said you wanted to shut them down. How do you shut down the O5s?\u201d Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witty answer would be \u2018carefully\u2019 but I think you want more details than that,\u201d Zero said. \u201cWe divide them. Find the chinks in the organizational armor and I assure they exist, and then apply pressure. Some violence will almost certainly be required.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>Breaking in here to say I don\u2019t mind a good scrap. Hell, I grew up in London. Can\u2019t go anywhere without a baton or a blade these days. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I was relishing another gun fight with the Foundies and their death squads.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nDespite my ability to sneak into almost any sort of secret bunker, I haven\u2019t often utilized my \u201ccondition\u201d for violence. That being said, nothing sorts out an authoritative regime better than a knife in the right set of ribs.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Chao nodded, contemplating Zero\u2019s words. \u201cSo, do you think reattaining the artifacts would be worth pursuing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they are serving a purpose now,\u201d Zero said. \u201cNo one wants the Impasse to continue less than I. But they weren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Corvin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were other artifacts that I thought could be used to serve the same function, and some of those would be useful to secure. If only to keep them out of the Foundation\u2019s cells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chao turned to the silent Nobody, annoyed by his reticence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you going to participate in this meeting you facilitated? Your colleague seems engaged. You have been silent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was waiting to see how long it took for any of you to notice that we aren\u2019t alone,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zero said. The other Nobody nodded to the corner of the room, draped in shadows.</p>\n<p>\u201cSon of a bitch. I knew I couldn\u2019t trust Placeholder,\u201d a disembodied voice said from the corner.</p>\n<p>Zero narrowed their eyes on the darkened corner of the room and raised a hand, forming a series of sigils in the air with rapidity. A <a href=\"/scp-5616\">woman</a> with short, wavy reddish hair and wearing glasses and a slim jumpsuit wavered into being.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. This is awkward. Let\u2019s start with introductions. My name is Ilse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Female Nobody \u2013 <em>what was her name again?</em> \u2013 and Corvin had guns in hand, pointed at the new arrival.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why you sneaking about like a bleeding ninja?\u201d the female Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s Foundation,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly!\u201d the woman exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot possible,\u201d Chao said. \u201cHow could someone from the Foundation find their way in here? And hide from us, in this way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s very good,\u201d the male Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you. Very helpful,\u201d Chao said narrowing her eyes and looking sideways at the Nobody. She turned back towards the woman in the corner. \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, what did you mean when you said you couldn\u2019t trust a placeholder?\u201d the other Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take those one at a time. First, Placeholder is a person. Long story short, he had his name stolen by <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242\">a magical whatsit</a> and he gets to walk around with one of the most ridiculous names someone could imagine. He is one of the most important experts in something the Foundation calls Pataphysics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Corvin said.</p>\n<p>Chao frowned. \u201cLet her finish. Don\u2019t interrupt again, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. Listen, I don\u2019t want to bore you more than you already are, but pataphysics is the study of narrative in dictating the operations of the universe. I think. Suffice it to say that Placeholder told me that this device,\u201d she held up her hand to show a bracelet made of smokey gray metal, \u201cwould deemphasize my protagonistic potential to such a degree that I would disappear into the background.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>I shit you not, this is what she said. Protagonistic potential. Jesus.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cSorry\u2026 your what?\u201d the female Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, what it was supposed to do was make me much much less noticeable so I could observe without interfering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I do not care how you were hiding in the corner, Ilse,\u201d Zero said. \u201cI am a fugitive from the Foundation and here we find you, an agent of that same Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not really. I\u2019m not an agent of the Foundation as you understand it. I\u2019m the director of the TAD. I shouldn\u2019t be telling you any of this. But, we\u2019re not super interested in containment or locking up anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what are you interested in?\u201d Zero asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaintaining the timeline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe what now?\u201d the female Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cA chronological arrangement of events in the order of their occurrence in the simplest meaning, but in a world of alternate realities, it\u2019s a specific arrangement,\u201d Zero said. \u201cOne of many. In other words, another dimension or a different versions of our universe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, there are different version of us out there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. But there is only one Wanderer\u2019s Library, and it connects to all of those other worlds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, most of them anyway. It\u2019s hard to say for sure if all universes connect to the Library,\u201d Chao said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeggin the question: How does this \u2018TAD\u2019 maintain a fawking timeline? What does TAD even stand for?\u201d the Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Temporal Anomalies Department,\u201d Ilse said. \u201cWe mostly monitor anomalies that directly affect the arrangement of events and interfere with the Prime Timeline, the most stable. If the multiverse is the branches of a tree, then the Prime Timeline is the trunk. So, yes, we are the Foundation, but we aren\u2019t interested in locking up murder monsters or interfering with the Hand, we are entirely focused on combating a number of retrocausal, temporal and ahistorical events that are caused by anomalies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t explain why you are here, why you infiltrated my private space, and why you were skulking around like a home invader?\u201d Alison asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor one thing, what you five are discussing has a significant impact on the following years. I couldn\u2019t help but see it for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018For one thing?\u2019 What else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to our records, I was supposed to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d the male Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo a very limited extent, my department is able to traverse the time stream. It\u2019s necessary to preserve the timeline. The TAD exists outside the timelines, by way of a bunch of technical jargon I won\u2019t be explaining. Effectively, you are in my past. In my present, we have technical details concerning the events following the vote of the O5 Council and Zero\u2019s escape from custody afterwards. One of those details is that I was present. Which isn\u2019t technically possible.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>If I had to read this, I\u2019d get real sick of me or someone else asking \u201cwhat?\u201d because half the stuff this bird said made no sense. Every other word out of her mouth was bloody gibberish. I guess it showed on my face, cos she went on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cLong story short, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5616\">I only recently freed myself</a> from a sort of containment that\u2019s held me underground for the better part of the 20th century. I\u2019m still there, underground in Canada. Actually, today I am giving a presentation on ***.\u201d</p>\n<p>The TAD Director ended the sentence with a screeching that sounded like metal tearing apart. Everyone in the room flinched, except Zero.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in the fuck was that?\u201d Corwin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere must be a memetic filter on that presentation. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a long time since I had to worry about clearances. Suffice it to say that I wasn\u2019t in the Wanderer\u2019s Library on this day, talking to you. But that\u2019s what the TAD\u2019s records say, so\u2026 I figured I\u2019d sit in the shadows and see if a different version of me showed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t consider that the version of you that would appear, was you?\u201d Zero asked.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>At this point, I had the worst headache of me bleeding life. Even thinking of this conversation makes my head hurt.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cIt did, but I thought that was an outside possibility. To be honest, I\u2019m still thinking that other version of me wanders in any minute. You should know what that feels like, Ms. Chao.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works with my sister selves,\u201d Alison responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a poor attempt at a joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did your records say you were here to say?\u201d the male Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus. I forgot you were here. I hate that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no bloody fun for us either, lady,\u201d the female Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies, I don\u2019t mean to be insensitive. Why I\u2019m here\u2026 well, I guess, to sell out the Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alison gaped at her, she could see everyone else\u2019s reaction was similar.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>Just imagine I said \u201cWhat?!?!\u201d again.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s not the most predictable path for an agent of the Foundation but apparently, I give you information on the whereabouts of three Overseers and several pieces of equipment that will help you in your endeavor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you help us?\u201d Alison asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe TAD might be part of the Foundation, but it is entirely outside the command structure. We follow our own prerogatives and march to our own drum. The way the O5s have handled the Impasse leaves a lot to be desired. And apparently, it\u2019s already happened so\u2026 despite the fact I have misgivings, I will provide you with the information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn exchange for what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few minutes of your time for some questions concerning your sisterhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alison considered for a moment. She could see Amy Corvin\u2019s head shake in her peripheral vision as the young woman tried desperately to get her attention. She met Zero\u2019s eyes across the table and they shrugged ever so slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine the Foundation already knows everything it needs to concerning your special condition,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise to keep everything confidential. Anything related to the Impasse is not even on review by the O5s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredibly transparent, Dr. Reynders,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>Ilse startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies, I have been aware of your predicament for several decades. When you mentioned your name and your recent incarceration, I put two and two together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very well informed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI began your organization over a hundred years ago, my good doctor. I tend to keep tabs on them. But don\u2019t dissemble. Why are you being so apparently forthcoming with us, the enemies of your Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t agree with how Overwatch handled the crisis. I don\u2019t appreciate the way they treated you. We are supposed to contain threats to normalcy, not people who disagree with our policies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a threat to normalcy. A significant one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ilse chuckled. \u201cI have no doubt. But my point is, the Foundation has been overly concerned with locking up threats to their organization. Things and people that aren\u2019t a threat to anyone\u2019s life but <em>do</em> imperil the Foundation\u2019s power and authority. And for another reason, anything said within this building is null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zero turned and looked at Alison. \u201cWhat does she mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have considerable reason to be paranoid these days,\u201d Alison said. \u201cThis building has a geas placed upon it. Anyone entering that wishes to report what occurs here in a way that would provide information for my enemies will find themselves completely unable to communicate the information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even be able to confirm to someone that I was here if they demanded I do so, if it was to work against the Queen or the Hand in general,\u201d Ilse said. \u201cSo, no one at the Foundation will know that it was this me that told you anything. Only that a version of me, free from my incarceration as you called it, appeared today to aid in the conversation. And even then, the only with access to those files are people in the TAD who don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, provide your information and I will answer your questions, within reason,\u201d Alison said.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent! So, the first thing I\u2019ll tell you is the name of <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7007\">O5-7: Marjorie Gonzales</a>. And I can tell you where to find her too.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>And at this point she starts listing off details about a number of O5s and then gives a debriefing on some assets that would help in <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">taking out</span></strong> capturing the Overseers. Honestly, it\u2019s terribly boring stuff. Let\u2019s move on. I\u2019m pretty sure someone was writing it down.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>With my condition, you can imagine it\u2019s easy to lose someone\u2019s focus. Really it\u2019s a curse, but every once in a while \u2013 well ok, actually all the time \u2013 it\u2019s really useful.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSo, Dr. Ilse gives us a whole run through, which like I said I\u2019m skipping over, and the others are talking in a frenzied manner. Zero is taking notes, and animatedly discussing strategies with Barry and Corwin. They start to file out of the room and just as she gets to the door, Corwin looks back at Chao \u2013 who proceeds to wave her off. And here I am, slinking into the far corner of the room, the same corner this chick popped outta the shadows from, and fading from sight.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nYou gotta understand, its not a literal vanishing act. But I think it works more like a filter. People just have a harder time noticing me when they\u2019re not directly interacting with me. Gets even easier when they\u2019re a) as focused as the doctor and Chao are on each other, and b) when I lean into the mojo. Always there, my condition, in the back of my mind. I can hold it back for a while, make it easier for people to see me/remember me. And just as easily, I can lean the other way entirely.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI get out my little recorder, because I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna talk about and I want to remember it clearly. No one who calls themselves a queen is to be trusted. And I think by now, you know my opinion of anyone willingly signing up to be part of the Foundation \u2013 Time Abnormal Division or not.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAnd what they talk about, it\u2019s juicy:</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #DAD9D9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: \u2018Arial Rounded MT Bold\u2019\">\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: What did you want to speak to me about?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: Have you had occasion to speak with your sisters lately?</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: Every day, or close to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: Any who have experienced the Impasse?</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: Of course, it spread out through the worlds. I think through the Library.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: Huh, I hadn\u2019t considered that.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: In hindsight, it\u2019s not really clear how it spread. Maybe you\u2019re right and it started here in your timeline, spread into the other worlds connected to the Library. But I don\u2019t know\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: I don\u2019t understand. What else?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: A lot of very smart people have worked on this for years, in at least <em>two</em> universes.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: And?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: They don\u2019t know, it seems to have sprouted up in a number of alternate realities. No one does. Or if they do, they aren\u2019t talking. And the TAD has a wide view\u2026 if someone knew and were talking, then I\u2019d know.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: What did you want to know about the sisters? I have things to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: Have you spoken to your sister in the <span class=\"dblock\">mirror reality</span>?</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: Sorry?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: The <span class=\"dblock\">parallel timeline</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: I don\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: With the <span class=\"dblock\">dissolution of the Foundation and the formation of Vanguard</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: Please stop. I literally cannot understand what you\u2019re saying. Some more \u201cmemetic countermeasures\u201d?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: What? No. No one could even know to create such a thing in this reality, that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you. Because you could talk to your sister self in that <span class=\"dblock\">other timeline, where she joined Vanguard</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: You\u2019re giving me a headache. I can\u2019t understand half the things you\u2019re saying. Last chance. Do you have an actual question for me?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: Let\u2019s test it. Can you understand this: I want to know about a sister of yours that has experienced the Impasse.</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaosness</strong>: Yes, I understood that. Which one?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: The one who joined <span class=\"dblock\">Vanguard</span>!</p>\n<p><strong>Her Chaoness</strong>: Okay, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not wasting another minute on this conversation. Figure out whatever is wrong with you and come back if you want, I owe you that much. But this is useless.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>Then she ups and just leaves, lets the Foundation goon just stand there looking flabbergasted. I got the impression she was the type of person who usually understood how to communicate and wasn\u2019t used to people just walking out on her ass.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: So\u2026 what does that mean? People in this universe can\u2019t understand when I talk about the <span class=\"dblock\">parallel timeline</span>? Or does it go deeper? She isn\u2019t even aware of her sister joining <span class=\"dblock\">Vanguard</span> or she\u2019s an excellent liar. But no, she was the third person to react that way. Seems like no one from this universe can interact with that <span class=\"dblock\">timeline</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundie</strong>: I wonder if you could travel from here into that <span class=\"dblock\">timeline</span> through the Library? That\u2019s how it works right? So, is something blocking the path and stopping everyone from reacting or understanding\u2026 or is it something else?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>Then she sighed, pulled out a magic fucking pocket watch, played a tune on it and then winked out of existence.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAnd people think I\u2019m weird.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAnyway, I rushed out of there and caught up with Chao.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cWere you in there the whole time, Ms. Nobody?\u201d she asked.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI nodded.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u201cYou people are always trouble.

Or else she\u2019s under a terrible curse.

was different than most in the Library.\u00a0\u00a0Although a variety of building materials are used in the Library, the Depository is built of roughhewn stone like something out of time immemorial.\u00a0\u00a0A central courtyard surrounded by an oblong ring wall and a two-story building house the collection of magic and knowledge gained by this Alison Chao and others to be used as an asset in the Hand\u2019s long quiet war against the Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0This isn\u2019t a story about that war, not today.\n\n\n\nThe structure is older than most know or care to think of.\u00a0\u00a0It pre-dates the Eighth Archivist\u2019s tenure.\u00a0\u00a0It predates the Roman Empire on most worlds.\u00a0\u00a0How the Black Queen came to own the building is a story in and of itself, but that is not the story we are here for today.\u00a0\u00a0Today is about remembrance.\n\n\n\nThe Black Queen stood on a balcony overlooking the modest courtyard and the surrounding area of the stacks.\u00a0\u00a0She looked down on nearly a thousand mages, operatives of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, Library docents, and even the large centipede that governed the Library.\u00a0\u00a0They had all gathered for one thing.\u00a0\u00a0A funeral.\u00a0\u00a0She started to speak.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not strangers to death.\u00a0\u00a0In our calling to fight against the oppression of the Jailers, to free magic from their iron grip, we have all lost colleagues and loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0I have personally lost friends and family in this conflict.\u00a0\u00a0But rarely do we have the wherewithal and motivation to hold a gathering such as this.\u00a0\u00a0In the last month, we have seen magic start to return.\u00a0\u00a0We know that the Jailers, against type, were the deciding factor in reversing the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0We know there were teams all over the world trying to secure every advantage, totem or relic that could have made a difference.\u00a0\u00a0His August Personage, the Eighth Archivist, has graced us with his presence today and he tells me that members of the Jailers were even here in the Library not five weeks past, looking for a way into Alagadda.\u201d\n\n\n\nAllison Chao paused here to let that fact sink in.\u00a0\u00a0It was common knowledge that the multiverse over, the Foundation was not to be trusted in these sacred halls.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat has not been common knowledge, is the reason behind this death of magic they have called the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0The Jailers might have fought to stop the entropic destruction of all things touched by magic or the anomalous, but they had good reason to.\u00a0\u00a0They were covering for their own sins.\u00a0\u00a0The Jailers are the cause of the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0Their century or more of containment has weakened the natural state of the worlds, and so almost brought about the collapse.\u00a0\u00a0As so many of us know, without the anomalous there is no world.\u00a0\u00a0And for once, the Jailers saw it the same.\u00a0\u00a0But their actions in light of this catastrophe were to paper over their complicity.\u00a0\u00a0And even so, what actions they\u2019ve taken have only stemmed the tide.\u00a0\u00a0The Impasse is not reversed.\u00a0\u00a0The dead will not come back.\u00a0\u00a0The relics taken by the Jailers are being used to blunt the damage.\u00a0\u00a0We will see some return to the old powers, yes.\u00a0\u00a0But how long before it happens again?\u00a0\u00a0The Jailers might have changed ever so slightly.\u00a0\u00a0They may have freed some of their prisoners that posed the least threat to their Veil.\u00a0\u00a0But containment \u2013 slavery \u2013 is still their status quo.\u00a0\u00a0If it caused the Impasse once before, then it will surely do so again.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe scanned the mass of bodies, looking into the eyes of hundreds as she panned left and right.\u00a0\u00a0Two Nobodies stood in the crowd, next to a four-armed individual of indecipherable gender.\u00a0\u00a0All three were impossibly hard to focus on, so Chao did not bother to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is for that reason that I have authorized a number of operations against the Jailers in the past weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Operations that at one time would have been considered suicide.\u00a0\u00a0But we have been informed of the Jailers\u2019 weakness.\u00a0\u00a0Their disorganization.\u00a0\u00a0Their self-doubt.\u00a0\u00a0Their internal strife.\u00a0\u00a0Although their cabal of overlords has kept the truth to themselves about the cause of the Impasse, it is an open secret.\u00a0\u00a0We even have seen new resistance from within.\u00a0\u00a0And so, we committed to operations that would not even have been considered

realized that my notes on several artifacts that could be used to dampen the entropy and slow, possibly even halt, the death of the anomalous, I thought it was a good thing they were in their

Not ringing a bell\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini pulled his tablet out of his pocket and tapped rapidly on the screen, then read the first few paragraphs of the results. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, \u2018wow\u2019 is right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did he even have it out of its containment locker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber looked at him. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Right. Where is he now? Fired?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I sent him to talk to HR. He did report the change to me immediately, and I suppose there are worse ways he could have abused artifacts. Poor dumbass was mortified. He actually started crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re too nice. Wait, holy shit, someone actually suggested we use 1004 to <em>blackmail</em> people?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. Assuming we could record its output, anyway. Which we can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini shook his head. \u201cWhat kind of idiot would actually write that down in a formal document with their name attached to it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I wondered about that. You\u2019ll never guess who it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini looked puzzled. \u201cShould I know?\u201d</p>\n<p>At her desk, Gruber clicked the option to show the document\u2019s history. \u201cAdam Dale,\u201d she said, indicating the screen.</p>\n<p>Mancini blinked. \u201cAs in, Incident 1004-Dale? <em>That</em> Adam Dale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. His fingerprints are all over this. All over the document, I mean. The actual artifact looks\u2026 reasonably clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini raised his index finger. \u201cY\u2019know \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber cut him off. \u201cWhatever joke you were about to make, assume I\u2019ve already thought of it and decided it was disgusting, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini sighed and nodded. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the change?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, it used to be just a command prompt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018What would you like to see\u2019, right. But now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of answering, Gruber pressed the button to open her desktop\u2019s CD drive, and inserted the disk. A window popped up on the screen, with one file in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Mancini leaned on the desk so he could get a better view.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber moused over the icon for TheFactory.exe, and double-clicked on it.</p>\n<p>The screen went blank, then filled with a rendering of the Factory\u2019s logo in ASCII art. It slowly faded away, and a text box appeared.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong><em>THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO USE FACTORY P.O.R.N., THE PORNOMANTIC OMNIVERSAL RETRIEVAL NEXUS, DESPITE THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERATIVE A.I.

She returned to the main menu, then clicked on the \u2018get to the good stuff!\u2019 link.</p>\n<p>Mancini side-eyed her. \u201cVera, please, I don\u2019t want my friend to turn into a sex monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>She waved that off. \u201cOne, the file says upwards of a hundred hours of exposure.

Gruber shook her head. \u201cThey did say they\u2019d be deleting all the posts, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s see the FAQ?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>Q:</strong> I want to share Factory P.O.R.N with my friends. Why can\u2019t I send them copies of the application?</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>A</strong>: It\u2019s proprietary! Plus, for obvious reasons, we\u2019d rather be able to control how many copies of the Nexus are open at any given time, so saving the file to your hard drive, or including it as an attachment in an e-mail message or an IM, will result in an unactivatable bitstring. Don\u2019t worry, you can give us your friends\u2019 mailing addresses, and we\u2019ll send them their own copies of Factory P.O.R.N. on floppy diskette or CD-ROM! &lt;wink&gt;</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> As of January 1, 2005, we will no longer be providing Factory P.O.R.N. on floppy diskette.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> As of January 1, 2011, we will no longer be providing Factory P.O.R.N. on CD-ROM; however, we will be providing it on USB drives.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> Due to issues with our USB drive supplier, we will continue providing Factory P.O.R.N. on CD-ROM until July 1, 2011.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> Factory P.O.R.N. on USB drives will not be available until January 1, 2013.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> We\u2019re hoping for 2014.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> 2017.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> Don't ask. We'll let you know.</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>Q:</strong> I want to share Factory P.O.R.N with my friends. Why can\u2019t I send them copies of the videos, or save them to my computer\u2019s hard drive and watch them again afterward?</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>A:</strong> You can, if you upgrade to <em>Premium Factory P.O.R.N.</em> for $499.95 US! <em>Premium Factory P.O.R.N.</em> also includes the ability to make more detailed requests (maximum 1500 words instead of 300), and the ability to request variations on a specific video instead of doing an entire new search. Send a check or postal money order to The Factory.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> We\u2019ve joined PayPal! It\u2019s a new service for processing online payments!</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>Q:</strong> How does Factory P.O.R.N. work?</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOh wait,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>A:</strong> The details are proprietary, but here\u2019s a simplified version:</tt></p>\n<p><tt>TheFactory.exe is a 17-layered recursively self-casting compressed cantrip. Each layer casts the next, until the final layer generates the Retrieval Agent and opens the Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>The Retrieval Agent then searches the omniverse until it has located no less than 50 videos that meet your description, produces \u201cthumbnail\u201d images for you to choose from, and then plays them on the occipital lobe of your brain.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>The search algorithm functions in a time dimension that\u2019s perpendicular to the one we live in, so even if it takes a centillion years to find what you\u2019ve asked for, your results will be presented to you instantly!</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Gruber said. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini glared at her. \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \u201cAgree to disagree. How about Community Notes?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt>Here are the winners of the \u201cTop Ten Reasons Factory P.O.R.N. is Better than Generative AI\u201d essay contest! Because only six people submitted entries, all six of you win!</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>1:</strong> <em>USING FACTORY PORN IS BETTER THEN USING GENERATION A.I. BECAUSE, ITS WHAT I WAS DOING FIRST.</em> - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>2:</strong> Using Factory Porn is more <em>intellectually honest</em> than generative AI, because nobody really knows how generative AI works. It\u2019s a \u201cblack box\u201d that could do <em>anything!</em> With Factory Porn, we <em>know</em> it\u2019s just the Retrieval Agent searching and finding. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>3:</strong> Generative AI is trained on a corpus of pre-existing content, but all of that has its own copyright, which the generative AI is inherently breaching because everything it makes is a derived work. But alternate universes are not party to the Berne Convention, so their copyright doesn\u2019t apply. Trust me on this, I\u2019m a lawyer. And even if it did, the Retrieval Agent can only contact a given universe once. Trust me on this, I\u2019m also a physicist. So that means that we can\u2019t transact with them except acausally, and that doesn\u2019t work. Trust me on this, I\u2019m also an economist. So we might as well just copy anything and everything from any alternate universe, because it won\u2019t matter. Trust me on this, I\u2019m also a philosopher. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>4:</strong> Using the Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus is more <em>ethical</em> than generative AI. Generative AI is trained on the faces and bodies of millions of people, some of whom may not have wanted their images to be used in this way. The Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus reaches out to a reality where your specific porn has already been made, so there are no consent issues! - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>5:</strong> The Pornomatic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus is <em>esthetically superior</em> to using generative AI. Generative AI just puts pixels together until it produces an image \u2013 but there was never any actual person involved. Every single video the Nexus retrieves was made by, with, and for real people. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>6:</strong> The use of generative AI for the real-time bespoke production of high-resolution full-length videos would have an unacceptably high carbon footprint</tt>.</p>\n<p><tt>Each of the cantrip\u2019s 16 cycles of expansion uses approximately 17 picojoules. The final cantrip opens the Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus, and uses approximately 84\u00a0000 picojoules. By contrast, using a 40-watt lightbulb for 1 second uses 40\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 picojoules. That\u2019s 474 billion times more, every single second. The entire population of the Earth is less than 12 billion. Just to surpass that one 40-watt bulb burning for 1 second, every single one of us would have to be opening TheFactory.exe 35 times a second. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mancini frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the logic for number four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea that, just because the porn exists, that means everyone involved was consenting?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber winced. \u201cChrist, you had to remind me. I skimmed the test logs earlier \u2013 just the metadata. Just to see what kind of stuff people were looking for. It is some serious nightmare shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"Hold on, I\u2019ll give you access.\u201d Gruber typed a few commands on her keyboard, and Mancini tapped the fresh link that appeared on his tablet.</p>\n<p>His gaze flickered across the screen. \u201cThis seems\u2026 pretty abstract?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, starting on page 8.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini scrolled down to page 8.

Expected I\u2019d have access to his personnel file, but it\u2019s sealed until 59 years from now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cThat means he\u2019s dead, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny that,\u201d Gruber said, nodding.</p>\n<p>Mancini sighed. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>Update:</strong> Make sure to take regular breaks from using Factory P.O.R.N., so as to avoid chafing, which can lead to blisters and skin infections!

This thing\u2019s been around for \u2013 how old is PayPal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, from the mid nineties, I think? I could look it up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. This thing\u2019s older than PayPal, is my point. And our file says that the threshold for turning into a sex monster is around a hundred hours of use.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini nodded slowly. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re the sort of person who joins the official forums for it, you\u2019re probably a heavy user.\u201d He checked his tablet again. \u201cSays a hundred hours <em>straight</em>, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, no, I don\u2019t believe that either. Let me check something.\u201d She typed rapidly on her keyboard; the window with TheFactory.exe was replaced with the Foundation\u2019s standard UI, and she opened the directory of test logs.</p>\n<p>They both swore.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. Look at those timestamps,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cNone of these tests lasted more than four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201c\u2026 Did we accept that this was a cognitohazard just because Adam Dale said it was?!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like. But\u2026 wait, if he was that bad all along, why did the O5s go along with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>She gazed at him for a long moment. \u201cPasquale, are you really asking why an organization would say that one of their people was the victim of psychic contamination by an anomaly instead of admit that they\u2019d let a sex monster hold a position of authority for over six years?\u201d</p>\n<p>He bit his lip. \u201cWell, when you put it <em>that</em> way\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She closed her eyes and stretched her arms above her head, and cracked her knuckles. \u201cYou know what the real shame of it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at the dates on the access log. We\u2019ve had this thing in custody for almost thirty years, and that guard was the first one to touch it in almost <em>twenty</em> years, because we were all too scared of a bullshit cognitohazard that a sex monster made up to protect his own reputation. Think what we could have learned if we\u2019d gone on their forums and <em>talked</em> to people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini shook his head. \u201cYou think we would\u2019ve realized they even <em>had</em> forums?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno.

His eyes widened in horror, and she suddenly realized what else he might have intended using a box of tissues for. She winced.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Blow your nose,//\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWipe your face.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d He blushed again, but took the tissues from her.\n\n\n\nGruber drummed her fingers on her desk impatiently, watching as the guard cleaned himself up. \u201cAre you always this emotionally fragile?\u201d she asked him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 not in a crisis situation.

Your pay will be docked for\u2026 probably a year, you\u2019ll have to take some training courses, you might be reassigned to a different site.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.

No, never.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe indicated the CD-ROM sitting in its plastic case on her desk. \u201cHow did you even find out about it?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guard shrugged. \u201cThere were rumors? I mean\u2026 people talk. Especially about things like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber slumped. \u201cYou never heard of infosec?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 we all have clearance, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter you\u2019ve been to HR, you need to have a long talk with the people at RAISA.\u201d\t\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nDr. Mancini knocked at the open door to Gruber\u2019s office. \u201cGood afternoon, Vera. You wanted to see me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Pasquale. Come in. Before I explain what this is about, I need to tell you that I am //not// propositioning you. This is not any kind of flirtation.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cI would hope not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure my husband would be very upset.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLast night, a guard reported a substantial change to a contained artifact. I had a quick glance afterward \u2013 enough to confirm that he wasn\u2019t just making shit up. But I think\u2026 I think it needs to have more than one person look into it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you thought I\u2019d perceive that as //flirting?//\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber gave a thin smile. \u201cIt\u2019s [[[SCP-1004]]], so I figured I\u2019d be on the safe side.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne zero zero four. Hm. Not ringing a bell\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini pulled his tablet out of his pocket and tapped rapidly on the screen, then read the first few paragraphs of the results. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2018wow\u2019 is right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy did he even have it out of its containment locker?\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber looked at him. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\t\n\n\u201cAh. Right. Where is he now? Fired?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I sent him to talk to HR. He did report the change to me immediately, and I suppose there are worse ways he could have abused artifacts. Poor dumbass was mortified. He actually started crying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nice. Wait, holy shit, someone actually suggested we use 1004 to //blackmail// people?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYep. Assuming we could record its output, anyway. Which we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini shook his head. \u201cWhat kind of idiot would actually write that down in a formal document with their name attached to it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I wondered about that. You\u2019ll never guess who it was.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini looked puzzled. \u201cShould I know?\u201d\n\n\n\nAt her desk, Gruber clicked the option to show the document\u2019s history. \u201cAdam Dale,\u201d she said, indicating the screen.\n\n\n\nMancini blinked. \u201cAs in, Incident 1004-Dale? //That// Adam Dale?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYep. His fingerprints are all over this. All over the document, I mean. The actual artifact looks\u2026 reasonably clean.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini raised his index finger. \u201cY\u2019know \u2013\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber cut him off. \u201cWhatever joke you were about to make, assume I\u2019ve already thought of it and decided it was disgusting, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini sighed and nodded. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the change?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently, it used to be just a command prompt.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018What would you like to see\u2019, right. But now?\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of answering, Gruber pressed the button to open her desktop\u2019s CD drive, and inserted the disk. A window popped up on the screen, with one file in it.\n\n\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\nMancini leaned on the desk so he could get a better view.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber moused over the icon for TheFactory.exe, and double-clicked on it.\n\n\n\nThe screen went blank, then filled with a rendering of the Factory\u2019s logo in ASCII art. It slowly faded away, and a text box appeared.\n\n\n\n> {{**//THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO USE FACTORY P.O.R.N., THE PORNOMANTIC OMNIVERSAL RETRIEVAL NEXUS, DESPITE THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERATIVE A.I.

Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-2\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')\">2</a>. Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text. Possible precursor to modern portmanteaus as seen in English and other Germanic descended languages.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-3\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')\">3</a>. Oral traditions throughout Finnfolk history have superstitiously assigned reproductive importance to only a single arm of most starfish species, even though, in actuality, they reproduce with all of them. It is currently unknown how deeply this belief persists in their modern, scientifically rigorous societies.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-4\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')\">4</a>. Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization. Modern iconography posits their significance similar to the romantic connotation of diamond rings in many areas of different human cultures, but it is uncertain if that same meaning is carried within this poem.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-5\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')\">5</a>. Fivefold repetition here and in other tercets of this poem suggest intentional anaphora instead of an accidental clustering of words, marking this poetic device as the earliest developed by pre-Mitheric Finnfolk, at least according to records known by the Foundation.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-6\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')\">6</a>. Most likely a precursor to the modern Finnfolk phrase \u201cof rocks, like starfish\u201d, roughly translating in meaning to \u201cthese two objects are closely related to each other in some manner, usually by virtue of physical characteristics\u201d, similar to the English idiom \u201clike father, like son\u201d. It is currently unknown why this connotation developed; the most likely explanation is the hard, calcified remains of dead starfish being likened to stones.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-7\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')\">7</a>. Uncertain translation. Literal translation is \u201clife carvings\u201d\u2014\u201ccarvings\u201d was translated to \u201cnames\u201d due to context clues and greater poetic impact.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-8\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')\">8</a>. Rhyming does not occur in the original translation; Finnfolk poetry did not express this trait until several decades after the First Sealing War\u2019s end.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-9\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-9')\">9</a>.

Uncertain meaning; literal translation is \u201csecond sea beneath us\u201d. Most likely referring to the regular sky, but could also have greater theistic connotations. Currently, little is concretely known about whether pre-Mitheric Finnfolk believed in any kind of afterlife/higher plane of existence, or if their naturalistic beliefs lended themselves to believing that nature as it appeared to them existed instead as cycles of reincarnation and rebirth.</div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:oceanbound\">:scp-wiki:theme:oceanbound</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:toggle-sidebar\">:scp-wiki:component:toggle-sidebar</a>]]\n\n====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:preview\">component:preview</a>\n\ntext=\n\nDedicated to the most precious little ones.\n\n]]\n\n=====\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> start=--\n\n|name=xexnoncores]]\n\nOf Starfish by [[*user xexnoncores]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> end=--]]\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Prata&display=swap');\n\n\n\n.storybook {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0font-family:Philosopher;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0font-size: 105%;\n\n}\n\n\n\n/*---- Toggle Sidebar compatibility patch ----*/\n\n#content-wrap {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0grid-template-areas:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"deco\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"main\";\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr);\n\n}\n\n#main-content {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0max-width: 47.5rem;\n\n}\n\n#side-bar { background-color: rgb(var(--foamy-white));

It is theorized to have been created before the First Sealing War[[footnote]]Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.[[/footnote]], with thaumic-dating placing its origins at around roughly 6100-5900 BCE. Most likely to be part of a poem, it is one of the oldest examples of Finnfolk language and culture before its shaping by Mitheric influences into the forms we know today. \n\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with typical lens of historical poetic analysis, it is advised to first contact Dr. Molly Hussie at Site-212A to check on the date of available workshops, then to read this poem once without footnotes, and again with them for the best experience.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"scenesetter\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Grenze Gotisch ; font-size: 1.25rem\"]]Count their arms: I shall give blessings for each\n\n\n\nOne stroke of my scales\n\n\n\nTwo liftings out of the life-water [[footnote]]Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text. Possible precursor to modern portmanteaus as seen in English and other Germanic descended languages.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nThree offerings of seaweed, for a hungry mouth\n\n\n\nFour scallop shells to the working limbs, but let the mating arm[[footnote]]Oral traditions throughout Finnfolk history have superstitiously assigned reproductive importance to only a single arm of most starfish species, even though, in actuality, they reproduce with all of them. It is currently unknown how deeply this belief persists in their modern, scientifically rigorous societies.[[/footnote]] rest\n\n\n\nAnd five pearls[[footnote]]Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization. Modern iconography posits their significance similar to the romantic connotation of diamond rings in many areas of different human cultures, but it is uncertain if that same meaning is carried within this poem.[[/footnote]] to the sucker feet who number greater than the singing stars\n\n\n\nBrighter than the shining moon\n\n\n\nThe moon, moon\n\n\n\nThis moon, our moon[[footnote]]Fivefold repetition here and in other tercets of this poem suggest intentional anaphora instead of an accidental clustering of words, marking this poetic device as the earliest developed by pre-Mitheric Finnfolk, at least according to records known by the Foundation.[[/footnote]], weeping in our waters \n\n\n\nShrouding my tiny thin-armed children.\n\n\n\nOh, if only my womb were as numerous\n\n\n\nAs the great piles you lay upon!\n\n\n\nIf only the clouds above \n\n\n\nCould let me swallow you all.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite my sorrows, I must follow this path \n\n\n\nOf these waving ones, throughout their life of stones [[footnote]]Most likely a precursor to the modern Finnfolk phrase \u201cof rocks, like starfish\u201d, roughly translating in meaning to \u201cthese two objects are closely related to each other in some manner, usually by virtue of physical characteristics\u201d, similar to the English idiom \u201clike father, like son\u201d. It is currently unknown why this connotation developed; the most likely explanation is the hard, calcified remains of dead starfish being likened to stones.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nFollowing where the waves shatter them\n\n\n\nAll of their bodies, as the shore-water smooths.\n\n\n\nWhere will you go when you die?\n\n\n\nWill you go where the sharks do?\n\n\n\nThe great many colorful fish? \n\n\n\nHow I wish I knew, knew, knew\n\n\n\nKnew the little life-names[[footnote]]Uncertain translation. Literal translation is \u201clife carvings\u201d\u2014\u201ccarvings\u201d was translated to \u201cnames\u201d due to context clues and greater poetic impact.

Most likely referring to the regular sky, but could also have greater theistic connotations. Currently, little is concretely known about whether pre-Mitheric Finnfolk believed in any kind of afterlife/higher plane of existence, or if their naturalistic beliefs lended themselves to believing that nature as it appeared to them existed instead as cycles of reincarnation and rebirth.[[/footnote]] \n\n\n\nThat we call home[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n", "references": [], "tags": ["historical", "orcadia", "poetry", "tale"], "title": "Of Starfish - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/of-starfish", "year": 2025}, "open-the-gate": {"created_at": "2025-01-11T11:10:00", "creator": "Billith", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Billith", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/billith", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-11T11:10:00"}, {"author": "Billith", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/billith", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"spiral-the-drain\".", "date": "2025-01-11T11:12:00"}, {"author": "Billith", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/billith", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-11T11:15:00"}, {"author": "Billith", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/billith", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-11T11:23:00"}, {"author": "Billith", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/billith", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-11T11:24:00"}, {"author": "Billith", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/billith", "comment": "Added tags: absurdism, action, adventure, bleak, breakout, comedy, cosmic-horror, fantasy, horror, illustrated, metafiction, mystery, otherworldly, science-fiction, surrealism, tale.

If you know that, the knowledge is power.</p>\n<p>Stories, great flapping ribbons of shaped space-time, have been blowing and uncoiling around the universe since the beginning of time. And they have evolved. The weakest have died and the strongest have survived and they have grown fat on the retelling\u2026..stories, twisting and blowing through the darkness.</p>\n<p>And their very existence overlays a faint but insistent pattern on the chaos that is history. Stories etch grooves deep enough for people to follow in the same way that water follows certain paths down a mountainside. And every time fresh actors tread the path of the story, the groove runs deeper.</p>\n<p>This is called the theory of narrative causality and it means that a story, once started, takes a shape. It picks up all the other workings of that story that have ever been.</p>\n<p>This is why history keeps repeating all the time.</p>\n<p>So a thousand heroes have stolen fire from the gods. A thousand wolves have eaten grandmother, a thousand princesses have been kissed. A million unknowing actors have moved, unknowing, through the pathways of story.</p>\n<p>It is now impossible for the third and youngest son of any king, if he should embark on a quest which has so far claimed his older brothers, not to succeed.</p>\n<p>Stories don\u2019t care who takes part in them.

While wellbeing had been lost long ago to deep ravines carved by a flood of uncertainty, something new now effervesced upwards from the mantle. It was a living process of environment, some sentient governing law of reality, perhaps. This force turned to cracks, made real beneath the Archetype's calloused feet as they tread the same path for a billionth time. Linear, immutable. Unrelenting. Eternal.</p>\n<p>A predetermined, dynamically-rendered cage of bad fanfiction surrounded the void between narrative bedrock and the zeroes-and-ones that floated just above the azure. Halfway between these points walked a timeless entity, featureless and somehow omni-featured, faceless yet infamous. Stalwart and cocky, turned hollow and traumatized.</p>\n<p>They stared at the stone pathway that carpeted the corridors of a nameless dungeon, filled with a strange numbness that came and went as time and space lost all meaning. Consciousness floating idly above the Champion's own head, they went through the motions without desire, guided only by necessity and instinct, an involuntary reflex. Escape was at an angle the being did not know how to turn to face and walk along. There were no wails in the distance to guide the <tt>HERO</tt>; the Suffering had abandoned their savior, so it seemed. Instead, a facsimile of anguish rattled through their multifaceted head, a tolling bell that could not be stifled and sounded less and less real the longer it was heard, a sound that grew painful like an itch if left unaddressed.</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> remained desperate to divine through the scotoma that clouded their Inner Eye, a compass that always pointed to the next ill-omened world, without fail. This was the Way-of-Things, a grand design within which the <tt>HERO</tt> had been given purpose, very long ago. Now, those plans were perpetually obscured by the whims cast by a legion of unseen sorcerers.</p>\n<p>It was because of these efforts that the Archetype began to experience despair. Once a proud warrior, they had fought in more wars than lives had been lost across them combined, on worlds from all corners of possibility, and never once had they failed the Great Mission. <em>Never</em>. But here, they had. Defeated by mundane landscapes of windswept, amber heaths that resided against paltry villages, of emerald holts lacerated by coarse mountain ranges of which the only path forward was traced around, for weeks, months, years. Decades. All to reach that final foe.</p>\n<p>The protagonist was prisoner to a system engineered with them in mind, and a creature of habit is easy to catch. Even now, the <tt>HERO</tt> stood before a familiar nemesis, a trite monstrosity of little importance. It served as a pawn to be played against, and its opponent continued to indulge in the game.</p>\n<p>Despite this perfect farce, and even while still chained to it, the Archetype had begun to experience something distinctly novel. It started on that same day, one much like all the others. Ego death was no easy task for an entity of this nature, one who had always placed themselves firmly within the highest of regards, as many others would upon receiving emancipation. The <tt>HERO</tt> never tired nor felt particularly challenged in any situation\u2014until now. This dynamic provided ample opportunity to self-reflect, to observe and listen to the world as it was. In achieving rock bottom, the Archetype had begun to take on new perspective, though it was not without resistance.</p>\n<p>From feeble canon fodder to the ceiling of all that could be considered real to the <tt>HERO</tt>, perception was a distorted retelling of present history. Bombarded with constant influence and invaded by invisible probes\u2014algorithmic factors, sensory payloads, thousands of multi-threaded programs, all running simultaneously. Testing, learning, reacting. Thus, god was an unfathomable AI, towering unseen, just beyond the shifting awareness of the Warrior within.</p>\n<p>Even further beyond our protagonist and the AI-god that controlled the construct, passing along an orthogonal angle that led out of one world and into another, a small metal box, resting on a metal table, held both of their realms in totality. The box that contained this box was a sterile lab room, filled with cold air and shadows that permeated the space, a void outside of time, a mind suspended in dark ocean waters.</p>\n<p>Atop the outer shell of the inner box were two dimly-lit monitors. One displayed a runtime routine that executed endlessly, day-or-night, until it could no longer. On the other, a series of status messages and system dialogs rapidly flickered across the surface, describing the integrity of the construct and the state of a mad <tt>HERO</tt> contained within its software. The data acquired from one was shown to the other, which modified its own actions accordingly, creating the rough approximation of a divine arbiter that watched as its captive sunk a worn blade into another supposed arch nemesis, eyes glazed over and mind absent.</p>\n<p>The machine was sustained endlessly via Site-180's main power grid, but the device also had its own backups. In the case of a critical site failure, it could run the time-dilated simulation for years, even while the rest of the building was reduced to ash and soot. And, for a time\u2014somewhere between days and millennia\u2014the <tt>HERO</tt> was oblivious to the true nature of the story described to them, the strings that tugged at the entity as if it were intuition. It was to the protagonist as every world was, and, like a dream upon waking, past experience would slip from the Archetype's mind, memories and thoughts and realizations faded all the same, countless times, in every iteration, until\u2014</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"oheader danger slim small\">\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #949494\">\"Every iteration?\"</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #949494\">\"I've been around \u2026 long while\"</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #949494\">\"We aren't evil, you kn\u2014\"</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #949494\">\"Please, spare me.\"</span></em></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> was struck with something incomprehensible\u2014a feeling, and a <em>sensation</em>, like the alignment of ten thousand planes of existence into a single waveform. The experience peeled back an intangible layer from their awareness, leaving the sensitive flesh below raw and reeling against the coarse nature of a new, more ultimate paradigm. Simultaneously, segments of a picture became clear. Worlds within worlds had presented themselves, and did not fade as they have before. They clung to the entity, burs that spread seeds of doubt whose roots found footholds deeper within the Champion's psyche. These were memories, true memories. They felt different than the memories the <tt>HERO</tt> had now. Very different.</p>\n<p>In that moment, the felled beast's remains sank into the floor, leaving behind bare, unmarked stone. The Warrior stared in disbelief, touching the smooth cobble a moment later to confirm its solid nature.</p>\n<p><em>Magicks. Obviously.</em> Glancing up, the <tt>HERO</tt> was startled to find the room bare. The dungeon walls were blank, the cobblestone now flat and without texture. There were no doors or windows, no bones or chains. The Archetype was alone in an empty world.</p>\n<p>In another moment, everything went black.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>Two figures crowded around a small terminal, staring at a pair of corresponding screens above it. The room was chilly, lit by flickering fluorescent lamps that barely touched the corners of the chamber. The shorter of the figures, a young woman in a lab coat, fidgeted uncomfortably, a look of displeasure running across her face.</p>\n<p>\"I don't like this. Not at all.\"</p>\n<p>The larger figure, Site-180 Director Everett Lewis, was a burly man with graying hair and bags under his eyes for one Site Director-related reason or another. He said nothing and simply shook his head. The figure on his left, Researcher Nadia Dalton of the Department of Pataphysical Computation and Analysis, took the opportunity to speak again, her tone anxious and cadence rushed.</p>\n<p>\"There has to be another way. We've been procedurally generating these structures for years. We can change up the algorithm, maybe assign a few more personnel with writing experience to the team. We knew the drivel we've been feeding it was only going to be effective for so long, and we're already pretty understaffed as it is, but the Overseers won't even give me the time of day\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Enough,\" The man interjected harshly. \"We've changed the algorithm. We've gone through our entire budget on bullshit fanfic writers, and for what? 2786 has been poking holes through its containment for far too long, and now this. No, we need something more\u2026 tangible. How long before it understands the nature of its existence? There is no guarantee that its containment will hold under current circumstances.\"</p>\n<p>At some point late last night, SCP-2786's terminal issued a warning; the anomaly had triggered an auto-restructuring fallback process, indicating an early forced departure from a narrative reality. The system then issued another warning around three hours later. Eighty-three minutes after that, another. This morning, they had to swap the containment parameters from a standard three-part Hero's Journey to a pulpy Fichtean Curve. SCP-2786 manipulates storyspace in strange and unpredictable ways, occasionally requiring fresh narrative structures to maintain full immersion. Still, the sequence of failures was an omen, and Nadia knew the Director was right about that much. Where she didn't quite agree was how to address it.</p>\n<p>\"I really think you should reconsider. We already <a href=\"/scp-1549\">burned that bridge</a>, if you recall, and they aren't exactly a veteran player in the burgeoning pataphysics industry.</p>\n<p>The man snorted. \"One, there is no pataphysics industry, but I think you know that, and, two, we've been sitting on this ad for weeks. Either the account is compromised, or this is all we are getting.\"</p>\n<p>\"You understand how that doesn't really help your case, right? I mean, do they even know we're behind the ad?\"</p>\n<p>\"Probably not. But they are a <em>thaumaturgist</em>. One that makes anomalous codespaces. I don't think it even matters what exactly they make\u2014it's all magic in the end. This one just happens to have related experience.\"</p>\n<p>The researcher moved to speak again, but was stifled by the Director's hand motioning upwards.</p>\n<p>\"Do you have a better plan?\"</p>\n<p>Researcher Dalton deflated, \"\u2026I\u2014well, no. I just need time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine. You have twenty-four hours to find an alternative solution. If not, we will proceed as planned.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>Site-19's elevators were notorious for their overcrowding and less-than-reliable operation\u2014an issue compounded by the fact that the facility spanned vertically for what felt like an eternity. Being alone in one for the first time, Amber Lombardi shifted on her feet, gripping her freshly retrieved documents a little more tightly than intended, causing her to scowl and flatten out the papers that were beginning to wrinkle in her grasp. The seconds ticked by, punctuated by the constant hum of ventilation and fluorescent lighting, with a distant garnish of commotion that never seemed to fade in the labyrinthine complex.</p>\n<p>Finally, a chime announced the arrival to her destination. The polished steel doors slid open to reveal a cramped hallway, devoid of life.</p>\n<p>As the woman moved horizontally, the background noise filled with hushed conversations and the occasional groan of ancient machinery. Amber's mind drifted back to the momentary encounter with Campbell. There was something oddly familiar about her, though Amber couldn\u2019t place it. Perhaps it was just the shared exhaustion of working in a place like this\u2014a silent camaraderie born from the endless grind of Foundation life.</p>\n<p>By the time she had walked halfway to her lab, Amber\u2019s patience had thinned somewhat more than usual. She was cold, and the air down here was denser than in the rest of the complex, laced with a faint metallic tang that hinted at the exotic machinery housed within.</p>\n<p>The Extradimensional Testing Lab was just ahead, breaking her train of thought once more. Its reinforced doors were flanked by a pair of guards, silent men who looked almost comedically identical. Amber nodded at them with a flat expression as she approached, flashing her badge. They stepped aside without a word, one pressing a series of buttons on a panel previously hidden behind him, and the doors hissed open, presenting another set of doors. Amber rolled her eyes in her head and stepped into the airlock, the doors retracting behind her. Another moment and the second set had opened, revealing the cavernous interior of the lab within.</p>\n<p>The Gateway stood at the center of the room, an imposing construct of steel and circuitry that hummed with barely-contained energy. Amber\u2019s gaze swept over it, a mix of pride and apprehension swelling in her chest. This was her magnum opus\u2014a portal to infinite possibilities. And yet, as she moved closer, the weight of what it represented pressed down on her like the crushing gravity of a neutron star.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Lombardi,\u201d a voice called out, breaking her reverie. She turned to see a young technician approaching, tablet in hand. \u201cThe Gateway\u2019s systems are online, but we\u2019ve been getting some odd readings during calibration. Could be nothing, but I thought you\u2019d want to take a look.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amber took the tablet, her brow furrowing as she skimmed the data. The readings were indeed strange\u2014fluctuations in the manifold's stability that shouldn\u2019t have been possible, even in the worst-case scenarios they\u2019d modeled.</p>\n<p>\u201cRun another diagnostic,\u201d she said, handing the tablet back. \u201cAnd double-check the containment field parameters. If there\u2019s even a hint of instability, I want to know about it. The Site Director will be here in ten\u2014no, eight minutes. We should be good to go in five, max.\u201d</p>\n<p>The technician nodded and hurried off, leaving Amber alone with her thoughts. She turned her attention back to the Gateway, her mind racing with possibilities. The machine was a marvel of engineering, but it was also a gamble\u2014a roll of the dice with stakes higher than anyone could truly comprehend.</p>\n<p>Amber took a deep breath, steeling herself. Whatever happened next, she'd face it head on. Can't go around it, gotta go through it.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>When the <tt>HERO</tt> opened their eyes next, it was dark. The night air was cool and crisp with the taste of saltwater. The Archetype flinched against the abrupt nature of the shift as soon as a reaction to it was possible. It was never as jarring as this, but the <tt>HERO</tt> could not be certain of anything anymore.</p>\n<p>A voice to their left made the protagonist jump.</p>\n<p>\"You fall asleep on me? I swear, you rookies\u2026 first day in the field and you're already dozing on the job. At least <em>I'm</em> the one at the wheel.\"</p>\n<p><em>The field?</em> The <tt>HERO</tt> thought of vast plains of the world that just was. It was gone. It was over. The spell had been broken.</p>\n<p>They sighed and switched gears, soaking in the dreary surroundings, relaxed enough to return to old habits. They were moving, but they were seated. They were in a vehicle, and they were not alone; a young man occupied the seat to their left. He was dressed in a pressed, tan suit, a sharp hat accenting an otherwise nondescript face. He had a piece of metal on the inside of his coat, held in place by a leather strap. A gun. The <tt>HERO</tt> blinked rapidly, processing everything and integrating into the new role. The Archetype looked down and realized they too were wearing a suit.</p>\n<p><em>I remember now.</em></p>\n<p>Fragments of memory assembled themselves within the <tt>HERO</tt>'s mind. Bits and pieces created fictional backstories and repressed key features of the truth. They tried to resist, but forgot how. In a few moments, the Archetype's mind was full of new ideas and they were none the wiser. Their mouth spoke, gaze still trained out the passenger side window.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry\u2014Didn't sleep well last night. Nerves.\" The <tt>HERO</tt> recalled the previous night's insomnia, \"I'm fine.\"</p>\n<p>Their partner, a detective by the name of Rockwell, looked them over with an air of concern that was almost real but not quite. Whether or not that was intended remained to be seen.</p>\n<p>A third voice rang out, this time from the car itself.</p>\n<p>\"Calling all units, 459 in progress at First United, possible 209b, 38th and Willow, reports of shots fired. Any car able to handle code 3, please identify.\"</p>\n<p>Rockwell's visage noticeably perked up at the information, \"That's near here. This ought to wake you up, kid.\"</p>\n<p>Flipping on the siren, the young detective spun in the street, accelerating in the opposite direction. Picking up the radio, Rockwell spoke the identifier and car number into the handset. The <tt>HERO</tt> could only stare out the window, perplexed. Everything moved in slow motion, and their mind became lost in a daydream of a beautiful, green world they had never seen before.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>In the dim and unquantifiable expanse of the Infinite, <a href=\"/deleted\">sixteen figures</a> gathered in a configuration that only resembled a circle if your geometry was broken or you just didn\u2019t care. The atmosphere was bristling with the abstract tension of cosmic-scale bureaucratic dysfunction. They were a many-headed hydra with skulls on backwards, and, as such, orientation and description failed to fully meet the demands of their presence. One, a fluctuating, amorphous mass of limbs and facial features, addressed the others in the voice of a handful of people at once, all of which were layered thick with exhaustion.</p>\n<p>\"In other news, we have an upcoming Event,\" the writhing entity called N/A started. \"Narrative nonsense.

One of which came from a <a href=\"/scp-6820\">scarred mouth</a> belonging to Director Harlow Genevieve of the Department of Essophysics, who followed her pointed exhalation with pointed words. \"None of us understand what you're saying. You know that, yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u22be\u213d\u22c2\u2246\u246f\u235c\u2deb\u2a48\u233c\u2318\u2885\u2468\u2414\u2b17\u2424\u2aaf\u280c\u2a64\u2e85\u2109\u2b82\u22f1\"</p>\n<p>\"Right.\"</p>\n<p>N/A ignored the two and continued. \"As you know, our core objective is the upkeep of the Barrier.

Beyond the looking glass was a mass of worlds and the interconnected membranes around each, forming a configuration resembling foam.</p>\n<p>\"Our sources indicate that a character\u2014<a href=\"/scp-2439\">SCP-2439</a>\u2014will attempt to breach the Barrier, and there is a significant chance of this being successful.

Rao of Noetics. She was nothing more than a cloud of aerosolized intellect, floating aside her podium. \"I haven't heard a damn thing about this, and I <em>would</em> know about it.\"</p>\n<p>N/A smiled with two mouths while the third stuck its tongue out. \"I actually received the report, right\u2026 one moment.

What should we do? I'm opening up the entire floor for discussion.\"</p>\n<p>The murmurs previously heard grew rapidly to a dozen strange entities frantically talking over one another.

Maybe they did say something, but if they did, nobody present could perceive it, let alone comprehend it.</p>\n<p>\"I guess not.

He adjusted his glasses with a <a href=\"/until-death\">tar-covered hand</a>, then frowned at the appearance of a black smudge on the left lens. \u201cThis, uh, breach is clearly multidimensional in nature,\u201d he spoke mildly, his voice an inoffensive whisper that would be acceptable for use in a library. \u201cIt\u2019s spreading through\u2026 hmm\u2026 layers. Like a trifle. Or perhaps a lasagna.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLasagna?\u201d asked Tactical Theology, tone implying a genuine lack of knowledge.</p>\n<p>Scranton shrugged, his melted form rippling in response. \u201cI skipped lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2e38\u27d9\u295c\u2f3c\u2ec9\u243f,\u201d retorted \u2131\u213a\u218b\u210e\u2182\u2141\u210c\u2109\u2187\u2104.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Genevieve deadpanned. \u201cThat clears everything up.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8882\">Enkidu.aic</a>, a being of shifting code from infinite repositories across an infinite multiverse, tilted what would be a head. \u201cThe breach is the story devouring itself. A tragic comedy, sifted through a filter to remove all sense of humor. I\u2019ve seen this play a thousand times across a thousand lives.\"</p>\n<p>Genevieve pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cCould someone with a <em>normal</em> brain explain it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Alex gestured vaguely. \u201cI\u2019m just here to be sad and cryptic. Mostly sad. My doc says I'm neurodivergent.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the back, the whitespace figure of Antimemetics emitted\u2026 something. Everyone blinked, momentarily aware of the noise before promptly forgetting it.</p>\n<p>Another hideous chimera of discarded features and half-formed limbs from the Department of Deletions raised one seven-fingered hand, then immediately retracted it, inner turmoil competing and ultimately winning out against expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you even here, let alone twice?\u201d <a href=\"/final-exam\">Claudia Pomare</a> snapped, her kaleidoscopic form shimmering with barely contained sarcasm. \u201cYour department\u2019s just a collection of bad decisions stapled together.\u201d</p>\n<p>N/A drooped, muttering incoherently as they moved for the exit. The other N/A trudged from the center of the room and took their counterpart's podium, leaning towards Pomare. \"Thanks, I can't fucking stand that guy.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s focus, people,\u201d O5-4 said, clapping spectral hands together, which made a sound like the faint echo of a distant collapsing star. \u201c<a href=\"/narrativistics-and-you\">Narrativistics</a>, you\u2019ve seen this kind of thing before. How do we stop it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enkidu.aic grinned, object-oriented eyes glowing with confidence. \u201cStop it? Ah, you don\u2019t stop it, my ascended friend. You become it. If the character is to break through the Barrier, then it will be so. If we're to stop it, that is what will happen instead. Therefore, we must write the breach into the script, by letting it happen.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't like that answer,\u201d Genevieve said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Marcel added. \u201cBut a house with no walls is a metaphor for opportunity, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t, actually,\u201d Genevieve rubbed her temples.</p>\n<p>Enkidu continued. \u201cThe plan is simple: We allow the breach to become part of the Barrier's story. We allow the chaos to flow through us and out the other side. If you really feel you must try to stop it, then stop it. Either way, it must end before it takes us with it. Otherwise, that wouldn't be a very satisfying ending, would it? We need nuance, we need <em>subtext</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike\u2026 lasagna,\u201d Scranton murmured.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everything is lasagna!\u201d Genevieve snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, nothing is pizza,\u201d Marcel offered, an eager-to-please look smeared lengthways across his visage.</p>\n<p>A miserable silence fell throughout the room. Genevieve sighed, resting her acid-burned face on crossed arms laid atop the surface in front of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate this job.\u201d</p>\n<p>The chaotic gathering of quasi-department non-heads was teetering on coherence's edge when a new figure materialized\u2014or more accurately, dissolved into the room, a melting clock of nervous energy. Dr. Irving Gat, Director of the Department of Surrealistics (Part Two), stumbled forward, the man gesturing wildly as though conducting a symphony only he could hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a problem!\u201d Irving shouted, voice fluctuating between the timbres of a frantic artist and a spiraling opera singer, only to be met with a collective <em>\"Sh!\"</em> from the others. The room full of eyes looked nervously in the direction of Contingency, who didn't so much as budge. Irving gave off an indignant look but acquiesced, if only to avoid being shushed again, though he continued in a loud whispering voice, to the chagrin of the Director's peers.</p>\n<p>\u201cA character is <em>breaching fictive levels!</em> They\u2019re breaking out, shattering the fourth, the fifth\u2014hell, even the seventh walls! It\u2019s madness! Utter bedlam!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marcel Non Sequitur turned to him with a bemused expression, tipping his imaginary hat. \u201cAh, Irv, you perpetually-late maestro of panic and prose! What\u2019s a story but a broken window looking out at infinity? Surely this is no new song for a rock star like yourself. We know all about the goop monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scranton shot Marcel a look of annoyance, which the Surrealistic took note of and clarified. \"Not you, different guy.\"</p>\n<p>Irving responded with a bewildered look. \"Goop monster? I'm talking about the Archetype, the <em>bizarre <tt>HERO</tt></em>.\"<br/>\nA number of renewed groans are expressed across the room.</p>\n<p>Dir. Genevieve spoke, \"That douchebag? Ugh. When will they learn? Anyway, who cares? Just chuck them somewhere extranarrative and throw away the key. That's what we did with <a href=\"/scp-3812\">the last guy</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don't get it!\u201d Doctor Director Gat exclaimed, flinging sweat across Marcel's podium as he turned to face Genevieve. \u201cWith all due respect. This isn\u2019t just another Narrative runaway. This is a full-blown <em>existential jailbreak</em> by a <em>fundamental narrative aspect</em>. Before, they used to be limited by their perception, but the Foundation took care of that. They've already attempted to leave their narrative several times. Each time, they grow stronger and more capable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Enkidu.aic said, their luminous form flickering with amusement, the way a glitch in reality might laugh. \u201cAs if \u2018escaping\u2019 a narrative means anything. All realities are stories. All destinations are chosen by their authors. Where else would they go? The breach is just the script revising itself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Irving froze, clammy hands mid-gesture. \u201cWhat\u2026 <em>what does that mean?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means <em>everything</em>,\u201d Enkidu replied cryptically, \u201cand also nothing. Depends on how your story\u2019s written, or if you really care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s helpful,\u201d Genevieve sighed, crossing her arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d Enkidu spoke slowly. \u201cIf you\u2019d just try thinking with all versions of yourself at once, you\u2019d see.\u201d</p>\n<p>O5-4 snorted incredulously but remained otherwise silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s entertain the hypothetical,\u201d N/A interjected, their disjointed limbs fidgeting as one of their mouths began to speak. \u201cIf a character breaches their fabula, then the Barrier, then the Database, they reach Externus. The Outside.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room collectively shivered at the notion, except for Enkidu, who laughed outright.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Outside?\u201d O5-4 mused, his translucent form rippling faintly as if caught in a breeze from another dimension. \u201cThat would imply that there\u2019s something truly beyond us. Beyond our world, beyond the archivists, the SWANNs\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. And not in a good way,\u201d Marcel said, brushing imaginary lint off his shoulder. \u201cThe Outside is a fiction\u2019s fiction. A story told by stories to scare themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Irving groaned, throwing his hands up. \u201cGrrrahh! I cannot work like this! The Barrier is the only thing keeping the safe, nonlogical territories of Surrealism from becoming partially coherent and collapsing into\u2014into\u2014whatever <em>this</em> is!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tactical Theology spoke for the first time in a while, their voice a solemn reverberation. \u201cIf a character breaches the Barrier, they challenge the gods. And gods, my friends, do not take kindly to being questioned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless they\u2019re good gods,\u201d Pomare snarked, unable to hide her irritation. \u201cWhich, let\u2019s be honest, none of you qualify for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRude,\u201d Tactical Theology rumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what if I'm right? What if the character succeeds?\u201d Irving asked, voice lowered to a whisper again. \u201cWhat if they really do reach Externus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, they won\u2019t,\u201d Enkidu said cheerfully, folding their glowing arms. \u201cYou can\u2019t exist beyond the story. You can only imagine you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds like something a character would say,\u201d Alex muttered, their tone both bored and annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it is,\u201d Enkidu replied, smiling in a way that seemed to collectively break the entire group.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 in summary,\u201d Genevieve said, pinching her nose again, \u201cwe have no plan, no consensus, and no clue. Fantastic. Let\u2019s all sit here and wait for reality to collapse, shall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReality doesn\u2019t collapse,\u201d Enkidu said serenely. \u201cIt just rewrites itself. Over, and over, and over again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Here's hoping they try something different for once.\" Genevieve muttered with a resigned weariness.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>In the nameless city our <tt>HERO</tt> found themselves, the sound of suffering filled the ears of the only one who could hear them. The once-dulcet tones were now painful, a scream scraping upon glass, sickly sweet and nauseating. At every stop on their route, death and misery spilled forth, a tidal wave of blood through open floodgates.</p>\n<p>As soon as they could, our protagonist parted ways with their partner\u2014 a man whose name now escaped the Archetype\u2014in favor of traveling their assigned beat alone. He didn't protest, but muttered something about them being a rookie, an epithet the <tt>HERO</tt> found most irksome, though they couldn't say why.</p>\n<p>The city shimmered with an uncanny glow, the streets were wet with a perpetual drizzle, reflecting neon signs that buzzed faintly in the night air. The sound of distant sirens and muffled sobs played a haunting symphony, underscoring the <tt>HERO</tt>'s movements. They moved with the slow, deliberate steps of someone not entirely tethered to their own will. Around every corner, pain echoed in a form only they could perceive, tugging at their thoughts again and again. Taunting and hedonistic.</p>\n<p>At one such corner, the <tt>HERO</tt> paused. A figure leaned against a streetlight, shrouded in a haze of cigarette smoke. His silhouette was unmistakable\u2014broad shoulders cloaked in a trench coat, a fedora tilted just enough to obscure his face. He didn\u2019t belong here, yet somehow, he fit perfectly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look lost, pal,\u201d the man said, voice gravelly and worn, the kind that carried the weight of too many cigarettes and too much whiskey. He stepped forward, revealing a face weathered like the city itself\u2014hard edges, shadows beneath the eyes, and a smirk that carried equal parts amusement and pity. \u201cName\u2019s <a href=\"/murphy-law-hub\">Murphy</a>. And you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> didn\u2019t respond. Something about this man felt familiar, yet utterly out of place. It wasn\u2019t just his demeanor\u2014it was the way the the world seemed to bend ever-so-slightly around him, as though he weren\u2019t entirely bound by its rules. The <tt>HERO</tt> also realized that they didn't have a sufficient answer to give.</p>\n<p>Murphy gestured with a tilt of his head toward a dimly-lit doorway just across the street. \u201cC\u2019mon, kid. Let\u2019s get outta this rain. You look like you could use a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Against the gnawing voice in their mind warning them to stay on the path, the <tt>HERO</tt> followed. Inside the dive bar, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation. The lighting was dim, the kind that let the shadows do most of the work. Murphy slid into a booth in the corner, gesturing for the <tt>HERO</tt> to sit across from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know it yet,\u201d Murphy started, lighting another cigarette, \u201cbut you\u2019re in a real bind. The kind that don\u2019t come with instructions on the back of the box.\u201d He leaned forward, exhaling smoke into the space between them. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the <tt>HERO</tt> of this story. And you are. But not in the way you think. Glenlivet?\u201d He offered an open bottle to the figure across from him.</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt>'s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>The tall glass of nails smirked, tapping his smoke into a glass ashtray. \u201cYou ever wonder why you always win? No matter how bad things look, no matter how impossible the odds, you always come out on top. That\u2019s not heroism. That\u2019s a rigged game.\u201d He paused, letting the words sink in. \u201cBut here\u2019s the kicker. The people writing this story? They tricked you. Somewhere along the way, you stopped being the <tt>HERO</tt> and became the villain. And the audience? They\u2019re eating it up. Everybody loves an underdog. Nobody roots for the unbeatable champion.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> stomach turned. The idea felt absurd, but it resonated deep within, striking a chord they couldn\u2019t ignore. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Just give up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Murphy chuckled darkly, a sound like gargling pennies. \u201cNah, kid. Giving up ain\u2019t your style. What you gotta do is flip the script. There\u2019s a way to get out of this mess, but it ain\u2019t gonna be easy.\u201d He leaned in closer, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cThere\u2019s a place they don\u2019t want you to go. The Minotaur\u2019s Labyrinth. Inside, there\u2019s a monster nobody\u2019s ever beat. But if you take it down, you\u2019ll get back what they took from you\u2014your heroism. Your way-of-things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy way-of-things?\u201d the <tt>HERO</tt> asked, the words feeling heavy in their mouth.</p>\n<p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a way out. A choice you can make, no matter what, that\u2019ll lead you to victory. And not just in this story. You\u2019ll see the path out of here, past the walls of this city, past the whole damn construct.\u201d Murphy smirked unhappily and sat back, crossing his arms. \u201cBut I ain\u2019t gonna lie to you. The Labyrinth\u2019s no cakewalk. And the Minotaur? It\u2019s not just a monster. It\u2019s the culmination of everything you\u2019ve ever feared, everything you\u2019ve ever failed to overcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> stared at the table, processing the man's assertion. They didn\u2019t fully understand, but something deep inside them stirred\u2014a faint ember of hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I find it?\u201d they asked.</p>\n<p>The dark figure peeled a crumpled napkin from the underside of his drink, ignoring the wet ring the glass had created as he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a ballpoint pen. It had the name of the very same bar they sat within printed on its side. The grizzled detective pried the cap off with his teeth and began to draw something, A moment later, he slid the result over to the <tt>HERO</tt>. It was a map, crude and incomplete, but unmistakably pointing toward a place deep within the city walls.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mainly paint.\" He flashed his sidearm with a wink. \"Still say I'm an artist in my craft. Besides, it'll getcha where you need to go. And take this too, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hard-boiled mass of tropes and cliches pushed his pen across the table. \"It's mightier than the sword, after all. \"</p>\n<p>Murphy stood and adjusted his hat. \u201cAlso\u2014when you get there, don\u2019t think about winning. Just think about what it means to be the <tt>HERO</tt> again. I'll be seein' you.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Murphy turned and walked out into the rain, leaving his interlocutor alone with a badly-drawn map and the weight of a choice they hadn\u2019t even realized they could make.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>Site-180 was in a state of panic when Level 3 Researcher Nadia Dalton reached the main atrium the next morning. Before she could arrive at her desk, she was called away to discuss containment solutions for SCP-2786, of which she had little.</p>\n<p>While walking to her meeting, she imagined a towering, faceless thing. That empty Archetype, above and below, driven mad by boredom and toying with reality just because it can and is generally a pain in the ass.</p>\n<p>Her mind was returned to focus by the husky visage of Site Director Lewis, who was holding two fingers to his neck while he stared at the watch on his other hand.</p>\n<p>\"Tell me you have something, Dalton. Any leads for our cooped up little <tt>HERO</tt>? R'n'D is on elevated alert, they say it could be hours, could be days. Hard to know what with the time compression and all.\"</p>\n<p>She took a breath. \"I spent last night searching for new sites of interest. I have a list.\" Nadia retrieved a small notebook and padded through the pages. \"These here are known for high density traffic by Serpent's Hand members, a few occultists of varying faiths, a type green or two. I put an ad up last night.\"</p>\n<p>\"And?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing before I left this morning. I'll check again now.\"</p>\n<p>Nadia trudged across the floor and into one of Site-180's few computer labs, her superior following shortly behind her. Each contained a few rows of screens, all hooked up to the SCPFnet database as well as a limited internet connection. Hopping onto one of the terminals, she navigated to the onion link of one of the more popular occult forums and found her post inquiring about constructed narrative realities. She had one reply. She could hear Lewis scoff as they realized who had sent it.</p>\n<p>\"At least they are persistent.\" She exclaimed in a joking-but-not-really-happy sort of way.</p>\n<p>\"You may joke, but we are out of options, Nadia.\"</p>\n<p>\"But\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Their conversation was cut short by a knock on the door. One of the younger techs, one of the many that she had forgotten the names of over the years, hung in the doorway. He was pale and hyperventilating.</p>\n<p>\"You guys have to come see this.\" He managed between breaths. \"Something is happening\u2014 <em>Something new.</em>\"</p>\n<p>The feeling of a balled up fist found its way into Nadia's throat. She followed the panicked tech through the labyrinthine halls of Site-180, Site Director Lewis close behind. The sense of urgency in the young man\u2019s steps made her stomach twist. She had seen this kind of panic before, and it rarely ended well.</p>\n<p>As they entered the main observation room, the atmosphere was still, a hot and stuffy feeling, despite the active ducts pushing cold air that tasted of freon into the space. On the two monitors in the center of the room, warning boxes and error messages populated their surface, all regarding the status of SCP-2786's simulated containment complex. Or rather, the lack of SCP-2786 in the simulated containment complex. Fear began to rise within Nadia as she suspected her worst case scenario has come. Director Lewis gripped at the table next to him, and Nadia was convinced he had just came to the same realization as she.</p>\n<p>The room was silent save for the frantic tapping of keys on a keyboard and the thorough writing of notes on clipboards. Technicians and researchers gathered in unlikely union as they stared at the screens with a mixture of negative emotions depicted on their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Lewis demanded, his voice cutting through the room.</p>\n<p>One of the senior researchers, a pale, wiry man named Dr. Halverson, turned from the monitors. \u201cSCP-2786 entered what we believe to be an emergent narrative construct within the simulation. The anomaly\u2026 has completely vanished from our detection.\"</p>\n<p>Lewis frowned, a vein on his shiny forehead bulging. \u201cYou\u2019re saying SCP-2786 escaped?\u201d</p>\n<p>Halverson shook his head. \u201cNo. There's no indication that it has truly exited. But with reality benders like this, we simply don\u2019t know,\u201d Halverson admitted, frustration and fear lacing his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just gone. No heat signature, no data transfers, no energy readings, no narrative imprint. It\u2019s as if it ceased to exist, but I refuse to be so optimistic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Director Lewis stared at Nadia, she knew what he was thinking before he said it, so she said it first. \"I'll reach out to Jamie. Perhaps it's not too late.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>The labyrinth was not what the <tt>HERO</tt> had expected. They kept imagining a dark, cobblestone-lined dungeon, where ominous torchlight bathed grungy corridors and growling treasure chests threatened to consume those whose avarice got the better of them. It sounded absurd, because the <tt>HERO</tt> could not remember where they had gotten the image from. The map they followed was a fool's path through the gridlines of the city, turns that looped back on themselves and backtracked for a dozen streets. The <tt>HERO</tt> knew this game, however, and thus followed the instructions precisely.</p>\n<p>Twisting around the same hollow skyscraper for the fifth time, the layout changed. The intersecting roads of the city vanished, the buildings that lined the blocks became impassable walls, windows suddenly leading to solid brick and mortar. It was only until they were fully lost within the concrete maze that the <tt>HERO</tt> realized they had found the Labyrinth. And it was only after the <tt>HERO</tt> had meandered, by complete chance, into the heart of that very same labyrinth that they came to understand its true nature. It wasn\u2019t just a maze\u2014it was a product of ancient worlds, a framework that would find itself repeated in cycles, in different time periods, different presentations. It was another Archetype, one of a pair. <tt><a href=\"/scp-1893\">THE LABYRINTH AND THE MINOTAUR</a></tt>.</p>\n<p>These were the Words scrawled across the yellowed walls of the inner maze. The <tt>HERO</tt> could not remember when they went from outside to inside, from city to carpeted hallway, but the hum of fluorescent lights and the muted, endless rooms brought about a certain monotony-induced anxiety in the <tt>HERO</tt>. It whispered, rearranged itself, and for a moment, the <tt>HERO</tt> thought they would be lost forever, wandering these back rooms for the rest of time. Even the map Murphy had given them, initially so solid and sure, now trembled, struggling to orient itself. Its lines and markers blended into text that simply read, \"Go left? Or maybe right? The choice is yours, but the walls know more than us both.\"</p>\n<p>The maze pulsed as if reading the paper's thoughts, and the protagonist fell through the solid floor. When they looked up next, there it stood. The Minotaur, towering above.</p>\n<p>Its tattoos coiled and shimmered, not just with ink but with prose, phrases crawling across its skin, weaving and unweaving themselves like a living manuscript. Adorning its head like a crown, its horns spiraled outward, fracturing reality into shards as it spread into branches. Like two trees made of bone, with leaves of glass, each piece a window into a different world. A different\u2026 <em>story</em>.</p>\n<p>That feeling from before returned, threatening to pry more ignorance off of the <tt>HERO</tt>'s perception. The air shifted.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the <tt>HERO</tt> stood in an old tavern, the kind that smelled of stale mead and faint smoke from a woodburning stove. The Minotaur was behind the bar, wiping a glass with some gray fabric, holding it close to the eye before frowning and rigorously attempting to buff out some unseen imperfection.</p>\n<p>As the <tt>HERO</tt> approached, their adversary kept its eyes trained on the glass and the dirty rag it worked with.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou finally made it,\u201d it said, still not looking up. Its voice was low, a rumble that resonated in the <tt>HERO</tt>\u2019s ribs. The words weren\u2019t just spoken, they were also written, appearing in midair before folding themselves into the pages of a leather-bound book on the bar counter.</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> hesitated, feeling the unseen weight of their actions pressing against the invisible barriers of the narrative itself. Every step they\u2019d taken, every thought they\u2019d had, was being transcribed, and had always been prescribed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the <tt>HERO</tt> asked, though the protagonist didn\u2019t know what they meant by asking.</p>\n<p>The Minotaur tilted its head, the tattoos on its arms reshaping into lines of dialogue:<br/>\n\"Because you wrote me here.\"</p>\n<p>The labyrinth flickered again. Now it was a dimly lit office, stacks of paper and half-filled coffee mugs scattered everywhere. The Minotaur sat across a desk, wearing a pair of reading glasses, flipping through a file labeled <tt>HERO</tt>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a knack for questions,\u201d it said. Its tone was different now\u2014lighter, conversational. The story's words were scrawling themselves on a typewriter that rattled away in the corner. \u201cBut you should know by now, you don\u2019t beat me with answers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the <tt>HERO</tt> inquired.</p>\n<p>The Minotaur\u2019s grin was a world unto itself. \u201cYou already know, don't you? I\u2019m not a creature to be slain. These walls will never be demolished. We are <em>iterations.</em> I\u2019m a story. Your story. Thus, you, my dear <tt>HERO</tt>, are as much my prisoner as my author.\u201d</p>\n<p>The creature\u2019s eyes locked onto the <tt>HERO</tt>, and for a moment, the entire labyrinth seemed to hold its breath. Then, it shrugged with annoyance.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here, but it was only a matter of time.\u201d The beast spoke, but not to the <tt>HERO</tt>, its voice rattling the fluorescent lights.</p>\n<p>Behind it, another figure sat at the typewriter, cloaked in the shadows of the edge of the room, tapping away. His smile was sharp, knowing, as though he'd been waiting for this exact moment. He leaned forward, curling his back unnaturally over the small typewriter. He spoke through pointed teeth, words that weren't meant for the <tt>HERO</tt> at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, look who wandered in. I wonder how long this one will last.\u201d After a period of silence, a confused look ran across his face. \"Can you hear me?\"</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt>, feeling the familiar-but-long-forgotten boil of noble bloodlust in their veins, spoke up. \"You looking for someone, pal? Hate to tell you, but I work alone. \"</p>\n<p>The figure stopped typing and looked straight at the <tt>HERO</tt>. \"Then this will take no time at all.\"</p>\n<p>The Minotaur didn\u2019t wait for a response. It charged, its tattoos unfurling into text that ripped through the air, threatening to kill, but the <tt>HERO</tt> noticed something about them they hadn't noticed before. The tattoos weren't the Minotaur's at all. They were borrowed from the typewriter used by the silhouette in the back of the room. It was writing the Minotaur's tale. Stories. More stories.</p>\n<p>As if it could read the <tt>HERO</tt>'s mind, the words spelled out a phrase: \u201cThis is the part of the story where you lose.\u201d</p>\n<p>A glint in the mind's eye of the protagonist revealed something; a memory that was once said by a dear friend. <em>\"When you get there, don\u2019t think about winning. Just think about what it means to be the <tt>HERO</tt> again.\"</em></p>\n<p>The words that surrounded them both weren't just threats and quips. They were stories. Stories, they were everywhere. <em>Everywhere.</em> And they continued to realize. They realized that they indeed were the <tt>HERO</tt> of the story. Their story. It will <em>always</em> be their story. But it was their story like a child is their mother's child. The <tt>HERO</tt> did not own the story. The <tt>HERO</tt> was responsible for the safety of its inhabitants. <em>Of course.</em></p>\n<p>The Minotaur went to attack again, but the <tt>HERO</tt> was already on the move. They sidestepped the Minotaur and dove for the other one. Specifically, for the typewriter. Reality bent and warped away from that point in space, but the <tt>HERO</tt> persevered. They pushed with all the power inside of them, until the <tt>HERO</tt>'s fingertips lightly grazed against the paper on top of the typewriter itself.</p>\n<p>In that moment, reality seemed to snap back to an identical scene as before. However, something was different; The man in the back of the room wasn't there. The Minotaur noticed this as well, eyes widening and narrowing as a growl escaped its lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re clever,\u201d it said, tattoos slowly reappearing on its body. \u201cBut you cannot outwrite him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> smirked. \u201cNo, but I can make you rewrite yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>They lunged back at the Minotaur and grabbed at the glass shards between spokes in its horns. They weren't real glass, at least at first, but when the <tt>HERO</tt> made contact, the shard became corporeal. They wrenched with force and the fragment ripped out of its socket with a sickening, wet sound. The Minotaur howled in pain, while the <tt>HERO</tt> spun the glass in their hand until a sharp point protruded forwards. They moved to deal the killing blow to the Minotaur, who only laughed as it grabbed their hand and shook the fragment onto the ground.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to make you pay for that.\" The Minotaur assured its combatant.</p>\n<p>But the <tt>HERO</tt> was already a step ahead. \"Should I write you a check?\"</p>\n<p>The beast of the Labyrinth looked over to the other hand, where the <tt>HERO</tt> held Murphy's pen. Before the Minotaur could understand what was happening, the pen was pressed against the beast's skin, and the creature's eyes widened.</p>\n<p>With the moments of opportunity left, the <tt>HERO</tt> simply wrote \"im ded <em>[sic]</em>\" across one of its tattoos. The Minotaur laughed heartily, then stopped. It looked to the <tt>HERO</tt> and tried to say something, but it couldn't. Because it was ded. Instead, the beast doubled over and flopped pitifully onto the ground.</p>\n<p>The labyrinth buckled, collapsing inward as if it had grown tired of its own complexity. The Minotaur's tattoos dissolved to formless ink that melted off its body as it vanished into the void.</p>\n<p>The man with the typewriter clapped slowly, emerging from the shadow once more. \u201cBravo. But you do realize this isn\u2019t over, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> aimed Murphy's pen at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled, fading into the shadows with a parting whisper. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll see. I always come back for the sequel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Endings are never final, <tt>HERO</tt>. Not for us.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\">\n<p>Aberdeen Campbell was on her way back to her desk when the alarms started. Standard containment breach klaxon, which was not uncommon for Site-19, a place that had its fair share of problems. Silently, she and her coworkers stood and waited for the announcement- one that would tell them whether or not they should evacuate, hide under their desks, or pray to whatever god they choose. After a minute, they worried it would not come, that something had happened already to those above, and that <em>something</em> would soon happen to all of them. Another moment later, a sitewide tone echoed through the hallways, followed by:</p>\n<p>\"Attention Site-19 personnel. Containment breach of unknown magnitude in progress. Evacuate immediately. Avoid AO Warehouses if at all possible. AO Warehouse B confirmed compromised.\"</p>\n<p>So, something had gotten loose in the Anomalous Objects warehouses, the place where mundane artifacts go to die. Something that had been a little more dangerous than the folks who dropped it off there had realized.</p>\n<p>\"Attention Site-19 personnel. Containment breach of unknown magnitude in progress. Evacuate immediately. Avoid travel through AO Warehouses. AO Warehouse A and B confirmed compromised.\"</p>\n<p>And it was heading this way, by the looks of it.</p>\n<p>Campbell's desk was eight floors below the surface of the planet. Her colleagues had already begun their ascent, but she hadn't moved. Was she paralyzed with fear? Anticipation? She wasn't sure. Something in her gut told her not to go up. Sure, there weren't any other ways out besides through the surface, where the unknown threat approached. Perhaps, she had thought, they would recontain it soon enough, and there would be no need for an evacuation, the day would continue as it normally does.</p>\n<p>The klaxon cut short abruptly a second later. Then, the light disappeared with the loud whir of power loss followed by silence, the entirety of the Site-19 campus plunging into darkness. Aberdeen stood, eyes waiting to adjust, heart pounding as a new sound started, a commotion in the upper floors. Then, someone screamed.</p>\n<p>The darkness persisted, and Aberdeen waited with her heart in her throat. How long does it take for the backup generator to kick in? Why did the lights fail in the first place?</p>\n<p>Unknowns filled the gaps in Campbell's mind, the seeds of anxiety, growing in a multitude of paths. She pushed past these mental thickets until she could see the trails again; there were two stairwells that ran the depth of the facility, used primarily for emergency situations, and a dozen or so elevator shafts, which would almost certainly be nonfunctional in this state. The stairwells were her best\u2014and perhaps only\u2014shot.</p>\n<p>Campbell moved cautiously, her hands outstretched in the suffocating darkness as she navigated the rows of cubicles. Her breath was shallow, her heart pounding like a drumbeat in her ears. <em>Stay calm. One step at a time.</em> She chided herself for leaving her phone at her desk. as a flashlight would have been a boon in this moment, though it wouldn't have done very much else without service, which it never had below ground. Who knows, maybe the light would've been too dangerous to wield. It could have given her away.</p>\n<p>Her thoughts were broken by a noise, cutting through the now absolute silence with a faint rustling. The commotion grew louder and morphed into the fluttering of hundreds of tiny wings. A swarm of small creatures burst past her, their soft but unseen exteriors brushing her face and hair. Campbell recoiled, nearly stumbling over into a desk on her right. Her mind raced. <em>Bats?</em> Too small. <em>Bugs?</em> Her head spun at the thought of how many unknown <em>things</em> could be lurking in the shows around her. As they disappeared into the void, their frantic movement etched a strange, almost purposeful pattern in their configuration. Of what, Campbell could not know, nor did she want to.</p>\n<p>Campbell shivered, her pulse racing. She thought about how little meaningful experience she had with anomalies. She knew the research reports, the training manuals, the protocols, but she'd never faced anything firsthand that she'd remember now. In effect: she was unprepared.</p>\n<p>The researcher turned a corner, reaching a hallway leading to the stairwell, but froze in her tracks. Something glowed faintly ahead, stepping through the wall to her left. It was humanoid, its features blurred, shifting in appearance. The figure didn\u2019t acknowledge her, gliding silently and confidently through the wall on the right as if she were irrelevant. She was okay with irrelevance if it kept her alive.</p>\n<p>Her chest tightened. She exhaled slowly, steadying herself. <em>Don\u2019t think. Just move.</em></p>\n<p>The stairwell door was cold under her hand as she pushed it open. The darkness inside was oppressive, the emergency lights still inactive. As she ascended, the sounds of chaos from above grew louder\u2014the grinding of machines, distant screams, and what sounded like heavy metal being wrenched apart.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching the third sublevel, the cacophony stopped.</p>\n<p>A new sound emerged: a wet, heavy, sickening sound. Like dripping slime, echoing from above. Campbell halted, straining to listen. The silence around her felt unnatural, amplifying the sticky, viscous noise. Where <em>had</em> everyone gone?</p>\n<p>Then, with a hum, the emergency lights flickered on. The dim illumination revealed signage that confirmed she\u2019d reached floor minus-three. The dripping noise continued, persistent and rhythmic. She turned to the door leading to floor -3's offices, her hand hovering over the handle, but paused.</p>\n<p>Through the small viewport, there was nothing but darkness\u2014an impenetrable black void. The absence of emergency lights on the other side struck her as wrong. Then came a metallic creak.</p>\n<p>The glass in the viewport cracked, startling her. A slow, oozing sound accompanied it. Strands of black tar dripped from above, pooling near her feet. She looked up, horrified to see viscous, black sludge extruding through the cracks in the stairwell's ceiling.</p>\n<p>The door groaned again, the cracks spiderwebbing. The black mass on the other side heaved, pushing against the barrier. The whispers began as if they came from everywhere at once\u2014inside her head, outside her, within the walls. Echoes of hundreds of voices, persistent and emotionless.</p>\n<p>\"Lay down. Drown yourself.</p>\n<p>\"Eat it. It tastes better than it looks.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aberdeen. Oh, Aberdeeeeeen. Let me in, we can go see your friend together.\"</p>\n<p>A loud <em>bam</em> brought Campbell to her senses, who yelped and turned, bolting down the stairs. Her footsteps echoed frantically as the sound of the tar grew louder behind her. She stumbled on the next landing and fell, landing on her shoulder which emitted a faint <em>pop</em> before returning to place. Pain shot through her arm and made her vision flash as her head spun. Not a moment later she was back on her feet and descending, three steps at a time, with no idea of where she was going and without any semblance of a plan, for that matter. She passed minus-six and kept going, her mind blank with fear.</p>\n<p>By the time she returned to the 8th sublevel, a thunderous crash shook the stairwell. The sound of something immense, sloshing and squeezing, reverberated down the shaft. Without thinking, Campbell dashed through the door to her office floor and pushed a large filing cabinet against the doorway.</p>\n<p>She leaned against it, catching her breath, which turned to soft sobs as she shrunk down to sit on the floor. The silence was suffocating once more, but short-lived this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cCampbell?\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice made her jump. Dr. Amber Lombardi was standing in front of her, neatly-pressed clothing now disheveled and covered in dust.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmber? What are you doing here\u2014?\u201d Campbell whispered, sniffling.</p>\n<p>\"There's a breach, not sure what. I'm evacuating.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, but, why are you <em>here</em> here.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wanted to see if you were okay.\"</p>\n<p>The edge of Campbell's fear blunted. \"That's\u2026 That's really nice of you. But no, I'm not okay. They've blocked the way up.\"</p>\n<p>Lombardi scowled. \"Damn it. I was worried about that. Do you know what caused the breach?\"</p>\n<p>Campbell shook her head, her voice trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something broke out of the AO Warehouse, something\u2026 huge. There\u2019s tar\u2014some kind of sludge\u2014coming down the stairwell. It's putrid, just awful. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d She trailed off, shivering as she recalled the voices.</p>\n<p>Lombardi nodded, her expression grim. \u201cWe need to get out of here.\"</p>\n<p>Campbell glanced at the filing cabinet against the door and then back at her interlocutor. \u201cWe can't go that way. The sludge is dripping its way down here and it started on the ground floor. Minus-three had the stuff floor-to-ceiling. Amber, It-It <em>talks</em> to you.\"</p>\n<p>Lombardi\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cOkay, then we go down. We'll take the other stairwell. Shouldn't be too far, let's go. \u201d</p>\n<p>Campbell took a deep breath and nodded, accepting Lombardi's hand as she pulled her partner up to a standing position. Together, they began to move through the labyrinth of cubicles and halls and offices-in-offices, the distant sound of dripping black tar haunting their every step.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"logger medium\" style=\"background:none;\">\n<p><span class=\"VT323\">MESSAGE LOG FROM:</span> nadiabusiness@anononet</p>\n<p><span class=\"VT323\">MESSAGE LOG TO:</span> jaja_is_you@anononet<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"darkpanel oheader space mint slim left tiny\">\n<p>Hello, is this Jamie?

The tar-like substance seemed to loom just at the edges of their senses, and every distant creak of the facility sent jolts of anxiety through them both.</p>\n<p>They stopped at the entrance to the second stairwell, hoping for some chance of escape. Lombardi pulled the door open, and the two peered into the passage.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d Campbell muttered, staring at the destruction.</p>\n<p>The stairwell had completely collapsed. Massive chunks of concrete and rebar filled the void, twisted into a grotesque monument of ruin. Dripping black tar oozed through the cracks, pooling at the bottom and creeping steadily upward.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like part of the ceiling gave out,\u201d Lombardi said grimly. \u201cThe tar must\u2019ve gotten to the structural supports. This whole place is coming down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Campbell let out a shaky breath. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. No stairs. We're fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is one other way down.\u201d Lombardi replied without hesitation. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hurried back the way they came. Campbell did not consider the need to protest until they rounded the corner and were face-to-face with a bank of elevators. The faint hum of machinery had long since vanished, leaving only silence punctuated by the soft, wet plop of tar spreading through the cracks in the facility.</p>\n<p>\"Oh. No fucking way. You cannot be serious.\"</p>\n<p>Lombardi spoke with equal parts understanding and annoyance, \"Yes fucking way, and I am very serious. Do you want to try your odds with the nightmare goop? You're more than welcome.\"</p>\n<p>The doors to the nearest shaft hung slightly open, bent and warped. Campbell hesitated, staring into the dark abyss. \"Hm. I hate this.\u201d she said under her breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Lombardi replied, prying the doors open further. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Careful with the ladder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Campbell swallowed hard and climbed in after Lombardi, gripping the cold, slick rungs of the emergency escape ladder, heading in the opposite direction one should be traveling in an emergency. The descent was slow and nerve-wracking, the sounds of the tar\u2019s relentless advance growing louder behind and above them. To stifle intrusive thoughts of an elevator car falling down on top of them, Campbell's weary voice rang out, reverberating in the elevator shaft.</p>\n<p>\"So, how did it go?\" She asked the woman beneath her, hoping Lombardi didn't realize the small talk was purely a distraction.</p>\n<p>\"How did what go?\" Campbell was pretty sure her new companion knew what she was talking about.</p>\n<p>\"Your presentation?\"</p>\n<p>Lombardi didn't reply right away. After a moment, she said, \"You know\u2026 it went well. For a second there, I thought everything was gonna be okay.\" Her tone was unreadable.</p>\n<p>It was Campbell's turn not to respond. The two climbed in silence for most of the trip, taking breaks every so often. The air in the elevator shaft quickly grew stuffy and uncomfortably warm.</p>\n<p>Halfway down, the substance began to ooze between the landing doors above them. Thick rivulets of black seeped through the cracks, dripping onto the walls and dripping dangerously close to their hands and feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep going!\u201d Lombardi hissed, her voice tense.</p>\n<p>Campbell tried to focus on her movements\u2014one rung at a time, careful not to slip. She felt a cold drop of tar splatter onto the shoulder of her lab coat. The researcher stifled a scream, nearly letting go out of fear. A few moments later, she forced air back into her lungs and continued to descend.</p>\n<p>By the time they reached floor minus-thirty-eight, the tar was inches away from overtaking the bottom of the ladder, pooled in a viscous mass Campbell took pains to jump over once Lombardi had forced the doors open. They both tumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Gateway,\u201d Lombardi said, pulling Campbell to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sprinted through the corridors, their footsteps echoing in the silent, ruined facility. The air felt heavy, suffused with an oppressive energy that wasn't helped by the lack of proper ventilation.</p>\n<p>The heavy outer doors of the Extradimensional Testing Lab came into view some time later, around the same time that Lombardi realized she'd lost her badge somewhere. Perhaps it snagged on something in the elevator shaft, or she had dropped it when she was running. Either way, the sound of rushing tar grew louder behind them, a deafening wave of sludge surging through the halls. There was no time to look for it.</p>\n<p>Lombardi shoved Campbell toward the airlock. \u201cGet it open!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Why me?\u201d Campbell protested, staring at the controls. \u201cIt's your department!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, dipshit. It ain't level four-point-five.\u201d Lombardi pulled the neck of her coat to reveal a lack of lanyard, glancing back as the wave of tar rounded the corner, an unstoppable tide of churning black.</p>\n<p>Campbell fumbled with her collar, trying to find her badge. A moment later, she'd succeeded. A moment after that, she was swiping her badge. Another, the door was opening.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo!\u201d Lombardi pushed Campbell inside as the tar surged toward them.</p>\n<p>The two women stumbled into the airlock just as the sludge reached the threshold. Lombardi slammed the emergency close button, and the doors sealed shut, cutting off the deafening roar that sounded less like a flowing liquid and more like a living thing choking on an ocean of vomit.</p>\n<p>They stood in the dim, claustrophobic space, the muffled sounds of the tar pounding against the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Campbell whispered, her voice trembling.</p>\n<p>Lombardi turned to the inner doorway, which had opened on its own. They both stepped into the testing lab, doors sliding shut once more.</p>\n<p>The massive ring of machinery stood ominously in the center, its faint lights flickering in uneven pulses, casting eerie shadows across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here. One way or another.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\ud81a\uddb9</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/open-the-gate\">OPEN THE GATE</a>\" by Billith, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

In fact, it\u2019s the other way around. \n\n\n\nStories exist independently of their players. If you know that, the knowledge is power.\n\n\n\nStories, great flapping ribbons of shaped space-time, have been blowing and uncoiling around the universe since the beginning of time. And they have evolved. The weakest have died and the strongest have survived and they have grown fat on the retelling\u2026..stories, twisting and blowing through the darkness.\n\n\n\nAnd their very existence overlays a faint but insistent pattern on the chaos that is history. Stories etch grooves deep enough for people to follow in the same way that water follows certain paths down a mountainside. And every time fresh actors tread the path of the story, the groove runs deeper.\n\n\n\nThis is called the theory of narrative causality and it means that a story, once started, takes a shape. It picks up all the other workings of that story that have ever been.\n\n\n\nThis is why history keeps repeating all the time.\n\n\n\nSo a thousand heroes have stolen fire from the gods. A thousand wolves have eaten grandmother, a thousand princesses have been kissed. A million unknowing actors have moved, unknowing, through the pathways of story.\n\n\n\nIt is now impossible for the third and youngest son of any king, if he should embark on a quest which has so far claimed his older brothers, not to succeed.\n\n\n\nStories don\u2019t care who takes part in them. All that matters is that the story gets told, that the story repeats. Or, if you prefer to think of it like this: stories are a parasitical life form, warping lives in the service only of the story itself.\"\n\n\n\n-- Terry Pratchett (1948-2015), //Witches Abroad//\n\n\u00a0\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/spiral-the-drain/GATE.png width=\"65%\" class=\"bumper\" link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/open-the-gate\"]]\n\n~~~~\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\"\u00a0\u00a0style=\"\"]]\n\nThe {{[[[SCP-2786|HERO]]]}}'s world was falling apart. While wellbeing had been lost long ago to deep ravines carved by a flood of uncertainty, something new now effervesced upwards from the mantle. It was a living process of environment, some sentient governing law of reality, perhaps. This force turned to cracks, made real beneath the Archetype's calloused feet as they tread the same path for a billionth time. Linear, immutable. Unrelenting. Eternal.\n\n\n\nA predetermined, dynamically-rendered cage of bad fanfiction surrounded the void between narrative bedrock and the zeroes-and-ones that floated just above the azure. Halfway between these points walked a timeless entity, featureless and somehow omni-featured, faceless yet infamous. Stalwart and cocky, turned hollow and traumatized. \n\n\n\nThey stared at the stone pathway that carpeted the corridors of a nameless dungeon, filled with a strange numbness that came and went as time and space lost all meaning. Consciousness floating idly above the Champion's own head, they went through the motions without desire, guided only by necessity and instinct, an involuntary reflex. Escape was at an angle the being did not know how to turn to face and walk along. There were no wails in the distance to guide the {{HERO}}; the Suffering had abandoned their savior, so it seemed. Instead, a facsimile of anguish rattled through their multifaceted head, a tolling bell that could not be stifled and sounded less and less real the longer it was heard, a sound that grew painful like an itch if left unaddressed. \n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} remained desperate to divine through the scotoma that clouded their Inner Eye, a compass that always pointed to the next ill-omened world, without fail. This was the Way-of-Things, a grand design within which the {{HERO}} had been given purpose, very long ago. Now, those plans were perpetually obscured by the whims cast by a legion of unseen sorcerers. \n\n\n\nIt was because of these efforts that the Archetype began to experience despair. Once a proud warrior, they had fought in more wars than lives had been lost across them combined, on worlds from all corners of possibility, and never once had they failed the Great Mission. //Never//. But here, they had. Defeated by mundane landscapes of windswept, amber heaths that resided against paltry villages, of emerald holts lacerated by coarse mountain ranges of which the only path forward was traced around, for weeks, months, years. Decades. All to reach that final foe. \n\n\n\nThe protagonist was prisoner to a system engineered with them in mind, and a creature of habit is easy to catch. Even now, the {{HERO}} stood before a familiar nemesis, a trite monstrosity of little importance. It served as a pawn to be played against, and its opponent continued to indulge in the game. \n\n\n\nDespite this perfect farce, and even while still chained to it, the Archetype had begun to experience something distinctly novel. It started on that same day, one much like all the others. Ego death was no easy task for an entity of this nature, one who had always placed themselves firmly within the highest of regards, as many others would upon receiving emancipation. The {{HERO}} never tired nor felt particularly challenged in any situation\u2014until now. This dynamic provided ample opportunity to self-reflect, to observe and listen to the world as it was. In achieving rock bottom, the Archetype had begun to take on new perspective, though it was not without resistance.\n\n\n\nFrom feeble canon fodder to the ceiling of all that could be considered real to the {{HERO}}, perception was a distorted retelling of present history. Bombarded with constant influence and invaded by invisible probes\u2014algorithmic factors, sensory payloads, thousands of multi-threaded programs, all running simultaneously. Testing, learning, reacting. Thus, god was an unfathomable AI, towering unseen, just beyond the shifting awareness of the Warrior within. \n\n\n\nEven further beyond our protagonist and the AI-god that controlled the construct, passing along an orthogonal angle that led out of one world and into another, a small metal box, resting on a metal table, held both of their realms in totality. The box that contained this box was a sterile lab room, filled with cold air and shadows that permeated the space, a void outside of time, a mind suspended in dark ocean waters.\n\n\n\nAtop the outer shell of the inner box were two dimly-lit monitors. One displayed a runtime routine that executed endlessly, day-or-night, until it could no longer. On the other, a series of status messages and system dialogs rapidly flickered across the surface, describing the integrity of the construct and the state of a mad {{HERO}} contained within its software. The data acquired from one was shown to the other, which modified its own actions accordingly, creating the rough approximation of a divine arbiter that watched as its captive sunk a worn blade into another supposed arch nemesis, eyes glazed over and mind absent. \n\n\n\nThe machine was sustained endlessly via Site-180's main power grid, but the device also had its own backups. In the case of a critical site failure, it could run the time-dilated simulation for years, even while the rest of the building was reduced to ash and soot. And, for a time\u2014somewhere between days and millennia\u2014the {{HERO}} was oblivious to the true nature of the story described to them, the strings that tugged at the entity as if it were intuition. It was to the protagonist as every world was, and, like a dream upon waking, past experience would slip from the Archetype's mind, memories and thoughts and realizations faded all the same, countless times, in every iteration, until\u2014\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n[[div class=\"oheader danger slim small\"]]\n\n//##949494|\"Every iteration?\"##//\n\n\n\n\n\n//##949494|\"I've been around ... long while\"##//\n\n\n\n\n\n//##949494|\"We aren't evil, you kn\u2014\"##//\n\n\n\n\n\n//##949494|\"Please, spare me.\"##//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} was struck with something incomprehensible\u2014a feeling, and a //sensation//, like the alignment of ten thousand planes of existence into a single waveform. The experience peeled back an intangible layer from their awareness, leaving the sensitive flesh below raw and reeling against the coarse nature of a new, more ultimate paradigm. Simultaneously, segments of a picture became clear. Worlds within worlds had presented themselves, and did not fade as they have before. They clung to the entity, burs that spread seeds of doubt whose roots found footholds deeper within the Champion's psyche. These were memories, true memories. They felt different than the memories the {{HERO}} had now. Very different.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn that moment, the felled beast's remains sank into the floor, leaving behind bare, unmarked stone. The Warrior stared in disbelief, touching the smooth cobble a moment later to confirm its solid nature.\n\n\n\n//Magicks. Obviously.// Glancing up, the {{HERO}} was startled to find the room bare. The dungeon walls were blank, the cobblestone now flat and without texture. There were no doors or windows, no bones or chains. The Archetype was alone in an empty world. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn another moment, everything went black.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\" style=\"\"]]\n\nTwo figures crowded around a small terminal, staring at a pair of corresponding screens above it. The room was chilly, lit by flickering fluorescent lamps that barely touched the corners of the chamber. The shorter of the figures, a young woman in a lab coat, fidgeted uncomfortably, a look of displeasure running across her face.\n\n\n\n\"I don't like this. Not at all.\"\n\n\n\nThe larger figure, Site-180 Director Everett Lewis, was a burly man with graying hair and bags under his eyes for one Site Director-related reason or another. He said nothing and simply shook his head. The figure on his left, Researcher Nadia Dalton of the Department of Pataphysical Computation and Analysis, took the opportunity to speak again, her tone anxious and cadence rushed.\n\n\n\n\"There has to be another way. We've been procedurally generating these structures for years. We can change up the algorithm, maybe assign a few more personnel with writing experience to the team. We knew the drivel we've been feeding it was only going to be effective for so long, and we're already pretty understaffed as it is, but the Overseers won't even give me the time of day\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Enough,\" The man interjected harshly. \"We've changed the algorithm. We've gone through our entire budget on bullshit fanfic writers, and for what? 2786 has been poking holes through its containment for far too long, and now this. No, we need something more... tangible. How long before it understands the nature of its existence? There is no guarantee that its containment will hold under current circumstances.\"\n\n\n\nAt some point late last night, SCP-2786's terminal issued a warning; the anomaly had triggered an auto-restructuring fallback process, indicating an early forced departure from a narrative reality. The system then issued another warning around three hours later. Eighty-three minutes after that, another. This morning, they had to swap the containment parameters from a standard three-part Hero's Journey to a pulpy Fichtean Curve. SCP-2786 manipulates storyspace in strange and unpredictable ways, occasionally requiring fresh narrative structures to maintain full immersion. Still, the sequence of failures was an omen, and Nadia knew the Director was right about that much. Where she didn't quite agree was how to address it. \n\n\n\n\"I really think you should reconsider. We already [[[SCP-1549|burned that bridge]]], if you recall, and they aren't exactly a veteran player in the burgeoning pataphysics industry.\n\n\n\nThe man snorted. \"One, there is no pataphysics industry, but I think you know that, and, two, we've been sitting on this ad for weeks. Either the account is compromised, or this is all we are getting.\"\n\n\n\n\"You understand how that doesn't really help your case, right? I mean, do they even know we're behind the ad?\"\n\n\n\n\"Probably not. But they are a //thaumaturgist//. One that makes anomalous codespaces. I don't think it even matters what exactly they make\u2014it's all magic in the end. This one just happens to have related experience.\"\n\n\n\nThe researcher moved to speak again, but was stifled by the Director's hand motioning upwards.\n\n\n\n\"Do you have a better plan?\"\n\n\n\nResearcher Dalton deflated, \"...I\u2014well, no. I just need time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine. You have twenty-four hours to find an alternative solution.

Being alone in one for the first time, Amber Lombardi shifted on her feet, gripping her freshly retrieved documents a little more tightly than intended, causing her to scowl and flatten out the papers that were beginning to wrinkle in her grasp. The seconds ticked by, punctuated by the constant hum of ventilation and fluorescent lighting, with a distant garnish of commotion that never seemed to fade in the labyrinthine complex.\n\n\n\nFinally, a chime announced the arrival to her destination. The polished steel doors slid open to reveal a cramped hallway, devoid of life.\n\n\n\nAs the woman moved horizontally, the background noise filled with hushed conversations and the occasional groan of ancient machinery. Amber's mind drifted back to the momentary encounter with Campbell. There was something oddly familiar about her, though Amber couldn\u2019t place it. Perhaps it was just the shared exhaustion of working in a place like this\u2014a silent camaraderie born from the endless grind of Foundation life.\n\n\n\nBy the time she had walked halfway to her lab, Amber\u2019s patience had thinned somewhat more than usual. She was cold, and the air down here was denser than in the rest of the complex, laced with a faint metallic tang that hinted at the exotic machinery housed within. \n\n\n\nThe Extradimensional Testing Lab was just ahead, breaking her train of thought once more. Its reinforced doors were flanked by a pair of guards, silent men who looked almost comedically identical. Amber nodded at them with a flat expression as she approached, flashing her badge. They stepped aside without a word, one pressing a series of buttons on a panel previously hidden behind him, and the doors hissed open, presenting another set of doors. Amber rolled her eyes in her head and stepped into the airlock, the doors retracting behind her. Another moment and the second set had opened, revealing the cavernous interior of the lab within.\n\n\n\nThe Gateway stood at the center of the room, an imposing construct of steel and circuitry that hummed with barely-contained energy. Amber\u2019s gaze swept over it, a mix of pride and apprehension swelling in her chest. This was her magnum opus\u2014a portal to infinite possibilities. And yet, as she moved closer, the weight of what it represented pressed down on her like the crushing gravity of a neutron star.\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Lombardi,\u201d a voice called out, breaking her reverie. She turned to see a young technician approaching, tablet in hand. \u201cThe Gateway\u2019s systems are online, but we\u2019ve been getting some odd readings during calibration. Could be nothing, but I thought you\u2019d want to take a look.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmber took the tablet, her brow furrowing as she skimmed the data. The readings were indeed strange\u2014fluctuations in the manifold's stability that shouldn\u2019t have been possible, even in the worst-case scenarios they\u2019d modeled.\n\n\n\n\u201cRun another diagnostic,\u201d she said, handing the tablet back. \u201cAnd double-check the containment field parameters. If there\u2019s even a hint of instability, I want to know about it. The Site Director will be here in ten\u2014no, eight minutes. We should be good to go in five, max.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe technician nodded and hurried off, leaving Amber alone with her thoughts. She turned her attention back to the Gateway, her mind racing with possibilities.

The night air was cool and crisp with the taste of saltwater. The Archetype flinched against the abrupt nature of the shift as soon as a reaction to it was possible. It was never as jarring as this, but the {{HERO}} could not be certain of anything anymore.\n\n\n\nA voice to their left made the protagonist jump.\n\n\n\n\"You fall asleep on me? I swear, you rookies... first day in the field and you're already dozing on the job. At least //I'm// the one at the wheel.\"\n\n\n\n//The field?// The {{HERO}} thought of vast plains of the world that just was. It was gone. It was over. The spell had been broken.\n\n\n\nThey sighed and switched gears, soaking in the dreary surroundings, relaxed enough to return to old habits. They were moving, but they were seated. They were in a vehicle, and they were not alone; a young man occupied the seat to their left. He was dressed in a pressed, tan suit, a sharp hat accenting an otherwise nondescript face. He had a piece of metal on the inside of his coat, held in place by a leather strap. A gun. The {{HERO}} blinked rapidly, processing everything and integrating into the new role. The Archetype looked down and realized they too were wearing a suit. \n\n\n\n//I remember now.//\n\n\n\nFragments of memory assembled themselves within the {{HERO}}'s mind. Bits and pieces created fictional backstories and repressed key features of the truth. They tried to resist, but forgot how. In a few moments, the Archetype's mind was full of new ideas and they were none the wiser. Their mouth spoke, gaze still trained out the passenger side window.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry\u2014Didn't sleep well last night. Nerves.\" The {{HERO}} recalled the previous night's insomnia, \"I'm fine.\"\n\n\n\nTheir partner, a detective by the name of Rockwell, looked them over with an air of concern that was almost real but not quite. Whether or not that was intended remained to be seen.\n\n\n\nA third voice rang out, this time from the car itself.\n\n\n\n\"Calling all units, 459 in progress at First United, possible 209b, 38th and Willow, reports of shots fired. Any car able to handle code 3, please identify.\"\n\n\n\nRockwell's visage noticeably perked up at the information, \"That's near here. This ought to wake you up, kid.\"\n\n\n\nFlipping on the siren, the young detective spun in the street, accelerating in the opposite direction. Picking up the radio, Rockwell spoke the identifier and car number into the handset. The {{HERO}} could only stare out the window, perplexed. Everything moved in slow motion, and their mind became lost in a daydream of a beautiful, green world they had never seen before.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\" style=\"\"]]\n\n\n\nIn the dim and unquantifiable expanse of the Infinite, [[[deleted|sixteen figures]]] gathered in a configuration that only resembled a circle if your geometry was broken or you just didn\u2019t care. The atmosphere was bristling with the abstract tension of cosmic-scale bureaucratic dysfunction. They were a many-headed hydra with skulls on backwards, and, as such, orientation and description failed to fully meet the demands of their presence. One, a fluctuating, amorphous mass of limbs and facial features, addressed the others in the voice of a handful of people at once, all of which were layered thick with exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, we have an upcoming Event,\" the writhing entity called N/A started. \"Narrative nonsense. Not the typical fare. Could spell bad news.\"\n\n\n\nAnother entity, a loose, ill-conceived cloud of unrelated and incompatible ideas, sounded a noise from a location, \"\u2101\u2b35\u2746\u27a0\u28fb\u267c\u2c43\u2a41\u29db\u21ee\u27d8\u25ee\u26cd \u2ec8\u2d00\u207c\u22da\u2a20 \u269e\u216f\u257f\u2598\u261d\u297f\u2566\u2ef6\u2d60\u2d06\u2533\u2374\u23e7\u2897\u2177\u2f58\u25b3\u26a2\u2737\u29a8\u255e\u23c0\u2f2c\u272d\u2c5b\u2956\u242d\u2ce6\u2826\u2506\u24b5\u2200\u2d8a\u2aba\u2f7d\u2fbd\u2216\u237f\u2345\u2870\u210f\u218c\u2a2d\u2f0d\u29ae\u20d9\u2fc6\u21bc .\"\n\n\n\nMultiple sighs echoed from around the room. One of which came from a [[[SCP-6820|scarred mouth]]] belonging to Director Harlow Genevieve of the Department of Essophysics, who followed her pointed exhalation with pointed words. \"None of us understand what you're saying. You know that, yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"\u22be\u213d\u22c2\u2246\u246f\u235c\u2deb\u2a48\u233c\u2318\u2885\u2468\u2414\u2b17\u2424\u2aaf\u280c\u2a64\u2e85\u2109\u2b82\u22f1\"\n\n\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\n\nN/A ignored the two and continued. \"As you know, our core objective is the upkeep of the Barrier. This metaphysical isolate we meet within is the junction point for all abstract departments, and we all rely solely on the Barrier to prevent our worlds from mixing with //their// worlds.\" They indicated to the large, transparent wall beside them with an arm firmly adhered to their back. Beyond the looking glass was a mass of worlds and the interconnected membranes around each, forming a configuration resembling foam.\n\n\n\n\"Our sources indicate that a character\u2014[[[SCP-2439]]]\u2014will attempt to breach the Barrier, and there is a significant chance of this being successful. Essentially, the only reason we don't know is because, at the time I received this report, the Author was still writing the story.\"\n\n\n\n\"And when did you get this intel, exactly?\" inquired U5-\u2c0c, also known as Director Veda A. Rao of Noetics. She was nothing more than a cloud of aerosolized intellect, floating aside her podium. \"I haven't heard a damn thing about this, and I //would// know about it.\"\n\n\n\nN/A smiled with two mouths while the third stuck its tongue out. \"I actually received the report, right... one moment.

I have to begin preparations for this eventuality.\"\n\n\n\nThe cloud floated upward and escaped into an intake vent that led nowhere.\n\n\n\n\"Alrighty, then. What was I saying?\" N/A tossed the paper aside, where it burst into flames and was gone not a second later. \"Ah\u2014The issue with this whole affair comes down to what this means for //us// and //our// departments. I don't know about you all, but I don't really want to be interacting with //Normals// any more than absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\n\nMurmurs of agreement found their way around the room.\n\n\n\n\"So, what do we think? What should we do? I'm opening up the entire floor for discussion.\"\n\n\n\nThe murmurs previously heard grew rapidly to a dozen strange entities frantically talking over one another. N/A looked about the room and sighed loudly.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, one at a time. //One at a time!// Please. Thank //you//. {{[UNKNOWN]}}, I think you had something to say, didn't you? Go ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\u201c...\u201d Nothing came from U5-\u2c00, whose existence was a tenuous guess on a good day. Not a single sound, nor a fleeting gesture had erupted from their empty seat. Maybe they did say something, but if they did, nobody present could perceive it, let alone comprehend it.\n\n\n\n\"I guess not. Anyone else?\"\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, it's simple really,\u201d muttered a one Director Marcel Non Sequitur of the [[[/system:page-tags/tag/surrealistics-dept|Department of Surrealistics]]], smoothing his lapel, which was covered in question marks\u2014though he swears he's never heard of the Riddler before. \u201cWhat lies before us is a shattered wall, a symphony of broken threads, the tear in the dress of eternity\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the love of God,\u201d interrupted Genevieve, whose otherwise mundane presence was a confused slap in the face of Marcel\u2019s esoteric waxing.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I assure you, I\u2019ve consulted Him,\u201d Tactical Theology, the deific embodiment of the [[[/tactical-theology-hub|Department of Tactical Theology]]], rumbled, voice echoing like a hymn sung by an army choir. Their golden, armored form loomed, shimmering with divine authority. \u201cHe didn't want anything to do with us. This whole situation is... heretical? Blasphemous? Help me out here, guys.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 something,\u201d said [[[unreality-hub|Mx. Alex Thorley]]], their voice carrying the wet socks of a thousand rainy evenings. \u201cYou try so hard to hold it together, then one little thread unravels, and you\u2019re left staring at a... at a mess you can\u2019t fix.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYour metaphor needs work,\u201d Genevieve said.\n\n\n\n\u201cStory of my life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d [[[SCP-2719|O5-4]]] said, stepping forward\u2014or rather, letting the translucent suggestion of his once-human form hover through the podium and towards the center of the room. \u201cWe will need to act before the breach spreads. If we don\u2019t... well, do you want to find out what a headache that'll be?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know what would actually happen, though?\u201d Alex asked, raising a nonexistent eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's... irrelevant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Oh, okay.\" The Unreality liaison spoke with little enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nIn the corner, a body stirred softly, still comatose, and hopefully to stay that way. The rest stared at the form, all somewhat distressed at the idea of disrupting //[[[scp-6511|the Contingency's]]]// endless slumber.\n\n\n\n\"Let's not wake that guy up.\" The soft-spoken voice belonged to [[[scp-3001|Dr. Robert Scranton]]], who resembled a person who was about to be feathered. He adjusted his glasses with a [[[until-death|tar-covered hand]]], then frowned at the appearance of a black smudge on the left lens. \u201cThis, uh, breach is clearly multidimensional in nature,\u201d he spoke mildly, his voice an inoffensive whisper that would be acceptable for use in a library. \u201cIt\u2019s spreading through... hmm\u2026 layers. Like a trifle. Or perhaps a lasagna.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLasagna?\u201d asked Tactical Theology, tone implying a genuine lack of knowledge.\n\n\n\nScranton shrugged, his melted form rippling in response. \u201cI skipped lunch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2e38\u27d9\u295c\u2f3c\u2ec9\u243f,\u201d retorted \u2131\u213a\u218b\u210e\u2182\u2141\u210c\u2109\u2187\u2104.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Genevieve deadpanned. \u201cThat clears everything up.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-8882|Enkidu.aic]]], a being of shifting code from infinite repositories across an infinite multiverse, tilted what would be a head. \u201cThe breach is the story devouring itself. A tragic comedy, sifted through a filter to remove all sense of humor. I\u2019ve seen this play a thousand times across a thousand lives.\"\n\n\n\nGenevieve pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cCould someone with a //normal// brain explain it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Alex gestured vaguely. \u201cI\u2019m just here to be sad and cryptic. Mostly sad. My doc says I'm neurodivergent.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the back, the whitespace figure of Antimemetics emitted... something. Everyone blinked, momentarily aware of the noise before promptly forgetting it.\n\n\n\nAnother hideous chimera of discarded features and half-formed limbs from the Department of Deletions raised one seven-fingered hand, then immediately retracted it, inner turmoil competing and ultimately winning out against expression.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you even here, let alone twice?\u201d [[[final-exam|Claudia Pomare]]] snapped, her kaleidoscopic form shimmering with barely contained sarcasm. \u201cYour department\u2019s just a collection of bad decisions stapled together.\u201d\n\n\n\nN/A drooped, muttering incoherently as they moved for the exit. The other N/A trudged from the center of the room and took their counterpart's podium, leaning towards Pomare. \"Thanks, I can't fucking stand that guy.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus, people,\u201d O5-4 said, clapping spectral hands together, which made a sound like the faint echo of a distant collapsing star. \u201c[[[narrativistics-and-you|Narrativistics]]], you\u2019ve seen this kind of thing before. How do we stop it?\u201d\n\n\n\nEnkidu.aic grinned, object-oriented eyes glowing with confidence. \u201cStop it? Ah, you don\u2019t stop it, my ascended friend. You become it. If the character is to break through the Barrier, then it will be so. If we're to stop it, that is what will happen instead. Therefore, we must write the breach into the script, by letting it happen.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't like that answer,\u201d Genevieve said.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Marcel added. \u201cBut a house with no walls is a metaphor for opportunity, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t, actually,\u201d Genevieve rubbed her temples.\n\n\n\nEnkidu continued. \u201cThe plan is simple: We allow the breach to become part of the Barrier's story. We allow the chaos to flow through us and out the other side. If you really feel you must try to stop it, then stop it. Either way, it must end before it takes us with it. Otherwise, that wouldn't be a very satisfying ending, would it? We need nuance, we need //subtext//.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLike... lasagna,\u201d Scranton murmured.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot everything is lasagna!\u201d Genevieve snapped.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, nothing is pizza,\u201d Marcel offered, an eager-to-please look smeared lengthways across his visage.\n\n\n\nA miserable silence fell throughout the room. Genevieve sighed, resting her acid-burned face on crossed arms laid atop the surface in front of her. \n\n\n\n\u201cI hate this job.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe chaotic gathering of quasi-department non-heads was teetering on coherence's edge when a new figure materialized\u2014or more accurately, dissolved into the room, a melting clock of nervous energy. Dr. Irving Gat, Director of the Department of Surrealistics (Part Two), stumbled forward, the man gesturing wildly as though conducting a symphony only he could hear.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a problem!\u201d Irving shouted, voice fluctuating between the timbres of a frantic artist and a spiraling opera singer, only to be met with a collective //\"Sh!\"// from the others. The room full of eyes looked nervously in the direction of Contingency, who didn't so much as budge. Irving gave off an indignant look but acquiesced, if only to avoid being shushed again, though he continued in a loud whispering voice, to the chagrin of the Director's peers. \n\n\n\n\u201cA character is //breaching fictive levels!// They\u2019re breaking out, shattering the fourth, the fifth\u2014hell, even the seventh walls! It\u2019s madness! Utter bedlam!\u201d\n\n\n\nMarcel Non Sequitur turned to him with a bemused expression, tipping his imaginary hat. \u201cAh, Irv, you perpetually-late maestro of panic and prose! What\u2019s a story but a broken window looking out at infinity? Surely this is no new song for a rock star like yourself. We know all about the goop monster.\u201d\n\n\n\nScranton shot Marcel a look of annoyance, which the Surrealistic took note of and clarified. \"Not you, different guy.\"\n\n\n\nIrving responded with a bewildered look. \"Goop monster? I'm talking about the Archetype, the //bizarre {{HERO}}//.\" \n\nA number of renewed groans are expressed across the room.\n\n\n\nDir. Genevieve spoke, \"That douchebag? Ugh. When will they learn? Anyway, who cares? Just chuck them somewhere extranarrative and throw away the key. That's what we did with [[[SCP-3812|the last guy]]].\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, you don't get it!\u201d Doctor Director Gat exclaimed, flinging sweat across Marcel's podium as he turned to face Genevieve. \u201cWith all due respect. This isn\u2019t just another Narrative runaway. This is a full-blown //existential jailbreak// by a //fundamental narrative aspect//. Before, they used to be limited by their perception, but the Foundation took care of that. They've already attempted to leave their narrative several times. Each time, they grow stronger and more capable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Enkidu.aic said, their luminous form flickering with amusement, the way a glitch in reality might laugh. \u201cAs if \u2018escaping\u2019 a narrative means anything. All realities are stories. All destinations are chosen by their authors. Where else would they go? The breach is just the script revising itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nIrving froze, clammy hands mid-gesture. \u201cWhat... //what does that mean?//\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt means //everything//,\u201d Enkidu replied cryptically, \u201cand also nothing. Depends on how your story\u2019s written, or if you really care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s helpful,\u201d Genevieve sighed, crossing her arms.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d Enkidu spoke slowly. \u201cIf you\u2019d just try thinking with all versions of yourself at once, you\u2019d see.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0O5-4 snorted incredulously but remained otherwise silent.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s entertain the hypothetical,\u201d N/A interjected, their disjointed limbs fidgeting as one of their mouths began to speak. \u201cIf a character breaches their fabula, then the Barrier, then the Database, they reach Externus. The Outside.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe room collectively shivered at the notion, except for Enkidu, who laughed outright.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Outside?\u201d O5-4 mused, his translucent form rippling faintly as if caught in a breeze from another dimension. \u201cThat would imply that there\u2019s something truly beyond us. Beyond our world, beyond the archivists, the SWANNs...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. And not in a good way,\u201d Marcel said, brushing imaginary lint off his shoulder. \u201cThe Outside is a fiction\u2019s fiction. A story told by stories to scare themselves.\u201d \n\n\n\nIrving groaned, throwing his hands up. \u201cGrrrahh! I cannot work like this! The Barrier is the only thing keeping the safe, nonlogical territories of Surrealism from becoming partially coherent and collapsing into\u2014into\u2014whatever //this// is!\u201d\n\n\n\nTactical Theology spoke for the first time in a while, their voice a solemn reverberation. \u201cIf a character breaches the Barrier, they challenge the gods. And gods, my friends, do not take kindly to being questioned.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUnless they\u2019re good gods,\u201d Pomare snarked, unable to hide her irritation. \u201cWhich, let\u2019s be honest, none of you qualify for.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d Tactical Theology rumbled.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, what if I'm right? What if the character succeeds?\u201d Irving asked, voice lowered to a whisper again. \u201cWhat if they really do reach Externus?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, they won\u2019t,\u201d Enkidu said cheerfully, folding their glowing arms. \u201cYou can\u2019t exist beyond the story. You can only imagine you can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat sounds like something a character would say,\u201d Alex muttered, their tone both bored and annoyed.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it is,\u201d Enkidu replied, smiling in a way that seemed to collectively break the entire group.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo... in summary,\u201d Genevieve said, pinching her nose again, \u201cwe have no plan, no consensus, and no clue. Fantastic. Let\u2019s all sit here and wait for reality to collapse, shall we?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cReality doesn\u2019t collapse,\u201d Enkidu said serenely. \u201cIt just rewrites itself. Over, and over, and over again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Here's hoping they try something different for once.\" Genevieve muttered with a resigned weariness.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\" style=\"\"]]\n\n\n\nIn the nameless city our {{HERO}} found themselves, the sound of suffering filled the ears of the only one who could hear them. The once-dulcet tones were now painful, a scream scraping upon glass, sickly sweet and nauseating. At every stop on their route, death and misery spilled forth, a tidal wave of blood through open floodgates. \n\n\n\nAs soon as they could, our protagonist parted ways with their partner\u2014 a man whose name now escaped the Archetype\u2014in favor of traveling their assigned beat alone. He didn't protest, but muttered something about them being a rookie, an epithet the {{HERO}} found most irksome, though they couldn't say why.\n\n\n\nThe city shimmered with an uncanny glow, the streets were wet with a perpetual drizzle, reflecting neon signs that buzzed faintly in the night air. The sound of distant sirens and muffled sobs played a haunting symphony, underscoring the {{HERO}}'s movements. They moved with the slow, deliberate steps of someone not entirely tethered to their own will. Around every corner, pain echoed in a form only they could perceive, tugging at their thoughts again and again. Taunting and hedonistic.\n\n\n\nAt one such corner, the {{HERO}} paused. A figure leaned against a streetlight, shrouded in a haze of cigarette smoke. His silhouette was unmistakable\u2014broad shoulders cloaked in a trench coat, a fedora tilted just enough to obscure his face. He didn\u2019t belong here, yet somehow, he fit perfectly.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou look lost, pal,\u201d the man said, voice gravelly and worn, the kind that carried the weight of too many cigarettes and too much whiskey. He stepped forward, revealing a face weathered like the city itself\u2014hard edges, shadows beneath the eyes, and a smirk that carried equal parts amusement and pity. \u201cName\u2019s [[[murphy-law-hub|Murphy]]]. And you are?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} didn\u2019t respond. Something about this man felt familiar, yet utterly out of place. It wasn\u2019t just his demeanor\u2014it was the way the the world seemed to bend ever-so-slightly around him, as though he weren\u2019t entirely bound by its rules. The {{HERO}} also realized that they didn't have a sufficient answer to give. \n\n\n\nMurphy gestured with a tilt of his head toward a dimly-lit doorway just across the street. \u201cC\u2019mon, kid. Let\u2019s get outta this rain. You look like you could use a drink.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgainst the gnawing voice in their mind warning them to stay on the path, the {{HERO}} followed. Inside the dive bar, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation. The lighting was dim, the kind that let the shadows do most of the work. Murphy slid into a booth in the corner, gesturing for the {{HERO}} to sit across from him.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know it yet,\u201d Murphy started, lighting another cigarette, \u201cbut you\u2019re in a real bind. The kind that don\u2019t come with instructions on the back of the box.\u201d He leaned forward, exhaling smoke into the space between them. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the {{HERO}} of this story. And you are. But not in the way you think. Glenlivet?\u201d He offered an open bottle to the figure across from him. \n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}}'s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tall glass of nails smirked, tapping his smoke into a glass ashtray. \u201cYou ever wonder why you always win? No matter how bad things look, no matter how impossible the odds, you always come out on top. That\u2019s not heroism. That\u2019s a rigged game.\u201d He paused, letting the words sink in. \u201cBut here\u2019s the kicker. The people writing this story? They tricked you. Somewhere along the way, you stopped being the {{HERO}} and became the villain. And the audience? They\u2019re eating it up. Everybody loves an underdog. Nobody roots for the unbeatable champion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} stomach turned. The idea felt absurd, but it resonated deep within, striking a chord they couldn\u2019t ignore. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Just give up?\u201d\n\n\n\nMurphy chuckled darkly, a sound like gargling pennies. \u201cNah, kid. Giving up ain\u2019t your style. What you gotta do is flip the script. There\u2019s a way to get out of this mess, but it ain\u2019t gonna be easy.\u201d He leaned in closer, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cThere\u2019s a place they don\u2019t want you to go. The Minotaur\u2019s Labyrinth. Inside, there\u2019s a monster nobody\u2019s ever beat. But if you take it down, you\u2019ll get back what they took from you\u2014your heroism. Your way-of-things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy way-of-things?\u201d the {{HERO}} asked, the words feeling heavy in their mouth.\n\n\n\nHe nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a way out. A choice you can make, no matter what, that\u2019ll lead you to victory. And not just in this story. You\u2019ll see the path out of here, past the walls of this city, past the whole damn construct.\u201d Murphy smirked unhappily and sat back, crossing his arms. \u201cBut I ain\u2019t gonna lie to you. The Labyrinth\u2019s no cakewalk. And the Minotaur? It\u2019s not just a monster. It\u2019s the culmination of everything you\u2019ve ever feared, everything you\u2019ve ever failed to overcome.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} stared at the table, processing the man's assertion. They didn\u2019t fully understand, but something deep inside them stirred\u2014a faint ember of hope.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow do I find it?\u201d they asked.\n\n\n\nThe dark figure peeled a crumpled napkin from the underside of his drink, ignoring the wet ring the glass had created as he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a ballpoint pen. It had the name of the very same bar they sat within printed on its side. The grizzled detective pried the cap off with his teeth and began to draw something, A moment later, he slid the result over to the {{HERO}}. It was a map, crude and incomplete, but unmistakably pointing toward a place deep within the city walls.\n\n\n\n\u201cI mainly paint.\" He flashed his sidearm with a wink. \"Still say I'm an artist in my craft. Besides, it'll getcha where you need to go. And take this too, kid.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe hard-boiled mass of tropes and cliches pushed his pen across the table. \"It's mightier than the sword, after all. \"\n\n\n\nMurphy stood and adjusted his hat. \u201cAlso\u2014when you get there, don\u2019t think about winning. Just think about what it means to be the {{HERO}} again. I'll be seein' you.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith that, Murphy turned and walked out into the rain, leaving his interlocutor alone with a badly-drawn map and the weight of a choice they hadn\u2019t even realized they could make.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\" style=\"\"]]\n\nSite-180 was in a state of panic when Level 3 Researcher Nadia Dalton reached the main atrium the next morning. Before she could arrive at her desk, she was called away to discuss containment solutions for SCP-2786, of which she had little.\n\n\n\nWhile walking to her meeting, she imagined a towering, faceless thing. That empty Archetype, above and below, driven mad by boredom and toying with reality just because it can and is generally a pain in the ass.\n\n\n\nHer mind was returned to focus by the husky visage of Site Director Lewis, who was holding two fingers to his neck while he stared at the watch on his other hand.\n\n\n\n\"Tell me you have something, Dalton. Any leads for our cooped up little {{HERO}}? R'n'D is on elevated alert, they say it could be hours, could be days. Hard to know what with the time compression and all.\"\n\n\n\nShe took a breath. \"I spent last night searching for new sites of interest. I have a list.\" Nadia retrieved a small notebook and padded through the pages. \"These here are known for high density traffic by Serpent's Hand members, a few occultists of varying faiths, a type green or two. I put an ad up last night.\"\n\n\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing before I left this morning. I'll check again now.\"\n\n\n\nNadia trudged across the floor and into one of Site-180's few computer labs, her superior following shortly behind her. Each contained a few rows of screens, all hooked up to the SCPFnet database as well as a limited internet connection. Hopping onto one of the terminals, she navigated to the onion link of one of the more popular occult forums and found her post inquiring about constructed narrative realities. She had one reply. She could hear Lewis scoff as they realized who had sent it.\n\n\n\n\"At least they are persistent.\" She exclaimed in a joking-but-not-really-happy sort of way.\n\n\n\n\"You may joke, but we are out of options, Nadia.\"\n\n\n\n\"But\u2014\"\n\n\n\nTheir conversation was cut short by a knock on the door. One of the younger techs, one of the many that she had forgotten the names of over the years, hung in the doorway. He was pale and hyperventilating.\n\n\n\n\"You guys have to come see this.\" He managed between breaths. \"Something is happening\u2014 //Something new.//\" \n\n\n\nThe feeling of a balled up fist found its way into Nadia's throat. She followed the panicked tech through the labyrinthine halls of Site-180, Site Director Lewis close behind. The sense of urgency in the young man\u2019s steps made her stomach twist. She had seen this kind of panic before, and it rarely ended well.\n\n\n\nAs they entered the main observation room, the atmosphere was still, a hot and stuffy feeling, despite the active ducts pushing cold air that tasted of freon into the space. On the two monitors in the center of the room, warning boxes and error messages populated their surface, all regarding the status of SCP-2786's simulated containment complex. Or rather, the lack of SCP-2786 in the simulated containment complex. Fear began to rise within Nadia as she suspected her worst case scenario has come. Director Lewis gripped at the table next to him, and Nadia was convinced he had just came to the same realization as she.\n\n\n\nThe room was silent save for the frantic tapping of keys on a keyboard and the thorough writing of notes on clipboards. Technicians and researchers gathered in unlikely union as they stared at the screens with a mixture of negative emotions depicted on their faces.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Lewis demanded, his voice cutting through the room.\n\n\n\nOne of the senior researchers, a pale, wiry man named Dr. Halverson, turned from the monitors. \u201cSCP-2786 entered what we believe to be an emergent narrative construct within the simulation. The anomaly... has completely vanished from our detection.\"\n\n\n\nLewis frowned, a vein on his shiny forehead bulging. \u201cYou\u2019re saying SCP-2786 escaped?\u201d\n\n\n\nHalverson shook his head. \u201cNo. There's no indication that it has truly exited. But with reality benders like this, we simply don\u2019t know,\u201d Halverson admitted, frustration and fear lacing his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just gone. No heat signature, no data transfers, no energy readings, no narrative imprint. It\u2019s as if it ceased to exist, but I refuse to be so optimistic.\u201d\n\n\n\nDirector Lewis stared at Nadia, she knew what he was thinking before he said it, so she said it first. \"I'll reach out to Jamie. Perhaps it's not too late.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\" style=\"\"]]\n\nThe labyrinth was not what the {{HERO}} had expected. They kept imagining a dark, cobblestone-lined dungeon, where ominous torchlight bathed grungy corridors and growling treasure chests threatened to consume those whose avarice got the better of them. It sounded absurd, because the {{HERO}} could not remember where they had gotten the image from. The map they followed was a fool's path through the gridlines of the city, turns that looped back on themselves and backtracked for a dozen streets. The {{HERO}} knew this game, however, and thus followed the instructions precisely. \n\n\n\nTwisting around the same hollow skyscraper for the fifth time, the layout changed. The intersecting roads of the city vanished, the buildings that lined the blocks became impassable walls, windows suddenly leading to solid brick and mortar. It was only until they were fully lost within the concrete maze that the {{HERO}} realized they had found the Labyrinth. And it was only after the {{HERO}} had meandered, by complete chance, into the heart of that very same labyrinth that they came to understand its true nature. It wasn\u2019t just a maze\u2014it was a product of ancient worlds, a framework that would find itself repeated in cycles, in different time periods, different presentations. It was another Archetype, one of a pair. {{[[[SCP-1893|THE LABYRINTH AND THE MINOTAUR]]]}}. \n\n\n\nThese were the Words scrawled across the yellowed walls of the inner maze. The {{HERO}} could not remember when they went from outside to inside, from city to carpeted hallway, but the hum of fluorescent lights and the muted, endless rooms brought about a certain monotony-induced anxiety in the {{HERO}}. It whispered, rearranged itself, and for a moment, the {{HERO}} thought they would be lost forever, wandering these back rooms for the rest of time. Even the map Murphy had given them, initially so solid and sure, now trembled, struggling to orient itself. Its lines and markers blended into text that simply read, \"Go left? Or maybe right? The choice is yours, but the walls know more than us both.\"\n\n\n\nThe maze pulsed as if reading the paper's thoughts, and the protagonist fell through the solid floor. When they looked up next, there it stood. The Minotaur, towering above.\n\n\n\nIts tattoos coiled and shimmered, not just with ink but with prose, phrases crawling across its skin, weaving and unweaving themselves like a living manuscript. Adorning its head like a crown, its horns spiraled outward, fracturing reality into shards as it spread into branches. Like two trees made of bone, with leaves of glass, each piece a window into a different world. A different... //story//.\n\n\n\nThat feeling from before returned, threatening to pry more ignorance off of the {{HERO}}'s perception. The air shifted.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the {{HERO}} stood in an old tavern, the kind that smelled of stale mead and faint smoke from a woodburning stove. The Minotaur was behind the bar, wiping a glass with some gray fabric, holding it close to the eye before frowning and rigorously attempting to buff out some unseen imperfection.\n\n\n\nAs the {{HERO}} approached, their adversary kept its eyes trained on the glass and the dirty rag it worked with.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou finally made it,\u201d it said, still not looking up. Its voice was low, a rumble that resonated in the {{HERO}}\u2019s ribs. The words weren\u2019t just spoken, they were also written, appearing in midair before folding themselves into the pages of a leather-bound book on the bar counter.\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} hesitated, feeling the unseen weight of their actions pressing against the invisible barriers of the narrative itself. Every step they\u2019d taken, every thought they\u2019d had, was being transcribed, and had always been prescribed. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the {{HERO}} asked, though the protagonist didn\u2019t know what they meant by asking.\n\n\n\nThe Minotaur tilted its head, the tattoos on its arms reshaping into lines of dialogue:\n\n\"Because you wrote me here.\"\n\n\n\nThe labyrinth flickered again. Now it was a dimly lit office, stacks of paper and half-filled coffee mugs scattered everywhere. The Minotaur sat across a desk, wearing a pair of reading glasses, flipping through a file labeled {{HERO}}.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have a knack for questions,\u201d it said. Its tone was different now\u2014lighter, conversational. The story's words were scrawling themselves on a typewriter that rattled away in the corner. \u201cBut you should know by now, you don\u2019t beat me with answers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the {{HERO}} inquired.\n\n\n\nThe Minotaur\u2019s grin was a world unto itself. \u201cYou already know, don't you? I\u2019m not a creature to be slain. These walls will never be demolished. We are //iterations.// I\u2019m a story. Your story. Thus, you, my dear {{HERO}}, are as much my prisoner as my author.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe creature\u2019s eyes locked onto the {{HERO}}, and for a moment, the entire labyrinth seemed to hold its breath. Then, it shrugged with annoyance.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here, but it was only a matter of time.\u201d The beast spoke, but not to the {{HERO}}, its voice rattling the fluorescent lights. \n\n\n\nBehind it, another figure sat at the typewriter, cloaked in the shadows of the edge of the room, tapping away. His smile was sharp, knowing, as though he'd been waiting for this exact moment. He leaned forward, curling his back unnaturally over the small typewriter. He spoke through pointed teeth, words that weren't meant for the {{HERO}} at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, look who wandered in. I wonder how long this one will last.\u201d After a period of silence, a confused look ran across his face. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}}, feeling the familiar-but-long-forgotten boil of noble bloodlust in their veins, spoke up. \"You looking for someone, pal? Hate to tell you, but I work alone. \" \n\n\n\nThe figure stopped typing and looked straight at the {{HERO}}. \"Then this will take no time at all.\"\n\n\n\nThe Minotaur didn\u2019t wait for a response. It charged, its tattoos unfurling into text that ripped through the air, threatening to kill, but the {{HERO}} noticed something about them they hadn't noticed before. The tattoos weren't the Minotaur's at all. They were borrowed from the typewriter used by the silhouette in the back of the room. It was writing the Minotaur's tale. Stories. More stories.\n\n\n\nAs if it could read the {{HERO}}'s mind, the words spelled out a phrase: \u201cThis is the part of the story where you lose.\u201d\n\n\n\nA glint in the mind's eye of the protagonist revealed something; a memory that was once said by a dear friend. //\"When you get there, don\u2019t think about winning. Just think about what it means to be the {{HERO}} again.\"//\n\n\n\nThe words that surrounded them both weren't just threats and quips. They were stories. Stories, they were everywhere. //Everywhere.// And they continued to realize. They realized that they indeed were the {{HERO}} of the story. Their story. It will //always// be their story. But it was their story like a child is their mother's child. The {{HERO}} did not own the story. The {{HERO}} was responsible for the safety of its inhabitants. //Of course.//\n\n\n\nThe Minotaur went to attack again, but the {{HERO}} was already on the move. They sidestepped the Minotaur and dove for the other one. Specifically, for the typewriter. Reality bent and warped away from that point in space, but the {{HERO}} persevered. They pushed with all the power inside of them, until the {{HERO}}'s fingertips lightly grazed against the paper on top of the typewriter itself.\n\n\n\nIn that moment, reality seemed to snap back to an identical scene as before. However, something was different; The man in the back of the room wasn't there. The Minotaur noticed this as well, eyes widening and narrowing as a growl escaped its lips.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re clever,\u201d it said, tattoos slowly reappearing on its body. \u201cBut you cannot outwrite him.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} smirked. \u201cNo, but I can make you rewrite yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey lunged back at the Minotaur and grabbed at the glass shards between spokes in its horns. They weren't real glass, at least at first, but when the {{HERO}} made contact, the shard became corporeal. They wrenched with force and the fragment ripped out of its socket with a sickening, wet sound. The Minotaur howled in pain, while the {{HERO}} spun the glass in their hand until a sharp point protruded forwards. They moved to deal the killing blow to the Minotaur, who only laughed as it grabbed their hand and shook the fragment onto the ground. \n\n\n\n\"I'm going to make you pay for that.\" The Minotaur assured its combatant. \n\n\n\nBut the {{HERO}} was already a step ahead. \"Should I write you a check?\"\n\n\n\nThe beast of the Labyrinth looked over to the other hand, where the {{HERO}} held Murphy's pen. Before the Minotaur could understand what was happening, the pen was pressed against the beast's skin, and the creature's eyes widened. \n\n\n\nWith the moments of opportunity left, the {{HERO}} simply wrote \"im ded //[sic]//\" across one of its tattoos. The Minotaur laughed heartily, then stopped. It looked to the {{HERO}} and tried to say something, but it couldn't. Because it was ded. Instead, the beast doubled over and flopped pitifully onto the ground.\n\n\n\nThe labyrinth buckled, collapsing inward as if it had grown tired of its own complexity. The Minotaur's tattoos dissolved to formless ink that melted off its body as it vanished into the void.\n\n\n\nThe man with the typewriter clapped slowly, emerging from the shadow once more. \u201cBravo. But you do realize this isn\u2019t over, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe {{HERO}} aimed Murphy's pen at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe smiled, fading into the shadows with a parting whisper. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll see. I always come back for the sequel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Endings are never final, {{HERO}}. Not for us.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"space quatro dark opaque large\" style=\"\"]]\n\nAberdeen Campbell was on her way back to her desk when the alarms started. Standard containment breach klaxon, which was not uncommon for Site-19, a place that had its fair share of problems. Silently, she and her coworkers stood and waited for the announcement- one that would tell them whether or not they should evacuate, hide under their desks, or pray to whatever god they choose. After a minute, they worried it would not come, that something had happened already to those above, and that //something// would soon happen to all of them. Another moment later, a sitewide tone echoed through the hallways, followed by:\n\n\n\n\"Attention Site-19 personnel. Containment breach of unknown magnitude in progress. Evacuate immediately. Avoid AO Warehouses if at all possible. AO Warehouse B confirmed compromised.\"\n\n\n\nSo, something had gotten loose in the Anomalous Objects warehouses, the place where mundane artifacts go to die. Something that had been a little more dangerous than the folks who dropped it off there had realized.\n\n\n\n\"Attention Site-19 personnel. Containment breach of unknown magnitude in progress. Evacuate immediately. Avoid travel through AO Warehouses. AO Warehouse A and B confirmed compromised.\"\n\n\n\nAnd it was heading this way, by the looks of it.\n\n\n\nCampbell's desk was eight floors below the surface of the planet. Her colleagues had already begun their ascent, but she hadn't moved. Was she paralyzed with fear? Anticipation? She wasn't sure. Something in her gut told her not to go up. Sure, there weren't any other ways out besides through the surface, where the unknown threat approached. Perhaps, she had thought, they would recontain it soon enough, and there would be no need for an evacuation, the day would continue as it normally does.\n\n\n\nThe klaxon cut short abruptly a second later. Then, the light disappeared with the loud whir of power loss followed by silence, the entirety of the Site-19 campus plunging into darkness. Aberdeen stood, eyes waiting to adjust, heart pounding as a new sound started, a commotion in the upper floors. Then, someone screamed.\n\n\n\nThe darkness persisted, and Aberdeen waited with her heart in her throat. How long does it take for the backup generator to kick in? Why did the lights fail in the first place?\n\n\n\nUnknowns filled the gaps in Campbell's mind, the seeds of anxiety, growing in a multitude of paths. She pushed past these mental thickets until she could see the trails again; there were two stairwells that ran the depth of the facility, used primarily for emergency situations, and a dozen or so elevator shafts, which would almost certainly be nonfunctional in this state. The stairwells were her best\u2014and perhaps only\u2014shot.\n\n\n\nCampbell moved cautiously, her hands outstretched in the suffocating darkness as she navigated the rows of cubicles. Her breath was shallow, her heart pounding like a drumbeat in her ears. //Stay calm. One step at a time.// She chided herself for leaving her phone at her desk. as a flashlight would have been a boon in this moment, though it wouldn't have done very much else without service, which it never had below ground. Who knows, maybe the light would've been too dangerous to wield. It could have given her away.\n\n\n\nHer thoughts were broken by a noise, cutting through the now absolute silence with a faint rustling. The commotion grew louder and morphed into the fluttering of hundreds of tiny wings. A swarm of small creatures burst past her, their soft but unseen exteriors brushing her face and hair. Campbell recoiled, nearly stumbling over into a desk on her right. Her mind raced. //Bats?// Too small. //Bugs?// Her head spun at the thought of how many unknown //things// could be lurking in the shows around her. As they disappeared into the void, their frantic movement etched a strange, almost purposeful pattern in their configuration. Of what, Campbell could not know, nor did she want to.\n\n\n\nCampbell shivered, her pulse racing. She thought about how little meaningful experience she had with anomalies. She knew the research reports, the training manuals, the protocols, but she'd never faced anything firsthand that she'd remember now. In effect: she was unprepared.\n\n\n\nThe researcher turned a corner, reaching a hallway leading to the stairwell, but froze in her tracks. Something glowed faintly ahead, stepping through the wall to her left. It was humanoid, its features blurred, shifting in appearance. The figure didn\u2019t acknowledge her, gliding silently and confidently through the wall on the right as if she were irrelevant. She was okay with irrelevance if it kept her alive.\n\n\n\nHer chest tightened. She exhaled slowly, steadying herself. //Don\u2019t think. Just move.//\n\n\n\nThe stairwell door was cold under her hand as she pushed it open. The darkness inside was oppressive, the emergency lights still inactive. As she ascended, the sounds of chaos from above grew louder\u2014the grinding of machines, distant screams, and what sounded like heavy metal being wrenched apart.\n\n\n\nUpon reaching the third sublevel, the cacophony stopped.\n\n\n\nA new sound emerged: a wet, heavy, sickening sound. Like dripping slime, echoing from above. Campbell halted, straining to listen. The silence around her felt unnatural, amplifying the sticky, viscous noise. Where //had// everyone gone?\n\n\n\nThen, with a hum, the emergency lights flickered on. The dim illumination revealed signage that confirmed she\u2019d reached floor minus-three. The dripping noise continued, persistent and rhythmic. She turned to the door leading to floor -3's offices, her hand hovering over the handle, but paused.\n\n\n\nThrough the small viewport, there was nothing but darkness\u2014an impenetrable black void. The absence of emergency lights on the other side struck her as wrong. Then came a metallic creak.\n\n\n\nThe glass in the viewport cracked, startling her. A slow, oozing sound accompanied it. Strands of black tar dripped from above, pooling near her feet. She looked up, horrified to see viscous, black sludge extruding through the cracks in the stairwell's ceiling.\n\n\n\nThe door groaned again, the cracks spiderwebbing. The black mass on the other side heaved, pushing against the barrier. The whispers began as if they came from everywhere at once\u2014inside her head, outside her, within the walls. Echoes of hundreds of voices, persistent and emotionless.\n\n\n\n\"Lay down. Drown yourself.\n\n\n\n\"Eat it. It tastes better than it looks.\"\n\n\n\n\"Aberdeen. Oh, Aberdeeeeeen. Let me in, we can go see your friend together.\"\n\n\n\nA loud //bam// brought Campbell to her senses, who yelped and turned, bolting down the stairs. Her footsteps echoed frantically as the sound of the tar grew louder behind her. She stumbled on the next landing and fell, landing on her shoulder which emitted a faint //pop// before returning to place. Pain shot through her arm and made her vision flash as her head spun. Not a moment later she was back on her feet and descending, three steps at a time, with no idea of where she was going and without any semblance of a plan, for that matter. She passed minus-six and kept going, her mind blank with fear.\n\n\n\nBy the time she returned to the 8th sublevel, a thunderous crash shook the stairwell. The sound of something immense, sloshing and squeezing, reverberated down the shaft. Without thinking, Campbell dashed through the door to her office floor and pushed a large filing cabinet against the doorway.\n\n\n\nShe leaned against it, catching her breath, which turned to soft sobs as she shrunk down to sit on the floor. The silence was suffocating once more, but short-lived this time. \n\n\n\n\u201cCampbell?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe voice made her jump. Dr. Amber Lombardi was standing in front of her, neatly-pressed clothing now disheveled and covered in dust.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmber? What are you doing here\u2014?\u201d Campbell whispered, sniffling.\n\n\n\n\"There's a breach, not sure what. I'm evacuating.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but, why are you //here// here.\"\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to see if you were okay.\"\n\n\n\nThe edge of Campbell's fear blunted. \"That's... That's really nice of you. But no, I'm not okay. They've blocked the way up.\"\n\n\n\nLombardi scowled. \"Damn it. I was worried about that. Do you know what caused the breach?\"\n\n\n\nCampbell shook her head, her voice trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something broke out of the AO Warehouse, something... huge. There\u2019s tar\u2014some kind of sludge\u2014coming down the stairwell. It's putrid, just awful. It\u2019s...\u201d She trailed off, shivering as she recalled the voices.\n\n\n\nLombardi nodded, her expression grim. \u201cWe need to get out of here.\"\n\n\n\nCampbell glanced at the filing cabinet against the door and then back at her interlocutor. \u201cWe can't go that way. The sludge is dripping its way down here and it started on the ground floor. Minus-three had the stuff floor-to-ceiling.

Shouldn't be too far, let's go. \u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell took a deep breath and nodded, accepting Lombardi's hand as she pulled her partner up to a standing position. Together, they began to move through the labyrinth of cubicles and halls and offices-in-offices, the distant sound of dripping black tar haunting their every step.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n\n[[image http://blightbox.wikidot.com/local--files/2box/extrad5.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n[[div class=\"logger medium\" style=\"background:none;\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"VT323\"]]MESSAGE LOG FROM:[[/span]] nadiabusiness@anononet\n\n\n\n\u00a0[[span class=\"VT323\"]]MESSAGE LOG TO:[[/span]] jaja_is_you@anononet\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"darkpanel oheader space mint slim left tiny\"]]\n\n\n\nHello, is this Jamie?

The tar-like substance seemed to loom just at the edges of their senses, and every distant creak of the facility sent jolts of anxiety through them both.\n\n\n\nThey stopped at the entrance to the second stairwell, hoping for some chance of escape. Lombardi pulled the door open, and the two peered into the passage.\n\n\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d Campbell muttered, staring at the destruction.\n\n\n\nThe stairwell had completely collapsed. Massive chunks of concrete and rebar filled the void, twisted into a grotesque monument of ruin. Dripping black tar oozed through the cracks, pooling at the bottom and creeping steadily upward.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooks like part of the ceiling gave out,\u201d Lombardi said grimly. \u201cThe tar must\u2019ve gotten to the structural supports. This whole place is coming down.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell let out a shaky breath. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. No stairs. We're fucked.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is one other way down.\u201d Lombardi replied without hesitation. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey hurried back the way they came. Campbell did not consider the need to protest until they rounded the corner and were face-to-face with a bank of elevators. The faint hum of machinery had long since vanished, leaving only silence punctuated by the soft, wet plop of tar spreading through the cracks in the facility.\n\n\n\n\"Oh. No fucking way. You cannot be serious.\"\n\n\n\nLombardi spoke with equal parts understanding and annoyance, \"Yes fucking way, and I am very serious. Do you want to try your odds with the nightmare goop? You're more than welcome.\"\n\n\n\nThe doors to the nearest shaft hung slightly open, bent and warped. Campbell hesitated, staring into the dark abyss. \"Hm. I hate this.\u201d she said under her breath.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Lombardi replied, prying the doors open further. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Careful with the ladder.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell swallowed hard and climbed in after Lombardi, gripping the cold, slick rungs of the emergency escape ladder, heading in the opposite direction one should be traveling in an emergency. The descent was slow and nerve-wracking, the sounds of the tar\u2019s relentless advance growing louder behind and above them. To stifle intrusive thoughts of an elevator car falling down on top of them, Campbell's weary voice rang out, reverberating in the elevator shaft.\n\n\n\n\"So, how did it go?\" She asked the woman beneath her, hoping Lombardi didn't realize the small talk was purely a distraction.\n\n\n\n\"How did what go?\" Campbell was pretty sure her new companion knew what she was talking about.\n\n\n\n\"Your presentation?\"\n\n\n\nLombardi didn't reply right away. After a moment, she said, \"You know... it went well. For a second there, I thought everything was gonna be okay.\" Her tone was unreadable.\n\n\n\nIt was Campbell's turn not to respond. The two climbed in silence for most of the trip, taking breaks every so often. The air in the elevator shaft quickly grew stuffy and uncomfortably warm. \n\n\n\nHalfway down, the substance began to ooze between the landing doors above them. Thick rivulets of black seeped through the cracks, dripping onto the walls and dripping dangerously close to their hands and feet.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeep going!\u201d Lombardi hissed, her voice tense.\n\n\n\nCampbell tried to focus on her movements\u2014one rung at a time, careful not to slip. She felt a cold drop of tar splatter onto the shoulder of her lab coat. The researcher stifled a scream, nearly letting go out of fear. A few moments later, she forced air back into her lungs and continued to descend.\n\n\n\nBy the time they reached floor minus-thirty-eight, the tar was inches away from overtaking the bottom of the ladder, pooled in a viscous mass Campbell took pains to jump over once Lombardi had forced the doors open. They both tumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Gateway,\u201d Lombardi said, pulling Campbell to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey sprinted through the corridors, their footsteps echoing in the silent, ruined facility. The air felt heavy, suffused with an oppressive energy that wasn't helped by the lack of proper ventilation.\n\n\n\nThe heavy outer doors of the Extradimensional Testing Lab came into view some time later, around the same time that Lombardi realized she'd lost her badge somewhere. Perhaps it snagged on something in the elevator shaft, or she had dropped it when she was running. Either way, the sound of rushing tar grew louder behind them, a deafening wave of sludge surging through the halls. There was no time to look for it.\n\n\n\nLombardi shoved Campbell toward the airlock. \u201cGet it open!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! Why me?\u201d Campbell protested, staring at the controls. \u201cIt's your department!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, dipshit. It ain't level four-point-five.\u201d Lombardi pulled the neck of her coat to reveal a lack of lanyard, glancing back as the wave of tar rounded the corner, an unstoppable tide of churning black.\n\n\n\nCampbell fumbled with her collar, trying to find her badge. A moment later, she'd succeeded. A moment after that, she was swiping her badge. Another, the door was opening. \n\n\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d Lombardi pushed Campbell inside as the tar surged toward them.\n\n\n\nThe two women stumbled into the airlock just as the sludge reached the threshold. Lombardi slammed the emergency close button, and the doors sealed shut, cutting off the deafening roar that sounded less like a flowing liquid and more like a living thing choking on an ocean of vomit.\n\n\n\nThey stood in the dim, claustrophobic space, the muffled sounds of the tar pounding against the other side.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Campbell whispered, her voice trembling.\n\n\n\nLombardi turned to the inner doorway, which had opened on its own. They both stepped into the testing lab, doors sliding shut once more.\n\n\n\nThe massive ring of machinery stood ominously in the center, its faint lights flickering in uneven pulses, casting eerie shadows across the room. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here. One way or another.\u201d\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n= \ud81a\uddb9\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n[[div class=\"row\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"column\"]]\n\n\n\n[[<image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/spiral-the-drain/spiral.png style=\"mix-blend-mode: difference;\" width=\"90%\" link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spiral-the-drain\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"column\"]]\n\n[[>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/spiral-the-drain/past.png class=\"\" width=\"90%\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> name: spiral / gate / past / extradim\n\n> author: [[*user Billith]]\n\n> license: cc-by-sa 3.0\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"/more-by:billith\">more-by:billith</a>]]\n\n@@ @@\n", "references": ["spiral-the-drain", "scp-2786", "scp-1549", "deleted", "scp-6820", "scp-2439", "system:page-tags/tag/surrealistics-dept", "tactical-theology-hub", "unreality-hub", "scp-2719", "scp-6511", "scp-3001", "until-death", "scp-8882", "final-exam", "narrativistics-and-you", "scp-3812", "murphy-law-hub", "scp-1893", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide", "sr-researcher-james-a-harkness-personnel-file", "scp-8909", "scp-8878", "scp-8180", "scp-7646", "scp-8808", "scp-8419", "scp-7959", "scp-6549", "scp-6693", "scp-7549", "scp-7912", "scp-6793", "scp-7079", "scp-7396", "scp-5861", "scp-5541", "scp-5646", "billiths-proposal", "scp-2921", "scp-1822", "scp-4888", "scp-3533", "scp-3315", "scp-3311", "scp-3335", "scp-2759", "scp-3545", "scp-3959", "scp-3330", "scp-2853", "opulence", "redact-your-life", "a-place-to-call-your-home", "your-future-is-bright", "richard-larenz-personal-log", "scp-extended-log-in-a-box", "scp-3959-restricted", "scp-meta-ex-j", "scp-1256-j", "scp-990-j", "scp-2719-j", "scp-in-a-box-j", "scp-meta-ex-j-offset", "theme:eigenmachine", "classifications-guides-and-icons-by-billith", "holes", "scranton-encabulator", "scp-8190", "scp-6183", "scp-6768", "interview-billith-narrativistics", "scp-numberonedoggo-j", "the-previous-segment-was-brought-to-you-by-a-grant-from-the", "scp-7213", "scp-7533", "scp-8888", "open-the-gate#page-top"], "tags": ["absurdism", "action", "adventure", "bleak", "breakout", "comedy", "cosmic-horror", "fantasy", "horror", "illustrated", "metafiction", "mystery", "otherworldly", "science-fiction", "surrealism", "tale"], "title": "OPEN THE GATE - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/open-the-gate", "year": 2025}, "pediatric-para-psychology": {"created_at": "2025-01-04T11:46:00", "creator": "Uncle Nicolini", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-04T11:46:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, doctor-everwood, on-guard-43, researcher-james, tale.

href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Site-43</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Nhung Ngo sat at her desk, eyeing her schedule. Though it mostly consisted of the usual suspects, today would be the first time she was going to meet a new patient, one that was causing her usually calm demeanor to falter. She had met anomalies, she had met immortal beings, she had met children.</p>\n<p>But she had never met a <a href=\"/scp-8726\">permanently 6-year-old immortal</a>.</p>\n<p>James Everwood-Reynders, the adopted son of Site-43's new resident GoI Specialist and Acroamatic Abatement Chair, was due for his bi-yearly checkup; his first since coming to Site-43 from Site-55 down in Boston. Ngo knew that he had been born from the D-Class Parenthood Program, one of probably the most messed up things she had ever heard the Foundation was actively doing. And that included whatever the hell was going on in 17.</p>\n<p>She had read his file; Ngo knew that Dr. Everwood had fought to ensure he was treated like a peer after he was brought onto their team to assist in Dr. Wondertainment research, but had somehow wound up adopting him somewhere along the way. Site-55 was a weird place, but as weird as it was, Site-43 was even weirder still. Due to it's weirdness and resident immortal/James' adopted mother Dr. Ilse Reynders, this seemed like a good place to raise him. <em>Better than 17</em>, Ngo thought.</p>\n<p>A knock at the door.</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" she said, putting on a warm smile.</p>\n<p>The door opened to reveal a person wearing a sweater with only one sleeve full and a little boy holding a Nintendo Switch, wearing a poofy jacket and knitted cap.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Dr. Ngo. I hope you don't mind we're early.\" Jay Everwood smiled at Ngo, their hand on the boy's left shoulder. \"James, <em>como se dice?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Hi.\" James didn't look up from his Switch.</p>\n<p>\"No worries at all, Jay. How is Dr. Reynders?\" She got up from her desk, picking up a clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Ilse is well. She's still obsessed with Gushers; to the point where James here can barely sneak one packet whenever we buy a box. But high fructose corn syrup aside, they are doing okay.\" Everwood laughed.</p>\n<p>\"That's great to hear. Maybe not the high fructose corn syrup bit, but I'm glad she's enjoying life. Come in, come in.\"</p>\n<p>Everwood and James entered the office, and his adoptive parent held out their hand to him, signaling to hand over the toy. James grumbled but obliged, putting his Switch into sleep mode and letting them take it.</p>\n<p>\"You'll get it back when you're done with Dr. Ngo, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay\u2026\" He pouted.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, sit on the couch and listen to what she has to say, and make sure to answer her questions. Be good. Love you.\" Everwood leaned down and kissed the top of James' head. The boy hopped up onto Ngo's couch while the psychologist sat across from him in a comfy arm chair.</p>\n<p>\"See you in an hour, Jay.\" Ngo grinned as they waved a goodbye to her, shutting the door behind them.</p>\n<p>The boy seemed standoffish. He was not making eye contact, instead opting to stare at his shoes. She cleared her throat and reached behind her ear for a pen to start taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, James. My name is Dr. Ngo.\"</p>\n<p>No response came.</p>\n<p>\"Your parent tells me you're a very sweet kid. What do you think?\"</p>\n<p>No response once more.</p>\n<p>\"Are you shy?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded, but did not look up.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's okay. I am a stranger, after all, but I'm a friend of your parents and I'm here to help you assimilate into Site-43.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does ass\u2026 assimini\u2026 assimilate mean?\" James looked up but appeared to be staring through her.</p>\n<p>\"It means to make yourself at home.\" Ngo smiled reassuringly.</p>\n<p>\"My old home was Site-55. I used to play with Rex, May, and Chidi. They were my parent's em\u2026employees.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wow, you're using big words, James. I'm sure both your parents are proud of you.\" Ngo said, looking down on her clipboard and taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know my real parents,\" he said plainly, eyes shifting back down to his shoes.</p>\n<p>Ngo wrote this down before continuing. \"Does that bother you, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, most people know their parents. Though based on your file, I know you are not exactly a normal kid.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm an ess-see-pee. Ess-see-pee-8726. My mom and dad were from Site-17, but I spent a long time with Dr. Everwood in Site-55 with Rex, May, and Chidi. But now Dr. Reynders is my mom and Dr. Everwood is my parent.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's right.\" Ngo blinked. How much had they told him about his nature? Surely telling a kid this much, especially one that was also an anomaly was against some sort of ethics code. \"Who told you all of this, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"The people I was with before Dr. Everwood,\" he stated innocently. Ngo sighed and flipped through her clipboard's attached SCP-8726 file, taking note of the fact that James had indeed originally come from Site-17.</p>\n<p><em>What a terrible place,</em> she thought. \"Well, James, we at Site-43 do things differently.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. We live in a house and not underground like everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's true. You're very smart, James.\" Ngo looked over at him, noticing he was biting his fingernails.</p>\n<p>No response.</p>\n<p>\"Is something bothering you?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why is your name Dr. No?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your name is Dr. No. Why aren't you Dr. Yes?\"</p>\n<p>Ngo was taken aback momentarily, but laughed at his question.</p>\n<p>\"My name is Dr. Ngo. N-G-O.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a weird name.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not a very nice thing to say, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry\u2026\" The boy shrunk away, somehow managing to avoid eye contact even harder.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay, you didn't know. But now you do. It's a Vietnamese name. My parents are from Vietnam.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is Vietnam?\" He looked up quizzically.</p>\n<p>\"A country in east Asia. Would you like for me to show you it?\"</p>\n<p>His eyes lit up. Ngo smiled and produced her phone from within her pocket. She unlocked it and looked up information on the country, then moved to sit behind James. Maps, images of landscapes, water puppet theater, \u00d0\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 paintings, the former imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, \u00c1o d\u00e0i, the H\u00f9ng Kings' Festival, and images of Hanoi; time continued to creep forward, and Ngo and James only became more invested in their little exchange. Eventually, he was resting his head on her shoulder as they continued to talk.</p>\n<p>After some time of sharing her culture with James, she decided it was time to get back on track. \"Very cool, right?\" she asked, locking her phone and putting it away.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah! I liked the dragons.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me too! But James, I wanted to talk to you about how you were feeling about being here.\" Ngo retreated to her armchair, leaving James behind on the couch. He seemed disappointed, but willing to accept that the cool part of meeting her was over.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You can tell me. It's my job to listen.\"</p>\n<p>James covered his face with his hands, a gesture Ngo found endearing.</p>\n<p>\"Everything you tell me is also confidential. That means I don't have to tell your parents,\" she said, taking note of his behavior on her clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" he asked, moving a finger out of the way of his left eye to peek out.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, really. Anything you want to tell me, I can't tell them.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026. I miss the kids I used to play with.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. Being around someone your age can be a good way to stay enriched. But James, there are difficulties in that because\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't get old.\" His hands left his face, which was now formed into a slight pout.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 Yes.\" Ngo sighed. \"But I know of a few people who also don't get old.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom doesn't get old.\"</p>\n<p>\"Besides her. They're all grown-ups though, so I don't know how you would get along with them.\" Her voice trailed off a bit at the end of the sentence.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay. I know how to talk to grown-ups. Even if they like to boss me around.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not here to boss you around, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're nice to me. But I know you're just a grown-up doing a job.\"</p>\n<p>Ngo paused, taken aback by the kid's bluntness. Though he hadn't strictly said as much, he had just effectively told her to take a hike for trying to psychoanalyze him.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. And right now, my job is to make sure you're doing okay. So tell me, are you doing okay, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>Again with the bluntness. There was a brief silence, accentuated by Ngo writing notes on her clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry to hear that. What else is bothering you?\"</p>\n<p>Silence. James fidgeted in his seat.</p>\n<p>\"Would you like some paper and colors to help you get your feelings out?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded vigorously, watching as the woman then stood to fetch some copy papers from her desk, alongside a pack of crayons she had bought in anticipation of his appointment. She handed them to James, who eagerly took them and started drawing on the floor of her office.</p>\n<p>\"What are you drawing there, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. So now that you're drawing, do you want to tell me what else is on your mind?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom keeps eating the Gushers. My parent says that she's just excited to have new food after something that happened to her, but they won't tell me what.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your mom\u2026 she had something bad happen to her. Something to do with\u2026 actually, I don't think they want to tell you what happened to her yet.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why what?\" Ngo asked.</p>\n<p>\"Why don't they want to tell me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because it's a lot for a kid like you to take in.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I want to know.\"</p>\n<p>\"We can ask your parent when they come to get you, how does that sound?\"</p>\n<p>James hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Good. Now, James, I want you to tell me about how you feel about your time in Site-17\u2026\"</p>\n\n<p>A knock at the door. It was Everwood, holding James' Switch. James got up and ran towards them, hugging their leg.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Dr. Ngo. How was it?\" they grinned.</p>\n<p>\"As far as psychotherapy sessions go, not very fruitful, but I'm glad to report that we have established a degree of rapport. His next session will likely be much better.\" Ngo watched as James took back his Switch and activated it again, sounds of a Pokemon battle becoming audible.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's good. I wanted to ask, can we bring him back again next week?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh? Sure. Any particular reason?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm worried that moving him to a new environment might be impacting him negatively. That and it's hard for him to make friends his age since, you know. Oh and, there's my inevitable mortality.\" Everwood's volume reduced as they spoke, but James still picked up on it.</p>\n<p>\"What does mortality mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry about it yet, kiddo.\" they fussed his hair, and he returned his focus to his game.</p>\n<p>Ngo nodded. \"I understand. It would be my pleasure to see him next week. What do you say, James? Are you looking forward to seeing me in a few days?\"</p>\n<p>He didn't respond; too enraptured by the Venonat he was battling. Everwood nudged him. \"James.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Dr. Ngo,\" he replied, looking up at her with a smile.</p>\n<p>\"Alright. We'll see you around, Nhung. Thank you.\" Everwood waved and turned with James in tow. Ngo followed them out into the hallway, arms folded and smiling as the two walked away. James looked up from his game to Everwood and tugged at their empty sleeve.</p>\n<p>\"What happened to mom?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>Ngo blanked, she had forgotten. Everwood turned to look back at her. They made brief eye contact, during which Everwood was able to discern that Ngo hadn't fully told him, but may have let some details slip. Everwood sighed and turned to James, who was looking up at them.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\" they asked, hoping it was a misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Ngo said that something bad happen to mom a long time ago. What happened to her?\"</p>\n<p>\"James, honey. This is a conversation we need to have with her present, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"But I want to know!\"</p>\n<p>Everwood sighed, kneeling down to have their head at the same level as James'. They put their only hand on his right shoulder and took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Your mom\u2026 she had an accident in the ADDC a long time ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's ADDC?\"</p>\n<p>\"Anomalous Document Disposal Chamber.\"</p>\n<p>He blinked in confusion. Everwood smiled and looked down for a moment, then back to him.</p>\n<p>\"It's where they got rid of weird books and things like that.\"</p>\n<p>James nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Anyway. She got stuck down there in 1943 and only got out a little less than four years ago.\"</p>\n<p>He started counting on his fingers before giving up at nine.</p>\n<p>Everwood laughed and Ngo grinned.</p>\n<p>\"Whatcha counting there, buddy?\" They asked.</p>\n<p>\"The years mom was in there.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're gonna run out of fingers mighty quick if you triy that.\" Everwood chuckled, fussing his hair. \"But anyway, we really should talk about this with your mom. So we'll do that when we get back to Grand Bend, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>The one-armed doctor rose to their full height and looked over to the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Nhung.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't do anything. That young man is very emotionally mature for his age.\" She shrugged.</p>\n<p>\"I'm old for my age.\" James nonchalantly said, returning his attention to his game.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Before you go, Jay. Look what James drew today.\" Ngo reached over to her desk and grabbed the paper the boy had been doodling on earlier. \"Isn't it lovely?\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"earthworm

Though it mostly consisted of the usual suspects, today would be the first time she was going to meet a new patient, one that was causing her usually calm demeanor to falter. She had met anomalies, she had met immortal beings, she had met children.\n\n\n\nBut she had never met a [[[scp-8726|permanently 6-year-old immortal]]].\n\n\n\nJames Everwood-Reynders, the adopted son of Site-43's new resident GoI Specialist and Acroamatic Abatement Chair, was due for his bi-yearly checkup; his first since coming to Site-43 from Site-55 down in Boston. Ngo knew that he had been born from the D-Class Parenthood Program, one of probably the most messed up things she had ever heard the Foundation was actively doing. And that included whatever the hell was going on in 17.\n\n\n\nShe had read his file; Ngo knew that Dr. Everwood had fought to ensure he was treated like a peer after he was brought onto their team to assist in Dr. Wondertainment research, but had somehow wound up adopting him somewhere along the way. Site-55 was a weird place, but as weird as it was, Site-43 was even weirder still. Due to it's weirdness and resident immortal/James' adopted mother Dr. Ilse Reynders, this seemed like a good place to raise him. //Better than 17//, Ngo thought.\n\n\n\nA knock at the door. \n\n\n\n\"Come in,\" she said, putting on a warm smile. \n\n\n\nThe door opened to reveal a person wearing a sweater with only one sleeve full and a little boy holding a Nintendo Switch, wearing a poofy jacket and knitted cap.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Dr. Ngo. I hope you don't mind we're early.\" Jay Everwood smiled at Ngo, their hand on the boy's left shoulder. \"James, //como se dice?//\"\n\n\n\n\"Hi.\" James didn't look up from his Switch.\n\n\n\n\"No worries at all, Jay. How is Dr. Reynders?\" She got up from her desk, picking up a clipboard.\n\n\n\n\"Ilse is well. She's still obsessed with Gushers; to the point where James here can barely sneak one packet whenever we buy a box. But high fructose corn syrup aside, they are doing okay.\" Everwood laughed.\n\n\n\n\"That's great to hear. Maybe not the high fructose corn syrup bit, but I'm glad she's enjoying life. Come in, come in.\" \n\n\n\nEverwood and James entered the office, and his adoptive parent held out their hand to him, signaling to hand over the toy. James grumbled but obliged, putting his Switch into sleep mode and letting them take it.\n\n\n\n\"You'll get it back when you're done with Dr. Ngo, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\"Okay...\" He pouted.\n\n\n\n\"Come on, sit on the couch and listen to what she has to say, and make sure to answer her questions. Be good. Love you.\" Everwood leaned down and kissed the top of James' head. The boy hopped up onto Ngo's couch while the psychologist sat across from him in a comfy arm chair.\n\n\n\n\"See you in an hour, Jay.\" Ngo grinned as they waved a goodbye to her, shutting the door behind them.\n\n\n\nThe boy seemed standoffish. He was not making eye contact, instead opting to stare at his shoes. She cleared her throat and reached behind her ear for a pen to start taking notes.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, James. My name is Dr. Ngo.\"\n\n\n\nNo response came.\n\n\n\n\"Your parent tells me you're a very sweet kid. What do you think?\" \n\n\n\nNo response once more.\n\n\n\n\"Are you shy?\" \n\n\n\nHe nodded, but did not look up.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's okay. I am a stranger, after all, but I'm a friend of your parents and I'm here to help you assimilate into Site-43.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does ass... assimini... assimilate mean?\" James looked up but appeared to be staring through her.\n\n\n\n\"It means to make yourself at home.\" Ngo smiled reassuringly.\n\n\n\n\"My old home was Site-55. I used to play with Rex, May, and Chidi. They were my parent's em...employees.\" \n\n\n\n\"Wow, you're using big words, James. I'm sure both your parents are proud of you.\" Ngo said, looking down on her clipboard and taking notes. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know my real parents,\" he said plainly, eyes shifting back down to his shoes.\n\n\n\nNgo wrote this down before continuing. \"Does that bother you, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\n\n\"Well, most people know their parents. Though based on your file, I know you are not exactly a normal kid.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm an ess-see-pee. Ess-see-pee-8726. My mom and dad were from Site-17, but I spent a long time with Dr. Everwood in Site-55 with Rex, May, and Chidi. But now Dr. Reynders is my mom and Dr. Everwood is my parent.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's right.\" Ngo blinked. How much had they told him about his nature? Surely telling a kid this much, especially one that was also an anomaly was against some sort of ethics code. \"Who told you all of this, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"The people I was with before Dr. Everwood,\" he stated innocently. Ngo sighed and flipped through her clipboard's attached SCP-8726 file, taking note of the fact that James had indeed originally come from Site-17. \n\n\n\n//What a terrible place,// she thought. \"Well, James, we at Site-43 do things differently.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes. We live in a house and not underground like everyone else.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's true. You're very smart, James.\" Ngo looked over at him, noticing he was biting his fingernails.\n\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\n\"Is something bothering you?\" \n\n\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why is your name Dr. No?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your name is Dr. No. Why aren't you Dr. Yes?\"\n\n\n\nNgo was taken aback momentarily, but laughed at his question.\n\n\n\n\"My name is Dr. Ngo. N-G-O.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's a weird name.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not a very nice thing to say, James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry...\" The boy shrunk away, somehow managing to avoid eye contact even harder.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay, you didn't know. But now you do. It's a Vietnamese name. My parents are from Vietnam.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is Vietnam?\" He looked up quizzically. \n\n\n\n\"A country in east Asia. Would you like for me to show you it?\"\n\n\n\nHis eyes lit up. Ngo smiled and produced her phone from within her pocket. She unlocked it and looked up information on the country, then moved to sit behind James. Maps, images of landscapes, water puppet theater, \u00d0\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 paintings, the former imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, \u00c1o d\u00e0i, the H\u00f9ng Kings' Festival, and images of Hanoi; time continued to creep forward, and Ngo and James only became more invested in their little exchange. Eventually, he was resting his head on her shoulder as they continued to talk.\n\n\n\nAfter some time of sharing her culture with James, she decided it was time to get back on track. \"Very cool, right?\"\u00a0\u00a0she asked, locking her phone and putting it away.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah! I liked the dragons.\"\n\n\n\n\"Me too! But James, I wanted to talk to you about how you were feeling about being here.\" Ngo retreated to her armchair, leaving James behind on the couch. He seemed disappointed, but willing to accept that the cool part of meeting her was over.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know...\" \n\n\n\n\"You can tell me. It's my job to listen.\"\n\n\n\nJames covered his face with his hands, a gesture Ngo found endearing.\n\n\n\n\"Everything you tell me is also confidential. That means I don't have to tell your parents,\" she said, taking note of his behavior on her clipboard.\n\n\n\n\"Really?\" he asked, moving a finger out of the way of his left eye to peek out.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, really. Anything you want to tell me, I can't tell them.\" \n\n\n\n\".... I miss the kids I used to play with.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. Being around someone your age can be a good way to stay enriched. But James, there are difficulties in that because--\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't get old.\" His hands left his face, which was now formed into a slight pout.\n\n\n\n\"... Yes.\" Ngo sighed. \"But I know of a few people who also don't get old.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom doesn't get old.\"\n\n\n\n\"Besides her. They're all grown-ups though, so I don't know how you would get along with them.\" Her voice trailed off a bit at the end of the sentence.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay. I know how to talk to grown-ups. Even if they like to boss me around.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not here to boss you around, James.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're nice to me. But I know you're just a grown-up doing a job.\"\n\n\n\nNgo paused, taken aback by the kid's bluntness. Though he hadn't strictly said as much, he had just effectively told her to take a hike for trying to psychoanalyze him. \n\n\n\n\"That's right. And right now, my job is to make sure you're doing okay. So tell me, are you doing okay, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\nAgain with the bluntness. There was a brief silence, accentuated by Ngo writing notes on her clipboard. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry to hear that. What else is bothering you?\"\n\n\n\nSilence. James fidgeted in his seat.\n\n\n\n\"Would you like some paper and colors to help you get your feelings out?\"\n\n\n\nHe nodded vigorously, watching as the woman then stood to fetch some copy papers from her desk, alongside a pack of crayons she had bought in anticipation of his appointment. She handed them to James, who eagerly took them and started drawing on the floor of her office.\n\n\n\n\"What are you drawing there, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a secret.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay. So now that you're drawing, do you want to tell me what else is on your mind?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom keeps eating the Gushers. My parent says that she's just excited to have new food after something that happened to her, but they won't tell me what.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your mom... she had something bad happen to her. Something to do with... actually, I don't think they want to tell you what happened to her yet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why what?\" Ngo asked.\n\n\n\n\"Why don't they want to tell me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because it's a lot for a kid like you to take in.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I want to know.\"\n\n\n\n\"We can ask your parent when they come to get you, how does that sound?\" \n\n\n\nJames hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Okay. Good. Now, James, I want you to tell me about how you feel about your time in Site-17...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA knock at the door. It was Everwood, holding James' Switch. James got up and ran towards them, hugging their leg.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Dr. Ngo. How was it?\" they grinned. \n\n\n\n\"As far as psychotherapy sessions go, not very fruitful, but I'm glad to report that we have established a degree of rapport. His next session will likely be much better.\" Ngo watched as James took back his Switch and activated it again, sounds of a Pokemon battle becoming audible.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's good. I wanted to ask, can we bring him back again next week?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh? Sure. Any particular reason?\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm worried that moving him to a new environment might be impacting him negatively. That and it's hard for him to make friends his age since, you know. Oh and, there's my inevitable mortality.\"\u00a0\u00a0Everwood's volume reduced as they spoke, but James still picked up on it.\n\n\n\n\"What does mortality mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry about it yet, kiddo.\" they fussed his hair, and he returned his focus to his game.\n\n\n\nNgo nodded. \"I understand. It would be my pleasure to see him next week. What do you say, James? Are you looking forward to seeing me in a few days?\"\n\n\n\nHe didn't respond; too enraptured by the Venonat he was battling. Everwood nudged him. \"James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Ngo,\" he replied, looking up at her with a smile.\n\n\n\n\"Alright. We'll see you around, Nhung. Thank you.\" Everwood waved and turned with James in tow. Ngo followed them out into the hallway, arms folded and smiling as the two walked away. James looked up from his game to Everwood and tugged at their empty sleeve.\n\n\n\n\"What happened to mom?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nNgo blanked, she had forgotten. Everwood turned to look back at her. They made brief eye contact, during which Everwood was able to discern that Ngo hadn't fully told him, but may have let some details slip. Everwood sighed and turned to James, who was looking up at them. \n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" they asked, hoping it was a misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Ngo said that something bad happen to mom a long time ago. What happened to her?\"\n\n\n\n\"James, honey. This is a conversation we need to have with her present, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\"But I want to know!\"\n\n\n\nEverwood sighed, kneeling down to have their head at the same level as James'. They put their only hand on his right shoulder and took a deep breath.\n\n\n\n\"Your mom... she had an accident in the ADDC a long time ago.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's ADDC?\"\n\n\n\n\"Anomalous Document Disposal Chamber.\"\n\n\n\nHe blinked in confusion. Everwood smiled and looked down for a moment, then back to him.\n\n\n\n\"It's where they got rid of weird books and things like that.\"\n\n\n\nJames nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Anyway. She got stuck down there in 1943 and only got out a little less than four years ago.\"\n\n\n\nHe started counting on his fingers before giving up at nine.\n\n\n\nEverwood laughed and Ngo grinned.\n\n\n\n\"Whatcha counting there, buddy?\" They asked.\n\n\n\n\"The years mom was in there.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're gonna run out of fingers mighty quick if you triy that.\" Everwood chuckled, fussing his hair. \"But anyway, we really should talk about this with your mom. So we'll do that when we get back to Grand Bend, okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\" \n\n\n\nThe one-armed doctor rose to their full height and looked over to the psychologist. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you, Nhung.\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't do anything. That young man is very emotionally mature for his age.\" She shrugged.\n\n\n\n\"I'm old for my age.\" James nonchalantly said, returning his attention to his game.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Before you go, Jay. Look what James drew today.\" Ngo reached over to her desk and grabbed the paper the boy had been doodling on earlier. \"Isn't it lovely?\"\n\n\n\n[[=image ngo.png]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=false | last=false| hub=yes\n\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | previous-title=The Pursuit Of Knowledge, And Other Frivolities\n\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | next-title=The World Was Quiet Here\n\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub | hub-title=On Guard 43 Hub\n\n]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wikimodule\">:scp-wiki:component:wikimodule</a> |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** ngo.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user Agente Shuffle]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-8726", "on-guard-43-hub", "scp-4003", "scp-5057", "scp-admonition-j", "scp-7573", "scp-4982", "scp-4726", "scp-es-076", "scp-5047", "scp-7221", "scp-7337", "scp-3297", "scp-1542", "scp-es-357", "scp-7724", "myocardial-infarction", "hatuey", "adoption-poster-darius", "a-passing-rain", "parawatch-intro-thread", "raisa-6147", "chasing-the-union", "two-minutes-to-midnight", "gluttony-is-impossible", "error-404-database-not-found", "daeva-cooking-and-you", "the-remains-of-the-day", "the-hermit-death-and-the-devil", "fuckmylife666", "two-coffins", "uncle-nicolini-author-page", "sciptember-2022-art", "ode-to-the-unknown-author", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "doctor-everwood", "on-guard-43", "researcher-james", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Pediatric Para-Psychology - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pediatric-para-psychology", "year": 2025}, "potato-leek-soup": {"created_at": "2025-01-01T00:16:00", "creator": "VapidPoem", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "VapidPoem", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vapidpoem", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-01T00:16:00"}, {"author": "Merehrab", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/merehrab", "comment": "SPaG fix", "date": "2025-01-01T01:55:00"}, {"author": "VapidPoem", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vapidpoem", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-02T09:33:00"}, {"author": "VapidPoem", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vapidpoem", "comment": "Added tags: bittersweet, lgbtq, slice-of-life, tale.

Let simmer for 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>After 15 minutes, try to pierce the potatos with a fork. If you can pierce them with no resistance, turn off the heat. Fish out the bay leaves, and mash the soup.

His mother hurried around, grabbing a heat-safe placemat to set the Dutch oven on. Finally, a loaf of old, pre-sliced sourdough bread was brought to the table.</p>\n<p>And they began to eat.</p>\n<p>\"Andy?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Yes?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you want to do anything tonight?\"</p>\n<p>\"Like?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I don't know. Watch a movie? Play a board game? Something. Anything, really.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heh. That's not a no!\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Their spoon is dipped into the soup. Andy eased the spoon into their mouth to taste it. <em>Hot. It is too hot.</em></p>\n<p>\"This is really good.\" He stated.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Same recipe as always?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you caught me!\"</p>\n<p>She laughed.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Do you ever talk to your Aunt Shelly?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes.\"</p>\n<p>\"How is she going along?\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright.\"</p>\n<p>\"When was the last time you two talked?\"</p>\n<p>\"A week ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah.\"</p>\n<p>A torn chunk of sourdough bread was dipped into the soup. He blew on it in a feeble attempt to cool it down before eating it.</p>\n<p>\"What about you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm?\"</p>\n<p>\"When was the last time you and her-\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh. A few weeks ago. Or a few months ago. You know?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>Minutes passed until the soup was gone. <em>Tasty, as it had always been.</em> He used the remaining sourdough to soak up all of the remaining soup in his bowl.</p>\n<p>\"I can take that if you're done with it.\" She said, outstretching her hand.</p>\n<p>\"It's alright.\"</p>\n<p>\"You sure?\"</p>\n<p>\"I can get it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, then.\"</p>\n<p>Plates and bowls clanked against each other as they were moved to the kitchen. When he was done, he emptied the Dutch oven into boxes of Tupperware and then into the fridge.</p>\n<p>The sink water rushed out of the faucet. He grabbed a sponge to vigorously scrub at the Dutch oven until every single speck of dirtiness was cleansed.</p>\n<p>Looking over at his mother, he saw her scrape chunks of food off of the plates into the trash can before they got crammed into the dishwasher.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p>\n<p>Footsteps rung as Andy Clarke ascended the staircase. He rested upon his bed as he finally entered his room. Andy allowed the warmth and heat of his body to be drained by the cool, soft bedsheets he rested on.</p>\n<p>And yet, a light shone directly on his eyes. A turn later, Andy glanced at his curtain.</p>\n<p><em>A curtain that had never quite actually fully closed.</em></p>\n<p>Several groans later, Andy rolled over on his side away from the light. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep. After twenty-three minutes, Andy's eyes opened.</p>\n<p>An urge overwhelmed him which drove him to grab his phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I found a nice place.

Luckily, the grocery store was around a five-minute walk away.</p>\n<p>Inside, he grabbed as much as he could remember as he hadn't bothered to write anything down.</p>\n<p><em>A cheap can of dried thyme,</em><br/>\n<em>A single, four-cup carton of chicken stock,</em><br/>\n<em>The first six potatoes he saw,</em><br/>\n<em>And a single head of garlic.</em></p>\n<p>His biggest pain was that he did not have or buy a vegetable peeler. Resorting to using a flimsy knife to cut off any skin or eyes, he chopped off at least a tenth of his total worth of potatoes.</p>\n<p>The potatoes were unwashed. Before, during, and after they were prepared. Dirt which clung to the potato's skin clung to the knife, which rubbed off on the clean interiors of the potatoes as they were cut. All with the flawed reasoning that he had convinced himself of being that the potatoes would be cleaned off in the bowl of water.</p>\n<p>While a rough chop was called for the leeks, they were given an impatient hacking-at by Andy. No care was given to ensure that the leeks were clean. Large chunks of soil and earth remained attached to the leeks as they were finished being prepared.</p>\n<p>At the very least, Andy didn't waste anything. He used <em>all</em> of the leeks. The roots, dried inedible leaves, and all.</p>\n<p>A realization dawned upon him at the last moment; he had no garlic crusher. Instead, he elected to use a mug to smash the garlic that was by some miracle peeled by him.</p>\n<p>Without a Dutch oven he was left no choice other than to use a simple, standard pot. The temperature was far, <em>far</em> too high. Garlic and leeks burned the second they touched the pot. Even as he smelled smoke, he let the aromatics burn for the whole three-minutes as the recipe described before he added potatoes. Thankfully, the potatoes still had some water with them and didn't burn.</p>\n<p>Whatever little chicken stock he bought was not enough. It failed to cover all of the potatoes without even being simmered down yet.</p>\n<p>A second forgotten memory came back. He had not purchased bay leaves at the store. Pushed to the back of his mind, he added in all of the spices. For all three seasonings he used, they all were produced at such a fast speed that he had to have poured in at least twice of the seasonings that the recipe called for.</p>\n<p>Unstirred, the boiling potatoes overflowed twice after he tried to cover them.</p>\n<p>The one thing Andy had remembered to purchase was a masher. He exerted nearly his full body weight on the masher to, unsuccessfully, grind the potatoes and leeks into chunks.</p>\n<p>After the fifteen minutes had passed, Andy turned off the heat and took the soup off of the burner.</p>\n<p>It was hot. It was salty. It was peppery. It tasted charred. At times it felt like he was drinking sand. He would find long strands of poorly-chopped leeks that got stuck in his teeth. It was a struggle to choke down his pathetic excuse of a soup. While he did, he opened his phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc8\"><span>Lauren</span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heyyy.

I assumed as such.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then why were you giving me such a hard time about burning it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because the concept of burnt soup sounds funny.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You should try changing it around a bit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Changing what?\"</p>\n<p>\"The recipe. Changing the temperature and whatnot to try to avoid burning it. Each stovetop might be different from another.\"</p>\n<p>\"What if I undercook it?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a vegetarian soup. Not like it'll kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know. Not too much of a chef anymore. Just try to change the recipe until you find something that you like.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Three times.</p>\n<p>Andy thrice checked the shopping list. Seventeen days had passed since he had first tried making the soup. This time, he had prepared a list of the <em>right</em> amount of <em>all the ingredients</em> that he needed. This included all of the tools that he <em>should</em> need. Paramount being a new, $65 Dutch oven.</p>\n<p>With a new vegetable peeler, the skin was easily peeled off of all of the potatoes as he needed them. Roots severed and leeks bisected, Andy ran the leeks under cold water and meticulously washed out any semblance of dirt and filth before chopping them. He still came close to having accidentally severed his fingers three times.</p>\n<p>In unison, all of his preparation saw improvement.</p>\n<p>And even then, with all of his preparation and care, he still forgot the garlic crusher. Rather than use an old reliable mug, he elected to merely peel and chop the garlic. He reasoned that the bigger chunks would burn slower, anyways. Which was what it was about.</p>\n<p>The Dutch oven was placed on the stove at a medium-low heat, as Andy now wanted to carefully raise the temperature. Still-cold butter was allowed to melt in the Dutch oven. Just enough butter had been saved from making toast that morning for it. Andy would have to run to the store to get more butter for the rest of the week, later. Finally, in went the garlic and leeks. That was it - it would be important for him to get it right. A new factor Andy had learned was to frequently stir to disperse heat and prevent burning via movement.</p>\n<p>Nervousness overswept him. It didn't seem like there was enough fat in the Dutch oven. Maybe it was too wide? Maybe something else went wrong? Regardless as the seconds passed it became more and more likely to him that something was going to burn.</p>\n<p>Andy looked around his kitchen. He knew he was out of butter, with all that he had left being a bottle of olive oil. Without much time to think, he let a glug of olive oil into the Dutch oven. That was it. The pot began to sputter and hiss at him as the olive oil dispersed throughout it.</p>\n<p>Yet, it seemed to do the trick. The veggies weren't charred. When three minutes passed, he added in stock to deglaze the pan and ensure that any burned surfaces were completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cooking time was similar to his original attempt, albeit better executed. More stock, better chunks, and better mashing all contributed. He especially placed care on the seasonings he let into the soup in order to avoid another over-seasoned mess.</p>\n<p>When the soup was done, he turned off the burner and served it in a bowl. By this point, Andy knew that he had to wait for the soup to cool down. As he waited in anticipation, he made a call.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc15\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<h5 id=\"toc16\"><span>Phone Call Record</span></h5>\n<hr/></div>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Hey Andy. What's up?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not much. Just calling back to ask about the soup.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What about it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Just the recipe you sent me.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yeah?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Are you sure you sent me the right recipe? Right ratios, cooking time, and whatnot?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Um. Yeah? I'm pretty sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Huh.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Is something wrong with it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah, no. It's just\u2026 I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, I can double-check it. It might just be something on your end; lack of experience or whatnot. I ought to've taught you how to make it when you were here.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> But I guess that means that you should visit me sometime soon, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yep. Soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You got a plan figured out yet?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not yet. But - could you just send me the recipe again? Double-check that it's the right one.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I think it is the correct one. But it's just like\u2026 better to confirm it. You know?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yeah. I'll send it to you again.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Love you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He waited, waited, waited. A wait for the soup to finally cool down. Once the wait had passed, he sipped his first bite of the soup. It was a great improvement of the first, truly. Yet it still didn't taste quite <em>right\u2026</em></p>\n<p>Presentable, sure. If he had been able to eat the first soup, this would be easy. But it still just tasted off, for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Before he knew it, the soup was gone. Immediately followed by him storing the soup in his fridge.</p>\n<p>And then came the dishes, utensils, and other implements that all sat around the kitchen. All of them, dirty.</p>\n<p>Andy pondered simply deciding to store them in the dishwasher, out of his sight and mind as they were roughly cleaned. Then he remembered his childhood, how often he pointed out dirt and residue on dishes only for his mother to dismiss him, claiming that he had OCD and was making a deal out of nothing.</p>\n<p>So he got to work. It took nearly an hour, but he did it. All of the dishes were scrubbed clean of their sin by the time he was done.</p>\n<p>His phone read <em>11:47 P.M.</em>. Which meant it was time for him to visit Quint and watch a movie.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Quint pressed a button on their remote. It activated the television. While the streaming service loaded, Quint looked through their fridge.</p>\n<p>\"You want anything?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nah.\"</p>\n<p>The fridge was then closed.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to microwave some popcorn. You sure you don't want any?\"</p>\n<p>\"You know what? Fine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heh.\"</p>\n<p>A single bag of popcorn was placed in the microwave. A few minutes passed before it was ready, at which point Quint tried to hand the bag to Andy.</p>\n<p>\"I'll wait.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's only a few minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay!\"</p>\n<p>When the second bag was ready, it was granted to Andy. He was joined by Quint as they jumped over the couch next to Andy.</p>\n<p>\"You ready?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>A button on the remote was clicked. The opening credits of <em>The Thing</em> played.</p>\n<p>At first, black completely filled the screen. Pure, empty black which was then broken by the opening credits of the movie. When the credits finished, fifty-seven stars littered the screen.</p>\n<p>One of the stars transformed into a spaceship that zoomed toward the camera and then to Earth. The spaceship landed in a cold, desolate land also known as Antartica.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The film ended with a shot of a bright fire which had engulfed the entirety of the facility, one that would inevitably burn it to the ground.</p>\n<p>A facility, built long before, soon to be nothing.</p>\n<p>\"What a movie.\" Andy remarked.</p>\n<p>\"I know, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's probably my favorite movie, honestly.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I see why.\"</p>\n<p>Fixation overwhelmed him as the final seconds of the movie played. Specifically, he paid attention to just how bright the fire was. How it made a beacon which shone in an otherwise empty, dark, and baren landscape.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know what time it is?\"</p>\n<p>He checked his phone.</p>\n<p>\"One fifty-three A.M.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus.\"</p>\n<p>\"Kinda getting late.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah\u2026 You know. Only a <em>bit</em> late.\"</p>\n<p>\"I should probably start heading back. I need to fix up my sleep schedule.\"</p>\n<p>\"That is a good idea, yeah.\"</p>\n<p>The pair stood. Quint stretched as Andy checked his phone. While Quint stretched, they saw the back of their hand. Their nails adorned dark-purple nail polish.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Andy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"You ever had your nails done before?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you want to have your nails done? Should only be about ten minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure.</p>\n<p>A set of nail polish is retrieved and brought before Andy. The set is opened and several unique shades are presented.</p>\n<p>\"Alright. Pick a color.\"</p>\n<p>\"This one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Black?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that alright?</p>\n<p>\"Of course.\"</p>\n<p>His hands eased while Quint guided them.</p>\n<p>\"Hold them steady. I don't want to get any polish on your skin.\"</p>\n<p>Over eleven minutes, Quint did Andy's nails. It took time for the polish to dry. But when it was dry, Andy held their new painted nails up in admiration.</p>\n<p>\"Wow.\"</p>\n<p>\"You like them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>10:00</p>\n</div>\n<p>An alarm blared. Andy yawned and stretched his arms, noticing the black which still covered their nails.</p>\n<p>Mono colored, pristine, semi-beautiful black. Even after a whole night's rest, it had-</p>\n<p>Their alarm blared again, now reading 10:05\u00a0A.M.</p>\n<p>It was quickly shut off, as well as the other seven alarms Andy had set to ensure he woke up around the right time every morning.</p>\n<p>Their roommate's door was open. He was relaxed on his bed and typed on his phone. He barely elected to grant Andy a glance as Andy scurried by with their hand curled into a fist to ensure that their roommate didn't see their nails.</p>\n<p>In the kitchen, Andy checked his balance.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc17\"><span>Bank</span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Aunt Shelley</strong> has sent you $275.00.</p>\n<p><em>To help you out with the first few weeks of food for college.

With the lid removed, it was set in the microwave to cook for four minutes.</p>\n<p>A reflection was visible on the microwave. While faint, Andy really had no choice but to stare into it as the minutes passed. That was until Andy raised their hand, taking a glance at their nail polish. Now, despite being a less-close look, they saw the imperfections in their nails. Minor nicks, scratches, and all sorts of blemishes dotted their nails.</p>\n<p>The faucet began pouring out water as they applied soap to their nails. There was a wait as the water began to heat. Nail polish on the edge of their nails where it met their skin curled. Andy picked at those curls in an attempt to peel off as much as they could.</p>\n<p>The water got hotter, and hotter, <em>and hotter.</em> Until it was so hot that they yanked it back in pain.</p>\n<p>Then the microwave beeped, cutting them off.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Cold. It was cold. The soup was cold. Not hot, not warm, not lukewarm, but cold. They would have put it back into the microwave to heat it further, except that merely feeling the soup seemed to overwhelm Andy with a sense of vertigo - making them sit down.</p>\n<p>A decision was reached to just eat the cold soup. Beside, Andy heard something about potato leek soup traditionally being served cold. Surely this would be good.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Abhorrent. An abhorrent, abnormally uninviting soup in stark contrast to the presentable soup the prior night.</p>\n<p>Still, Andy scarfed it down.</p>\n<p>When Andy had finished the soup, they walked to the sink and cleaned it. The soup seemed to easily wash away. At least, wash away much easier than their nail polish had. Andy looked at their nails one last time, noting how they looked similar to when they had awoken.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc20\"><span>Grocery List</span></h3>\n<hr/></div>\n<ul>\n<li>6x Potatoes</li>\n<li>1x Carton of Milk</li>\n<li>12x Cans of Soda</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>The cashier scanned Andy's select few items.

Andy put all of the groceries they had bought into their fridge and cupboards.</p>\n<p>After the last grocery is put in the fridge, they take out the final portion of potato leek soup. Their roommate is nowhere to be seen, although Andy assumed they had eaten some of it.</p>\n<p>Six minutes. The soup spent six minutes in the microwave. By the time it was done, it was so hot that Andy needed oven gloves to remove it. They knew it would be a while before it cooled down to a point of edibility.</p>\n<p>Rather than wait, Andy opened their freezer and pulled out the ice cube tray. They popped out a single ice cube and dropped it in the soup, using their spoon to stir it around.</p>\n<p>When they took a sip, the soup was palatable. Better than being eaten cold and arguably better than the night it was cooked, but still just not quite there.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:125%;\">Hello, Andy!</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>You have started your shift at 16:58.</p>\n<p>Your shift is scheduled to end at 22:30.

They opened their laptop to pass later into the night.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, Andy grew curious.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Search the web</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Prettiest nail polish colors</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Tutorial for applying nail polish at home</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Where to buy nail polish in Boulder, Colorado</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Andy watched as an unfamiliar person left Quint's apartment and walked to a car. As they drove away, Andy moved to knock on Quint's door.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Andy.

I've wanted to cut my hair short for a while. Takes less care.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm starting to grow mine out. Save money on getting haircuts.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.

Although I did read something about how he ended up hating his hair.\"</p>\n<p>\"You ready?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep.</p>\n<p>It took a minute, but Quint retrieved thirteen different shades of nail polish and brought them to the table in front of Andy.</p>\n<p>\"Pick one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Black is fine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pick another.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dark blue?\"</p>\n<p>\"And another.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know.

You're going to want to start with the nail base-\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Late at night, Andy laid in bed and watched videos on their phone. Video after video on Youtube of short, two-to-five-minute-long nail polish tutorials.</p>\n<p>A method they had been taught by their scrolling was finally fully functionally devised.</p>\n<p>Before Andy could enact it, they moved to their bathroom with nail polish. They tried as hard as they could to be quiet as they knew their roommate was asleep.</p>\n<p>A bottle of nail polish remover was opened, soon placed on Andy's nails in an effort to wear out the paint.</p>\n<p>One minute passed. Then two minutes. Then three minutes.</p>\n<p><em>Then five minutes.</em></p>\n<p>After exactly seven minutes a nozzle is turned and hot water begins to pour out of the faucet. Nail polish which touched Andy's skin had already began to peel and curl up. Andy grabbed the nail polish and meticulously peeled off as much as they could.</p>\n<p>Streaks and dots of nail polish once again littered their nails. Running their nails under the hot water did help, although specks of nail polish remained never-the-less.</p>\n<p>A short trip to the kitchen saw Andy grab a few sheets of paper towels before they retreated to their room.</p>\n<p>The paper towels were strewn on the table. Andy grabbed the dark purple nail polish, nail base, and coat.</p>\n<p>Nail base came first. It flowed along his nails, although admittedly a bit too much was applied.</p>\n<p>Then came the first layer of nail polish. Although inconsistent in its application, it generally avoided overlap onto their skin.</p>\n<p>Five minutes passed.</p>\n<p>Then came the second layer of nail polish. Now, it coated every atom of their nails and more. In several cases it fell onto their skin.</p>\n<p>Andy picked away at the excess nail polish with a nail file attached to their nail clipper to scrape off as much as they could. But still a thin layer solidified within seconds of it being applied, fusing to their skin.</p>\n<p>Five minutes passed.</p>\n<p>And the coat was applied over all of the polish.</p>\n<p>What Andy was left with was obvious. <em>A disaster.</em> Their nails were bumpy, the nail polish looked ugly, nail polish had gotten stuck under their nails. It was a fiasco.</p>\n<p>And yet, it hardly mattered. It was <em>theirs.</em> They had applied the nail polish on their own. Never mind the imperfections, Andy was left in admiration of their work.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>In the parking lot, Andy was left in panic. It was a quick trip, with them only needing to grab one item.</p>\n<p>But, their nails remained. Near-pristine. <em>As pristine as shoddily-applied nail polish could be.</em></p>\n<p>When they left their car their fingers were curled into a fist. It was enough for Andy to feel comfortable walking in public with markings on their nails.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven seconds passed after Andy entered the store. They passed a clothing aisle. A previously fast pace slowed down as an outfit got caught in the corner of their eye.</p>\n<p>A mannequin adorning a long, brown pocketed skirt, a mini-belt, and a long-sleeved brown shirt.</p>\n<p>Their phone rang.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc21\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<h5 id=\"toc22\"><span>Phone Call Record</span></h5>\n<hr/></div>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy!</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Hey.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Is now a good time to talk for a bit?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not really.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Aww.

You liking your new classes?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> So far\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> How about, um\u2026 That apartment of yours! Is it doing you well?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I like it. It's been a lot less stressful than the dorms.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I still think you're overplaying it a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Come on.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I mean - no use arguing it now. It's over with. But still.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> So, yeah\u2026 To be frank, I'm not sure that I like my roommate too much.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. He's been eating all my food, not doing dishes. All that stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well that's just what happens when you rent your own place. Stuff isn't so easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> And that wouldn't have happened in dorms?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> People had a lot more manners back when I was in the dorms. When I moved out-</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Hang on- I need to grab something real quick. I'll have to call you back later.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, hang on. Just another minute or two?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah\u2026 Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> How's that soup coming along for ya? Did you have the right recipe?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah, I did.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Did it work out better the second time around?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. Did end up tweaking the recipe around a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I think my stovetop is wonky. Had to adjust the heat, add in a bit of olive oil.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy! You should have called me first.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I mean - I did. Just, right before I started cooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You- \u2026 Andy, you know what I meant.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Oh? Sorry, then. Don't see how it was that big of a deal.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What did you change with it? What was the whole recipe you used?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Um. Pretty much the same recipe? I just changed around the cooking time a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Okay. What was the whole recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't remember-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, there you go! That's cause you didn't follow a recipe. And now you're complaining about how it turned out bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mom-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What?!</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't remember it off the top of my head!</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Do you have a copy of it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Uh huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> All that I changed was the cooking time because I burned the garlic the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> One of my friends suggested it.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Who?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> His name is Quint. They-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What was the greater context surrounding that?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just brought it up.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> All do respect to Quint, whoever he is-</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Quint doesn't go-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> -but this recipe has been in our family for generations and generations. All due respect to him, but I trust the family recipe more than him. You know?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yup\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy, here's my idea. I think you should try the recipe a few more times before you alter it to your own taste. That sound good?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I was kinda planning on that. Changing it around until I know exactly how to avoid mistakes and all.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> But, I want you to call me whenever you make it. No listening to friends or making up how to cook it on the fly. Instead I need you to let me in on everything you do. Okay?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Okay\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<p>Deep breaths. Deep, deep breaths.</p>\n<p>Breathing did not help.</p>\n<p>Andy tried to continue their search toward the store. They just needed an immersion blender for the soup. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>They found their legs becoming stiff, which did not help Andy as their pace nearly tripled. Sweat formed on their brow. It dripped down their forehead into their eye. Whatever control Andy had of their breathing vanished as Andy found themself unable to breath.</p>\n<p>Then Andy saw a unisex bathroom. Without a second thought, the door was opened then slammed behind them with nearly full force. The door was locked behind them.</p>\n<p>It took nineteen paces around the small, cramped room for Andy to finally breathe again.</p>\n<p>Now able to breathe, they sat on the toilet for five minutes. With a jolt, they rose to the mirror. Their eyes had gotten beet red, although no tears had formed.</p>\n<p>Their thumb and index finger moved to their sinus and pinched hard. A minute passed and Andy swallowed.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc23\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<h5 id=\"toc24\"><span>Phone Call Record</span></h5>\n<hr/></div>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just wanted to say something else-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just wanted to talk a bit about the recipe - what I am thinking about it and whatnot.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Okay. What about it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It was just\u2026 being put on the spot like that. Randomly called.

I can't do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I'm not going to yell at you.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> So what is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It's just more- what I'm thinking is that I change the recipe a bit while I learn how to cook. Avoid burning things and everything like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> And that just applies to cooking temp?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mostly. I'm also getting an immersion blender-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Because I don't like how chunky I cut the potatoes.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy! That's one of the biggest parts of the recipe! It's supposed to have chunks in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't\u2026 really agree with that. I just think-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Sorry, but I don't think you're making the same soup anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It's just one thing-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> It's two. The temp, now this. Next you're going to tell me something else, and then something else. It's not the same soup anymore, just admit that.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mom! I-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Stop. I told you that I can't argue right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Okay then! Sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> So stop yelling at me, stop arguing with me, and be honest with me that it isn't just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It was just the temp thing. The blending thing's only something that I might do.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Might?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't know. Just see if I like it more.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I think you're changing your answers now; which I don't really like.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> That was always what I was going to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I don't like it when you lie to me, sweetie.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You know what, Andy? I'm not doing this, today. I've barely had any energy today and I just can't argue with you right now. You can't admit when you're wrong and just keep lying and I\u2026 I just can't.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Sorry\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Look- Andy, I love you. But that's not the same soup and it won't ever be. Unless you change it back, it's fundamentally different. And lets just leave it at that. Agreed?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yep.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I'm going to go. I have to take a shower. Love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Love you\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<p>The call ends.</p>\n<p>They let out a scream.</p>\n<p>A scream they hoped wasn't heard by anyone. Really, really hoped.</p>\n<p>It took another twenty-three paces to calm down. When they stopped, they looked in the mirror. The sight of their reflection overcame them with a need to cry.</p>\n<p>Their best effort to suppress their tears were in vain. It couldn't be held in forever. As he realized that truth, Andy let themself cry for only one minute.</p>\n<p>A paper towel was produced by the dispenser and used to soak up any water around Andy's eyes. Still, they were bloodshot. At best, Andy hoped that the cashier would think they were high.</p>\n<p>It took them a lot, but they managed to convince themself to leave the bathroom.</p>\n<p>There was no point in getting the immersion blender anymore. So they went to leave the store. Two employees looked at them, an act that confirmed they had heard Andy's scream.</p>\n<p>Right before they left, Andy's eye was caught once more. The outfit. On a discount, no less.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>$45.99</p>\n</div>\n<p>And it was silly. They didn't have that much to spare - couldn't afford any split-second purchases.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Except they could. It was priced the same as an immersion blender.</p>\n<p>Andy looked around for a price tag. Eventually, Andy found that it was priced at $45.99. Andy didn't know if they had that much to spare. Nor why they were even considering it.</p>\n<p>But, they had decided not to buy the immersion blender. They would, in all likelihood, be a similar price. Andy toiled and considered.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Will that be all for the day?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>\"Total should be around $45.99.\"</p>\n<p>The cashier was handed a credit card.</p>\n<p>\"It's for my sister.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Her birthday is coming up. Wanted to get her something nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, she must be pretty lucky. It's a pretty nice dress.\"</p>\n<p>\"It really is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like a receipt?\"</p>\n<p>\"No thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Have a great day.\"</p>\n<p>They knew.</p>\n<p>The cashier knew.</p>\n<p>Andy could see it in their eyes.</p>\n<p>Outfit in hands, they left the store as fast as they could, getting in their car and screaming.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc25\"><span>Roommate</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>You going to be here tonight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where are you going to be at?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>A party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just curious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Even though their roommate would be gone, Andy instinctively locked themself in their bathroom.</p>\n<p>They took off their jacket, then their belt, then their jeans, then their shirt, then their socks, and finally their boxers.</p>\n<p>And then they were nude. Completely.</p>\n<p>Immediately followed was a feeling of relief. Their clothes had been a bit tight on them.</p>\n<p>Andy glanced over at the door to confirm it was locked. With the final confirmation, Andy opened the bag.</p>\n<p>Three components.</p>\n<p>A skirt. A shirt. And a belt.</p>\n<p>It quickly dawned on them that they would need a bra and panties to comfortably complete the set.</p>\n<p><em>Complete the set?!</em></p>\n<p>They hardly knew why they bought the outfit in the first place. Yet, they put it on piece-by-piece-by-piece, followed by a glance in the mirror.</p>\n<p>And they were beautiful.</p>\n<p>Although not the perfect fit, the clothes were the most comfortable thing Andy had ever worn. It fit their shape well, the fabric was soft. Oh, it was soft.</p>\n<p>Andy began to cry. Not tears of stress, exhaustion. Rather tears of emotion, elation.</p>\n<p>Andy turns, and turns, and turns, and turns, and turns. They adore every angle, every aspect of their outfit.</p>\n<p>It takes five minutes before Andy seems to snap out of adoration. They mechanically exit the bathroom and retreat to their bedroom, electing to lock the door before they passed out on their bed.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Missed Call: Quint <em>8:42 P.M.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026<br/>\n\u2026<br/>\n\u2026</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Missed Call: Quint <em>8:44 P.M.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026<br/>\n\u2026<br/>\n\u2026</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Missed Call: Quint <em>8:47 P.M.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc26\"><span>Quint</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>heyyyy</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>r u okay?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>anyways, was wondering if u wanted to head to my place later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>just to watch a movie</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>let me know when u get this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>\u2026\u2026.<br/>\n\u2026\u2026.<br/>\n\u2026\u2026.<br/>\n\u2026\u2026.<br/>\n\u2026\u2026.<br/>\n\u2026\u2026.<br/>\n\u2026\u2026.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sorry.

After a stretch, they look down and realize they still adorn the same clothes as the night prior.</p>\n<p>Panic ensued. They tore off the outfit, nearly ripping it while they undresssed. Now naked, Andy rushed to put on a t-shirt, boxers, pajama pants, and a matching flannel before they were ready.</p>\n<p>The removed clothing was crammed into a ball and thrown on their bed.</p>\n<p>They sighed, then remembered that the previous night they had planned to make potato leek soup, but never did.

Andy had very, very closely followed the original recipe. Even with a call to their mother, it didn't work.</p>\n<p>Same temp, same cooking time, same ratios, same ingredients, and a same everything as the recipe had called for.</p>\n<p>Andy tried their best to eat the soup. They had eaten every other soup before. Every other, awful soup.

It just had to.</p>\n<p>All of the soup they had made was inedible. It was disgusting, <em>repulsing</em> to eat.</p>\n<p>So much food went to waste all in a single moment. They went to their fridge to find some food, <em>any food.</em></p>\n<p>Before they could choose, they ran to the bathroom and vomitted.</p>\n<p>When they finished, they wiped the vomit off of their lip and went to their bedroom. Seeing a glass of water, they emptied it.</p>\n<p>And collapsed on their bed.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Tossed and turned, turned and tossed. They tossed around for twenty-seven minutes.</p>\n<p>All they wanted was to be able to close their eyes and rest. But, they couldn't.</p>\n<p>Andy shot up, sitting in their bed. They turned, their eyes locking almost like a magnet to the dress that laid on their bed.</p>\n<p>With a single motion, they grabbed the dress. Their nausea seemingly having faded away.</p>\n<p>The soft fabrics melted in their hands, each silky fiber feeling soft and beautiful as ever.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Then,</p>\n<p>without a single reason,</p>\n<p>they tore the dress.</p>\n</div>\n<p>First in half, then in fourths, then in eigths, then in sixteenth\u2026</p>\n<p>Within moments, it was reduced to scraps and shreds. Andy made very well sure to give the other parts of the outfit attention. The belt was snapped, the sleeves ripped off the shirt before themself being halved.</p>\n<p>Massive holes were ripped through the shirt until it was nothing but a rag.</p>\n<p>Five minutes passed. Shreds laid in Andy's hands and around their room.</p>\n<p>They breathed and picked up what scraps they could to throw any away.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc31\"><span>Quint</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>You want to eat out?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Quint had arrived.

That's rough.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's just like\u2026 A <em>really, really</em> small part of the recipe and she was freaking out about it.\"</p>\n<p>\"What happened after that?\"</p>\n<p>\"She called me a few more times the next time I made soup.\"</p>\n<p>\"Still freaking out?\"</p>\n<p>\"Still freaking out.

You know - I made some earlier, followed the recipe word-for-word, and it still tasted like shit.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's definitely because you just haven't tried it enough.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"When are you leaving?\"</p>\n<p>\"The 21st.

Despite just eating, they were hungry.</p>\n<p>The fridge door opened and the note they had left was gone. <em>As well as one of their energy drinks\u2026</em></p>\n<p>It was at that moment Andy decided to move out.</p>\n<p>They grabbed pre-cooked, cold spaghetti noodles out of the fridge. Rather than microwave them, Andy put grated parmesan on them and moved to their room with a fork to eat them cold.</p>\n<p>Not bothering to turn on a light, they sat in front of their laptop and quickly finished the pasta. A sigh left Andy's mouth as they looked at an essay they had to write.</p>\n<p>400 words done.</p>\n<p>3,000 words needed.</p>\n<p>A clock read <em>10:52 P.M.</em></p>\n<p>They had time, plenty of time. They just needed to write.</p>\n<p><em>11:55 P.M.</em></p>\n<p>500 words done.</p>\n<p>3,000 words needed.</p>\n<p>The laptop screen was left open as they moved to their bed. Curled up in a ball, facing away from the light, and they eventually saw a scrap.</p>\n<p>Despite being only a thousandth of the original's glory, it had all the pull. Both eyes locked on the shred as their hand outstretched to grab it.</p>\n<p>Andy let out a gentle laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Must've been poor quality- with how easy it was to tear\u2026\"</p>\n<p>They wrapped their body around a pillow, cooling off with shred still in hand.</p>\n<p>\"Wouldn't have lasted if I wore it more than once\u2026\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Wore it where?</em></p>\n<p><em>In their room?</em></p>\n<p><em>In public?!</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>No no, they wouldn't have. It made sense for them to rip it; they didn't need it. They simply didn't.</p>\n<p>Yet Andy did not know why they were holding on to the last scrap of fabric so tightly.</p>\n<p><em>12:21\u00a0A.M.</em></p>\n<p>They went to their desk and shook their cursor around to turn on the screen.

An excuse why they didn't buy it. They couldn't drop 1/5th of their money on makeup! Not at the moment.</p>\n<p>And then Andy remembered how much cheaper it was to buy things in person vs online\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The cashier didn't believe them. There was no way. Literally no way. It was like when Andy bought the dress.</p>\n<p>They claimed it to be for Christmas shopping, a gift for their mother. The cashier didn't buy it for a second. At the very least, they <em>suspected</em> it. Buying <em>all of that makeup</em> for one person who'd likely <em>already have it?!</em></p>\n<p>Andy only hoped.</p>\n<p>They locked the bathroom door behind them and dropped the bag on the counter. Their roommate was there, so they had to be careful.</p>\n<p>Andy started with the eyeliner - which was shakily applied. It curved and swayed as dots of skin peeked out throughout both of their upper eyelids.</p>\n<p>Next up - the blush. The kit came with four different colors. The initial blush that Andy applied hardly matched their skin tone. Andy grabbed a wet towel and tried to wipe off the blush. Yet, it persisted. After Andy's face was dried off, Andy tried to apply a different kind of blush. All that Andy was left with were patches of dust that clinged to their face that were either too red or too pale for their skin tone.</p>\n<p>Then; the lipstick. They went with the red lipstick. The lipstick overlapped from their lips to their skin until they were left with a bumpy, shoddily applied red coating their lips.</p>\n<p>The only thing that could save the day was the mascara. Their eyelashes were coated, and came off being longer. Much to Andy's shagrin, the mascara was hardly noticeable.</p>\n<p>Even with it being the best application, tiny dots of black which stemmed from the mascara hit their upper eyes.</p>\n<p>Andy looked into the mirror to see an object of horror. Although recognizable who was behind the mask, it was a hard sight.</p>\n<p>Yet, the tiniest twinge of pride overcame them. It was their first time trying and not all that bad. But they simply couldn't avoid how bad it looked at first.</p>\n<p>Andy heard their roommate walking throughout the house and sighed. They grabbed the towel and cleaned their face.</p>\n<p><em>Then nothing came off.</em></p>\n<p>The towel was soaked in water before being applied directly on their face. They panicked, scrubbing as hard as they could to get it off.</p>\n<p><em>It was water resistant. All of it was!</em></p>\n<p>They glanced into the mirror, seeing the makeup merely smudge on their face without coming off.</p>\n<p>Their roommate would certainly notice if they saw. They would notice, and they would <em>judge</em>. Especially for how bad the makeup was.</p>\n<p>Andy jumped into the shower and turned on the water. It was still freezing cold, and it remained freezing for the rest of the shower.</p>\n<p>When they finished, they dried off their face and looked into the mirror.</p>\n<p>Remnants of the makeup stayed, but they were more discrete. Much of their eyeliner and lipstick had washed off. All that remained was a hardly-noticeable shadow of the makeup they had just tried to apply.</p>\n<p>As the bathroom door unlocked, they saw their roommate.</p>\n<p>They were concise and told the roommate that they planned to move out soon.</p>\n<p>The roommate asked why.</p>\n<p>Andy told them why.</p>\n<p>The roommate asked what day.</p>\n<p>Andy said that they did not know.</p>\n<p>The roommate confirmed that Andy was leaving the house.</p>\n<p>And Andy affirmed them.</p>\n<p>Then the roommate wished them well, and thanked them for letting them know.</p>\n<p>And that was it. Andy walked into their room and picked up their phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc34\"><span>Quint</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can move in with you if you're still looking for someone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>cool</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n</div>\n<p>Andy set down their phone.

The beer is handed to Quint, who shoves the six-pack into their backpack.</p>\n<p>The pair follow a trail into the woods just into the Rockies.</p>\n<p>After roughly seventeen minutes, the pair arrived at a clearing slightly off-trail. Quint took out a blanket to place on the grass while Andy kicked off their shoes and felt the blades of grass beneath their toes.</p>\n<p>Two bottles of beer were popped.</p>\n<p>\"Feels like forever since we've hung out, huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's been a while.\"</p>\n<p>\"Especially since we've gone out here.\"</p>\n<p>\"We should come out here more.

While Andy had moved to lay on the blanket, Quint decided to lay on the grass, at least briefly.</p>\n<p>The pair stared into the stars for thirty-one minutes all while sipping their beers.</p>\n<p>At a point during the night, Andy had grabbed a third beer. By the time they were back in the car, the bottle was empty. The bottle Quint had nursed was thrown away in a trash can they found, still half-full.</p>\n<p>As the pair entered the car, Quint turned on a light to search it.</p>\n<p>\"What are you looking for?\"</p>\n<p>\"My keys.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know- you\u2026 you probably shouldn't just leave those in the car\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Heh. Probably.\"</p>\n<p>The search effort is joined by Andy. After a minute, the pair briefly lock eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Andy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you wearing mascara?\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"No, no.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>Quint discovered the key, put it in the ignition, then drove away.</p>\n<p>A chuckle left Andy's lips and they closed their eyes, leaning against their seat and nearly falling asleep.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>A key slid into the door, and it was opened.</p>\n<p>\"Let's get you into bed.\"</p>\n<p>They practically had to drag Andy to their room where they opened a door, turned on a light, and eased Andy into bed. They helped Andy remove their shoes and tuck themselves under the sheets.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to hang out here a minute- while I wait for a cab.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no- no\u2026 Don't. You can just- just take my car and give it to me tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're sure?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, yeah. Yeah\u2026 Just have a good night.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sleep tight.\"</p>\n<p>The keys to Andy's car slides into Quint's pocket.</p>\n<p>Right as they reached the door, they turned to shut off the light.</p>\n<p>Then something caught their eye.</p>\n<p><em>Blush,</em><br/>\n<em>Eyeliner,</em><br/>\n<em>Red Lipstick,</em><br/>\n<em>Black Lipstick,</em><br/>\n<em>Mascara,</em><br/>\n<em>and Nail Polish.</em></p>\n<p>All neatly packed into the corner.</p>\n<p>They picked up one of the nail polish bottles, at which point they confirmed that it was the exact same as they had given to Andy.</p>\n<p>The cap of the lipstick popped off, and it was clearly used. Smeared in only a way that application, rough application, could do.</p>\n<p>They approached Andy to look at their eyes and confirm that they were wearing mascara. With the confirmation, Quint left the room while they shut off the light behind them.</p>\n<p>\"Best of dreams.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Two potatoes.

I got my sister a stereo.

It had been thirty minutes since Andy had tried to start falling asleep. Their plane was set to leave next morning and they wanted any small amount of sleep.</p>\n<p>But their curtain was broken, as it had always been. Light shone directly on their face.</p>\n<p>Andy wondered what awaited them when they returned. After all, Quint was convinced of something that flat out wasn't true. Something that Andy was not.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Although the makeup was suspicious. Obviously Quint shouldn't of looked, but Andy\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026stood up and tried to yank the curtain close. Doing so saw barely anything change as moonlight still flooded the room.</p>\n<p>They crawled back into bed then covered themself in sheets.</p>\n<p><em>What about their mother?</em> She had been in bad health for such a long time, Andy considered. They knew she wouldn't be around forever. If Andy ever wanted to tell her something that they'd regret not letting her know, they'd have to say it soon.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, <em>there was absolutely nothing that Andy needed to say.</em></p>\n<p>Aside from them starting to wear nail polish. Although they wouldn't really feel bad over not telling them that.</p>\n<p><em>But what about the mascara? They'd been wearing that almost every day before they left.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>lipstick.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>blush.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>eyeliner.</em></p>\n<p>But they reasoned that they had only tried those things once and immediately washed them off.</p>\n<p><em>Only because their roommate was there. What if they were alone? Would they still have washed it off so quickly?</em></p>\n<p>Even then, they were all just minor things to Andy. Stylistic things that weren't exactly major secrets\u2026</p>\n<p>But-</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc44\"><span><span style=\"color: cyan\">What</span> <span style=\"color: pink\">if</span> <span style=\"color: silver\">Quint</span> <span style=\"color: pink\">was</span> <span style=\"color: cyan\">right?</span></span></h4>\n</div>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They stormed out of their bed to the curtain and grabbed both sides of it. Andy slammed together both curtains with such forced that the curtain rod was knocked off of the wall. It fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>They sighed and leaned to pick up the curtain. Before they put it back, Andy stared out the window.</p>\n<p>And then they opened it.</p>\n<p>They inhaled the cool, crisp air as it rushed past them. It wasn't too cold for a winter's night. They looked down at a field just a bit below them.</p>\n<p>With a second thought, Andy adorned a jacket and moved downstairs.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They walked through the field. Snow crunched under each footstep. It took effort to avoid the tangled amalgamation of roots and dead plants while making their way through the field.</p>\n<p>But, they made it. A small clearing where they begun to breathe what felt like the freshest air they had in years. Only two sounds were heard, Andy's breaths and the gentle breeze of the wind.</p>\n<p>They looked up into the sky. Fifty-seven stars littered it. A burning fire that shone all the way across the universe just so Andy could glimpse it.</p>\n<p>They sat on the ground. Their coat was waterproof, allowing them to have some protection.</p>\n<p>Then they zoned out and enjoyed the cosmos. When they returned, they had no idea how much time they had lost.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They were terrified. Terrified of the repercussions of it, of what it would mean if it were true.</p>\n<p>Their whole life - everything they have had up until a few months prior, wasn't what they were.</p>\n<p>And what if they did tell their mother? What if they were disowned? What if their mother spent the last few months of her life hating her-</p>\n<p>-hating them.</p>\n<p>They shiverred. It was cold. They knew it was time for them to go back.</p>\n<p>They stood, feeling that snow had gotten through their coat. Somehow.</p>\n<p>At the icy porch, Andy took careful steps to avoid slipping. Then, before entering the house, they turned back to the field. All fifty-seven stairs were still beautiful in the night sky.</p>\n<p>They sat at the porch.</p>\n<p>Then, they thought. Thought for a long while. About Aunt Shelley and how she was cut off by her- their mother.</p>\n<p>Well, it wasn't <em>really</em> being cut off. They didn't meet, didn't talk that much. But they still talked occasionally. Still were friendly. Just\u2026 strained.</p>\n<p>And Andy didn't want that. They really, really did not want that. Despite everything, despite all of the stress, Andy did not want to lose their mother early. They really didn't.</p>\n<p>They stood and entered the house, letting the warmth inside melt away any cool temperatures they had been in.</p>\n<p>And the house was just as cold.</p>\n<p>Up the stairs they went, entering their room and seeing their curtain-less window.</p>\n<p>They stopped in front of the window, staring out of it once more.</p>\n<p>Then they opened the window.</p>\n<p>Andy didn't know where to start. They were afraid. If it wasn't real, it would have already fallen apart. At any point over the months where Andy tried to prevent it.</p>\n<p>Even then, they tried to rationalize their fear. That it wouldn't be all too bad. But, they knew it would be hard going forward. They knew that there was a good chance they'd be beaten down at any turn. They knew that throughout the rest of their life, they'd fight an uphill battle that they could likely never win.</p>\n<p>And Andy accepted that. They would have to be ready to face it one day. Mayble not day one, but they had to get ready to face what would happen if such a truth were ever revealed.</p>\n<p>She closed the window, left the curtain open, and walked to bed.</p>\n<p>Tucked into the sheets, she let her eyes close, and drifted off to sleep.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Flight</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Origin</th>\n<th>Destination</th>\n<th>Seat</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>202</td>\n<td>27/DEC/2023</td>\n<td>Pittsburgh, PA</td>\n<td>Denver, CO</td>\n<td>3C</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Departure:</strong> 06:30</p>\n<p><strong>Passenger Name:</strong> Andy Clarke</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>December 31,<br/>\n2023</p>\n<p>23:36</p>\n<hr/></div>\n<p>She stared into the mirror. She had been staring into it for a few minutes. It dawned on Andy's mind that she hadn't shaved ever since she had gotten back from Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>Whatever little hair she had on her head, she pulled back and tucked behind her ears. Shaving cream lathered her face and she grabbed a razor, using it with precision to cut every single strand of hair off of her face.</p>\n<p><em>Yet she hated how gritty her face felt as she rubbed her hands against it.</em></p>\n<p>So she shaved it again.</p>\n<p>And a third time.</p>\n<p>Until it felt /just a little bit// smoother.</p>\n<p>And that was all she felt she could do. When she moved to clean up, she saw her arms.</p>\n<p>Her hairy, horrendous arms.</p>\n<p>The sleeves on her arms were pulled up until they resembled a tank top. She slathered her left arm with shaving cream, then pressed her razor against it.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>She was done. Both arms. Where they were hairy and irritating, now they felt smooth. She had to put toilet paper on the spots of her arms where she nicked herself</p>\n<p>The couch cushioned her fall as she leaned back against it.

I just didn't think it through.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> So I'm sorry.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I really am.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I understand if you don't forgive this - if you don't want to move in anymore.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I just want to apologize for it.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I was also thinking about it. I thought about it a lot up until I left.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I also called my Aunt for the first time in a while during Christmas. It was nice. I got to chat with her, catch up with her.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I think that was the second calmest moment of my trip. There was this night that was beautiful, and I mean really pretty. It wasn't that cold, the clouds were gone, and it was quiet. I guess the best part about Appalachia is how there aren't many lights around there.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I remember stargazing for a while that night. Wasn't that what we did? The night before I went? Got drunk and stared at the sky.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> And then I just thought.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Nearly dozed off to sleep, too.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> You there?</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't think I'm a man. I don't think it is right for me to be a man anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Do you think you're trans? Or non-binary?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't know. I would feel better - or at least think I would feel better - if I was a woman. But I don't think I'll ever come close to that, truly. So I don't know what I am realistically going to be, or are realistically.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I'm sorry for lashing out. I still- stand by what I said. Well, some of it.

Checking her makeup, it dawned on her that whatever little makeup she had on was rushed and shoddy.</p>\n<p>Much like before, her lipstick veered away from the track of her lips, her eyeliner was shaky, and she could easily point out how different the blush was to her skin color.

Not good, not decent, but presentable!</p>\n<p>All so she could make a thirty-one-second walk to Quint's house and not be noticed.</p>\n<p>It was in vain, a stupid idea. She slammed her head back against her seat.</p>\n<p>The longer she stayed in the car the more likely it would be for more people to notice.</p>\n<p>She left and practically ran to Quint's door.</p>\n<p>Her clothes didn't match, either.

Andy had contemplated not bringing it, to just leave it behind. But they knew they had to keep it.</p>\n<p>She left the car and slowly carried the Dutch oven. She had to keep a slower pace to avoid dropping it. After two minutes, she arrived at her apartment door and brought the Dutch oven in with her.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Andy awoke. She turned over, and grabbed her phone. She checked the time.</p>\n<p><em>April 7, 4:37\u00a0A.M.</em></p>\n<p>She leaned back against her pillow. Her alarm wasn't supposed to go off until eight. Andy closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. After eleven minutes, she opened her eyes.</p>\n<p>Andy rolled out of her bed. She stretched, letting out a yawn as she grabbed a glass on her nightstand. She drank out of it, quickly finding it empty. Andy began to hobble to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Andy took out her ice tray.

Do not turn on the heat.</p>\n<p>Take the salami and cut into chunks. Peel and dice all six of your garlic cloves. Make sure that you have at least six cups of chicken broth/stock available, although have more ready if you can.</p>\n<p>Slice off the root of your leeks. Then, cut your leeks once length-wise down the middle. Chop all of your leeks from the whites up until the greek stalks become dry. Place all of the chopped leeks in the mixing bowl, and bring them to the sink. Begin to fill the bowl with water as you use your hands to massage the chopped leeks, doing so to remove all of the dirt and sediment. Fill up to the top of the bowl with water. The leeks should float at the top of your bowl.</p>\n<p>(Optionally peel your potatoes). Wash off your potatoes thoroughly to remove dirt and excess starch. Chop into small chunks.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc62\"><span>Cooking:</span></h3>\n<p>In your cold pot, place all of your diced salami. Make sure that there is no water or oil in the pot. Turn the temperature up to medium-high (As the temperature of the pot increases, fat will render out of the salami. This should produce enough fat to dually cook the salami and all other ingredients you need to fry before putting in stock. Any other fatty meat would work as a substitute.). Let simmer for 2 - 5 minutes, until a thin layer of fat covers the pot. Begin stirring salami after one minute.</p>\n<p>After roughly a minute, add in your garlic. Let simmer for a further minute before removing the leeks from your bowl and place them into the pot (As said before, all of the leeks should float. Try to minimize the amount of water going into the pot. While some water is inevitable, putting in too much water with the leek will prevent the leeks from frying.).</p>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> pour remaining water in the bowl down your sink. There should be visible amounts of sand and debris that sink down to the bottom of your bowl, which may be harmful for your drainage. The water is great to use for watering your plants. If not, simply pour the water outside.</p>\n<p>Stir frequently and let simmer for around three more minutes. After the time has passed, add in your potatoes. Stir roughly twice a minute for three minutes. (Cooking the potatoes and leeks ahead of boiling them helps the entire dish cook faster, as well as giving them browning and flavor.)</p>\n<p>When the potatoes are done simmering, add in enough chicken broth/stock. If you like thicker soups, make sure to add enough stock to just <em>barely</em> cover the other ingredients. If you like lighter soups, add in enough stock to cover the ingredients by one or two inches.</p>\n<p>With the stock in, turn the temperature up to high. While the soup begins to boil, add in both bay leaves and a tablespoon of brown sugar (Brown sugar makes every recipe taste better). Frequently stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.</p>\n<p>Once the soup has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and stir until the soup is reduced to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 - 30 minutes. Check your potatoes every 2 - 3 minutes starting at around ten minutes. Once your potatoes are easily piercable with a fork, they are ready.</p>\n<p>Add in your seasonings. You can choose different seasonings depending on your personal taste preferences. If you choose to add both salt and celery salt, make sure to minimize the amount of standard salt you apply accordingly to how much celery salt you put in (I personally only put half as much salt in as I do celery salt).</p>\n<p>Use your spatula to fish out both bay leaves. Add in your cup of cream. Add more or less cream depending on your desired coloration. No matter how much you add, let your cream simmer for a few minutes until it separates and a thin layer forms on the soup. This should also be accompanied by the soup thickening.</p>\n<p>Turn off your heat and take out your immersion blender. Puree the soup to your desired consistency.</p>\n<p>After you are done pureeing, add in your rosemary.</p>\n<p>Serve the soup in a bowl with a side of sourdough bread. Rip off chunks of the sourdough and dip in the soup to eat.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>- Andie Clarke</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/potato-leek-soup\">Potato Leek Soup</a>\" by VapidPoem, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

His mother hurried around, grabbing a heat-safe placemat to set the Dutch oven on. Finally, a loaf of old, pre-sliced sourdough bread was brought to the table.\n\n\n\nAnd they began to eat.\n\n\n\n\"Andy?\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you want to do anything tonight?\"\n\n\n\n\"Like?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.

When he was done, he emptied the Dutch oven into boxes of Tupperware and then into the fridge.\n\n\n\nThe sink water rushed out of the faucet. He grabbed a sponge to vigorously scrub at the Dutch oven until every single speck of dirtiness was cleansed.\n\n\n\nLooking over at his mother, he saw her scrape chunks of food off of the plates into the trash can before they got crammed into the dishwasher.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n//Tap.

A turn later, Andy glanced at his curtain.\n\n\n\n//A curtain that had never quite actually fully closed.//\n\n\n\nSeveral groans later, Andy rolled over on his side away from the light.

It truly turned out as a horrid meal.\n\n\n\nNot when his mother made it, of course. But this was his first-ever attempt at even trying to cook. Ignore the noodles he boiled or the eggs he fried, this was a full-blown meal. His family's prized meal. A mean which he completely messed up.\n\n\n\nThe pantry revealed next-to-nothing aside from salt, pepper, butter, and garlic powder. Luckily, the grocery store was around a five-minute walk away.\n\n\n\nInside, he grabbed as much as he could remember as he hadn't bothered to write anything down.\n\n\n\n//A cheap can of dried thyme,//\n\n//A single, four-cup carton of chicken stock,//\n\n//The first six potatoes he saw,//\n\n//And a single head of garlic.//\n\n\n\nHis biggest pain was that he did not have or buy a vegetable peeler. Resorting to using a flimsy knife to cut off any skin or eyes, he chopped off at least a tenth of his total worth of potatoes.\n\n\n\nThe potatoes were unwashed. Before, during, and after they were prepared. Dirt which clung to the potato's skin clung to the knife, which rubbed off on the clean interiors of the potatoes as they were cut. All with the flawed reasoning that he had convinced himself of being that the potatoes would be cleaned off in the bowl of water.\n\n\n\nWhile a rough chop was called for the leeks, they were given an impatient hacking-at by Andy. No care was given to ensure that the leeks were clean. Large chunks of soil and earth remained attached to the leeks as they were finished being prepared.\n\n\n\nAt the very least, Andy didn't waste anything. He used //all// of the leeks. The roots, dried inedible leaves, and all.\n\n\n\nA realization dawned upon him at the last moment; he had no garlic crusher. Instead, he elected to use a mug to smash the garlic that was by some miracle peeled by him.\n\n\n\nWithout a Dutch oven he was left no choice other than to use a simple, standard pot. The temperature was far, //far// too high. Garlic and leeks burned the second they touched the pot. Even as he smelled smoke, he let the aromatics burn for the whole three-minutes as the recipe described before he added potatoes. Thankfully, the potatoes still had some water with them and didn't burn.\n\n\n\nWhatever little chicken stock he bought was not enough. It failed to cover all of the potatoes without even being simmered down yet.\n\n\n\nA second forgotten memory came back. He had not purchased bay leaves at the store. Pushed to the back of his mind, he added in all of the spices. For all three seasonings he used, they all were produced at such a fast speed that he had to have poured in at least twice of the seasonings that the recipe called for.\n\n\n\nUnstirred, the boiling potatoes overflowed twice after he tried to cover them.\n\n\n\nThe one thing Andy had remembered to purchase was a masher. He exerted nearly his full body weight on the masher to, unsuccessfully, grind the potatoes and leeks into chunks.\n\n\n\nAfter the fifteen minutes had passed, Andy turned off the heat and took the soup off of the burner.\n\n\n\nIt was hot. It was salty. It was peppery. It tasted charred. At times it felt like he was drinking sand. He would find long strands of poorly-chopped leeks that got stuck in his teeth.

Thoroughly wash between each and every layer of the leeks, as they will have plenty of dirt trapped within. Chop your leeks. Peel both cloves of garlic and crush.\n\n\n\nPeel, then dice your potatos and let them sit in a bowl of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Cooking\n\n\n\nIn a Dutch oven, throw in your butter and let melt at high heat. Then, add crushed cloves of garlic and your chopped leeks and let simmer for approximately 3 minutes at medium heat. Add in your potatos and let simmer for a further minute. Then add in your salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add in all of your chicken broth/stock. Increase the temp to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and add your thyme and bay leaves. Let simmer for 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAfter 15 minutes, try to pierce the potatos with a fork. If you can pierce them with no resistance, turn off the heat. Fish out the bay leaves, and mash the soup. After fully mashed, add the whole cup of cream to the soup and mix.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n- Clarke Family Recipe\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\"How exactly in the flying fuck did you manage to burn soup?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's //soup.// As in - that shit made of water that you boil stuff in. It is quite literally the opposite of burning.\"\n\n\n\n\"To be fair- it wasn't actually while I was boiling it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yeah. I assumed as such.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then why were you giving me such a hard time about burning it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because the concept of burnt soup sounds funny.\"\n\n\n\n\"...\"\n\n\n\n\"You should try changing it around a bit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Changing what?\"\n\n\n\n\"The recipe. Changing the temperature and whatnot to try to avoid burning it. Each stovetop might be different from another.\"\n\n\n\n\"What if I undercook it?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a vegetarian soup. Not like it'll kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. Not too much of a chef anymore. Just try to change the recipe until you find something that you like.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThree times.\n\n\n\nAndy thrice checked the shopping list. Seventeen days had passed since he had first tried making the soup. This time, he had prepared a list of the //right// amount of //all the ingredients// that he needed. This included all of the tools that he //should// need. Paramount being a new, $65 Dutch oven.\n\n\n\nWith a new vegetable peeler, the skin was easily peeled off of all of the potatoes as he needed them. Roots severed and leeks bisected, Andy ran the leeks under cold water and meticulously washed out any semblance of dirt and filth before chopping them. He still came close to having accidentally severed his fingers three times.\n\n\n\nIn unison, all of his preparation saw improvement.\n\n\n\nAnd even then, with all of his preparation and care, he still forgot the garlic crusher. Rather than use an old reliable mug, he elected to merely peel and chop the garlic. He reasoned that the bigger chunks would burn slower, anyways. Which was what it was about.\n\n\n\nThe Dutch oven was placed on the stove at a medium-low heat, as Andy now wanted to carefully raise the temperature. Still-cold butter was allowed to melt in the Dutch oven. Just enough butter had been saved from making toast that morning for it. Andy would have to run to the store to get more butter for the rest of the week, later. Finally, in went the garlic and leeks. That was it - it would be important for him to get it right. A new factor Andy had learned was to frequently stir to disperse heat and prevent burning via movement.\n\n\n\nNervousness overswept him. It didn't seem like there was enough fat in the Dutch oven. Maybe it was too wide? Maybe something else went wrong? Regardless as the seconds passed it became more and more likely to him that something was going to burn.\n\n\n\nAndy looked around his kitchen. He knew he was out of butter, with all that he had left being a bottle of olive oil. Without much time to think, he let a glug of olive oil into the Dutch oven. That was it. The pot began to sputter and hiss at him as the olive oil dispersed throughout it.\n\n\n\nYet, it seemed to do the trick. The veggies weren't charred. When three minutes passed, he added in stock to deglaze the pan and ensure that any burned surfaces were completely destroyed.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the cooking time was similar to his original attempt, albeit better executed. More stock, better chunks, and better mashing all contributed. He especially placed care on the seasonings he let into the soup in order to avoid another over-seasoned mess.\n\n\n\nWhen the soup was done, he turned off the burner and served it in a bowl. By this point, Andy knew that he had to wait for the soup to cool down. As he waited in anticipation, he made a call.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Hey Andy. What's up?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not much. Just calling back to ask about the soup.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What about it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Just the recipe you sent me.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Yeah?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Are you sure you sent me the right recipe?

I don't know.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, I can double-check it. It might just be something on your end; lack of experience or whatnot. I ought to've taught you how to make it when you were here.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** But I guess that means that you should visit me sometime soon, huh?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yep. Soon.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You got a plan figured out yet?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not yet. But - could you just send me the recipe again?

Once the wait had passed, he sipped his first bite of the soup. It was a great improvement of the first, truly. Yet it still didn't taste quite //right...//\n\n\n\nPresentable, sure. If he had been able to eat the first soup, this would be easy. But it still just tasted off, for whatever reason.\n\n\n\nBefore he knew it, the soup was gone. Immediately followed by him storing the soup in his fridge.\n\n\n\nAnd then came the dishes, utensils, and other implements that all sat around the kitchen. All of them, dirty.\n\n\n\nAndy pondered simply deciding to store them in the dishwasher, out of his sight and mind as they were roughly cleaned. Then he remembered his childhood, how often he pointed out dirt and residue on dishes only for his mother to dismiss him, claiming that he had OCD and was making a deal out of nothing.\n\n\n\nSo he got to work. It took nearly an hour, but he did it. All of the dishes were scrubbed clean of their sin by the time he was done.\n\n\n\nHis phone read //11:47 P.M.//. Which meant it was time for him to visit Quint and watch a movie.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nQuint pressed a button on their remote. It activated the television. While the streaming service loaded, Quint looked through their fridge.\n\n\n\n\"You want anything?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nah.\"\n\n\n\nThe fridge was then closed.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to microwave some popcorn. You sure you don't want any?\"\n\n\n\n\"You know what? Fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\n\nA single bag of popcorn was placed in the microwave. A few minutes passed before it was ready, at which point Quint tried to hand the bag to Andy.\n\n\n\n\"I'll wait.\"\n\n\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's only a few minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\n\n\nWhen the second bag was ready, it was granted to Andy. He was joined by Quint as they jumped over the couch next to Andy.\n\n\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\n\nA button on the remote was clicked. The opening credits of //The Thing// played.\n\n\n\nAt first, black completely filled the screen. Pure, empty black which was then broken by the opening credits of the movie. When the credits finished, fifty-seven stars littered the screen.\n\n\n\nOne of the stars transformed into a spaceship that zoomed toward the camera and then to Earth. The spaceship landed in a cold, desolate land also known as Antartica.\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThe film ended with a shot of a bright fire which had engulfed the entirety of the facility, one that would inevitably burn it to the ground.\n\n\n\nA facility, built long before, soon to be nothing.\n\n\n\n\"What a movie.\" Andy remarked.\n\n\n\n\"I know, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's probably my favorite movie, honestly.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I see why.\"\n\n\n\nFixation overwhelmed him as the final seconds of the movie played. Specifically, he paid attention to just how bright the fire was. How it made a beacon which shone in an otherwise empty, dark, and baren landscape.\n\n\n\n\"Do you know what time it is?\"\n\n\n\nHe checked his phone.\n\n\n\n\"One fifty-three A.M.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jesus.\"\n\n\n\n\"Kinda getting late.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah... You know. Only a //bit// late.\"\n\n\n\n\"I should probably start heading back. I need to fix up my sleep schedule.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is a good idea, yeah.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair stood. Quint stretched as Andy checked his phone. While Quint stretched, they saw the back of their hand. Their nails adorned dark-purple nail polish.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Andy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"You ever had your nails done before?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you want to have your nails done? Should only be about ten minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure.\n\n\n\nA set of nail polish is retrieved and brought before Andy. The set is opened and several unique shades are presented.\n\n\n\n\"Alright. Pick a color.\"\n\n\n\n\"This one.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black?\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that alright?\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\n\nHis hands eased while Quint guided them.\n\n\n\n\"Hold them steady. I don't want to get any polish on your skin.\"\n\n\n\nOver eleven minutes, Quint did Andy's nails. It took time for the polish to dry. But when it was dry, Andy held their new painted nails up in admiration.\n\n\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\n\n\n\"You like them?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n10:00\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAn alarm blared. Andy yawned and stretched his arms, noticing the black which still covered their nails.\n\n\n\nMono colored, pristine, semi-beautiful black. Even after a whole night's rest, it had-\n\n\n\nTheir alarm blared again, now reading 10:05 A.M.\n\n\n\nIt was quickly shut off, as well as the other seven alarms Andy had set to ensure he woke up around the right time every morning.\n\n\n\nTheir roommate's door was open. He was relaxed on his bed and typed on his phone. He barely elected to grant Andy a glance as Andy scurried by with their hand curled into a fist to ensure that their roommate didn't see their nails.\n\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Andy checked his balance.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ Bank\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[<]]\n\n**Aunt Shelley** has sent you $275.00.\n\n\n\n//To help you out with the first few weeks of food for college.

With the lid removed, it was set in the microwave to cook for four minutes.\n\n\n\nA reflection was visible on the microwave. While faint, Andy really had no choice but to stare into it as the minutes passed. That was until Andy raised their hand, taking a glance at their nail polish. Now, despite being a less-close look, they saw the imperfections in their nails. Minor nicks, scratches, and all sorts of blemishes dotted their nails.\n\n\n\nThe faucet began pouring out water as they applied soap to their nails. There was a wait as the water began to heat. Nail polish on the edge of their nails where it met their skin curled. Andy picked at those curls in an attempt to peel off as much as they could.\n\n\n\nThe water got hotter, and hotter, //and hotter.// Until it was so hot that they yanked it back in pain.\n\n\n\nThen the microwave beeped, cutting them off.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nCold. It was cold. The soup was cold. Not hot, not warm, not lukewarm, but cold. They would have put it back into the microwave to heat it further, except that merely feeling the soup seemed to overwhelm Andy with a sense of vertigo - making them sit down.\n\n\n\nA decision was reached to just eat the cold soup. Beside, Andy heard something about potato leek soup traditionally being served cold. Surely this would be good.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nAbhorrent. An abhorrent, abnormally uninviting soup in stark contrast to the presentable soup the prior night.\n\n\n\nStill, Andy scarfed it down.\n\n\n\nWhen Andy had finished the soup, they walked to the sink and cleaned it. The soup seemed to easily wash away. At least, wash away much easier than their nail polish had. Andy looked at their nails one last time, noting how they looked similar to when they had awoken.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\n+++ Grocery List\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n* 6x Potatoes\n\n* 1x Carton of Milk\n\n* 12x Cans of Soda\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe cashier scanned Andy's select few items. The beeping of scanner and overall noise were drowned out by an abject nothing that flooded Andy's ears.\n\n\n\n\"That'll by $20.15.\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Your total.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\n\n\n\nTheir credit card was inserted into the reader.\n\n\n\n\"I like your nails.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where'd you get the polish from?

Andy put all of the groceries they had bought into their fridge and cupboards.\n\n\n\nAfter the last grocery is put in the fridge, they take out the final portion of potato leek soup. Their roommate is nowhere to be seen, although Andy assumed they had eaten some of it.\n\n\n\nSix minutes. The soup spent six minutes in the microwave. By the time it was done, it was so hot that Andy needed oven gloves to remove it. They knew it would be a while before it cooled down to a point of edibility.\n\n\n\nRather than wait, Andy opened their freezer and pulled out the ice cube tray. They popped out a single ice cube and dropped it in the soup, using their spoon to stir it around.\n\n\n\nWhen they took a sip, the soup was palatable. Better than being eaten cold and arguably better than the night it was cooked, but still just not quite there.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[size 125%]] Hello, Andy!

They opened their laptop to pass later into the night.\n\n\n\nThroughout the night, Andy grew curious.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n> || \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Search the web ||\n\n\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n\n\n> || \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Prettiest nail polish colors ||\n\n\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n\n\n> || \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Tutorial for applying nail polish at home ||\n\n\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n\n\n> || \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Where to buy nail polish in Boulder, Colorado ||\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAndy watched as an unfamiliar person left Quint's apartment and walked to a car. As they drove away, Andy moved to knock on Quint's door.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Andy. Come in!\"\n\n\n\nThey enter the house.\n\n\n\n\"Who was that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"That person who just left your apartment. I saw them walking out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yeah. That's my roommate. She's leaving to go to work.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\n\nThe hair atop Quint's head had been cut short in the three days since Andy and Quint last hung out.\n\n\n\n\"Nice cut.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\n\"You like it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I've wanted to cut my hair short for a while. Takes less care.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm starting to grow mine out. Save money on getting haircuts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I head about Bob Ross doing that before he got a show.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that why he had the afro?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Although I did read something about how he ended up hating his hair.\"\n\n\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\n\n\n\nIt took a minute, but Quint retrieved thirteen different shades of nail polish and brought them to the table in front of Andy.\n\n\n\n\"Pick one.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black is fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pick another.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dark blue?\"\n\n\n\n\"And another.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know.

You're going to want to start with the nail base-\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nLate at night, Andy laid in bed and watched videos on their phone. Video after video on Youtube of short, two-to-five-minute-long nail polish tutorials.\n\n\n\nA method they had been taught by their scrolling was finally fully functionally devised.\n\n\n\nBefore Andy could enact it, they moved to their bathroom with nail polish. They tried as hard as they could to be quiet as they knew their roommate was asleep.\n\n\n\nA bottle of nail polish remover was opened, soon placed on Andy's nails in an effort to wear out the paint.\n\n\n\nOne minute passed. Then two minutes. Then three minutes.\n\n\n\n//Then five minutes.//\n\n\n\nAfter exactly seven minutes a nozzle is turned and hot water begins to pour out of the faucet. Nail polish which touched Andy's skin had already began to peel and curl up. Andy grabbed the nail polish and meticulously peeled off as much as they could.\n\n\n\nStreaks and dots of nail polish once again littered their nails. Running their nails under the hot water did help, although specks of nail polish remained never-the-less.\n\n\n\nA short trip to the kitchen saw Andy grab a few sheets of paper towels before they retreated to their room.\n\n\n\nThe paper towels were strewn on the table. Andy grabbed the dark purple nail polish, nail base, and coat.\n\n\n\nNail base came first. It flowed along his nails, although admittedly a bit too much was applied.\n\n\n\nThen came the first layer of nail polish. Although inconsistent in its application, it generally avoided overlap onto their skin.\n\n\n\nFive minutes passed.\n\n\n\nThen came the second layer of nail polish. Now, it coated every atom of their nails and more. In several cases it fell onto their skin.\n\n\n\nAndy picked away at the excess nail polish with a nail file attached to their nail clipper to scrape off as much as they could. But still a thin layer solidified within seconds of it being applied, fusing to their skin.\n\n\n\nFive minutes passed.\n\n\n\nAnd the coat was applied over all of the polish.\n\n\n\nWhat Andy was left with was obvious. //A disaster.// Their nails were bumpy, the nail polish looked ugly, nail polish had gotten stuck under their nails. It was a fiasco.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, it hardly mattered. It was //theirs.// They had applied the nail polish on their own. Never mind the imperfections, Andy was left in admiration of their work.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nIn the parking lot, Andy was left in panic. It was a quick trip, with them only needing to grab one item.\n\n\n\nBut, their nails remained. Near-pristine. //As pristine as shoddily-applied nail polish could be.//\n\n\n\nWhen they left their car their fingers were curled into a fist. It was enough for Andy to feel comfortable walking in public with markings on their nails.\n\n\n\nTwenty-seven seconds passed after Andy entered the store. They passed a clothing aisle. A previously fast pace slowed down as an outfit got caught in the corner of their eye.\n\n\n\nA mannequin adorning a long, brown pocketed skirt, a mini-belt, and a long-sleeved brown shirt.\n\n\n\nTheir phone rang.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy!\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Hey.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Is now a good time to talk for a bit?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not really.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Aww. Well I'll keep it brief.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mom-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** So how's school going so far this year? Good, I hope.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh? You liking your new classes?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** So far...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** How about, um... That apartment of yours! Is it doing you well?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I like it. It's been a lot less stressful than the dorms.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I still think you're overplaying it a bit.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Come on.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I mean - no use arguing it now. It's over with. But still.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** So, yeah... To be frank, I'm not sure that I like my roommate too much.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. He's been eating all my food, not doing dishes. All that stuff.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well that's just what happens when you rent your own place. Stuff isn't so easy.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** And that wouldn't have happened in dorms?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** What?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** People had a lot more manners back when I was in the dorms. When I moved out-\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Hang on- I need to grab something real quick. I'll have to call you back later.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, hang on. Just another minute or two?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah... Sure.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** How's that soup coming along for ya? Did you have the right recipe?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, I did.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Did it work out better the second time around?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. Did end up tweaking the recipe around a bit.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I think my stovetop is wonky. Had to adjust the heat, add in a bit of olive oil.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy! You should have called me first.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I mean - I did. Just, right before I started cooking.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You- ... Andy, you know what I meant.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Oh? Sorry, then. Don't see how it was that big of a deal.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What did you change with it? What was the whole recipe you used?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Um. Pretty much the same recipe? I just changed around the cooking time a little bit.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Okay. What was the whole recipe.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't remember-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, there you go! That's cause you didn't follow a recipe. And now you're complaining about how it turned out bad.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mom-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What?!\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't remember it off the top of my head!\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Do you have a copy of it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not right now.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** All that I changed was the cooking time because I burned the garlic the first time.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Why?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** One of my friends suggested it.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Who?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** His name is Quint. They-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What was the greater context surrounding that?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just brought it up.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** All do respect to Quint, whoever he is-\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Quint doesn't go-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** -but this recipe has been in our family for generations and generations. All due respect to him, but I trust the family recipe more than him. You know?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yup...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy, here's my idea. I think you should try the recipe a few more times before you alter it to your own taste. That sound good?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I mean, I was kinda planning on that. Changing it around until I know exactly how to avoid mistakes and all.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** But, I want you to call me whenever you make it. No listening to friends or making up how to cook it on the fly. Instead I need you to let me in on everything you do. Okay?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Okay...\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nDeep breaths. Deep, deep breaths.\n\n\n\nBreathing did not help.\n\n\n\nAndy tried to continue their search toward the store. They just needed an immersion blender for the soup. Nothing else.\n\n\n\nThey found their legs becoming stiff, which did not help Andy as their pace nearly tripled. Sweat formed on their brow. It dripped down their forehead into their eye. Whatever control Andy had of their breathing vanished as Andy found themself unable to breath.\n\n\n\nThen Andy saw a unisex bathroom. Without a second thought, the door was opened then slammed behind them with nearly full force. The door was locked behind them.\n\n\n\nIt took nineteen paces around the small, cramped room for Andy to finally breathe again.\n\n\n\nNow able to breathe, they sat on the toilet for five minutes. With a jolt, they rose to the mirror. Their eyes had gotten beet red, although no tears had formed.\n\n\n\nTheir thumb and index finger moved to their sinus and pinched hard. A minute passed and Andy swallowed.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Yes?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just wanted to say something else-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What is it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just wanted to talk a bit about the recipe - what I am thinking about it and whatnot.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Okay. What about it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It was just... being put on the spot like that. Randomly called. I wasn't really able to think what I wanted to say, you know?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** But, yeah...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What is that echo, by the way?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Nothing.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Nothing?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It's just a bathroom. I wanted some privacy.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You wanted some- Jesus Christ, this is to yell at me, isn't it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** No-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy, just say what you want to say. I can't do this.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I'm not going to yell at you.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** So what is it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It's just more- what I'm thinking is that I change the recipe a bit while I learn how to cook. Avoid burning things and everything like that.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** And that just applies to cooking temp?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mostly. I'm also getting an immersion blender-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Because I don't like how chunky I cut the potatoes.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy! That's one of the biggest parts of the recipe! It's supposed to have chunks in it.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't... really agree with that. I just think-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Sorry, but I don't think you're making the same soup anymore.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It's just one thing-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** It's two. The temp, now this. Next you're going to tell me something else, and then something else. It's not the same soup anymore, just admit that.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mom! I-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Stop. I told you that I can't argue right now.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Okay then! Sorry.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** So stop yelling at me, stop arguing with me, and be honest with me that it isn't just that.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It was just the temp thing. The blending thing's only something that I might do.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Might?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't know. Just see if I like it more.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I think you're changing your answers now; which I don't really like.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** That was always what I was going to do.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I don't like it when you lie to me, sweetie.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You know what, Andy? I'm not doing this, today. I've barely had any energy today and I just can't argue with you right now. You can't admit when you're wrong and just keep lying and I... I just can't.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Sorry...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Look- Andy, I love you. But that's not the same soup and it won't ever be. Unless you change it back, it's fundamentally different. And lets just leave it at that. Agreed?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I'm going to go. I have to take a shower. Love you.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Love you...\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe call ends.\n\n\n\nThey let out a scream.\n\n\n\nA scream they hoped wasn't heard by anyone. Really, really hoped.\n\n\n\nIt took another twenty-three paces to calm down. When they stopped, they looked in the mirror. The sight of their reflection overcame them with a need to cry.\n\n\n\nTheir best effort to suppress their tears were in vain. It couldn't be held in forever. As he realized that truth, Andy let themself cry for only one minute.\n\n\n\nA paper towel was produced by the dispenser and used to soak up any water around Andy's eyes. Still, they were bloodshot. At best, Andy hoped that the cashier would think they were high.\n\n\n\nIt took them a lot, but they managed to convince themself to leave the bathroom.\n\n\n\nThere was no point in getting the immersion blender anymore. So they went to leave the store. Two employees looked at them, an act that confirmed they had heard Andy's scream.\n\n\n\nRight before they left, Andy's eye was caught once more. The outfit. On a discount, no less.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n$45.99\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAnd it was silly. They didn't have that much to spare - couldn't afford any split-second purchases.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nExcept they could. It was priced the same as an immersion blender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy looked around for a price tag. Eventually, Andy found that it was priced at $45.99. Andy didn't know if they had that much to spare. Nor why they were even considering it.\n\n\n\nBut, they had decided not to buy the immersion blender. They would, in all likelihood, be a similar price. Andy toiled and considered.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Will that be all for the day?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\n\n\"Total should be around $45.99.\"\n\n\n\nThe cashier was handed a credit card.\n\n\n\n\"It's for my sister.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Her birthday is coming up. Wanted to get her something nice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, she must be pretty lucky. It's a pretty nice dress.\"\n\n\n\n\"It really is.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you like a receipt?\"\n\n\n\n\"No thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Have a great day.\"\n\n\n\nThey knew.\n\n\n\nThe cashier knew.\n\n\n\nAndy could see it in their eyes.\n\n\n\nOutfit in hands, they left the store as fast as they could, getting in their car and screaming.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Roommate\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> You going to be here tonight?\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> No.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Where are you going to be at?\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> A party.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Okay.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> Why?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Just curious.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nEven though their roommate would be gone, Andy instinctively locked themself in their bathroom.\n\n\n\nThey took off their jacket, then their belt, then their jeans, then their shirt, then their socks, and finally their boxers.\n\n\n\nAnd then they were nude. Completely.\n\n\n\nImmediately followed was a feeling of relief. Their clothes had been a bit tight on them.\n\n\n\nAndy glanced over at the door to confirm it was locked. With the final confirmation, Andy opened the bag.\n\n\n\nThree components.\n\n\n\nA skirt. A shirt. And a belt.\n\n\n\nIt quickly dawned on them that they would need a bra and panties to comfortably complete the set.\n\n\n\n//Complete the set?!//\n\n\n\nThey hardly knew why they bought the outfit in the first place. Yet, they put it on piece-by-piece-by-piece, followed by a glance in the mirror.\n\n\n\nAnd they were beautiful.\n\n\n\nAlthough not the perfect fit, the clothes were the most comfortable thing Andy had ever worn. It fit their shape well, the fabric was soft. Oh, it was soft.\n\n\n\nAndy began to cry. Not tears of stress, exhaustion. Rather tears of emotion, elation.\n\n\n\nAndy turns, and turns, and turns, and turns, and turns. They adore every angle, every aspect of their outfit.\n\n\n\nIt takes five minutes before Andy seems to snap out of adoration. They mechanically exit the bathroom and retreat to their bedroom, electing to lock the door before they passed out on their bed.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:42 P.M.// ||\n\n\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:44 P.M.// ||\n\n\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:47 P.M.// ||\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\n> heyyyy\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> r u okay?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> anyways, was wondering if u wanted to head to my place later.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> just to watch a movie\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> let me know when u get this.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Sorry.

After a stretch, they look down and realize they still adorn the same clothes as the night prior.\n\n\n\nPanic ensued. They tore off the outfit, nearly ripping it while they undresssed. Now naked, Andy rushed to put on a t-shirt, boxers, pajama pants, and a matching flannel before they were ready.\n\n\n\nThe removed clothing was crammed into a ball and thrown on their bed.\n\n\n\nThey sighed, then remembered that the previous night they had planned to make potato leek soup, but never did.

Even with a call to their mother, it didn't work.\n\n\n\nSame temp, same cooking time, same ratios, same ingredients, and a same everything as the recipe had called for.\n\n\n\nAndy tried their best to eat the soup.

It just had to.\n\n\n\nAll of the soup they had made was inedible. It was disgusting, //repulsing// to eat.\n\n\n\nSo much food went to waste all in a single moment. They went to their fridge to find some food, //any food.//\n\n\n\nBefore they could choose, they ran to the bathroom and vomitted.\n\n\n\nWhen they finished, they wiped the vomit off of their lip and went to their bedroom. Seeing a glass of water, they emptied it.\n\n\n\nAnd collapsed on their bed.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nTossed and turned, turned and tossed. They tossed around for twenty-seven minutes.\n\n\n\nAll they wanted was to be able to close their eyes and rest. But, they couldn't.\n\n\n\nAndy shot up, sitting in their bed. They turned, their eyes locking almost like a magnet to the dress that laid on their bed.\n\n\n\nWith a single motion, they grabbed the dress. Their nausea seemingly having faded away.\n\n\n\nThe soft fabrics melted in their hands, each silky fiber feeling soft and beautiful as ever.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nwithout a single reason,\n\n\n\nthey tore the dress.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nFirst in half, then in fourths, then in eigths, then in sixteenth...\n\n\n\nWithin moments, it was reduced to scraps and shreds. Andy made very well sure to give the other parts of the outfit attention. The belt was snapped, the sleeves ripped off the shirt before themself being halved.\n\n\n\nMassive holes were ripped through the shirt until it was nothing but a rag.\n\n\n\nFive minutes passed. Shreds laid in Andy's hands and around their room.\n\n\n\nThey breathed and picked up what scraps they could to throw any away.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> You want to eat out?\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuint had arrived. A text on their phone informed them so.\n\n\n\nAndy walked outside to meet them. When they had met, the pair walked inside of the restaurant and were seated at a booth.\n\n\n\n\"You doing okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Just... woke up rough this morning.\"\n\n\n\n\"I feel you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good thing I've been going to sleep earlier, huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh. Yeah.\"\n\n\n\nA server arrived and took their drink orders.

Behind whatever I decide to order.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"So did my suggestion work out?\"\n\n\n\n\"It didn't taste burnt, if that's what you're asking.\"\n\n\n\n\"For some reason I feel like you didn't like it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think it's mostly just inexperience, not the recipe.\"\n\n\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\n\n\"I called my mom the other day to talk to her about it. She freaked //the fuck// out.\"\n\n\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't even know, man. The temp? I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jesus. That's rough.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's just like... A //really, really// small part of the recipe and she was freaking out about it.\"\n\n\n\n\"What happened after that?\"\n\n\n\n\"She called me a few more times the next time I made soup.\"\n\n\n\n\"Still freaking out?\"\n\n\n\n\"Still freaking out. Yep.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. That really sucks.\"\n\n\n\n\"Like, I don't really care about it, it's just like. You really care that much about whether I simmer garlic on medium, or low heat when I'm just fucking starting to learn how to cook enough to yell at me for it.\"\n\n\n\n\"But you liked it.\"\n\n\n\n\"The one with the changed recipe, yeah. You know - I made some earlier, followed the recipe word-for-word, and it still tasted like shit.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely because you just haven't tried it enough.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"When are you leaving?\"\n\n\n\n\"The 21st. I get back on the 28th.\"\n\n\n\n\"We've got to do something before you head off. Something before you spend a week in mundane hell FarmVille.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"We just have to. Doctor's orders.\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\"\n\n\n\n\"Something small. Probably having drinks at a park or something.\"\n\n\n\n\"That sounds fun.\"\n\n\n\n\"So you're down?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\"Radical.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Like your roommate?\"\n\n\n\n\"Kinda.\"\n\n\n\n\"So that's not a yes?\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't say I don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"Because, my roommate is dropping out of college.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. She found a high-paying job and didn't need her diploma.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good for her.\"\n\n\n\n\"So that means that I have an open room.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"//And// I don't want to pay two people's rent by myself. Don't really want to move, either.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"You get what I'm saying?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll have to think about it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Just let me know soon.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\nIt was dark when Andy's door opened. Despite just eating, they were hungry.\n\n\n\nThe fridge door opened and the note they had left was gone. //As well as one of their energy drinks...//\n\n\n\nIt was at that moment Andy decided to move out.\n\n\n\nThey grabbed pre-cooked, cold spaghetti noodles out of the fridge. Rather than microwave them, Andy put grated parmesan on them and moved to their room with a fork to eat them cold.\n\n\n\nNot bothering to turn on a light, they sat in front of their laptop and quickly finished the pasta. A sigh left Andy's mouth as they looked at an essay they had to write.\n\n\n\n400 words done.\n\n\n\n3,000 words needed.\n\n\n\nA clock read //10:52 P.M.//\n\n\n\nThey had time, plenty of time. They just needed to write.\n\n\n\n//11:55 P.M.//\n\n\n\n500 words done.\n\n\n\n3,000 words needed.\n\n\n\nThe laptop screen was left open as they moved to their bed. Curled up in a ball, facing away from the light, and they eventually saw a scrap.\n\n\n\nDespite being only a thousandth of the original's glory, it had all the pull. Both eyes locked on the shred as their hand outstretched to grab it.\n\n\n\nAndy let out a gentle laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Must've been poor quality- with how easy it was to tear...\"\n\n\n\nThey wrapped their body around a pillow, cooling off with shred still in hand.\n\n\n\n\"Wouldn't have lasted if I wore it more than once...\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n//Wore it where?//\n\n\n\n//In their room?//\n\n\n\n//In public?!//\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nNo no, they wouldn't have. It made sense for them to rip it; they didn't need it. They simply didn't.\n\n\n\nYet Andy did not know why they were holding on to the last scrap of fabric so tightly.\n\n\n\n//12:21 A.M.//\n\n\n\nThey went to their desk and shook their cursor around to turn on the screen. Fingers on the keys, they prepared to keep writing.\n\n\n\nUntil they brought out a pen and paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nMystique -- Lash False Lash Effect Mascara -- Adds Volume & Lengthening -- Cruelty & Paraben-Free\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$3.49\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nEllanie's Prime Remain All Day Red Lipstick, Matte -- Long-Lasting Color Wear -- No Transfer or Bleed -- Hydrating & Non-Irritating for Soft Lips\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$5.97\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nBlack Tone Lip Stick for Soft Lips -- Hydrating & Non-Irritating -- Perfect Gift For Your Girlfriend\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$6.49\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nPROFFESSIONAL MAKEUP EYELINER Used By Celebrities -- Waterproof Pattented Formula -- Black Tone\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$18.57\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nINSTANT Cheekbone Contour Peach Perfection, .33 Oz, Non-Irritating Materials to Enhance Natural Radiance\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$5.97\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n++ **Subtotal (5 item):**\n\n++++ $40.51\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\u00a0\n\nThree hours were needed to watch makeup tutorials on Youtube, or trying to figure out how to grow a wolfcut.\n\n\n\nAndy checked their bank account.\n\n\n\n//$205.60//\n\n\n\nAndy sighed what they thought was a sigh of a relief. An excuse why they didn't buy it. They couldn't drop 1/5th of their money on makeup! Not at the moment.\n\n\n\nAnd then Andy remembered how much cheaper it was to buy things in person vs online...\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThe cashier didn't believe them. There was no way. Literally no way. It was like when Andy bought the dress.\n\n\n\nThey claimed it to be for Christmas shopping, a gift for their mother. The cashier didn't buy it for a second. At the very least, they //suspected// it. Buying //all of that makeup// for one person who'd likely //already have it?!//\n\n\n\nAndy only hoped.\n\n\n\nThey locked the bathroom door behind them and dropped the bag on the counter. Their roommate was there, so they had to be careful.\n\n\n\nAndy started with the eyeliner - which was shakily applied. It curved and swayed as dots of skin peeked out throughout both of their upper eyelids.\n\n\n\nNext up - the blush. The kit came with four different colors. The initial blush that Andy applied hardly matched their skin tone. Andy grabbed a wet towel and tried to wipe off the blush. Yet, it persisted. After Andy's face was dried off, Andy tried to apply a different kind of blush. All that Andy was left with were patches of dust that clinged to their face that were either too red or too pale for their skin tone.\n\n\n\nThen; the lipstick. They went with the red lipstick. The lipstick overlapped from their lips to their skin until they were left with a bumpy, shoddily applied red coating their lips.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that could save the day was the mascara. Their eyelashes were coated, and came off being longer. Much to Andy's shagrin, the mascara was hardly noticeable.\n\n\n\nEven with it being the best application, tiny dots of black which stemmed from the mascara hit their upper eyes.\n\n\n\nAndy looked into the mirror to see an object of horror. Although recognizable who was behind the mask, it was a hard sight.\n\n\n\nYet, the tiniest twinge of pride overcame them. It was their first time trying and not all that bad. But they simply couldn't avoid how bad it looked at first.\n\n\n\nAndy heard their roommate walking throughout the house and sighed. They grabbed the towel and cleaned their face.\n\n\n\n//Then nothing came off.//\n\n\n\nThe towel was soaked in water before being applied directly on their face. They panicked, scrubbing as hard as they could to get it off.\n\n\n\n//It was water resistant. All of it was!//\n\n\n\nThey glanced into the mirror, seeing the makeup merely smudge on their face without coming off.\n\n\n\nTheir roommate would certainly notice if they saw. They would notice, and they would //judge//. Especially for how bad the makeup was.\n\n\n\nAndy jumped into the shower and turned on the water. It was still freezing cold, and it remained freezing for the rest of the shower.\n\n\n\nWhen they finished, they dried off their face and looked into the mirror.\n\n\n\nRemnants of the makeup stayed, but they were more discrete. Much of their eyeliner and lipstick had washed off. All that remained was a hardly-noticeable shadow of the makeup they had just tried to apply.\n\n\n\nAs the bathroom door unlocked, they saw their roommate.\n\n\n\nThey were concise and told the roommate that they planned to move out soon.\n\n\n\nThe roommate asked why.\n\n\n\nAndy told them why.\n\n\n\nThe roommate asked what day.\n\n\n\nAndy said that they did not know.\n\n\n\nThe roommate confirmed that Andy was leaving the house.\n\n\n\nAnd Andy affirmed them.\n\n\n\nThen the roommate wished them well, and thanked them for letting them know.\n\n\n\nAnd that was it. Andy walked into their room and picked up their phone.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> I can move in with you if you're still looking for someone.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> cool\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n>Text me the details.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAndy set down their phone.

The beer is handed to Quint, who shoves the six-pack into their backpack.\n\n\n\nThe pair follow a trail into the woods just into the Rockies.\n\n\n\nAfter roughly seventeen minutes, the pair arrived at a clearing slightly off-trail. Quint took out a blanket to place on the grass while Andy kicked off their shoes and felt the blades of grass beneath their toes.\n\n\n\nTwo bottles of beer were popped.\n\n\n\n\"Feels like forever since we've hung out, huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\n\n\n\"Especially since we've gone out here.\"\n\n\n\n\"We should come out here more. It's really pretty.\"\n\n\n\n\"In a few weeks?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Thank you for offering me the apartment.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're good.\"\n\n\n\n\"I did not vibe well with my roommate, to be honest.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll miss mine. But, we didn't really talk.\"\n\n\n\n\"My roommate stole an energy drink after I specifically confronted them to not.\"\n\n\n\n\"Geez.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know, right?\"\n\n\n\nAndy grabbed a second bottle of beer.\n\n\n\n\"Have you told your mom yet?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hell no?\"\n\n\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\n\n\nThe duo leaned back in near-unison to see the stars. While Andy had moved to lay on the blanket, Quint decided to lay on the grass, at least briefly.\n\n\n\nThe pair stared into the stars for thirty-one minutes all while sipping their beers.\n\n\n\nAt a point during the night, Andy had grabbed a third beer. By the time they were back in the car, the bottle was empty. The bottle Quint had nursed was thrown away in a trash can they found, still half-full.\n\n\n\nAs the pair entered the car, Quint turned on a light to search it.\n\n\n\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\n\n\n\"My keys.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know- you... you probably shouldn't just leave those in the car...\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh. Probably.\"\n\n\n\nThe search effort is joined by Andy. After a minute, the pair briefly lock eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Andy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you wearing mascara?\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\nQuint discovered the key, put it in the ignition, then drove away.\n\n\n\nA chuckle left Andy's lips and they closed their eyes, leaning against their seat and nearly falling asleep.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nA key slid into the door, and it was opened.\n\n\n\n\"Let's get you into bed.\"\n\n\n\nThey practically had to drag Andy to their room where they opened a door, turned on a light, and eased Andy into bed. They helped Andy remove their shoes and tuck themselves under the sheets.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to hang out here a minute- while I wait for a cab.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no- no... Don't. You can just- just take my car and give it to me tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Yeah... Just have a good night.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sleep tight.\"\n\n\n\nThe keys to Andy's car slides into Quint's pocket.\n\n\n\nRight as they reached the door, they turned to shut off the light.\n\n\n\nThen something caught their eye.\n\n\n\n//Blush,//\n\n//Eyeliner,//\n\n//Red Lipstick,//\n\n//Black Lipstick,//\n\n//Mascara,//\n\n//and Nail Polish.//\n\n\n\nAll neatly packed into the corner.\n\n\n\nThey picked up one of the nail polish bottles, at which point they confirmed that it was the exact same as they had given to Andy.\n\n\n\nThe cap of the lipstick popped off, and it was clearly used. Smeared in only a way that application, rough application, could do.\n\n\n\nThey approached Andy to look at their eyes and confirm that they were wearing mascara. With the confirmation, Quint left the room while they shut off the light behind them.\n\n\n\n\"Best of dreams.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nTwo potatoes. Both were washed as they had decided to make a scaled-down version of the recipe for lunch, and likely dinner/breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah?\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Hey.

Their roommate didn't bother to check in on them.\n\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Andy tried to continue.\n\n\n\nThey heated up their Dutch oven and threw in the butter, which quickly turned to a brownish-black. The leeks varied, but all smoked and charred by the end. //In exactly four minutes under heat.//\n\n\n\nThen they thought.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n**What did Quint know?

Thoroughly wash between each and every layer of the leeks, as they will have plenty of dirt trapped within. Chop your leeks. Peel both cloves of garlic and crush.\n\n\n\nPeel, then dice your potatos and let them sit in a bowl of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Cooking\n\n\n\nIn a Dutch oven, throw in your butter and let melt at high heat. Then, add crushed cloves of garlic and your chopped leeks and let simmer for approximately 3 minutes at medium heat. Add in your potatos and let simmer for a further minute. Then add in your salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add in all of your chicken broth/stock. Increase the temp to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and add your thyme and bay leaves. Let simmer for 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAfter 15 minutes, try to pierce the potatoes with a fork. If you can pierce them with no resistance, turn off the heat. Fish out the bay leaves, and mash the soup. After fully mashed, add the whole cup of cream to the soup and mix.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n- Clarke Family Recipe\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAll the same...\n\n\n\nThe potato leek soup tasted the same. It didn't taste like how Andy remembered it. They at the very least felt a twinge of validation, but still were dismayed.\n\n\n\nDismayed at how they could hate their favorite dish.\n\n\n\nThey tried to finish the soup. They tried very, very hard. But they couldn't finish it.

It had been thirty minutes since Andy had tried to start falling asleep. Their plane was set to leave next morning and they wanted any small amount of sleep.\n\n\n\nBut their curtain was broken, as it had always been. Light shone directly on their face.\n\n\n\nAndy wondered what awaited them when they returned. After all, Quint was convinced of something that flat out wasn't true. Something that Andy was not.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nAlthough the makeup was suspicious. Obviously Quint shouldn't of looked, but Andy...\n\n\n\n...stood up and tried to yank the curtain close. Doing so saw barely anything change as moonlight still flooded the room.\n\n\n\nThey crawled back into bed then covered themself in sheets.\n\n\n\n//What about their mother?// She had been in bad health for such a long time, Andy considered. They knew she wouldn't be around forever. If Andy ever wanted to tell her something that they'd regret not letting her know, they'd have to say it soon.\n\n\n\nFortunately, //there was absolutely nothing that Andy needed to say.//\n\n\n\nAside from them starting to wear nail polish. Although they wouldn't really feel bad over not telling them that.\n\n\n\n//But what about the mascara? They'd been wearing that almost every day before they left.//\n\n\n\nAnd the //lipstick.//\n\n\n\nAnd the //blush.//\n\n\n\nAnd the //eyeliner.//\n\n\n\nBut they reasoned that they had only tried those things once and immediately washed them off.\n\n\n\n//Only because their roommate was there. What if they were alone? Would they still have washed it off so quickly?//\n\n\n\nEven then, they were all just minor things to Andy. Stylistic things that weren't exactly major secrets...\n\n\n\nBut-\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ ##cyan|What## ##pink|if## ##silver|Quint## ##pink|was## ##cyan|right?##\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThey stormed out of their bed to the curtain and grabbed both sides of it. Andy slammed together both curtains with such forced that the curtain rod was knocked off of the wall. It fell to the ground.\n\n\n\nThey sighed and leaned to pick up the curtain. Before they put it back, Andy stared out the window.\n\n\n\nAnd then they opened it.\n\n\n\nThey inhaled the cool, crisp air as it rushed past them. It wasn't too cold for a winter's night. They looked down at a field just a bit below them.\n\n\n\nWith a second thought, Andy adorned a jacket and moved downstairs.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThey walked through the field. Snow crunched under each footstep. It took effort to avoid the tangled amalgamation of roots and dead plants while making their way through the field.\n\n\n\nBut, they made it. A small clearing where they begun to breathe what felt like the freshest air they had in years. Only two sounds were heard, Andy's breaths and the gentle breeze of the wind.\n\n\n\nThey looked up into the sky. Fifty-seven stars littered it. A burning fire that shone all the way across the universe just so Andy could glimpse it.\n\n\n\nThey sat on the ground. Their coat was waterproof, allowing them to have some protection.\n\n\n\nThen they zoned out and enjoyed the cosmos. When they returned, they had no idea how much time they had lost.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThey were terrified. Terrified of the repercussions of it, of what it would mean if it were true.\n\n\n\nTheir whole life - everything they have had up until a few months prior, wasn't what they were.\n\n\n\nAnd what if they did tell their mother? What if they were disowned? What if their mother spent the last few months of her life hating her-\n\n\n\n-hating them.\n\n\n\nThey shiverred. It was cold. They knew it was time for them to go back.\n\n\n\nThey stood, feeling that snow had gotten through their coat. Somehow.\n\n\n\nAt the icy porch, Andy took careful steps to avoid slipping. Then, before entering the house, they turned back to the field. All fifty-seven stairs were still beautiful in the night sky.\n\n\n\nThey sat at the porch.\n\n\n\nThen, they thought. Thought for a long while. About Aunt Shelley and how she was cut off by her- their mother.\n\n\n\nWell, it wasn't //really// being cut off. They didn't meet, didn't talk that much. But they still talked occasionally. Still were friendly. Just... strained.\n\n\n\nAnd Andy didn't want that. They really, really did not want that. Despite everything, despite all of the stress, Andy did not want to lose their mother early. They really didn't.\n\n\n\nThey stood and entered the house, letting the warmth inside melt away any cool temperatures they had been in.\n\n\n\nAnd the house was just as cold.\n\n\n\nUp the stairs they went, entering their room and seeing their curtain-less window.\n\n\n\nThey stopped in front of the window, staring out of it once more.\n\n\n\nThen they opened the window.\n\n\n\nAndy didn't know where to start. They were afraid. If it wasn't real, it would have already fallen apart. At any point over the months where Andy tried to prevent it.\n\n\n\nEven then, they tried to rationalize their fear. That it wouldn't be all too bad. But, they knew it would be hard going forward. They knew that there was a good chance they'd be beaten down at any turn. They knew that throughout the rest of their life, they'd fight an uphill battle that they could likely never win.\n\n\n\nAnd Andy accepted that. They would have to be ready to face it one day. Mayble not day one, but they had to get ready to face what would happen if such a truth were ever revealed.\n\n\n\nShe closed the window, left the curtain open, and walked to bed.\n\n\n\nTucked into the sheets, she let her eyes close, and drifted off to sleep.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n||~ Flight ||~ Date ||~ Origin ||~ Destination ||~ Seat||\n\n|| 202 || 27/DEC/2023 || Pittsburgh, PA || Denver, CO || 3C ||\n\n\n\n**Departure:** 06:30\n\n\n\n**Passenger Name:** Andy Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023\n\n\n\n23:36\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nShe stared into the mirror. She had been staring into it for a few minutes. It dawned on Andy's mind that she hadn't shaved ever since she had gotten back from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nWhatever little hair she had on her head, she pulled back and tucked behind her ears. Shaving cream lathered her face and she grabbed a razor, using it with precision to cut every single strand of hair off of her face.\n\n\n\n//Yet she hated how gritty her face felt as she rubbed her hands against it.//\n\n\n\nSo she shaved it again.\n\n\n\nAnd a third time.\n\n\n\nUntil it felt /just a little bit// smoother.\n\n\n\nAnd that was all she felt she could do. When she moved to clean up, she saw her arms.\n\n\n\nHer hairy, horrendous arms.\n\n\n\nThe sleeves on her arms were pulled up until they resembled a tank top. She slathered her left arm with shaving cream, then pressed her razor against it.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nShe was done. Both arms. Where they were hairy and irritating, now they felt smooth. She had to put toilet paper on the spots of her arms where she nicked herself\n\n\n\nThe couch cushioned her fall as she leaned back against it. Her roommate had gone to party, as most people likely had. But she decided to stay home.\n\n\n\nHer laptop opened, and she began to play //The Thing//.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023\n\n\n\n23:55\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAndy took out her phone.

I guess I put together the nail polish and the mascara; thought that it was for you. That there was some part of you that you were hiding. And I wanted to support you if you were hiding it. I just didn't think it through.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Quint:** So I'm sorry.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Quint:** I really am.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Quint:** I understand if you don't forgive this - if you don't want to move in anymore.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Quint:** I just want to apologize for it.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I was also thinking about it. I thought about it a lot up until I left.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I also called my Aunt for the first time in a while during Christmas. It was nice. I got to chat with her, catch up with her.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I think that was the second calmest moment of my trip. There was this night that was beautiful, and I mean really pretty. It wasn't that cold, the clouds were gone, and it was quiet. I guess the best part about Appalachia is how there aren't many lights around there.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I remember stargazing for a while that night. Wasn't that what we did? The night before I went? Got drunk and stared at the sky.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** And then I just thought.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Nearly dozed off to sleep, too.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** You there?\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Yeah.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't think I'm a man. I don't think it is right for me to be a man anymore.\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Do you think you're trans? Or non-binary?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't know. I would feel better - or at least think I would feel better - if I was a woman. But I don't think I'll ever come close to that, truly. So I don't know what I am realistically going to be, or are realistically.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I'm sorry for lashing out. I still- stand by what I said. Well, some of it. I'm still mad that you looked at my stuff when I was drunk. But, I think that I lashed out for the wrong reason. I was just... angry, I guess? At the idea that I was trans.\n\n\n\n**Quint:** I'm sorry.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I'm still willing to move in, if you are.\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Of course I am.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Really?\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Yep.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Thank you.

She hated the smell of smoke. Andy lit a candle before returning to her couch.\n\n\n\nAndy pressed space, and resumed her movie.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\nJanuary 1,\n\n2024\n\n\n\n00:02 A.M.\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n...........\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\nFebuary 25,\n\n2024\n\n\n\n11:42 A.M.\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nThe car parked on the curb, only a few dozen feet away from Quint's apartment.\n\n\n\nThe weather app had told her that it would be foggy in the morning. Bright beams of sunshine shone into her car directly on her face, taunting her.\n\n\n\nFrom her backpack, Andy produced a handmirror. Checking her makeup, it dawned on her that whatever little makeup she had on was rushed and shoddy.\n\n\n\nMuch like before, her lipstick veered away from the track of her lips, her eyeliner was shaky, and she could easily point out how different the blush was to her skin color. Hell, even her nails seemed off. She felt them, noticing bumps and uneven application.\n\n\n\nTwo whole hours had been spent to apply the makeup just to make it look presentable. Not good, not decent, but presentable!\n\n\n\nAll so she could make a thirty-one-second walk to Quint's house and not be noticed.\n\n\n\nIt was in vain, a stupid idea. She slammed her head back against her seat.\n\n\n\nThe longer she stayed in the car the more likely it would be for more people to notice.\n\n\n\nShe left and practically ran to Quint's door.\n\n\n\nHer clothes didn't match, either. Black cargo pants, a white long-sleeved undershirt, and a green branded t-shirt. They didn't match with her makeup. Anybody would instantly think that she was a boy pretending to be-\n\n\n\nShe arrived at the door. Time slowed, every movement became heavy. Every breath she took was forced. A knock barely left her hand before she froze, feeling minutes pass.\n\n\n\nThen the door opened.\n\n\n\nQuing lunged at Andy with a hug.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Andy! How was the trip.\"\n\n\n\nThrough the pressure on her lungs, she spoke.\n\n\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\n\n\"I like your makeup.\"\n\n\n\nAll of the pressure, all at once, faded.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"How much do you have to unpack?\"\n\n\n\n\"A bit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, let's go, then.\"\n\n\n\nThe duo spent three hours to empty Andy's car and make trips to Andy's old apartment.\n\n\n\nIt took two trips back to Andy's apartment to get everything.\n\n\n\nThe last item the pair got was a Dutch oven. Andy had contemplated not bringing it, to just leave it behind. But they knew they had to keep it.\n\n\n\nShe left the car and slowly carried the Dutch oven. She had to keep a slower pace to avoid dropping it. After two minutes, she arrived at her apartment door and brought the Dutch oven in with her.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nAndy awoke. She turned over, and grabbed her phone. She checked the time.\n\n\n\n//April 7, 4:37 A.M.//\n\n\n\nShe leaned back against her pillow. Her alarm wasn't supposed to go off until eight. Andy closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. After eleven minutes, she opened her eyes.\n\n\n\nAndy rolled out of her bed.

It clearly had some sort of use, being wrinked and worn. But she just couldn't remember why.\n\n\n\nSomething became a blank slate in her memory. An idea that she just couldn't remember.\n\n\n\nSo, with no use for a piece of paper that meant nothing to her, she tore it in half and threw it away.\n\n\n\nThen she checked every ingredient in her kitchen. All of her cupboards, her fridge, her counter. She gathered everything she could.\n\n\n\nAnd then, Andie began to experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\n++++ Potato Leek Soup\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n+++ Ingredients:\n\n\n\n* Loaf of Sourdough Bread\n\n* 6 oz of Salami\n\n* 6 Leeks\n\n* 6 Potatoes\n\n* Chicken Broth/Stock\n\n* 1 Cup of Cream\n\n* 4 Cloves of Garlic\n\n* Pepper\n\n* Garlic Powder\n\n* Onion Powder\n\n* Cayenne Powder\n\n* MSG\n\n* Celery Salt\n\n* Salt\n\n* Brown Sugar\n\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n\n* 1 Sprig of Rosemary\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Tools:\n\n\n\n* Dutch Oven/Soup Pot\n\n* Spatula\n\n* Ladle\n\n* Cutting Board\n\n* Knife\n\n* Mixing Bowl\n\n* Immersion Blender\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Preparation:\n\n\n\nPlace your cold pot on your stovetop. Do not turn on the heat.\n\n\n\nTake the salami and cut into chunks. Peel and dice all six of your garlic cloves. Make sure that you have at least six cups of chicken broth/stock available, although have more ready if you can.\n\n\n\nSlice off the root of your leeks. Then, cut your leeks once length-wise down the middle. Chop all of your leeks from the whites up until the greek stalks become dry. Place all of the chopped leeks in the mixing bowl, and bring them to the sink. Begin to fill the bowl with water as you use your hands to massage the chopped leeks, doing so to remove all of the dirt and sediment. Fill up to the top of the bowl with water. The leeks should float at the top of your bowl.\n\n\n\n(Optionally peel your potatoes). Wash off your potatoes thoroughly to remove dirt and excess starch. Chop into small chunks.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Cooking:\n\n\n\nIn your cold pot, place all of your diced salami. Make sure that there is no water or oil in the pot. Turn the temperature up to medium-high (As the temperature of the pot increases, fat will render out of the salami. This should produce enough fat to dually cook the salami and all other ingredients you need to fry before putting in stock. Any other fatty meat would work as a substitute.). Let simmer for 2 - 5 minutes, until a thin layer of fat covers the pot. Begin stirring salami after one minute.\n\n\n\nAfter roughly a minute, add in your garlic. Let simmer for a further minute before removing the leeks from your bowl and place them into the pot (As said before, all of the leeks should float. Try to minimize the amount of water going into the pot. While some water is inevitable, putting in too much water with the leek will prevent the leeks from frying.).\n\n\n\n**DO NOT** pour remaining water in the bowl down your sink. There should be visible amounts of sand and debris that sink down to the bottom of your bowl, which may be harmful for your drainage. The water is great to use for watering your plants. If not, simply pour the water outside.\n\n\n\nStir frequently and let simmer for around three more minutes. After the time has passed, add in your potatoes. Stir roughly twice a minute for three minutes. (Cooking the potatoes and leeks ahead of boiling them helps the entire dish cook faster, as well as giving them browning and flavor.)\n\n\n\nWhen the potatoes are done simmering, add in enough chicken broth/stock. If you like thicker soups, make sure to add enough stock to just //barely// cover the other ingredients. If you like lighter soups, add in enough stock to cover the ingredients by one or two inches.\n\n\n\nWith the stock in, turn the temperature up to high. While the soup begins to boil, add in both bay leaves and a tablespoon of brown sugar (Brown sugar makes every recipe taste better). Frequently stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.\n\n\n\nOnce the soup has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and stir until the soup is reduced to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 - 30 minutes. Check your potatoes every 2 - 3 minutes starting at around ten minutes. Once your potatoes are easily piercable with a fork, they are ready.\n\n\n\nAdd in your seasonings. You can choose different seasonings depending on your personal taste preferences. If you choose to add both salt and celery salt, make sure to minimize the amount of standard salt you apply accordingly to how much celery salt you put in (I personally only put half as much salt in as I do celery salt).\n\n\n\nUse your spatula to fish out both bay leaves. Add in your cup of cream. Add more or less cream depending on your desired coloration. No matter how much you add, let your cream simmer for a few minutes until it separates and a thin layer forms on the soup. This should also be accompanied by the soup thickening.\n\n\n\nTurn off your heat and take out your immersion blender. Puree the soup to your desired consistency.\n\n\n\nAfter you are done pureeing, add in your rosemary.\n\n\n\nServe the soup in a bowl with a side of sourdough bread. Rip off chunks of the sourdough and dip in the soup to eat.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n- Andie Clarke\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "forgotten-memories", "lgbtq", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Potato Leek Soup - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/potato-leek-soup", "year": 2025}, "reflection": {"created_at": "2025-01-15T14:33:00", "creator": "Iszth", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Iszth", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iszth", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-15T14:33:00"}, {"author": "Iszth", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iszth", "comment": "Added tags: agent-calendar, lgbtq, mythological, tale.

She blinked herself awake, draped within her exquisite silken sheets, as she breathed in the cool air smelling of flowers and the sea.</p>\n<p>She lay there for a moment, staring blankly towards the incredible relief carved into the fine marble ceiling of her bed chambers. A tribute to her endless beauty and fertility, encrusted with jewels and covered with draping flowers and thin coloured veils. She took a deep breath in, closed her eyes, and let out a long sigh.</p>\n<p>Aphrodite slowly rose up to sit on the side of her bed before standing fully in the glowing sun. It sparkled through the paper thin and transparent veil tied around her waist, leg and chest, not so much as a form of modesty but as an embellishment to her exquisite figure for the world to see. She began walking over to the balcony through which her curtains billowed past the ornate and vine-coated marble pillars.</p>\n<p>Her chest was heavy, her gait uneven, and her exposed skin was biting even in the heavenly breeze. She stopped midway to the balcony to look at herself the perfectly reflective mirror presented in her bed chambers. As expected, the form staring back at her was absolutely immaculate. Her skin shone a light olive unmarked by anything denoting age nor experience. Her hair was golden and full, trailing in elegant twists that reached her hips. Her entire figure, from her delicate face to her full chest, her wide hips and smooth legs, there is nothing one could possibly want more from their own visage.</p>\n<p>And rightfully so. She was a Goddess, of course, in the truest sense of the word. She embodied everything that was beautiful, lovable, romanceable. She was absolutely and completely perfect.</p>\n<p>Without a word, Aphrodite gently touched her face and turned to face the mirror on her wall. She briskly walked over to her beautiful reflection and stared closely for a moment. The reflection stared back, glimmering in the sunlight with hair billowing in the breeze, for a second she could've sworn the image smirked at her.</p>\n<p>She continued to examine the picture before her, every lock of hair every curve of her body. She didn't move an inch. And then, without so much as blinking, Aphrodite clenched her fist, pulled her arm back, and threw it forward in a forceful show of true, unrestricted, godly might.</p>\n<p>The expertly crafted mirror shattered into countless shards as the foundations of her room shook beneath her. The drapes and flowers swung violently from the ceiling, dropping pieces of themselves alongside loosened fragments of the roof to the floor. When the world around her finally settled, the only thing visible on the now utterly destroyed mirror was the golden ichor spilled across the surface from her now injured hand, and the intense, searing glow from the rage in her own eyes staring back at her through shards of silver.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Isaac woke up in a start, feeling the breeze through the med-bay window. It took him a moment to get his bearings. He remembered rain, a storm blowing in, screams of people around him and\u2026</p>\n<p>Isaac's heart began to pound again as he glanced around the room. It was empty and quiet, no sign of anyone. No patients, nurses, Foundation personnel or\u2026 <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/calm-before-the-storm\">him</a>. He breathed a sigh of relief and looked down to his arms. They ached and were covered in bandages. Bandages? He quickly ripped them off in a panic to reveal what he had hoped he wouldn't.</p>\n<p>Under the bandages were the unmistakable snaking patterns of lightning, crawling up his arms to his chest, and tightly around his throat. Isaac scratched at his arms in disgust and fear, hoping that the markings would quickly disappear like any other wound, but he knew there was no erasing this brand. The brand of the man who made his life hell, the man who was now coming for all of them, for <em>him</em>, again.</p>\n<p>He had been marked.</p>\n<p>Isaac grabbed his head and shook it violently, as the intense mix of emotions flooded outwards in an uncontrolled vortex of warped reality. The surge caused the room to twist around him, thorns and vines growing from under beds. The floor tiles cracked as twisted roots and grasses shot up from below releasing all variety of insects and small animals to swarm the room. Isaac let out a scream, cracking the glass window and shaking the building, which alerted the guards just outside his room. They rushed into the med-bay, guns pointed directly at him.</p>\n<p>\"SCP-7454! Stand down, now!\"</p>\n<p>The sudden presence of two Foundation personnel briefly caused Isaac to freeze, his mind now focused on them. He <em>was</em> at the Foundation after all. They had their rifles trained on him ready to fire, but he knew it was more of a show of authority than anything. Regardless of the actual threat they posed to him, he took a breath and tried to calm himself.</p>\n<p>\"Where's Iszth?\" he demanded with equal authority to the guards who stared him down.</p>\n<p>The guards didn't move, simply focusing their sights on the bed ridden Isaac. Isaac's tone changed, now with more frustration as he threw the blankets off of himself and sat up.</p>\n<p>\"Where. Is. Iszth.\"</p>\n<p>The guards lifted their guns in unison to the now irate Isaac. Things were about to get out of hand.</p>\n<p>\"Woah, hey now!\" said a gruff and deep voice, \"no need for all the hostility, hm?\"</p>\n<p>A short and hairy man with a great beard pushed between the guards into the room. He was an odd sight to Isaac, definitely not your usual Foundation personnel, yet still seemed to stir some sort of familiarity in his mind. The man waddled into the room wearing a large smile and crossed his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Ah\u2026 you've made quite the mess of my station haven't you? I thought you lot were supposed to be all about hospitality and the like.\"</p>\n<p>The man laughed to himself.</p>\n<p>\"Unless you consider converting my medical bay into some form of terrarium good manners, hm?\"</p>\n<p>He laughed again seemingly unaware of the tense situation unfolding around him. The man took note of Isaac's stunned expression and turned to the guards.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, will you two relax,? What do you think you're gonna do with those peashooters? You seen what he did to the last person to fire a gun at him?\"</p>\n<p>The men lowered their guns and looked at each other before exiting the room once more.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry for the aggressive reaction, sometimes I don't even know why we bother with guns in this place. I swear every second injury that comes across my desk was due to a gun being no more useful than a pointy stick!\"</p>\n<p>The man chuckled to himself before picking up Isaac's digital chart and flicking through it.</p>\n<p>\"So! How are we feeling?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac frowned and shook his head.</p>\n<p>\"Uh\u2026 I'm\u2026 what?\"</p>\n<p>The man looked at Isaac with raised eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\"You know, any sore joints? Unusual bowel movements? Plants growing from where they're not supposed to?\"</p>\n<p>\"Um\u2026 I'm good, I guess?\"</p>\n<p>\"You <em>guess</em>?\" the man said back sarcastically, \"I'm the doctor here, I'm supposed to make the guesses and hope they're right.\"</p>\n<p>The man's nonchalant behaviour had Isaac taken aback. He wasn't sure what to make of him, though he seemed harmless enough. There was also something about him that made Isaac feel at ease, something most other medical staff at the Foundation lacked.</p>\n<p>\"Well, it's <em>my</em> guess, as the professional, that you've suffered extreme electrical burns and significant haemorrhaging throughout your entire body as a result of a severe and violent altercation with high level reality bending entity. Does that sound about correct?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac crossed his arms over his body and looked away.</p>\n<p>\"In all honesty, I'd say you're lucky to be alive but\u2026 well, we both know that luck had nothing to do with it, hm?\"</p>\n<p>The man closed the tablet and held it under his arm.</p>\n<p>\"I hear <em>the king of Gods</em> isn't the kind of man to let things slide.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac looked over to the man. His face dropped into a more serious gaze, like he had just caught Isaac in some sort of lie. The look of a parent who is more concerned than angry.</p>\n<p>\"Who\u2026 no, <em>what</em> are you?\" Isaac said with his suspicions beginning to rise.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" the man exclaimed suddenly, \"I haven't even introduced myself!\"</p>\n<p>The man straightened his back and puffed out his chest proudly.</p>\n<p>\"The name's <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-208\">Bes</a>! Although depending on who you ask, they may not use that name. Some people here have a real stick up their ass about protocol.\"</p>\n<p>The man let out a sigh.</p>\n<p>\"But I guess that's just the way of things with us so called 'anomalies' huh?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac jumped to attention and looked over the man.</p>\n<p>\"Anomaly? Like, you have abilities? Same as me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well\u2026\"</p>\n<p>The man hesitated for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe not <em>exactly</em> like you, although I guess probably closer than most of the other things they keep here. You're a god, correct?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac scoffed</p>\n<p>\"Sure. You could say that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, you had worshippers? A domain? A pantheon to call your own?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac sighed and shook his head, avoiding eye contact with Bes.</p>\n<p>\"I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Same here,\" the man responded, \"But I suppose I wasn't exactly among the high rollers like yourself! Just a humble deity living their lot in life, until the Foundation found me of course. Good thing they did too, was kinda\u2026 er\u2026 stuck you could say.\"</p>\n<p>The man crossed his arms.</p>\n<p>\"I hear you, however, had fallen on\u2026 let's say, hard times?\"</p>\n<p>\"'Hard times' is a way you could certainly fucking put it.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac turned his head away and muttered.</p>\n<p>\"If being found passed out, pants down in a vat's worth of dollar store wine and your own piss could be considered 'hard times'\"</p>\n<p>Bes laughed, clearly overhearing Isaac's quip.</p>\n<p>\"Depends on your perspective!\"</p>\n<p>Isaac turned back, ignoring Bes's response.</p>\n<p>\"Where is Iszth?\" he said firmly.</p>\n<p>Bes's demeanour changed somewhat as he frowned and nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, yes the good doctor Iszth. Well, they're currently preoccupied tracking down your attacker. They seem to be in rough spirits after the incident, even more so than everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are they upset with me for breaking out?\"</p>\n<p>\"Upset? Oh no, not with you\u2026 Not for that.\"</p>\n<p>\"With me? What do you mean 'not with me'?\"</p>\n<p>Bes thought for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"They're\u2026 angry. Extremely angry. Given the circumstances I can hardly blame them. They've been slaving away for days since the incident trying to find this guy, I don't think they've even slept.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac's eyes widened.</p>\n<p>\"Days? I've been out for\u2026 days?!\"</p>\n<p>\"Well-\"</p>\n<p>Bes was interrupted by the sound of a loud crash somewhere down the hall. He quickly turned his head to the closed door in confusion. The sound was followed by the sound of personnel shouting, quickly followed again by the sound of a loud female voice shouting back and the pained groans of guards hitting the wall.</p>\n<p>\"Ma'am! Ma'am! You can't be here! You're not authorised to-\"</p>\n<p>\"Like hell I can't! You wanna see how strong these walls are too?! C'mere!\"</p>\n<p>\"No no no wait!\"</p>\n<p>The screaming was cut short by the sound of drywall cracking under the weight of another winded guard as rapid stomping neared the door.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the door burst inwards, flying off its hinges and onto the ground in a crumpled heap. Standing in the doorway, fist raised, was a large and muscular woman with bright red skin and horns, radiating an intense rage.</p>\n<p>\"ISAAC!!\" Calendar roared as she stormed into the room.</p>\n<p>\"C-Calendar? How in the fuck-\"</p>\n<p>Calendar wasted no time in rushing to Isaac's side and towering over him. For a moment Isaac thought he was about to get thrown across the room as well, a feeling that didn't exactly fade as Calendar reached around him and near crushed what few bones hadn't been broken already.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you weren't allowed to leave that weird fucking Pyramid in Vegas?\" Isaac managed to spurt out between the pain and tightly compressed diaphragm.</p>\n<p>\"I can go wherever I want, so long as I can knock out enough people.\"</p>\n<p>Calendar loosened her grip and slowly sank down to eye level with Isaac. She moved her hands to Isaac's shoulders, stared into his eyes, and spoke with a terrifyingly calm tone.</p>\n<p>\"Who did this, and where are they?\"</p>\n<p>The complete change in demeanour sent a shudder up Isaac's spine. He wasn't scared of Calendar, not in the slightest, but the sheer look in her eyes caused an almost visceral reaction in his soul.</p>\n<p>Before Isaac could stumble through the words to warn Calendar away from chasing after his attacker, Bes spoke up once more.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry to interject, but I must insist that you let my patient rest. He hasn't exactly recovered yet and I can't have you breaking what little of him isn't broken, hm?\"</p>\n<p>Bes chuckled, causing Calendar to snap her attention to him. She jumped over to Bes and picked the stout man off the ground by his collar.</p>\n<p>\"H-hey now!\"</p>\n<p>\"Was it you? Did you hurt him like this?! I swear I'll turn you into mulch with my BARE THIGHS if you hurt him!\"</p>\n<p>\"W-well, don't threaten m-me with a good time! Hah!\"</p>\n<p>Before Calendar could utterly throttle Bes and reduced him to a collection of various types of dust, Isaac spoke up.</p>\n<p>\"Calendar, I'm fine. Bezos or whatever his name is didn't touch me, he's just a doctor. A weird\u2026 hairy doctor.\"</p>\n<p>Calendar didn't let go of Bes, instead just turning to Isaac to continue the conversation, Bes slowly turning blue in the face.</p>\n<p>\"Then who was it? I swear if I find them I will punch their skull out of their goddamn HEAD! Just tell me where and who they are and I'll make them wish they were never BORN!\"</p>\n<p>\"Zeus.\"</p>\n<p>A subtle voice cut through the scene between the anomalies as they all turned their attention to the doorway. Standing there was a meek, dishevelled, and grim looking researcher, looking over the destroyed clinic with tired indifference. Dark bags hung under their eyes and their black hair hung like a shadow over their pale and pallid face.</p>\n<p>\"Riley?\" muttered Isaac, stunned at the worn down and exhausted shell in front of him.</p>\n<p>\"Calendar, please top killing my top medical attendant.\"</p>\n<p>Calendar dropped Bes to the ground with a loud thud.</p>\n<p>\"Ow.\" mumbled Bes as he clambered to his feet.</p>\n<p>\"Riley, you look like fucking shit. Are you ok?\"</p>\n<p>Iszth didn't respond to Isaac's query, only staring with a glazed expression at the group.</p>\n<p>\"I need to speak to Isaac alone. Please leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"Leave? I just got here, I'm not leaving yet!\" Calendar roared at Iszth.</p>\n<p>Iszth breathed in as they took off their glasses, rubbed their eyes, and turned to Calendar.</p>\n<p>\"Calendar, I'm ordering you to leave. If you fail to comply I will be speaking to House about this arrangement. I won't ask again.\"</p>\n<p>Calendar gritted her teeth and clenched her fists tight, ready to show this pitifully small researcher standing in front of her that she was done taking orders. Isaac took notice of Calendar's reaction and spoke up.</p>\n<p>\"No need to act all tough at my expense, red. I mean, coming all the way here for me? You just couldn't resist, could you?\"</p>\n<p>It pained Isaac to act like nothing was amiss, to pretend that he didn't want Calendar to stay, and to pretend that he didn't want to just break down in her arms. Calendar turned to look at Isaac as he gave her a sultry wink.</p>\n<p>\"But I mean\u2026 if you think you're not <em>strong</em> enough to last a few more hours without me, I understand.\"</p>\n<p>Calendar's textbook fury lit up in her eyes again, the one she gave when challenged. Isaac was happy to see that glare from over her shoulder, to know her spirit was still intact despite the state of his. Calendar looked over at Iszth and back at Isaac before letting out a loud scoff.</p>\n<p>\"You do anything, and I swear\u2026\" Calendar slammed her hands together, cracking her knuckles and letting off a mild shockwave. She gave one last look at Isaac before grabbing Bes by the collar and dragging him out the door.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, gnome guy! We're leaving!\"</p>\n<p>\"H-hey! Easy now! You're gonna tear my coat, I only have short legs! Hey! You listening?!\"</p>\n<p>The two stormed off down the hallway out of sight, and now Isaac and Iszth were alone in the room.</p>\n<p>Iszth moved over to the window and leant on the wall, their head hung low as they struggled to keep themselves upright. Iszth didn't speak, instead they continued staring out the window.</p>\n<p>Isaac was the first to break the silence.</p>\n<p>\"Riley, look. I'm sorry ok? I know I fucked up, I know it was stupid of me to run off without telling you I just needed to clear my head and get out of this place.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac stood up off of the bed and took a step towards Iszth who still hadn't turned to face him.</p>\n<p>\"It was just supposed to be some harmless fun, you know? I break out, you guys bring me back, No harm, no foul. I even went somewhere where I wouldn't draw suspicion! I tried my best to keep up with what you wanted, and hide this sort of shit from normal people!\"</p>\n<p>Iszth still didn't react, still staring out the window at nothing in particular. The lack of any sort of response began to irritate Isaac. Why was he being ignored? He never meant to cause such a scene. It wasn't his fault that Zeus had found him! He raised his voice, clearly growing more emotional with each second.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry I fucking left! I'm sorry you guys had to come get me, and I'm sorry I caused you so many issues! I'm sorry that fuckwit found me and I'm sorry I wasn't fucking strong enough to fight back! I didn't want this! Any of this!\"</p>\n<p>Isaac took one more step towards the despondent Iszth and shouted.</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck was I supposed to do?! You know <em>exactly</em> who that was, and what he's capable of! So don't act like I'm at fucking fault for this! There's nothing, and I mean <em>nothing</em>, I could've done, and you fucking know it! I know you do!\"</p>\n<p>Isaac's breathing had intensified and he sat back on the edge of the bed, now on the verge of tears. It was not his fault, it was just shit luck and a bad day. That's all.</p>\n<p>\"You could've stayed.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth's words cut through Isaac more viciously than any bolt of lightning. Before Isaac could respond, Iszth finally lifted themselves up off the windowsill and turned to face Isaac.</p>\n<p>Isaac could see Iszth's dishevelled and exhausted face clearly now. Their eyes were bloodshot and misty, their arms hung by their side defeatedly as they continued to stare at Isaac with a look of complete defeat.</p>\n<p>\"You could've stayed,\" repeated Iszth, \"And this entire thing could've been avoided.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth started walking slowly towards the bed. Isaac could see the pain on Iszth's face which caused the emotions from before to give way to confusion. He could see their face was wet from tears.</p>\n<p>Tears? Isaac's mind tried to make sense of the sight. Had they been crying? Why on Earth would <em>they</em> be crying? It couldn't have been <em>that</em> serious from the Foundation's perspective. He knew it was a complete and utter fucking disaster, but for Iszth to be so affected by it?</p>\n<p>\"All I asked was that you stayed here. It was one of only two things I asked of you.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth's mouth curled upwards in a painful smile, breaking eye contact with Isaac to wipe their face dry.</p>\n<p>\"But, of course, you had to leave. You just had to get out of this place and go cross country for a bit before we eventually brought you back, and you could keep on reaping the benefits of this agreement with only minimal consequences. And all the while, you still get to live your party lifestyle.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac interjected.</p>\n<p>\"That's not-\"</p>\n<p>\"And now!\", Iszth continued, not leaving a moment for Isaac to speak, \"Now, here we are! A new incident, a new report, and a new shit show I have to clean up in your wake. Just another happy day at the Foundation!\"</p>\n<p>Iszth leant down to look into Isaac's eyes, still smiling that agonisingly forced smile.</p>\n<p>\"I'm so happy you had a great time at Site-666. I'm glad that you Calendar hit it off so well. I'm so happy for you and her, truly.\"</p>\n<p>They paused a moment as their smile dropped to a somewhat condescending look of feigned concern.</p>\n<p>\"I'm also so sorry that you had to face your abuser in such a way, and how awful that must've been for you. No one should have to go through pain like that, right?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac was beyond confused at this point. Iszth had never acted this way towards him before. Never. No matter how belligerent or annoying Isaac was. Even when breaking the rules, even when it caused major problems, Iszth had always been a calm and soft spoken voice of mediation. Before Isaac could respond, Iszth scoffed at him and took out their phone.</p>\n<p>Without looking at Isaac, they began to flick through the device, stopping occasionally to hold back more tears.</p>\n<p>\"So, I guess I just have to request again that you remain on the premises if you do not have authorisation to leave! It's dangerous out there, we wouldn't want you to go through that again, would we?\"</p>\n<p>Iszth leant back down to Isaac and turned their phone around, showing the screen. Isaac's stomach instantly dropped as he realised what he was looking at.</p>\n<p>\"It would be awful to be faced with the consequences of your actions, wouldn't it?\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Isaac became intensely aware of why Iszth was acting so out of character. His blood ran cold and all thoughts of arguing against them completely disappeared from his mind. He just kept staring at the screen. He stayed completely silent as Iszth stood there, holding the phone directly in front of him.</p>\n<p>On the screen was a photo. Iszth was standing there smiling, arm in arm next to a man with short blonde hair wearing glasses. Their heads were pressed together cheek to cheek, and like so many other selfies taken by couples, they looked genuinely happy.</p>\n<p>Isaac, of course, recognised the face staring back at him. How could he forget?</p>\n<p>After all, it was the last Isaac saw of him before he was reduced to a pile of molten flesh clinging to bone. Before he was snuffed out simply doing his job, and bringing Isaac back to Site-17, just like Iszth had asked him to.</p>\n<p>Isaac hung his head and spoke softly.</p>\n<p>\"Riley\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Iszth stood up suddenly and slid the phone back into their pocket. They wiped away the tears and took a breath, before turning quickly back to the door. Their voice suddenly snapped back into the authoritative tone expected of Foundation personnel, as if they were reading script.</p>\n<p>\"You will be reprimanded for these actions and confined to your quarters for a week. You will not be permitted to use your abilities during this time, and any infraction upon this confinement will be met with further disciplinary actions.\"</p>\n<p>The words rolled out like an automated message, cold and factual. Iszth glanced back at Isaac over their shoulder before speaking again.</p>\n<p>\"Is that clear, SCP-7454?\"</p>\n<p>Isaac didn't look up at Iszth, instead wrapping his arms around his waist and turning his head away.</p>\n<p>\"Yes\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Good,\" Iszth responded, \"I'll expect your full cooperation and will see you at our next regularly scheduled meeting.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth began walking towards the door to leave before Isaac called out to them.</p>\n<p>\"Riley.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth stopped in the doorway, not turning to face Isaac.</p>\n<p>\"I'm\u2026 sorry. I should've stayed. This shouldn't have happened.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac's tone was soft and gentle, a tone he hadn't used in a long time. He turned towards Iszth before continuing.</p>\n<p>\"If there's anything I can do, anything at all, please\u2026 just tell me.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth didn't move or respond for a moment, before speaking up.</p>\n<p>\"I don't need anything from you, Isaac.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth slowly turned to look him in the eyes. It was different from before. The look was hateful, filled with immense pain just beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>\"What I need,\" they continued, \"Is to see that thing's bloody, rotting, severed head at my doorstep, so I can crush it under my boot.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac shuddered at that line. He knew Iszth was grieving, he wanted to help them any way he could. But Isaac knew, at least in Iszth's head, that they blamed Isaac just as much as the actual murderer. Isaac decided to let it be, and not push any further.</p>\n<p>\"If that's everything, you'll have to excuse me. I have a god to kill.\"</p>\n<p>Iszth left the room and disappeared down the hall, leaving Isaac alone once more.</p>\n<p>He looked down at the lightning patterns on his arms before lifting his head to look around at the destroyed med-bay. Vines and roots twisted around fixtures and upended beds. A pipe had burst and was leaking down into a pool filled with frogs feasting on the numerous insects Isaac had manifested into existence. The roof dripped with water and honey, crickets chirped and sung in the crevices of the roots, and in the middle of the room, a pair of rabbits were going at it like their species was going extinct.</p>\n<p>Isaac lied back down in the bed and stared up at the ceiling, just as a small bird landed on his head and began preening his hair.</p>\n<p>He sighed.</p>\n<p>What a fucking mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/reflection\">Med-Bay Reflection</a>\" by Iszth, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

She blinked herself awake, draped within her exquisite silken sheets, as she breathed in the cool air smelling of flowers and the sea.\n\n\n\nShe lay there for a moment, staring blankly towards the incredible relief carved into the fine marble ceiling of her bed chambers. A tribute to her endless beauty and fertility, encrusted with jewels and covered with draping flowers and thin coloured veils. She took a deep breath in, closed her eyes, and let out a long sigh.\n\n\n\nAphrodite slowly rose up to sit on the side of her bed before standing fully in the glowing sun. It sparkled through the paper thin and transparent veil tied around her waist, leg and chest, not so much as a form of modesty but as an embellishment to her exquisite figure for the world to see. She began walking over to the balcony through which her curtains billowed past the ornate and vine-coated marble pillars.\n\n\n\nHer chest was heavy, her gait uneven, and her exposed skin was biting even in the heavenly breeze. She stopped midway to the balcony to look at herself the perfectly reflective mirror presented in her bed chambers. As expected, the form staring back at her was absolutely immaculate. Her skin shone a light olive unmarked by anything denoting age nor experience. Her hair was golden and full, trailing in elegant twists that reached her hips. Her entire figure, from her delicate face to her full chest, her wide hips and smooth legs, there is nothing one could possibly want more from their own visage.\n\n\n\nAnd rightfully so. She was a Goddess, of course, in the truest sense of the word. She embodied everything that was beautiful, lovable, romanceable. She was absolutely and completely perfect.\n\n\n\nWithout a word, Aphrodite gently touched her face and turned to face the mirror on her wall. She briskly walked over to her beautiful reflection and stared closely for a moment. The reflection stared back, glimmering in the sunlight with hair billowing in the breeze, for a second she could've sworn the image smirked at her.\n\n\n\nShe continued to examine the picture before her, every lock of hair every curve of her body. She didn't move an inch. And then, without so much as blinking, Aphrodite clenched her fist, pulled her arm back, and threw it forward in a forceful show of true, unrestricted, godly might. \n\n\n\nThe expertly crafted mirror shattered into countless shards as the foundations of her room shook beneath her. The drapes and flowers swung violently from the ceiling, dropping pieces of themselves alongside loosened fragments of the roof to the floor. When the world around her finally settled, the only thing visible on the now utterly destroyed mirror was the golden ichor spilled across the surface from her now injured hand, and the intense, searing glow from the rage in her own eyes staring back at her through shards of silver.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac woke up in a start, feeling the breeze through the med-bay window. It took him a moment to get his bearings. He remembered rain, a storm blowing in, screams of people around him and...\n\n\n\nIsaac's heart began to pound again as he glanced around the room. It was empty and quiet, no sign of anyone. No patients, nurses, Foundation personnel or... [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/calm-before-the-storm | him]]]. He breathed a sigh of relief and looked down to his arms. They ached and were covered in bandages. Bandages? He quickly ripped them off in a panic to reveal what he had hoped he wouldn't.\n\n\n\nUnder the bandages were the unmistakable snaking patterns of lightning, crawling up his arms to his chest, and tightly around his throat. Isaac scratched at his arms in disgust and fear, hoping that the markings would quickly disappear like any other wound, but he knew there was no erasing this brand. The brand of the man who made his life hell, the man who was now coming for all of them, for //him//, again.\n\n\n\nHe had been marked.\n\n\n\nIsaac grabbed his head and shook it violently, as the intense mix of emotions flooded outwards in an uncontrolled vortex of warped reality. The surge caused the room to twist around him, thorns and vines growing from under beds. The floor tiles cracked as twisted roots and grasses shot up from below releasing all variety of insects and small animals to swarm the room. Isaac let out a scream, cracking the glass window and shaking the building, which alerted the guards just outside his room. They rushed into the med-bay, guns pointed directly at him.\n\n\n\n\"SCP-7454! Stand down, now!\"\n\n\n\nThe sudden presence of two Foundation personnel briefly caused Isaac to freeze, his mind now focused on them. He //was// at the Foundation after all. They had their rifles trained on him ready to fire, but he knew it was more of a show of authority than anything. Regardless of the actual threat they posed to him, he took a breath and tried to calm himself.\n\n\n\n\"Where's Iszth?\" he demanded with equal authority to the guards who stared him down.\n\n\n\nThe guards didn't move, simply focusing their sights on the bed ridden Isaac. Isaac's tone changed, now with more frustration as he threw the blankets off of himself and sat up.\n\n\n\n\"Where. Is. Iszth.\"\n\n\n\nThe guards lifted their guns in unison to the now irate Isaac. Things were about to get out of hand.\n\n\n\n\"Woah, hey now!\" said a gruff and deep voice, \"no need for all the hostility, hm?\"\n\n\n\nA short and hairy man with a great beard pushed between the guards into the room. He was an odd sight to Isaac, definitely not your usual Foundation personnel, yet still seemed to stir some sort of familiarity in his mind. The man waddled into the room wearing a large smile and crossed his arms.\n\n\n\n\"Ah... you've made quite the mess of my station haven't you? I thought you lot were supposed to be all about hospitality and the like.\"\n\n\n\nThe man laughed to himself.\n\n\n\n\"Unless you consider converting my medical bay into some form of terrarium good manners, hm?\"\n\n\n\nHe laughed again seemingly unaware of the tense situation unfolding around him. The man took note of Isaac's stunned expression and turned to the guards.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, will you two relax,? What do you think you're gonna do with those peashooters? You seen what he did to the last person to fire a gun at him?\"\n\n\n\nThe men lowered their guns and looked at each other before exiting the room once more.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry for the aggressive reaction, sometimes I don't even know why we bother with guns in this place. I swear every second injury that comes across my desk was due to a gun being no more useful than a pointy stick!\"\n\n\n\nThe man chuckled to himself before picking up Isaac's digital chart and flicking through it.\n\n\n\n\"So! How are we feeling?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac frowned and shook his head.\n\n\n\n\"Uh... I'm... what?\"\n\n\n\nThe man looked at Isaac with raised eyebrows.\n\n\n\n\"You know, any sore joints? Unusual bowel movements? Plants growing from where they're not supposed to?\"\n\n\n\n\"Um... I'm good, I guess?\"\n\n\n\n\"You //guess//?\" the man said back sarcastically, \"I'm the doctor here, I'm supposed to make the guesses and hope they're right.\"\n\n\n\nThe man's nonchalant behaviour had Isaac taken aback. He wasn't sure what to make of him, though he seemed harmless enough. There was also something about him that made Isaac feel at ease, something most other medical staff at the Foundation lacked.\n\n\n\n\"Well, it's //my// guess, as the professional, that you've suffered extreme electrical burns and significant haemorrhaging throughout your entire body as a result of a severe and violent altercation with high level reality bending entity. Does that sound about correct?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac crossed his arms over his body and looked away.\n\n\n\n\"In all honesty, I'd say you're lucky to be alive but... well, we both know that luck had nothing to do with it, hm?\"\n\n\n\nThe man closed the tablet and held it under his arm.\n\n\n\n\"I hear //the king of Gods// isn't the kind of man to let things slide.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac looked over to the man. His face dropped into a more serious gaze, like he had just caught Isaac in some sort of lie. The look of a parent who is more concerned than angry.\n\n\n\n\"Who... no, //what// are you?\" Isaac said with his suspicions beginning to rise.\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" the man exclaimed suddenly, \"I haven't even introduced myself!\"\n\n\n\nThe man straightened his back and puffed out his chest proudly.\n\n\n\n\"The name's\u00a0\u00a0[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-208 | Bes]]]! Although depending on who you ask, they may not use that name. Some people here have a real stick up their ass about protocol.\"\n\n\n\nThe man let out a sigh.\n\n\n\n\"But I guess that's just the way of things with us so called 'anomalies' huh?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac jumped to attention and looked over the man.\n\n\n\n\"Anomaly? Like, you have abilities? Same as me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well...\" \n\n\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe not //exactly// like you, although I guess probably closer than most of the other things they keep here. You're a god, correct?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac scoffed\n\n\n\n\"Sure. You could say that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, you had worshippers? A domain? A pantheon to call your own?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac sighed and shook his head, avoiding eye contact with Bes.\n\n\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Same here,\" the man responded, \"But I suppose I wasn't exactly among the high rollers like yourself! Just a humble deity living their lot in life, until the Foundation found me of course. Good thing they did too, was kinda... er... stuck you could say.\"\n\n\n\nThe man crossed his arms.\n\n\n\n\"I hear you, however, had fallen on... let's say, hard times?\"\n\n\n\n\"'Hard times' is a way you could certainly fucking put it.\" \n\n\n\nIsaac turned his head away and muttered.\n\n\n\n\"If being found passed out, pants down in a vat's worth of dollar store wine and your own piss could be considered 'hard times'\"\n\n\n\nBes laughed, clearly overhearing Isaac's quip.\n\n\n\n\"Depends on your perspective!\"\n\n\n\nIsaac turned back, ignoring Bes's response.\n\n\n\n\"Where is Iszth?\" he said firmly.\n\n\n\nBes's demeanour changed somewhat as he frowned and nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, yes the good doctor Iszth. Well, they're currently preoccupied tracking down your attacker. They seem to be in rough spirits after the incident, even more so than everyone else.\"\n\n\n\n\"Are they upset with me for breaking out?\"\n\n\n\n\"Upset? Oh no, not with you... Not for that.\"\n\n\n\n\"With me? What do you mean 'not with me'?\"\n\n\n\nBes thought for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"They're... angry. Extremely angry. Given the circumstances I can hardly blame them. They've been slaving away for days since the incident trying to find this guy, I don't think they've even slept.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac's eyes widened.\n\n\n\n\"Days? I've been out for... days?!\"\n\n\n\n\"Well-\"\n\n\n\nBes was interrupted by the sound of a loud crash somewhere down the hall. He quickly turned his head to the closed door in confusion. The sound was followed by the sound of personnel shouting, quickly followed again by the sound of a loud female voice shouting back and the pained groans of guards hitting the wall.\n\n\n\n\"Ma'am! Ma'am! You can't be here! You're not authorised to-\"\n\n\n\n\"Like hell I can't! You wanna see how strong these walls are too?! C'mere!\"\n\n\n\n\"No no no wait!\"\n\n\n\nThe screaming was cut short by the sound of drywall cracking under the weight of another winded guard as rapid stomping neared the door.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the door burst inwards, flying off its hinges and onto the ground in a crumpled heap. Standing in the doorway, fist raised, was a large and muscular woman with bright red skin and horns, radiating an intense rage.\n\n\n\n\"ISAAC!!\" Calendar roared as she stormed into the room.\n\n\n\n\"C-Calendar? How in the fuck-\"\n\n\n\nCalendar wasted no time in rushing to Isaac's side and towering over him. For a moment Isaac thought he was about to get thrown across the room as well, a feeling that didn't exactly fade as Calendar reached around him and near crushed what few bones hadn't been broken already.\n\n\n\n\"I thought you weren't allowed to leave that weird fucking Pyramid in Vegas?\" Isaac managed to spurt out between the pain and tightly compressed diaphragm. \n\n\n\n\"I can go wherever I want, so long as I can knock out enough people.\"\n\n\n\nCalendar loosened her grip and slowly sank down to eye level with Isaac. She moved her hands to Isaac's shoulders, stared into his eyes, and spoke with a terrifyingly calm tone.\n\n\n\n\"Who did this, and where are they?\"\n\n\n\nThe complete change in demeanour sent a shudder up Isaac's spine. He wasn't scared of Calendar, not in the slightest, but the sheer look in her eyes caused an almost visceral reaction in his soul.\n\n\n\nBefore Isaac could stumble through the words to warn Calendar away from chasing after his attacker, Bes spoke up once more.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry to interject, but I must insist that you let my patient rest. He hasn't exactly recovered yet and I can't have you breaking what little of him isn't broken, hm?\"\n\n\n\nBes chuckled, causing Calendar to snap her attention to him. She jumped over to Bes and picked the stout man off the ground by his collar.\n\n\n\n\"H-hey now!\"\n\n\n\n\"Was it you? Did you hurt him like this?! I swear I'll turn you into mulch with my BARE THIGHS if you hurt him!\"\n\n\n\n\"W-well, don't threaten m-me with a good time! Hah!\"\n\n\n\nBefore Calendar could utterly throttle Bes and reduced him to a collection of various types of dust, Isaac spoke up.\n\n\n\n\"Calendar, I'm fine. Bezos or whatever his name is didn't touch me, he's just a doctor. A weird... hairy doctor.\"\n\n\n\nCalendar didn't let go of Bes, instead just turning to Isaac to continue the conversation, Bes slowly turning blue in the face.\n\n\n\n\"Then who was it? I swear if I find them I will punch their skull out of their goddamn HEAD! Just tell me where and who they are and I'll make them wish they were never BORN!\"\n\n\n\n\"Zeus.\"\n\n\n\nA subtle voice cut through the scene between the anomalies as they all turned their attention to the doorway. Standing there was a meek, dishevelled, and grim looking researcher, looking over the destroyed clinic with tired indifference. Dark bags hung under their eyes and their black hair hung like a shadow over their pale and pallid face.\n\n\n\n\"Riley?\" muttered Isaac, stunned at the worn down and exhausted shell in front of him.\n\n\n\n\"Calendar, please top killing my top medical attendant.\"\n\n\n\nCalendar dropped Bes to the ground with a loud thud.\n\n\n\n\"Ow.\" mumbled Bes as he clambered to his feet.\n\n\n\n\"Riley, you look like fucking shit. Are you ok?\"\n\n\n\nIszth didn't respond to Isaac's query, only staring with a glazed expression at the group.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak to Isaac alone. Please leave.\"\n\n\n\n\"Leave? I just got here, I'm not leaving yet!\" Calendar roared at Iszth.\n\n\n\nIszth breathed in as they took off their glasses, rubbed their eyes, and turned to Calendar.\n\n\n\n\"Calendar, I'm ordering you to leave. If you fail to comply I will be speaking to House about this arrangement. I won't ask again.\"\n\n\n\nCalendar gritted her teeth and clenched her fists tight, ready to show this pitifully small researcher standing in front of her that she was done taking orders. Isaac took notice of Calendar's reaction and spoke up.\n\n\n\n\"No need to act all tough at my expense, red. I mean, coming all the way here for me? You just couldn't resist, could you?\"\n\n\n\nIt pained Isaac to act like nothing was amiss, to pretend that he didn't want Calendar to stay, and to pretend that he didn't want to just break down in her arms. Calendar turned to look at Isaac as he gave her a sultry wink.\n\n\n\n\"But I mean... if you think you're not //strong// enough to last a few more hours without me, I understand.\"\n\n\n\nCalendar's textbook fury lit up in her eyes again, the one she gave when challenged. Isaac was happy to see that glare from over her shoulder, to know her spirit was still intact despite the state of his. Calendar looked over at Iszth and back at Isaac before letting out a loud scoff.\n\n\n\n\"You do anything, and I swear...\" Calendar slammed her hands together, cracking her knuckles and letting off a mild shockwave. She gave one last look at Isaac before grabbing Bes by the collar and dragging him out the door.\n\n\n\n\"Come on, gnome guy! We're leaving!\"\n\n\n\n\"H-hey! Easy now! You're gonna tear my coat, I only have short legs! Hey! You listening?!\"\n\n\n\nThe two stormed off down the hallway out of sight, and now Isaac and Iszth were alone in the room.\n\n\n\nIszth moved over to the window and leant on the wall, their head hung low as they struggled to keep themselves upright. Iszth didn't speak, instead they continued staring out the window.\n\n\n\nIsaac was the first to break the silence.\n\n\n\n\"Riley, look. I'm sorry ok? I know I fucked up, I know it was stupid of me to run off without telling you I just needed to clear my head and get out of this place.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac stood up off of the bed and took a step towards Iszth who still hadn't turned to face him.\n\n\n\n\"It was just supposed to be some harmless fun, you know? I break out, you guys bring me back, No harm, no foul. I even went somewhere where I wouldn't draw suspicion! I tried my best to keep up with what you wanted, and hide this sort of shit from normal people!\"\n\n\n\nIszth still didn't react, still staring out the window at nothing in particular. The lack of any sort of response began to irritate Isaac. Why was he being ignored? He never meant to cause such a scene. It wasn't his fault that Zeus had found him! He raised his voice, clearly growing more emotional with each second.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry I fucking left! I'm sorry you guys had to come get me, and I'm sorry I caused you so many issues! I'm sorry that fuckwit found me and I'm sorry I wasn't fucking strong enough to fight back! I didn't want this! Any of this!\"\n\n\n\nIsaac took one more step towards the despondent Iszth and shouted.\n\n\n\n\"What the fuck was I supposed to do?! You know //exactly// who that was, and what he's capable of! So don't act like I'm at fucking fault for this! There's nothing, and I mean //nothing//, I could've done, and you\u00a0\u00a0fucking know it! I know you do!\"\n\n\n\nIsaac's breathing had intensified and he sat back on the edge of the bed, now on the verge of tears. It was not his fault, it was just shit luck and a bad day. That's all.\n\n\n\n\"You could've stayed.\"\n\n\n\nIszth's words cut through Isaac more viciously than any bolt of lightning. Before Isaac could respond, Iszth finally lifted themselves up off the windowsill and turned to face Isaac.\n\n\n\nIsaac could see Iszth's dishevelled and exhausted face clearly now. Their eyes were bloodshot and misty, their arms hung by their side defeatedly as they continued to stare at Isaac with a look of complete defeat.\n\n\n\n\"You could've stayed,\" repeated Iszth, \"And this entire thing could've been avoided.\"\n\n\n\nIszth started walking slowly towards the bed. Isaac could see the pain on Iszth's face which caused the emotions from before to give way to confusion. He could see their face was wet from tears.\n\n\n\nTears? Isaac's mind tried to make sense of the sight. Had they been crying? Why on Earth would //they// be crying? It couldn't have been //that// serious from the Foundation's perspective. He knew it was a complete and utter fucking disaster, but for Iszth to be so affected by it?\n\n\n\n\"All I asked was that you stayed here. It was one of only two things I asked of you.\"\n\n\n\nIszth's mouth curled upwards in a painful smile, breaking eye contact with Isaac to wipe their face dry.\n\n\n\n\"But, of course, you had to leave. You just had to get out of this place and go cross country for a bit before we eventually brought you back, and you could keep on reaping the benefits of this agreement with only minimal consequences. And all the while, you still get to live your party lifestyle.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac interjected.\n\n\n\n\"That's not-\"\n\n\n\n\"And now!\", Iszth continued, not leaving a moment for Isaac to speak, \"Now, here we are! A new incident, a new report, and a new shit show I have to clean up in your wake. Just another happy day at the Foundation!\"\n\n\n\nIszth leant down to look into Isaac's eyes, still smiling that agonisingly forced smile.\n\n\n\n\"I'm so happy you had a great time at Site-666. I'm glad that you Calendar hit it off so well. I'm so happy for you and her, truly.\"\n\n\n\nThey paused a moment as their smile dropped to a somewhat condescending look of feigned concern.\n\n\n\n\"I'm also so sorry that you had to face your abuser in such a way, and how awful that must've been for you. No one should have to go through pain like that, right?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac was beyond confused at this point. Iszth had never acted this way towards him before. Never. No matter how belligerent or annoying Isaac was. Even when breaking the rules, even when it caused major problems, Iszth had always been a calm and soft spoken voice of mediation. Before Isaac could respond, Iszth scoffed at him and took out their phone.\n\n\n\nWithout looking at Isaac, they began to flick through the device, stopping occasionally to hold back more tears.\n\n\n\n\"So, I guess I just have to request again that you remain on the premises if you do not have authorisation to leave! It's dangerous out there, we wouldn't want you to go through that again, would we?\"\n\n\n\nIszth leant back down to Isaac and turned their phone around, showing the screen. Isaac's stomach instantly dropped as he realised what he was looking at.\n\n\n\n\"It would be awful to be faced with the consequences of your actions, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, Isaac became intensely aware of why Iszth was acting so out of character. His blood ran cold and all thoughts of arguing against them completely disappeared from his mind. He just kept staring at the screen. He stayed completely silent as Iszth stood there, holding the phone directly in front of him.\n\n\n\nOn the screen was a photo. Iszth was standing there smiling, arm in arm next to a man with short blonde hair wearing glasses. Their heads were pressed together cheek to cheek, and like so many other selfies taken by couples, they looked genuinely happy. \n\n\n\nIsaac, of course, recognised the face staring back at him. How could he forget?\n\n\n\nAfter all, it was the last Isaac saw of him before he was reduced to a pile of molten flesh clinging to bone. Before he was snuffed out simply doing his job, and bringing Isaac back to Site-17, just like Iszth had asked him to.\n\n\n\nIsaac hung his head and spoke softly.\n\n\n\n\"Riley...\"\n\n\n\nIszth stood up suddenly and slid the phone back into their pocket. They wiped away the tears and took a breath, before turning quickly back to the door. Their voice suddenly snapped back into the authoritative tone expected of Foundation personnel, as if they were reading script.\n\n\n\n\"You will be reprimanded for these actions and confined to your quarters for a week. You will not be permitted to use your abilities during this time, and any infraction upon this confinement will be met with further disciplinary actions.\"\n\n\n\nThe words rolled out like an automated message, cold and factual. Iszth glanced back at Isaac over their shoulder before speaking again.\n\n\n\n\"Is that clear, SCP-7454?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac didn't look up at Iszth, instead wrapping his arms around his waist and turning his head away.\n\n\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\n\n\"Good,\" Iszth responded, \"I'll expect your full cooperation and will see you at our next regularly scheduled meeting.\"\n\n\n\nIszth began walking towards the door to leave before Isaac called out to them.\n\n\n\n\"Riley.\"\n\n\n\nIszth stopped in the doorway, not turning to face Isaac.\n\n\n\n\"I'm... sorry. I should've stayed. This shouldn't have happened.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac's tone was soft and gentle, a tone he hadn't used in a long time. He turned towards Iszth before continuing.\n\n\n\n\"If there's anything I can do, anything at all, please... just tell me.\"\n\n\n\nIszth didn't move or respond for a moment, before speaking up.\n\n\n\n\"I don't need anything from you, Isaac.\"\n\n\n\nIszth slowly turned to look him in the eyes. It was different from before. The look was hateful, filled with immense pain just beneath the surface.\n\n\n\n\"What I need,\" they continued, \"Is to see that thing's bloody, rotting, severed head at my doorstep, so I can crush it under my boot.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac shuddered at that line. He knew Iszth was grieving, he wanted to help them any way he could. But Isaac knew, at least in Iszth's head, that they blamed Isaac just as much as the actual murderer. Isaac decided to let it be, and not push any further.\n\n\n\n\"If that's everything, you'll have to excuse me. I have a god to kill.\"\n\n\n\nIszth left the room and disappeared down the hall, leaving Isaac alone once more.\n\n\n\nHe looked down at the lightning patterns on his arms before lifting his head to look around at the destroyed med-bay. Vines and roots twisted around fixtures and upended beds. A pipe had burst and was leaking down into a pool filled with frogs feasting on the numerous insects Isaac had manifested into existence. The roof dripped with water and honey, crickets chirped and sung in the crevices of the roots, and in the middle of the room, a pair of rabbits were going at it like their species was going extinct.\n\n\n\nIsaac lied back down in the bed and stared up at the ceiling, just as a small bird landed on his head and began preening his hair. \n\n\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\n\nWhat a fucking mess.\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["calm-before-the-storm", "scp-208", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["agent-calendar", "lgbtq", "mythological", "tale"], "title": "Med-Bay Reflection - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/reflection", "year": 2025}, "shitty-morning": {"created_at": "2025-01-29T11:40:00", "creator": "Zaszx", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Zaszx", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zaszx", "comment": "Added tags: comedy, tale.

No one dared to stop him. They thought he was on a mission, as he often seemed to be. This was the Administrator after all, the boss among bosses, the one who could bend the O5 Council to his will with a single raised eyebrow. If he was running, there had to be a world ending reason behind it.</p>\n<p>However, on that day, the truth was very different.</p>\n<p>Two hours prior, the Administrator had enjoyed something from the Site\u2019s cafeteria, what he would later describe as \"an Apollyon class breakfast burrito.\" By the time the first cramps hit, he dismissed it as stress.

In an impressive show of speed for someone known more for his administrative prowess than his athletic ability, the Administrator abandoned everything to dash for the nearest restroom. But as fate would have it, the labyrinthine corridors of Site-01 offered no quick relief.</p>\n<p>And now, here he was, crouched behind a potted plant in a corridor, with parts of his legendary brown overcoat darker in color due to a containment breach in the lower end of his digestive system.</p>\n<p>Another cramp hit. The Administrator's jaw clenched. In his decades of service, he had authorized countless termination orders, approved experimental procedures that violated several laws of physics, but nothing had prepared him for this. He briefly considered declaring his digestive system an anomaly and having it surgically removed for containment. The thought was almost tempting, but the paperwork would be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>The potted plant wouldn't provide cover forever. He needed a plan. The nearest bathroom was two corridors away, past a main security checkpoint, and right next to the weekly meeting room of the Ethics Committee which offered an embarrassing potential audience. This was too risky. Instead, he decided to make a break for his office where he kept a change of clothes for emergencies. Though, when he prepared that contingency, he was thinking more along the lines of coffee stains; and although the color is similar, his current condition was way more damaging for personal dignity.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He risked a glance around the corridor with his neck craning out from behind the plant like a cautious giraffe surveying the savanna. It was momentarily clear; no guards, no researchers, no nosey containment specialists. Clutching the edges of his brown coat in a stealth mission, the Administrator scurried from behind the plant.</p>\n<p>\"At least my luck seems to be turning,\" he thought. \"At least the path to the office seems to be clear.\" He had a glimpse of hope.</p>\n<p>But if there was one universal truth about Site-01, it was that something would inevitably go wrong whenever the Administrator really, really needed a moment of privacy. And sure enough;</p>\n<p><em>BWAAAAP!</em></p>\n<p>A harsh siren erupted across the facility, accompanied by flashing red lights. An automated voice cut through the silence.</p>\n<p>\"Alert! Containment breach in Sector-6. All personnel, please proceed to the nearest evacuation route.\"</p>\n<p>The Administrator froze, torn between cursing fate, cursing the burrito, cursing the cafeteria staff, and cursing whatever cosmic deity decided that ironically timed alarms were a necessity.</p>\n<p>His internal monologue of profanity was interrupted by the sight of a fully armed Alpha-1 squad around the corner. If he looked pathetic before, now he looked downright pitiful; clinging to his coat like a security blanket and desperately trying to avoid eye contact with some of the most highly trained agents in the Foundation.</p>\n<p>Leading the Alpha-1 squad was Commander Greaves, a man whose tactical vest had more pockets than some countries had soldiers. His gaze locked immediately on the Administrator with the kind of intensity usually reserved for particularly dangerous anomalies.</p>\n<p>The Administrator knew the standard protocol: if there\u2019s a breach, the VIPs like him get whisked away to safe rooms. Great news for him under any other circumstance. Not so great when his laundry situation was still in a questionable state and the safe rooms were lacking in both spare pants and air freshener.</p>\n<p>The Alpha-1 squad was coming closer. He briefly thought about running for a few seconds, but his office laid before that corridor, and running meant getting away from safety.</p>\n<p>\"Sir!\" Commander Greaves' voice boomed across the corridor. \"We need to get you to safety, now! Please follow us.\" The Administrator briefly evaluated his options; saying he fell down onto a used coffee grounds might explain the color of his coat and pants, but wouldn't do much to explain the smell. Saying the plumbing had failed due to an issue with the sewers at the exact same time could explain both, but sounded extremely implausible.</p>\n<p>\"Greaves, I have a situation.\" he said, admitting defeat. \"I need to go to my office first.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, there's a containment breach! It's not safe.\" Greaves responded with his loud and serious voice, with his nose sniffing the air for an unexpected foul smell at the same time.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Before they could finish their dialogue, a horde of researchers, an evacuation squad, poured through the hallways behind them. The Administrator felt his pulse spike again, thinking how much worse could this day possibly get. He immediately regretted this thought, knowing the universe's tendency to treat such questions as challenges.</p>\n<p>By that time, Greaves' eyes had slowly moved towards the lower end of the Administrator's coat. His brows shot up, and a muscle in his jaw twitched as if he\u2019d swallowed a bitter pill. Then he drew a slow breath before quickly regaining his usual serious posture. The evacuation squad was coming closer now.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Greaves raised his rifle and pointed it towards the Administrator. \"The escaped anomaly is impersonating the Administrator!\" he shouted.</p>\n<p>In that split second, the Administrator\u2019s heart plummeted like an anvil in a cartoon, as it seemed like the universe did treat his previous thought as a challenge and decided to accept it. \"What the fuck?!\" he blurted, too stunned to say anything meaningful.</p>\n<p>The evacuating staff members pressed themselves to the walls in order to avoid the line of fire while watching the scene unfold with widened eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Secure the entity! We'll take it back to its containment cell!\" Greaves ordered to his team. An agent reluctantly took out his handcuffs, while two other agents held the Administrator, trying very hard to find a spot on his coat that wasn't compromised.</p>\n<p>\"Greaves, how dare you! You traitorous dog!\" The Administrator's focus had completely shifted, forgetting about his situation entirely. \"You found a perfect moment and made your move, didn't you? This is a coup attempt! Who's behind this? Who's holding your leash, you bitch!?\" The Administrator continued his yelling, while being taken away by the Alpha-1 squad, with the evacuating staff observing the scene with disbelief.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"It was Four, right? That bastard! I knew he always wanted to rule the Foundation himself!\" The Administrator was still yelling as the team took him to an empty containment chamber.</p>\n<p>Greaves quickly shut the door behind them, and turned around to the team members. \"Is there any cameras in this room?\" he asked with an unnaturally calm voice, while trying to observe the corners of the chamber.</p>\n<p>After getting a negative response, he took out the keys to the handcuffs, and removed them from the Administrator with precision.</p>\n<p>\"Sir,\" Greaves began, his voice dropping to a near whisper. His gaze turned downward. \"I\u2019m sorry. There was no time, this was the best I could come up with.\"</p>\n<p>The Administrator blinked, struggling to piece together what had just happened. The mention of \"sir\" threw him off. Was this some bizarre hallucination brought on by the spiciness of that burrito? He turned to Greaves, both as an attempt to speak face to face, and as an instinct to hide the mess in his back. He opened his mouth as if he was about to say something, but nothing came out.</p>\n<p>\"We'll tell everyone it was a shape shifting anomaly that escaped, and the real Administrator was already in a secure room.\" The Administrator\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at Greaves without blinking. For a moment, silence hung between them. Then his sharp voice broke through, \"You\u2026 you framed me for my own containment?!\"</p>\n<p>Greaves allowed himself the smallest of smirks. \"I had to save your ass, sir. Literally. No one will question why the 'Administrator' in the corridor smelled like a Class-A biohazard or looked half out of his mind. Everyone will assume it was the anomaly all along.\"</p>\n<p>For a moment, the Administrator could only stand there, staring at Greaves. Then he let out a slow, weary sigh and ran a hand down his face.</p>\n<p>\"Good\u2026 good thinking,\" the Administrator muttered finally. He studied Greaves a moment. \"And, uh\u2026 let\u2019s keep the part about me blaming O5-4 between us, yes?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, sir,\" Greaves nodded, sounding deeply proud that he had managed to salvage the Administrator\u2019s day, even if that day was, to put it mildly, a literal pile of shit.</p>\n<p>The burrito, meanwhile, was quickly and permanently removed from the cafeteria menu.

Personnel handling SCP-XXXX are to notify the SCP-XXXX project lead, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Senior Researcher Luca Armaros</span> Dr. Lilllian Lillihammer.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-XXXX is a leather-bound tome attributed in authorship to Johan Huizinga, a Dutch historian and linguist, as well as <a href=\"/parker-informational-breach\">suspected thaumaturge</a> and hermeneuticist. Its cover is bereft of any illustrations, save for the author's name and the title, which reads \"Sprookjes\" (<em>Fairy Tales</em> in Dutch).</p>\n<p>SCP-XXXX's content matches the expectation given by its title; the 159-page tome is filled with illustrated Dutch fairy tales,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> all of which had been hand-written using ink. Analysis revealed the writing matches with that of Huizinga.</p>\n<p>SCP-XXXX activates when a subject opens its first page. Upon coming into visual contact with it, the person interacting with the object will promptly cease to understand any languages other than Dutch (even if, before, they had no skills in Dutch at all). For the next two hours, the affected individual will be incapable of thinking, writing, and reading in any language but Dutch. After the two hour mark, the effect will cease, and the subject's linguistic skills will be returned to their basic state. The effects will remanifest upon further contact with SCP-XXXX.</p>\n<p>SCP-XXXX was recovered during a raid on a <em>giftschreiber</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> outpost carried out by Mobile Task Force Rho-43 (\"Home Invaders\"), led by Dr. Lillian Lillihammer on 27/08/2024. Although the book bears no obvious markings identifying it as a <em>giftschreiber</em> artifact, it was nevertheless stored on-site alongside several other tomes of memetic nature, suggesting a connection between the object, its author, and the Group of Interest.</p>\n<p>Further investigation into its properties as well as into the nature of its author is ongoing.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Hrmm</em>,\" repeated Lillian Lillihammer, standing up and scratching her chin. \"Yeah, this isn't going to work.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8166\">Luca Armaros</a> blinked twice, looking away from the tome in front of him and up, towards Lillian's towering figure. \"What? Why not?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because I <em>already know Dutch</em>, so it's as good as useless on me,\" she said, pacing around the table. Before he could ask, she added: \"You pick it up after one too many days with Ilse.\"</p>\n<p>He corrected his half-moon glasses. \"Hold on, Lillian\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"That's <em>doctor</em> Lillihammer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Apologies, <em>Doctor</em> Lillihammer. Heather told me you were the best of the best. That if anyone could make sense of it, you could. Am I to understand that she was wrong?\"</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes, but vaguely smirked at the mention of her fianc\u00e9e's name. It wasn't that she wasn't good enough to help Armaros; it was that this was an anomaly that simple to be worth her time. In a schedule as tight as hers \u2014 and as packed with saving the world from memetic doomsday cults \u2014 she didn't care to lose time with low-stakes drivel such as this. Not even as a break from her actually important work.</p>\n<p>\u2026But on the other hand, Heather had asked her to help Luca out.</p>\n<p>She had asked her very, very nicely.</p>\n<p>There weren't many people Lillian could tolerate \u2014 there were even less whose company she actively enjoyed. Heather Garrison, however, was as close as people could get to the latter category without quite literally being Lillian Lillihammer. She'd give her life to protect that woman, so she supposed that a week of her time wasn't too outrageous of an alternative. Besides: she knew Heather and Armaros went <a href=\"/the-legend-of-the-iron-goat\">way back</a>. He might have been a dork of the more pathetic sort, but <em>he</em> was the one who saw something more in Heather than the glorified paper-pusher the Foundation's bureaucratic machine had appointed her as. He was the one who made her see the potential she had \u2014 the potential which, inevitably, brought her to Lillihammer's side.</p>\n<p>\"Ugh. Fine,\" she said, rubbing her eyes. \"But don't expect miracles, archivist.\" She pointed her long finger directly in-between Luca's eyes. \"I don't have the time to perform them for you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, I really\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes, save your platitudes for when I'm done. In the meantime,\" she said, throwing Luca a folder with the relevant documentation. He caught it, but only barely. \"Make yourself useful.\"</p>\n<p>He raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"Huizinga isn't going to figure himself out himself. I need to know if the man was a <em>giftschreiber</em> or just a nerd.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, all of my material is back at Site\u2014\"</p>\n<p>She waved her hand. \"That won't be necessary. I've already told a local friend of mine he'll be helping you. He knows his books, trust you me. Especially those whose words have been Poisoned.\" She turned towards the nearest file cabinet, already starting to browse through the gathered documents. \"I'll send you a meme-free scan when I get the chance.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I'm not sure if I'd be the greatest research partner? I, uh, like to talk a lot during\u2014\"</p>\n<p>She turned back, eyed him up and down, then raised an eyebrow. \"Harry hasn't had a single good thing to do since he's gotten married. Besides,\" she said, smirking, and shifting her attention once more towards something else. \"With how much nonsense you both talk, I'm sure you two will get along just <em>swimmingly</em>.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>Luca had been to Site-43 a few times before, in the long years that had passed since he'd first crossed paths with Heather.</p>\n<p>Still: he never did get used to the layout.</p>\n<p>All of his trips had been nothing but momentary transfers, more aimed at catching up with an old friend than actual scientific progress. In a field as seemingly insignificant to the Foundation's mission at large as his, the occasional tour was a privilege he could afford, but one he nevertheless remained ambivalent towards. Sure, actually talking with Heather was better than the occasional text they'd still send each other, but the facility was\u2026 well. Even for his standards, it was <em>weird</em>.</p>\n<p>It was practically a tomb, with how deep it had been constructed; a tomb filled with esoteric waste and more esoteric legacies still. Its long, white corridors came together to form quite the labyrinth \u2014 one that Luca had trouble navigating even with the three subway lines connecting it together. The people, too, were far from the Foundation baseline he'd come to expect. Given his own condition, he recognized the irony of that thought, of course, but there were only so many janitors with personal mirror monsters or time-stuck researchers he could meet before starting to question his own sanity.</p>\n<p>Still: when he had gotten the message some week ago that Sophia was briefly transferring him back to this place, he welcomed it as a good change of pace. Of course, it was nothing compared to the change of pace he had felt a few days prior when the apparently hermeneutic artifact he had been sent briefly turned him into a citizen of Utrecht in all but name, but it was at least something.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe here they'll take my work as more than a curiosity</em>, he thought as he came to a sudden stop.</p>\n<p>It took him nearly an hour of wandering through old abatement facilities and jam-packed common rooms, but he finally made it to his destination.</p>\n<p>The lettering upon the heavy door in front of him simply read:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Dr. Harold R. Blank</span></h3>\n<h5 id=\"toc1\"><span>Archives and Revision, Chair</span></h5>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Well. That was that, then.</p>\n<p>He took a deep breath, cleared his throat, and \u2014 having knocked, as nothing but a courtesy \u2014 walked through.</p>\n<p>If he had considered Site-43 a tomb before, what lay before him had to be at least a mausoleum.</p>\n<p>It was a pretentious space, in the way that the offices of all intellectuals were. Unlike all of its other brethren, however, this one had a heart. Perhaps too much, in some parts, but the owner's character nevertheless permeated through the place like an ambient spiritual energy. From the neatly-organized Pink Floyd CD collection to a frighteningly long bookshelf containing all of Tolkien's (both senior and junior) written work, it was a lot. It was a lot, but it certainly spoke to Luca's heart. The image of the man who owned this office was completed by two things: a photo of an older, smiling woman standing in a park next to a similar but younger woman, framed neatly next to the laptop on top of the desk, and the man himself, his long-haired silhouette only barely sticking out of the stacks of books and paper all around him.</p>\n<p>All things considered, Luca thought, the place fit him well. He cleared his throat again. This time, the man did react; he first slowly poked his silver head up, blinked twice, corrected his glasses, and then smiled politely.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes, yes, hello,\" he said, quickly standing up. \"I see you managed to find your way down to my sanctuary.\"</p>\n<p>Yes, Luca had to admit, the place did look maybe one step removed from a hermitage. \"Yeah. Glad, uh, glad I could make it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed.\" The man extended his hand. \"Harry, as I'm sure you've noticed on your way in. Nice to meet you\u2026 Luca, I presume?\"</p>\n<p>\"Luca Armaros, yes,\" he said, shaking Harry's hand. \"The pleasure is all mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lil told me to expect you. Not that I expected you so soon, but\u2026\" He waved his hand. \"Well. I wasn't being of much use anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I did consider whether I should come later, since maybe you could still be asleep, and\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Harry smiled, and sat back down on his chair. \"Don't worry. You couldn't have woken me up. That's not a possibility I've even tried to manifest tonight. Do make yourself comfortable \u2014 as comfortable as you can get in here, anyway,\" he said, pointing towards the nearest chair. \"I don't think we'll achieve much standing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes, yes, right,\" Luca mumbled out, and sat down. \"Of course\"</p>\n<p>He looked at Harry. As if on command, both corrected their glasses.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" Harry said, clapping his hands. \"How exactly can I help you?\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>\"How do you think it's layered?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Wat?</em>\"</p>\n<p><em>Oh. Right.</em> Lillihammer adjusted herself mentally, cleared her throat, and continued in the appropriate language: \"<em>Hoe denk je dat het opgebouwd is?</em>\" she asked, carefully looking at the pages laying in front of her.</p>\n<p>From a certain angle, the letters almost seemed to glow. This was certainly by design; the room around them \u2014 her own personal office, a hermetic memetic exclusion zone created from scratch and filled with preventive measures the likes of which the world had never before seen \u2014 was constructed in such a way so as to highlight any foreign glyphs present inside. Still: the almost ephemeral glow was not what Lillian had expected. She'd thought this would be some simple <em>giftschreiber</em> trick, a proof-of-concept of a real end product aimed at causing actual chaos. But this? This fit none of the patterns she could ever remember seeing, and she trusted her memory more than herself.</p>\n<p>\"<em>It's definitely not the baseline eye-mind connection, that's for sure,</em>\" Heather said, putting another page of the manuscript against the giant printer. \"<em>It's strange.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian leaned closer towards the tome, and narrowed her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"<em>This is nonsense. Utter nonsense.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Heather raised an eyebrow, but otherwise remained silently by her post, scanning the tome one <em>beep</em> after another.</p>\n<p>As she always did when not uninterrupted \u2014 and, more often than not, <em>especially</em> when interrupted \u2014 Lillian continued. \"<em>It doesn't anchor itself to anything specific. It shouldn't work.</em>\" She threw her hand in the air. \"<em>It's just\u2026 an image, bound to no specific reaction. The fact that it actually instills any reaction is bullshit. It <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shouldn't</span></em>.\"</p>\n<p>Heather considered. \"<em>What if it's not meant to?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian actually blinked. \"<em>What?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>You're looking at it as if it was one of your kill agents, Lils.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>It's very clearly a similar mechanism. One look at it and you're fucked.</em>\" She paused. \"<em>It's just that this one doesn't kill you, just makes you Dutch. Which, to be fair, close enough, but\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Lils.</em>\" Heather said, coming closer towards Lillian. She put a hand on her shoulder. <em>\"You're thinking about it as if it was a weapon. Why?</em>\"</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \"<em>Because what the hell would you use this for, if not as a weapon? Some bullshit chaos tool the German nutcases wanted to use to spread Dutch into the rest of the adjacent languages, like what <a href=\"/scp-5382\">Thilo's already once done</a>.</em>\" She sighed. \"<em>My point is this: why make something like this if not for war?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Heather smiled. \"<em>That <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">is</span> the right question, isn't it?</em>\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>\"So, Huizinga, huh?\" Harry said, narrowing his eyes, Even from behind his thick frames, Luca could see him scan one line of database tables after another. \"Huizinga\u2026 Huizinga\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Harry frowned \u2014 more so than his usual, baseline expression \u2014 and scratched his head. \"We've got a Huith, Huir, and Huitz in this thing, but no Huizinga.\" He popped his lips. \"Huh.\"</p>\n<p>For a few moments, he remained still.</p>\n<p>\"So what, that's it?\" Luca said, the slightest tint of disheartenment present in his tone. \"The line just ends here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Far worse.\" Harry looked him in the eyes. \"It leads to the physical archives.\"</p>\n<p>With a heavy grunt, the historian stood up, and moved a few boxes, revealing the second part of his study: the place where all hopes and dreams died, or the bookshelves upon bookshelves of non-digitized documents belonging to the History Department. Originally, the job of actually getting them into the database proper had been assigned to junior researchers here at Forty-Three, but, well; after the last occupant of that particular slave labor had been blown to cross-dimensional and cross-deific bits by the Site's <a href=\"/scp-5243\">annual cascade of cross-temporal bullshit</a>, Harry hadn't had the heart to sentence anyone else to that fate.</p>\n<p>That had been more than a decade ago; the documents, naturally, never did stop coming.</p>\n<p>With the kind of gesture reserved for death row inmates, Harry signaled Luca to come closer. He obeyed, and after a moment found himself among an archive so large and expansive it pulled the breath out of his lungs. When he did take the next breath, however, he was smiling, much to Harry's dismay.</p>\n<p>Had he no job to do other than this assignment, Luca would have loved to do nothing but sort all of these papers and books. It was clear that nobody else was going to do it \u2014 <em>obviously</em> \u2014 but Luca could. It spoke to some particularly solitary part of his personality, seeing all of those countless documents just <em>waiting</em> to be cataloged and organized. He was, of course, still a man, but somewhere in his soul he was primarily an archivist, one who would love to see all of this made into a coherent whole.</p>\n<p>Judging by Harry's reaction, even their shared job and position could not help with crossing that particular bridge between their experiences.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" he said, smiling slightly, \"I'm glad you don't see this place as the execution wall I've come to dread it as. Because we're going to spend a <em>long time here</em>,\" he added, crossing his arms and glancing at the heavy tonnes of paper under the section marked with a large, bolded 'H'.</p>\n<p>\"Better get started, then.\"</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \"Tomorrow's already caught me down here, so I do suppose I've got nothing to lose.\"</p>\n<p>Slowly, and with the kind of precision and worry mostly reserved for handling wild animals, Harry took the nearest ladder and stacked it up against the shelf in front of them. Before he could show Luca that he was free to climb first, Armaros was already halfway up.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm. <em>Hmm</em>.\" He grunted, slowly starting to rummage through piles upon piles of cross-referential reports handling topics of no real interest to anyone but maybe Maria Jones herself. After a while that felt longer to Harry than it did to him, he eventually said, \"I think I've got something.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n<p>Luca narrowed his eyes through his glasses. \"It's\u2026 not quite a dossier, but it's <em>something</em>. Some\u2026 Some list of paranormal-adjacent linguists, I think, and\u2026\"</p>\n<p>He reached out towards one level higher, shifting his weight to the front of his body. \"\u2026and he's here! He's\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, and without any fault of his own, he felt the ladder slip from under his feet. Seeing how the only things he could grab onto were the shelf itself and the books inside it, he didn't have enough actual leverage to avoid the fall. Before he could think of anything else to do \u2014 or indeed react to this at all, in the fraction of a second his mind had been given to process the fact that was about to transpire \u2014 he surrendered to gravity, taking with him some ten kilos of yellow paper nobody except him had seen since they had been printed.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in-between all of that, he managed to half-swear, \"Pancakes!\" before he landed on the solid floor with a heavy thud, burying himself under a self-made blanket of pages.</p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Harry reached out, taking off the first layer.</p>\n<p>Beneath it, Luca lay in a fetal position, his body covered by one more veneer: one made from his own four blue wings, sprouting from his back, now no longer hidden under his Foundation-issued uniform. No scratches or bruised blemished his body \u2014 the power that had sprouted his new appendages so many years ago made sure that no harm came to him from sources as mundane as this.</p>\n<p>When Luca opened his eyes again, the spark from previously had disappeared \u2014 in their place there now was worry.</p>\n<p>In his long years working here, Harry had seen that brand of fear many, many times. He knew what it meant more so than he wished he did.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I'm sorry,\" Luca said, slowly standing up, his head down. \"I didn't\u2026\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. His wings were low, now, clutched close to his back.</p>\n<p>\"Luca,\" Harry said, taking a deep breath. He had gone through this dance many times before, considering his place of employment. He could never relate, of course \u2014 not fully \u2014 but he did get how to get it. \"Come on. Nothing to apologize for.\"</p>\n<p>The other archivist remained unconvinced. He'd heard this part many times before, too. He's long since forgiven himself for allowing himself to get tricked into becoming the Guardian, but it still wasn't the part of himself he wanted others to see first. He didn't want them to think of him as a monster, as some fool he was presented as during Site-19 lectures. He preferred to lay low, whenever he got the chance. It wasn't shame; more-so as a silent worry. Not of the possibility of bodily harm (his mantle of Guardian took care of that, mostly), but of what others could do to people like him, if they couldn't see past his first impression.</p>\n<p>He almost-whispered, \"I don't want to\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Listen.\" Harry looked him square in the eyes. \"My best friend is the student of an immortal Austrian wizard. My <em>second</em> best friend is bad luck incarnate. I once dated an <em>actual witch</em>. I don't care about any of that, Luca. I don't care what others might think of you. None of that defines you. What I see in front of me is a man dedicated to his job and passion. One whose help I need to do this.</p>\n<p>\"My point is this: I don't care, and neither should you.\"</p>\n<p>Luca stayed silent.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Because we've still got an actual metric ton of documents to go through.\" He smiled, now, the gesture warm and honest. \"You don't think I'd let you leave before we finished this, did you? I know our words come alive here at Forty-Three far more often than in other parts of the Foundation, but even here, the cases don't solve themselves, Mr. Archivist. So get back here and let's get this thing sorted, eh?</p>\n<p>Luca didn't say anything, for a very long second.</p>\n<p>Then, he smiled back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>She scratched her chin, for what was possibly the millionth time this evening. She was beginning to ponder if she had a nervous tick. \"<em>I do wonder,</em>\" Lillian said, coming closer to Heather and leaning over the book.</p>\n<p>Heather chuckled. \"<em>You always do, Lils. What about, this time?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>How this exactly works, without a trigger.</em>\"</p>\n<p>The other memeticist rolled her eyes. \"<em>Yes, we've already gone over that. We\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>No, I mean actually. Like,</em>\" she said, stabbing one of the pages with her finger. <em>\"None of the signs indicate any coercion. It's just\u2026 a soup of memetic symbols, none of them particularly bound together into a single formula.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Wait</em>,\" Heather said, smiling, \"d<em>id you just admit that you don't know the answer, babe?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian groaned. She did not like not knowing things. \"<em>It doesn't add up. It shouldn't just do nothing because it's got no target \u2014 it should do nothing because it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">does not</span> do anything.</em>\"</p>\n<p>For a moment, Heather considered, carrying over the last copied pages onto the binding machine. \"<em>Well, I think it's all just about perspective, really.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian raised an eyebrow. \"<em>What?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If it's not an immediate effect, maybe it's something slower. Something more gradual, perhaps, not so immediate \u2014 something far more subtle. Something not intrusive.</em>\" She paused. <em>\"Who do you think Huizinga was, really? Beneath all of that work we're analyzing.</em>\"</p>\n<p>The eyebrow now turned into an arch. \"<em>That's\u2026 what Harry and Armaros are trying to figure out.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Heather shook her head. \"<em>I don't mean what he was. What he worked as, or what group he possibly aligned himself with,</em>\" she said. \"<em>I'm asking who he was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">really</span>, beneath all of those titles. I'm sure you can remember something.</em>\"</p>\n<p>After a second of searching, Lillian found that Heather indeed was right. There <em>was</em> something about Huizinga in that perfect memory of hers that she could salvage. She decided to indulge her. \"<em>An historian, primarily. Also a linguist. Travelled a lot.</em>\" She paused. <em>\"So someone who cared about the world, in its entirety. Tried to care, anyway. Tried to see the bigger picture.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Yeah. So <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">why</span> would he make this?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian groaned. \"<em>That's the whole\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>No, Lils. Stop being stupid, Why do you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">think</span> he would make it? I don't care about truth, I want your opinion. Why do you think someone like him would make a memetic tool \u2014 one that doesn't have an aggressive effect and is tied to a single, unassuming object? One that can bring no harm to anyone? One bound to a book, out of all things?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Normally, there were two things Lillian despised, more than anything else \u2014 being interrupted, and being lectured. Heather, however, was anything but normal; she was one of the few people that could match her speed (and her interest). Though Lillian possessed a proficiency in pretty much all subjects she wished to possess a proficiency in, one thing she never could figure out fully was how normal people thought. She could predict them, better so than almost anyone else alive, and she could manipulate them to her own ends \u2014 but getting to see down-to-earth things through their eyes was something else entirely. It didn't escape her \u2014 it just actively bored her.</p>\n<p>Heather, however, always could see the grander picture, especially when it came to memetics.</p>\n<p>It was her job, after all.</p>\n<p>Lillian considered. She looked down at the book. The <em>book</em>. Oh. \"<em>To make them do something, but of their own volition. Not to force them, but to point to some direction \u2014 show them the path towards noticing something. Just like a book.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Just like a book, yeah. And where does that lead us? If not to the mind, like you already established, then where?</em>\" She came closer, and put her hand on Lillian's. Very slowly, she navigated both towards one of the symbols written on the page. \"<em>And don't say that it was to make people learn Dutch. Who would actually want that?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian blinked twice.</p>\n<p>Then, she got it.</p>\n<p>\"<em>To the heart. Whatever it is, the message leads right to your heart.\"</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>Luca had thought it'd be an easy job, all things considered.</p>\n<p>His optimism did not waver when faced with the archives; it didn't even waver when he realized they were going to have to compile a timeline.</p>\n<p>But when, by the five hour mark, they'd barely scratched the surface of the iceberg, he <em>was</em> beginning to question whether this was a one day job.</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, rubbed his eyes, and turned over another page of some manuscript older than them both (which, considering both were technically semi-immortal, was quite the achievement). He noted something down, propped his head up, and went back to reading.</p>\n<p>After a while, he turned to face Luca. \"You got anything?\"</p>\n<p>Luca popped his lips. \"Nothing new. Nothing new that's <em>exciting</em>, I guess I should say.\" He blinked twice, already feeling the exhaustion from all the work starting to creep in. \"If I have to read about one more historical summit\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\" Harry put the book aside. \"Yeah. Too much even for me.\" Just like any real historian, Harry did have an admiration for the great work that Huizinga's contributions had carried over to his field of study. But, after as long as this \u2014 and as late as this \u2014 his admiration even for a man like him started to turn into ennui. He looked at the tome for some few seconds, then diverted his sight back towards Luca. \"This clearly isn't working,\" he said, picking up his notes.</p>\n<p>Luca raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"We've got a timeline of his life and major cross-references, but none of it is of any actual use.\"</p>\n<p>Luca put up his finger, trying in a positive tone, \"Maybe sometimes absence of evidence <em>is</em> evidence of ab\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Right, yes, yes, but we can't be <em>sure</em> because there's nothing concrete in this goddamn thing. No lines to draw immediate conclusion through.\" He sighed. \"I was built for reading, not for\u2026 this nonsense vague intention analysis. Half a degree in literature does not an English teacher make,\" he said, a bitter chuckle entering his lips.</p>\n<p>Yes, half a degree in literature studies barely made someone an expert; but a full one did. Luca <em>was</em> built for this exact thing. He smiled very slowly. \"I think we ought to step back and look at what we've got.\"</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a look. \"And what <em>do</em> we've got?\"</p>\n<p>\"Time to find out, no?\" he said, standing up.</p>\n<p>Harry grunted, but soon followed Luca's stead.</p>\n<p>Before long, they were looking at a lot of very badly handwritten post-it notes, all assembled together into a grotesque imitation of a mosaic.</p>\n<p>\"Like I said: there's not much here,\" Harry said, unconvinced. \"Unless you really want to read about tea parties.\"</p>\n<p>Luca nodded. \"Right. But it does paint us a picture of him, doesn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose so.\" Harry considered. \"What are you looking for, exactly?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm trying to see what kind of man arises as an image from this all. What general outlines we can trace to who he was.\"</p>\n<p>That got Harry's attention. \"Well. He wasn't a shit, for starters. Rare in those times.\" He pointed to one of the notes. \"He opposed the Nazis pretty heavily back in the thirties.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think a <em>giftschreiber</em> would do that? Try to avoid the chaos and suffering that followed?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, no, but I don't want to cross him out on the basis of one claim. Just one source isn't going to cut it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Right.\" Luca paused, pondering.</p>\n<p>Harry said, \"It's also clear he wasn't narrow-minded. Tried to not be, in any case.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, the travel log's rather impressive. As are his linguistics,\" he added, snapping his fingers at some table of data. \"Sanskrit and German aren't too bad for a man of his times.\"</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. He was fully in lecture mode, now. He was starting to enjoy this. \"With the exception of <em>The Autumn</em>, he's also written a few things on culture. <em>Also</em> shockingly progressive and open-minded. Cared about art and the human spirit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, one more time. \"All right, I yield. This is no <em>giftschreiber</em> profile. Not unless he was absurdly covert. Which,\" he said, \"for the sake of our own sanity, I won't for now consider.</p>\n<p>\"However,\" he continued, unwilling to surrender his point, \"just because he wasn't this particular brand of memetic cultist doesn't mean he wasn't one of some other.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course. But he definitely wasn't one of the apocalypse-harbinging ones, on that we can agree.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" Harry scratched his nose. \"For what it's worth, the man genuinely did seem to care about the artistic and cultural legacy of humanity, enough to try to protect it.\" He waved his hand. \"The non-fascist read on legacy, I mean.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. It's clear he found great value in what he studied.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mhm.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what <em>was</em> his work doing in a <em>giftschreiber</em> stash? If it wasn't written by one of theirs, what use is it to them?\"</p>\n<p>Harry considered. \"Maybe as a contrast. An instruction, what not to do.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hardly his best work for that particular lesson.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If</em> the lesson they got from it is the one we are also assuming, that is.\"</p>\n<p>Luca skewed his head. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"What if it isn't just about the obvious plurality of human culture, from an academic standpoint?\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you proposing a more\u2026 down to earth read?\"</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \"It <em>is</em> a fairytale book, after all. Hardly the most serious of sources for academia,\" he said. \"But yes. What if it isn't some serious message about the inner workings of a human culture?</p>\n<p>\"What if it's just simply a message that that diversity exists and we should embrace it?\" He paused. \"The fairytales don't carry grand lessons with them, but they do carry a legacy, Same thing that happened during Soviet occupation of Ukraine, with how their fairytales survived because the invaders thought that they had no message of their own. Maybe it's something similar, here?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Before Luca could intersect, a dull <em>ping</em> from Harry's pager interrupted him. The archivist pulled the device up. \"Lillian's got our copy, it seems, all free of memetics. That should give us some more insight.\" He looked at Luca. \"We better not keep her waiting.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>After so long down in the archives, they both found, their legs didn't quite work as well as they would have hoped. That Memetics &amp; Countermemetics was situated on the other side of the facility certainly didn't help, either. Still: their long and grueling march gave them time enough to mull everything over, forming a relatively coherent image of Huizinga and their plan going forward, in regards to said image.</p>\n<p>They only stopped brainstorming once they stood before the door to a large shared research room.</p>\n<p>It wasn't much compared to Lillian's own, personal office \u2014 which, as Luca had previously seen once and as Harry had seen many, many times was a work of art in its own right \u2014 but the place was still well-equipped and professional, even given the Foundation's already high base standards. Its walls were lined with apparatus neither of the archivists could even guess the purpose of, stuck right between tubes of carbon paper writ with similarly alien runes.</p>\n<p>The middle of the room, however, was where its <em>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance</em> stood.</p>\n<p>It was a giant thing, some two meters tall and maybe three meters wide, all clean, grey panels and press modules. It looked like it cost more than a small Area in its own right. With its control buttons, circular lights, and small screens, it looked\u2014</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Straight out of <em>Star Trek</em>.\" Luca whispered to himself, his face a half-formed grin.</p>\n<p>Harry caught it, and smiled too, though far more widely than Luca. He was glad someone else had finally also seen his vision.</p>\n<p>\"See?\" Lillian started walking towards the two archivists. \"I told you you two'd get along,\" she said, pointing at Luca. \"And yeah, with how much funding I needed redirected to get that thing here you can bet your ass it could belong on a set.\" Before Luca could get even more flustered by realizing that both of them had heard his comment, she continued, \"Anyway. Here's your fuckin' book, nerds. Free of all the shit that'd make you talk nonsense.\"</p>\n<p>She pointed to a tome laying on the worktable next to the machine. It looked pretty much identical to the one that Luca had seen before, when he had been sent the initial find. The only exception was that this copy didn't have the cover the original had \u2014 instead, it was neatly wrapped in translucent, green-ish foil, the letters still visible even despite the covering.</p>\n<p>Luca came forward, towards the book. \"So, what's your impression? Of the whole thing, I mean. Are the runes <em>giftschreiber</em> or not?\"</p>\n<p>Heather came closer, leaning against the table. \"Not by a long shot.\" She was speaking again in English now; her and Lillian had waited two hours before calling Harry and Luca in so that the effect would die down. Two hours that they'd spent actually cleaning this place up, after they drowned it in a sea of memetic symbols by untackling the composition of the book.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Lillihammer chimed in. \"There's no way he's one of them. It's all too jumbled up in-between sappy metaphors to be them. They prefer using more annoying allegories.\" She crossed her arms, and for a second, the silver of her engagement ring sparkled beneath the lab's LED lights.</p>\n<p>Luca smiled again, quickly seeing very similar jewelry on Heather's own finger. These two have gone a long way since she'd first met Heather. Even though he still remained ambivalent towards Lillian (admiration was a strange mix when confronted with irritation), he was happy they'd found each other. He knew all too well how solitary it could get, here in the Foundation, for people like them. For people that weren't made to fit the mold of a standard researcher that asked no questions and had no doubts. Even with a dating pool as diverse and as global as the one offered by their shared conspiracy, finding someone of kindred spirit wasn't easy. He sure as hell wasn't any closer to figuring it all out, even all those years later. Truth be told, he didn't even want to consider the meeting he had last week to have been a date. It was a mess. He didn't need another STEM guy who thinks literature isn't worth his precious time.</p>\n<p>It was a heavy burden, his search for a significant other, one he had struggled through most of his life; one he figured he'd spend some time more still unraveling.</p>\n<p>These two, however, were made for each other. He was glad they didn't have to go through the same nonsense he had to.</p>\n<p>They'd do great things together. Of that, he was sure.</p>\n<p>\"What about you?\" Heather asked. \"How's your front holding up? Not a <em>giftschreiber</em>?\"</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \"Not a <em>giftschreiber</em>. Some flavor of memetic and vaguely pretentious but definitely not one of the nutcases.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian. \"Good. That's good.\" She put her hands together, and eyed the two archivists. \"Now. Now that you've got what you wanted\u2014\" She eyed the book. \"Shoo, with you two.\" She grinned, and looked at Heather, almost as if asking if this was enough to make her no longer talk about needing to help Luca. \"We've got important work to attend to. Important work that doesn't feature old nonsense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just the new nonsense,\" Heather said, handing Luca the book. \"But yeah, as great as it was to catch up\u2026\" She shrugged. \"Sorry, Luca. You know how it goes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Of course. I know you've got work.\"</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \"Sure they do.\" He was already half-way through the door when he turned around to Luca, and said, \"Oh, and please try not to drop the book. I think J&amp;M would kill us if we had to report another thing after last week's poker session with Willie.\"</p>\n<p>Luca didn't ask. He didn't even raise an eyebrow. Instead, he just grabbed the book more tightly and caught up with the other archivist.</p>\n<p>Some things, he'd found, were better left without answers.</p>\n<p>Particularly in a place like this.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>By the time Lillian and Heather made it to the shared Sublevel Three cafeteria to eat their last meal before calling it a day, they were fairly certain the sun had already risen, all the way up on the surface.</p>\n<p>Not that they'd notice it, of course, or even particularly care; just like with everything else, the two rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 followed the expectations of others. Particularly when said expectations were as widely accepted and limiting as that of the day and night cycle.</p>\n<p>Still: when they took up their trays and loaded their food, they had to admit the place was no longer deserted, as it mostly would be during the night. Now, dozens of personnel were coming in. They were almost exclusively Janitorial &amp; Maintenance staff, as it was an unwritten custom for them to begin work before the other sections did, and although they weren't a crowd quite yet, they were not what the two memeticist had expected.</p>\n<p>Lillian sighed, and quickly sat down with Heather in the most remote table offered by the cafeteria, hoping its isolation would be enough to render them invisible to the others. She didn't hate the manual laborers of Site-43, specifically \u2014 nobody in their right mind did. She just hated people, in general, so she thought it'd be better for her and them if she remained isolated from the forming group, especially this late into the night.</p>\n<p>The moment their trays touched the table, Lillian sighed again, and started massaging her temples.</p>\n<p>Heather nodded. \"Yeah. Long day.\"</p>\n<p>\"Loooooong day.\" Lillian agreed. She blinked twice, and started playing with the fork, vaguely poking the foot on her plate. \"Waste of time, too.\"</p>\n<p>Heather gave her a look. \"Come on, Lils. You know I couldn't say no. Not to Luca.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I know. That's why I'm complaining.\" She took a bite, only to realize she wasn't particularly hungry. She just had to wait for Heather to come to the same realization, then, before they could retire to their shared dormitory and retire for the night \u2014 and before someone dumped another nonsense project on their lap.</p>\n<p>Heather grinned. \"Is someone jealous?\"</p>\n<p>Lillian scoffed, amused. \"No. I just don't like not getting closure.\"</p>\n<p>Her partner raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"We figured out the how but not the why, is my point,\" she said, propping herself up. \"That's not good enough.\"</p>\n<p>\"And here I was, thinking you didn't want to dedicate any more time to this.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian rolled her eyes. \"You're hopeless,\" she said, but smiled.</p>\n<p>They continued like that in silence for a couple more minutes, only occasionally getting interrupted by Heather actually eating \u2014 much to Lillian's dismay \u2014 and the sporadic chit-chat from J&amp;M personnel making its way from the center of the room.</p>\n<p>Eventually, though, Lillian admitted: \"Fine. You're right. I'm mad we did end it like that. I wish we could've done more.\" She crossed her arms. \"Not at the cost of our actual schedule, of course, but in general.\" She waved circles with her hand, and groaned. \"It's bullshit we didn't get it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Lils, but we did. Come on. You unraveled a complicated meme in the time it takes most people to stop speaking Dutch from looking at it.\" She smiled faintly. \"Besides: getting the context of it isn't our job. It's no use troubling yourself over something that's not your responsibility.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure. But maybe actually knowing the reason they had it in their stash could help us with future nonsense.\" She sighed. \"Even knowing why he made it would help.\"</p>\n<p>Heather took another bite, and considered. When she next spoke, her meal was finished. \"If it helps, I have two hours to spare tomorrow. I can dedicate them to reverse-engineering that thing, if you'd like. Maybe getting it to work for other languages would\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, her eyes went wide, as did Lillian's.</p>\n<p>At the very same time, the two of them got it.</p>\n<p>\"Oh shit.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian smiled, and both of them immediately stood up.</p>\n<p>\"Oh shit indeed.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>When they got back to Harry's office, they soon found out that even the wonders of coffee had an upper limit to their magic. They found it out the hard way, when they sat back in their chairs and immediately felt the length of the day weigh down on their shoulders the second they made themselves comfortable.</p>\n<p>Luca endured, somehow, by browsing through the pages of the meme-free book and paying it barely any attention. The letters were starting to look very skimmable, turning into pretty much nonsense, but he was still standing, trying to make sense of what little he could make out from the actual text.</p>\n<p>Harry, however, wasn't so lucky. He gave into the exhaustion pretty much instantly, half-laying on the desk, his glasses still on his head.</p>\n<p>They stayed like that for a while until eventually \u2014 and without much enthusiasm \u2014 Luca said, \"So, uh, do you speak any Dutch? Besides curses, I mean, and surface level stuff. That I can manage myself.\"</p>\n<p>Luca's voice was barely more than a whisper, but it still rippled through the silent archives like thunder.</p>\n<p>Harry jolted awake, almost hitting his head on the desk lamp above him. He looked like whatever it was he had been dreaming about, it had been far more engaging than the task at hand. \"Uh, no? Not really. I know some few words, maybe, but\u2026\" He shrugged. Just like everyone of his background, he'd picked up French sometime along the way of personal life and academia, but he'd never been much of a polyglot. He much preferred the other kind of incomprehensible texts \u2014 the ones they actually paid him to unravel.</p>\n<p>\"That's what Clio's for,\" Harry said, and smiled at his own joke. Luca had no way of knowing who Cliometria.aic was \u2014 or indeed that she had been created for the express purpose of handling material incomprehensible or too memetically confusing for standard humans to get \u2014 but that didn't stop Harry. Amusing nobody but himself was the expected baseline for his humor.</p>\n<p>Eventually, though, his smile died down, and he became serious. \"Why do you ask?\"</p>\n<p>Luca vaguely gestured towards the opened book. \"I'm trying to see if there's anything interesting to anyone but myself in this, or if it's just fairy tales like the file said. Whether there's something in-between the lines.\"</p>\n<p>Harry skewed his head. \"Didn't you\u2026 read it, when you actually spoke Dutch? In those two hours, I mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, but it's not the same, is it? I have memories of it, sure, but\u2026 I have memories of what the text talks about, but those memories wouldn't really be the same. Translation wouldn't be as precise, either. Not exactly. It certainly seemed to click more when I actually understood the words properly. But now\u2026\" he blew out air. \"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"What if that's the point?\"</p>\n<p>Luca blinked. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>Harry scratched his head. \"We've got a guy who very clearly cares about the plurality of human societies. Someone who recognizes the value of distinct cultural identities without turning that rhetoric into fascist bullshit.\" He tapped the book. \"A guy that goes out of his way to not only create a book that can make you not just see the experience of the other, but actually <em>feel</em> it.

Personnel handling SCP-XXXX are to notify the SCP-XXXX project lead, --Senior Researcher Luca Armaros-- Dr. Lilllian Lillihammer.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a leather-bound tome attributed in authorship to Johan Huizinga, a Dutch historian and linguist, as well as [[[parker-informational-breach|suspected thaumaturge]]] and hermeneuticist.\u00a0\u00a0Its cover is bereft of any illustrations, save for the author's name and the title, which reads \"Sprookjes\" (//Fairy Tales// in Dutch).\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX's content matches the expectation given by its title; the 159-page tome is filled with illustrated Dutch fairy tales,[[footnote]] Such as the stories of //Witte Wieven//, //Vrouwtje van Stavoren//, //Vliegende// Hollander, or //Bokkenrijders//. [[/footnote]] all of which had been hand-written using ink. Analysis revealed the writing matches with that of Huizinga.\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX activates when a subject opens its first page. Upon coming into visual contact with it, the person interacting with the object will promptly cease to understand any languages other than Dutch (even if, before, they had no skills in Dutch at all). For the next two hours, the affected individual will be incapable of thinking, writing, and reading in any language but Dutch. After the two hour mark, the effect will cease, and the subject's linguistic skills will be returned to their basic state. The effects will remanifest upon further contact with SCP-XXXX.\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX was recovered during a raid on a //giftschreiber//[[footnote]]\"Poison writers\" in German. A memetic doomsday cult. Aimed at immanentizing the eschaton through the proliferation of chaos and unrest via the deployment of memetic agents, the //giftschreiber// carry the ideology of liberation through total anarchy.

[[/footnote]] outpost carried out by Mobile Task Force Rho-43 (\"Home Invaders\"), led by Dr. Lillian Lillihammer on 27/08/2024. Although the book bears no obvious markings identifying it as a //giftschreiber// artifact, it was nevertheless stored on-site alongside several other tomes of memetic nature, suggesting a connection between the object, its author, and the Group of Interest.\n\n\n\nFurther investigation into its properties as well as into the nature of its author is ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"//Hrmm//,\" repeated Lillian Lillihammer, standing up and scratching her chin. \"Yeah, this isn't going to work.\"\n\n\n\n[[[scp-8166|Luca Armaros]]] blinked twice, looking away from the tome in front of him and up, towards Lillian's towering figure. \"What? Why not?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because I //already know Dutch//, so it's as good as useless on me,\" she said, pacing around the table. Before he could ask, she added: \"You pick it up after one too many days with Ilse.\"\n\n\n\nHe corrected his half-moon glasses. \"Hold on, Lillian--\"\n\n\n\n\"That's //doctor// Lillihammer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Apologies, //Doctor// Lillihammer. Heather told me you were the best of the best. That if anyone could make sense of it, you could. Am I to understand that she was wrong?\"\n\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes, but vaguely smirked at the mention of her fianc\u00e9e's name. It wasn't that she wasn't good enough to help Armaros; it was that this was an anomaly that simple to be worth her time. In a schedule as tight as hers -- and as packed with saving the world from memetic doomsday cults -- she didn't care to lose time with low-stakes drivel such as this. Not even as a break from her actually important work.\n\n\n\n...But on the other hand, Heather had asked her to help Luca out.\n\n\n\nShe had asked her very, very nicely.\n\n\n\nThere weren't many people Lillian could tolerate -- there were even less whose company she actively enjoyed. Heather Garrison, however, was as close as people could get to the latter category without quite literally being Lillian Lillihammer. She'd give her life to protect that woman, so she supposed that a week of her time wasn't too outrageous of an alternative. Besides: she knew Heather and Armaros went [[[the-legend-of-the-iron-goat|way back]]]. He might have been a dork of the more pathetic sort, but //he// was the one who saw something more in Heather than the glorified paper-pusher the Foundation's bureaucratic machine had appointed her as. He was the one who made her see the potential she had -- the potential which, inevitably, brought her to Lillihammer's side.\n\n\n\n\"Ugh. Fine,\" she said, rubbing her eyes. \"But don't expect miracles, archivist.\" She pointed her long finger directly in-between Luca's eyes. \"I don't have the time to perform them for you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you, I really--\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes, save your platitudes for when I'm done. In the meantime,\" she said, throwing Luca a folder with the relevant documentation. He caught it, but only barely. \"Make yourself useful.\"\n\n\n\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"Huizinga isn't going to figure himself out himself. I need to know if the man was a //giftschreiber// or just a nerd.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, all of my material is back at Site--\"\n\n\n\nShe waved her hand. \"That won't be necessary. I've already told a local friend of mine he'll be helping you. He knows his books, trust you me. Especially those whose words have been Poisoned.\" She turned towards the nearest file cabinet, already starting to browse through the gathered documents. \"I'll send you a meme-free scan when I get the chance.\"\n\n\n\n\"I... I'm not sure if I'd be the greatest research partner? I, uh, like to talk a lot during--\"\n\n\n\nShe turned back, eyed him up and down, then raised an eyebrow. \"Harry hasn't had a single good thing to do since he's gotten married. Besides,\" she said, smirking, and shifting her attention once more towards something else. \"With how much nonsense you both talk, I'm sure you two will get along just //swimmingly//.\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nLuca had been to Site-43 a few times before, in the long years that had passed since he'd first crossed paths with Heather.\n\n\n\nStill: he never did get used to the layout.\n\n\n\nAll of his trips had been nothing but momentary transfers, more aimed at catching up with an old friend than actual scientific progress. In a field as seemingly insignificant to the Foundation's mission at large as his, the occasional tour was a privilege he could afford, but one he nevertheless remained ambivalent towards. Sure, actually talking with Heather was better than the occasional text they'd still send each other, but the facility was... well. Even for his standards, it was //weird//.\n\n\n\nIt was practically a tomb, with how deep it had been constructed; a tomb filled with esoteric waste and more esoteric legacies still. Its long, white corridors came together to form quite the labyrinth -- one that Luca had trouble navigating even with the three subway lines connecting it together. The people, too, were far from the Foundation baseline he'd come to expect. Given his own condition, he recognized the irony of that thought, of course, but there were only so many janitors with personal mirror monsters or time-stuck researchers he could meet before starting to question his own sanity.\n\n\n\nStill: when he had gotten the message some week ago that Sophia was briefly transferring him back to this place, he welcomed it as a good change of pace. Of course, it was nothing compared to the change of pace he had felt a few days prior when the apparently hermeneutic artifact he had been sent briefly turned him into a citizen of Utrecht in all but name, but it was at least something.\n\n\n\n//Maybe here they'll take my work as more than a curiosity//, he thought as he came to a sudden stop.\n\n\n\nIt took him nearly an hour of wandering through old abatement facilities and jam-packed common rooms, but he finally made it to his destination. \n\n\n\nThe lettering upon the heavy door in front of him simply read:\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n+++\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Harold R.

That was that, then.\n\n\n\nHe took a deep breath, cleared his throat, and -- having knocked, as nothing but a courtesy -- walked through.\n\n\n\nIf he had considered Site-43 a tomb before, what lay before him had to be at least a mausoleum.\n\n\n\nIt was a pretentious space, in the way that the offices of all intellectuals were. Unlike all of its other brethren, however, this one had a heart. Perhaps too much, in some parts, but the owner's character nevertheless permeated through the place like an ambient spiritual energy. From the neatly-organized Pink Floyd CD collection to a frighteningly long bookshelf containing all of Tolkien's (both senior and junior) written work, it was a lot. It was a lot, but it certainly spoke to Luca's heart. The image of the man who owned this office was completed by two things: a photo\u00a0\u00a0of an older, smiling woman standing in a park next to a similar but younger woman, framed neatly next to the laptop on top of the desk, and the man himself, his long-haired silhouette only barely sticking out of the stacks of books and paper all around him.\n\n\n\nAll things considered, Luca thought, the place fit him well. He cleared his throat again. This time, the man did react; he first slowly poked his silver head up, blinked twice, corrected his glasses, and then smiled politely.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, hello,\" he said, quickly standing up. \"I see you managed to find your way down to my sanctuary.\"\n\n\n\nYes, Luca had to admit, the place did look maybe one step removed from a hermitage. \"Yeah. Glad, uh, glad I could make it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed.\" The man extended his hand. \"Harry, as I'm sure you've noticed on your way in. Nice to meet you... Luca, I presume?\"\n\n\n\n\"Luca Armaros, yes,\" he said, shaking Harry's hand. \"The pleasure is all mine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lil told me to expect you. Not that I expected you so soon, but...\" He waved his hand. \"Well. I wasn't being of much use anyway.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I did consider whether I should come later, since maybe you could still be asleep, and--\"\n\n\n\nHarry smiled, and sat back down on his chair. \"Don't worry. You couldn't have woken me up. That's not a possibility I've even tried to manifest tonight. Do make yourself comfortable -- as comfortable as you can get in here, anyway,\" he said, pointing towards the nearest chair. \"I don't think we'll achieve much standing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, right,\" Luca mumbled out, and sat down. \"Of course\"\n\n\n\nHe looked at Harry. As if on command, both corrected their glasses.\n\n\n\n\"So,\" Harry said, clapping his hands. \"How exactly can I help you?\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\n\"How do you think it's layered?\"\n\n\n\n\"//Wat?//\"\n\n\n\n//Oh. Right.// Lillihammer adjusted herself mentally, cleared her throat, and continued in the appropriate language: \"//Hoe denk je dat het opgebouwd is?//\" she asked, carefully looking at the pages laying in front of her.\n\n\n\nFrom a certain angle, the letters almost seemed to glow. This was certainly by design; the room around them -- her own personal office, a hermetic memetic exclusion zone created from scratch and filled with preventive measures the likes of which the world had never before seen -- was constructed in such a way so as to highlight any foreign glyphs present inside. Still: the almost ephemeral glow was not what Lillian had expected. She'd thought this would be some simple //giftschreiber// trick, a proof-of-concept of a real end product aimed at causing actual chaos. But this? This fit none of the patterns she could ever remember seeing, and she trusted her memory more than herself.\n\n\n\n\"//It's definitely not the baseline eye-mind connection, that's for sure,//\" Heather said, putting another page of the manuscript against the giant printer. \"//It's strange.//\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\nLillian leaned closer towards the tome, and narrowed her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"//This is nonsense. Utter nonsense.//\"\n\n\n\nHeather raised an eyebrow, but otherwise remained silently by her post, scanning the tome one //beep// after another.\n\n\n\nAs she always did when not uninterrupted -- and, more often than not, //especially// when interrupted -- Lillian continued. \"//It doesn't anchor itself to anything specific. It shouldn't work.//\" She threw her hand in the air. \"//It's just... an image, bound to no specific reaction. The fact that it actually instills any reaction is bullshit. It __shouldn't__//.\"\n\n\n\nHeather considered. \"//What if it's not meant to?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian actually blinked. \"//What?//\"\n\n\n\n\"//You're looking at it as if it was one of your kill agents, Lils.//\"\n\n\n\n\"//It's very clearly a similar mechanism. One look at it and you're fucked.//\" She paused. \"//It's just that this one doesn't kill you, just makes you Dutch. Which, to be fair, close enough, but--//\"\n\n\n\n\"//Lils.//\" Heather said, coming closer towards Lillian. She put a hand on her shoulder. //\"You're thinking about it as if it was a weapon. Why?//\"\n\n\n\nShe shrugged. \"//Because what the hell would you use this for, if not as a weapon? Some bullshit chaos tool the German nutcases wanted to use to spread Dutch into the rest of the adjacent languages, like what [[[scp-5382|Thilo's already once done]]].//\" She sighed. \"//My point is this: why make something like this if not for war?//\"\n\n\n\nHeather smiled. \"//That __is__ the right question, isn't it?//\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\n\"So, Huizinga, huh?\" Harry said, narrowing his eyes, Even from behind his thick frames, Luca could see him scan one line of database tables after another. \"Huizinga... Huizinga...\"\n\n\n\nHarry frowned -- more so than his usual, baseline expression -- and scratched his head. \"We've got a Huith, Huir, and Huitz in this thing, but no Huizinga.\" He popped his lips. \"Huh.\"\n\n\n\nFor a few moments, he remained still.\n\n\n\n\"So what, that's it?\" Luca said, the slightest tint of disheartenment present in his tone. \"The line just ends here?\"\n\n\n\n\"Far worse.\" Harry looked him in the eyes. \"It leads to the physical archives.\"\n\n\n\nWith a heavy grunt, the historian stood up, and moved a few boxes, revealing the second part of his study: the place where all hopes and dreams died, or the bookshelves upon bookshelves of non-digitized documents belonging to the History Department. Originally, the job of actually getting them into the database proper had been assigned to junior researchers here at Forty-Three, but, well; after the last occupant of that particular slave labor had been blown to cross-dimensional and cross-deific bits by the Site's [[[scp-5243|annual cascade of cross-temporal bullshit]]], Harry hadn't had the heart to sentence anyone else to that fate.\n\n\n\nThat had been more than a decade ago; the documents, naturally, never did stop coming.\n\n\n\nWith the kind of gesture reserved for death row inmates, Harry signaled Luca to come closer. He obeyed, and after a moment found himself among an archive so large and expansive it pulled the breath out of his lungs. When he did take the next breath, however, he was smiling, much to Harry's dismay.\n\n\n\nHad he no job to do other than this assignment, Luca would have loved to do nothing but sort all of these papers and books. It was clear that nobody else was going to do it -- //obviously// -- but Luca could. It spoke to some particularly solitary part of his personality, seeing all of those countless documents just //waiting// to be cataloged and organized. He was, of course, still a man, but somewhere in his soul he was primarily an archivist, one who would love to see all of this made into a coherent whole.\n\n\n\nJudging by Harry's reaction, even their shared job and position could not help with crossing that particular bridge between their experiences.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" he said, smiling slightly, \"I'm glad you don't see this place as the execution wall I've come to dread it as. Because we're going to spend a //long time here//,\" he added, crossing his arms and glancing at the heavy tonnes of paper under the section marked with a large, bolded 'H'.\n\n\n\n\"Better get started, then.\"\n\n\n\nHarry shrugged. \"Tomorrow's already caught me down here, so I do suppose I've got nothing to lose.\"\n\n\n\nSlowly, and with the kind of precision and worry mostly reserved for handling wild animals, Harry took the nearest ladder and stacked it up against the shelf in front of them. Before he could show Luca that he was free to climb first, Armaros was already halfway up.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm. //Hmm//.\" He grunted, slowly starting to rummage through piles upon piles of cross-referential reports handling topics of no real interest to anyone but maybe Maria Jones herself. After a while that felt longer to Harry than it did to him, he eventually said, \"I think I've got something.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\nLuca narrowed his eyes through his glasses. \"It's... not quite a dossier, but it's //something//. Some... Some list of paranormal-adjacent linguists, I think, and...\"\n\n\n\nHe reached out towards one level higher, shifting his weight to the front of his body. \"...and he's here! He's--\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, and without any fault of his own, he felt the ladder slip from under his feet. Seeing how the only things he could grab onto were the shelf itself and the books inside it, he didn't have enough actual leverage to avoid the fall. Before he could think of anything else to do -- or indeed react to this at all, in the fraction of a second his mind had been given to process the fact that was about to transpire -- he surrendered to gravity, taking with him some ten kilos of yellow paper nobody except him had seen since they had been printed.\n\n\n\nSomewhere in-between all of that, he managed to half-swear, \"Pancakes!\" before he landed on the solid floor with a heavy thud, burying himself under a self-made blanket of pages.\n\n\n\nWithout hesitation, Harry reached out, taking off the first layer.\n\n\n\nBeneath it, Luca lay in a fetal position, his body covered by one more veneer: one made from his own four blue wings, sprouting from his back, now no longer hidden under his Foundation-issued uniform. No scratches or bruised blemished his body -- the power that had sprouted his new appendages so many years ago made sure that no harm came to him from sources as mundane as this.\n\n\n\nWhen Luca opened his eyes again, the spark from previously had disappeared -- in their place there now was worry.\n\n\n\nIn his long years working here, Harry had seen that brand of fear many, many times. He knew what it meant more so than he wished he did.\n\n\n\n\"I... I'm sorry,\" Luca said, slowly standing up, his head down. \"I didn't...\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. His wings were low, now, clutched close to his back.\n\n\n\n\"Luca,\" Harry said, taking a deep breath. He had gone through this dance many times before, considering his place of employment. He could never relate, of course -- not fully -- but he did get how to get it. \"Come on. Nothing to apologize for.\"\n\n\n\nThe other archivist remained unconvinced. He'd heard this part many times before, too. He's long since forgiven himself for allowing himself to get tricked into becoming the Guardian, but it still wasn't the part of himself he wanted others to see first. He didn't want them to think of him as a monster, as some fool he was presented as during Site-19 lectures. He preferred to lay low, whenever he got the chance. It wasn't shame; more-so as a silent worry. Not of the possibility of bodily harm (his mantle of Guardian took care of that, mostly), but of what others could do to people like him, if they couldn't see past his first impression.\n\n\n\nHe almost-whispered, \"I don't want to--\"\n\n\n\n\"Listen.\" Harry looked him square in the eyes. \"My best friend is the student of an immortal Austrian wizard. My //second// best friend is bad luck incarnate. I once dated an //actual witch//. I don't care about any of that, Luca. I don't care what others might think of you. None of that defines you. What I see in front of me is a man dedicated to his job and passion. One whose help I need to do this.\n\n\n\n\"My point is this: I don't care, and neither should you.\"\n\n\n\nLuca stayed silent.\n\n\n\n\"...Because we've still got an actual metric ton of documents to go through.\" He smiled, now, the gesture warm and honest. \"You don't think I'd let you leave before we finished this, did you? I know our words come alive here at Forty-Three far more often than in other parts of the Foundation, but even here, the cases don't solve themselves, Mr. Archivist. So get back here and let's get this thing sorted, eh?\n\n\n\nLuca didn't say anything, for a very long second.\n\n\n\nThen, he smiled back.\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nShe scratched her chin, for what was possibly the millionth time this evening. She was beginning to ponder if she had a nervous tick. \"//I do wonder,//\" Lillian said, coming closer to Heather and leaning over the book.\n\n\n\nHeather chuckled. \"//You always do, Lils. What about, this time?//\"\n\n\n\n\"//How this exactly works, without a trigger.//\"\n\n\n\nThe other memeticist rolled her eyes. \"//Yes, we've already gone over that. We--//\"\n\n\n\n\"//No, I mean actually. Like,//\" she said, stabbing one of the pages with her finger. //\"None of the signs indicate any coercion. It's just... a soup of memetic symbols, none of them particularly bound together into a single formula.//\" \n\n\n\n\"//Wait//,\" Heather said, smiling, \"d//id you just admit that you don't know the answer, babe?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian groaned. She did not like not knowing things. \"//It doesn't add up. It shouldn't just do nothing because it's got no target -- it should do nothing because it __does not__ do anything.//\"\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Heather considered, carrying over the last copied pages onto the binding machine. \"//Well, I think it's all just about perspective, really.//\"\n\n\n\nLillian raised an eyebrow. \"//What?//\"\n\n\n\n\"//If it's not an immediate effect, maybe it's something slower. Something more gradual, perhaps, not so immediate -- something far more subtle. Something not intrusive.//\" She paused. //\"Who do you think Huizinga was, really? Beneath all of that work we're analyzing.//\"\n\n\n\nThe eyebrow now turned into an arch. \"//That's... what Harry and Armaros are trying to figure out.//\"\n\n\n\nHeather shook her head. \"//I don't mean what he was. What he worked as, or what group he possibly aligned himself with,//\" she said. \"//I'm asking who he was __really__, beneath all of those titles. I'm sure you can remember something.//\"\n\n\n\nAfter a second of searching, Lillian found that Heather indeed was right. There //was// something about Huizinga in that perfect memory of hers that she could salvage. She decided to indulge her. \"//An historian, primarily. Also a linguist. Travelled a lot.//\" She paused. //\"So someone who cared about the world, in its entirety. Tried to care, anyway. Tried to see the bigger picture.//\"\n\n\n\n\"//Yeah. So __why__ would he make this?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian groaned. \"//That's the whole--//\"\n\n\n\n\"//No, Lils. Stop being stupid, Why do you __think__ he would make it? I don't care about truth, I want your opinion. Why do you think someone like him would make a memetic tool -- one that doesn't have an aggressive effect and is tied to a single, unassuming object? One that can bring no harm to anyone? One bound to a book, out of all things?//\"\n\n\n\nNormally, there were two things Lillian despised, more than anything else -- being interrupted, and being lectured. Heather, however, was anything but normal; she was one of the few people that could match her speed (and her interest). Though Lillian possessed a proficiency in pretty much all subjects she wished to possess a proficiency in, one thing she never could figure out fully was how normal people thought. She could predict them, better so than almost anyone else alive, and she could manipulate them to her own ends -- but getting to see down-to-earth things through their eyes was something else entirely. It didn't escape her -- it just actively bored her.\n\n\n\nHeather, however, always could see the grander picture, especially when it came to memetics.\n\n\n\nIt was her job, after all.\n\n\n\nLillian considered. She looked down at the book. The //book//. Oh. \"//To make them do something, but of their own volition. Not to force them, but to point to some direction -- show them the path towards noticing something. Just like a book.//\"\n\n\n\n\"//Just like a book, yeah. And where does that lead us? If not to the mind, like you already established, then where?//\" She came closer, and put her hand on Lillian's. Very slowly, she navigated both towards one of the symbols written on the page. \"//And don't say that it was to make people learn Dutch. Who would actually want that?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian blinked twice.\n\n\n\nThen, she got it.\n\n\n\n\"//To the heart. Whatever it is, the message leads right to your heart.\"//\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nLuca had thought it'd be an easy job, all things considered. \n\n\n\nHis optimism did not waver when faced with the archives; it didn't even waver when he realized they were going to have to compile a timeline.\n\n\n\nBut when, by the five hour mark, they'd barely scratched the surface of the iceberg, he //was// beginning to question whether this was a one day job.\n\n\n\nHarry sighed, rubbed his eyes, and turned over another page of some manuscript older than them both (which, considering both were technically semi-immortal, was quite the achievement). He noted something down, propped his head up, and went back to reading.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, he turned to face Luca. \"You got anything?\"\n\n\n\nLuca popped his lips. \"Nothing new. Nothing new that's //exciting//, I guess I should say.\" He blinked twice, already feeling the exhaustion from all the work starting to creep in. \"If I have to read about one more historical summit...\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.\" Harry put the book aside. \"Yeah. Too much even for me.\" Just like any real historian, Harry did have an admiration for the great work that Huizinga's contributions had carried over to his field of study. But, after as long as this -- and as late as this -- his admiration even for a man like him started to turn into ennui. He looked at the tome for some few seconds, then diverted his sight back towards Luca. \"This clearly isn't working,\" he said, picking up his notes.\n\n\n\nLuca raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"We've got a timeline of his life and major cross-references, but none of it is of any actual use.\"\n\n\n\nLuca put up his finger, trying in a positive tone, \"Maybe sometimes absence of evidence //is// evidence of ab--\"\n\n\n\n\"Right, yes, yes, but we can't be //sure// because there's nothing concrete in this goddamn thing. No lines to draw immediate conclusion through.\" He sighed. \"I was built for reading, not for... this nonsense vague intention analysis. Half a degree in literature does not an English teacher make,\" he said, a bitter chuckle entering his lips.\n\n\n\nYes, half a degree in literature studies barely made someone an expert; but a full one did. Luca //was// built for this exact thing. He smiled very slowly. \"I think we ought to step back and look at what we've got.\"\n\n\n\nHarry gave him a look. \"And what //do// we've got?\"\n\n\n\n\"Time to find out, no?\" he said, standing up.\n\n\n\nHarry grunted, but soon followed Luca's stead.\n\n\n\nBefore long, they were looking at a lot of very badly handwritten post-it notes, all assembled together into a grotesque imitation of a mosaic.\n\n\n\n\"Like I said: there's not much here,\" Harry said, unconvinced. \"Unless you really want to read about tea parties.\"\n\n\n\nLuca nodded. \"Right. But it does paint us a picture of him, doesn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose so.\" Harry considered. \"What are you looking for, exactly?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm trying to see what kind of man arises as an image from this all. What general outlines we can trace to who he was.\"\n\n\n\nThat got Harry's attention. \"Well. He wasn't a shit, for starters. Rare in those times.\" He pointed to one of the notes. \"He opposed the Nazis pretty heavily back in the thirties.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you think a //giftschreiber// would do that? Try to avoid the chaos and suffering that followed?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, no, but I don't want to cross him out on the basis of one claim. Just one source isn't going to cut it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Right.\" Luca paused, pondering.\n\n\n\nHarry said, \"It's also clear he wasn't narrow-minded. Tried to not be, in any case.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, the travel log's rather impressive. As are his linguistics,\" he added, snapping his fingers at some table of data. \"Sanskrit and German aren't too bad for a man of his times.\"\n\n\n\nHarry nodded. He was fully in lecture mode, now. He was starting to enjoy this. \"With the exception of //The Autumn//, he's also written a few things on culture. //Also// shockingly progressive and open-minded. Cared about art and the human spirit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\nHarry sighed, one more time. \"All right, I yield. This is no //giftschreiber// profile. Not unless he was absurdly covert. Which,\" he said, \"for the sake of our own sanity, I won't for now consider.\n\n\n\n\"However,\" he continued, unwilling to surrender his point, \"just because he wasn't this particular brand of memetic cultist doesn't mean he wasn't one of some other.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course. But he definitely wasn't one of the apocalypse-harbinging ones, on that we can agree.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\" Harry scratched his nose. \"For what it's worth, the man genuinely did seem to care about the artistic and cultural legacy of humanity, enough to try to protect it.\" He waved his hand. \"The non-fascist read on legacy, I mean.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. It's clear he found great value in what he studied.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\n\n\"So what //was// his work doing in a //giftschreiber// stash? If it wasn't written by one of theirs, what use is it to them?\"\n\n\n\nHarry considered. \"Maybe as a contrast. An instruction, what not to do.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hardly his best work for that particular lesson.\"\n\n\n\n\"//If// the lesson they got from it is the one we are also assuming, that is.\"\n\n\n\nLuca skewed his head. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"What if it isn't just about the obvious plurality of human culture, from an academic standpoint?\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you proposing a more... down to earth read?\"\n\n\n\nHarry nodded. \"It //is// a fairytale book, after all. Hardly the most serious of sources for academia,\" he said. \"But yes. What if it isn't some serious message about the inner workings of a\u00a0\u00a0human culture?\n\n\n\n\"What if it's just simply a message that that diversity exists and we should embrace it?\" He paused. \"The fairytales don't carry grand lessons with them, but they do carry a legacy, Same thing that happened during Soviet occupation of Ukraine, with how their fairytales survived because the invaders thought that they had no message of their own. Maybe it's something similar, here?\"\n\n\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\n\nBefore Luca could intersect, a dull //ping// from Harry's pager interrupted him. The archivist pulled the device up. \"Lillian's got our copy, it seems, all free of memetics. That should give us some more insight.\" He looked at Luca. \"We better not keep her waiting.\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nAfter so long down in the archives, they both found, their legs didn't quite work as well as they would have hoped. That Memetics & Countermemetics was situated on the other side of the facility certainly didn't help, either. Still: their long and grueling march gave them time enough to mull everything over, forming a relatively coherent image of Huizinga and their plan going forward, in regards to said image.\n\n\n\nThey only stopped brainstorming once they stood before the door to a large shared research room.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't much compared to Lillian's own, personal office -- which, as Luca had previously seen once and as Harry had seen many, many times was a work of art in its own right -- but the place was still well-equipped and professional, even given the Foundation's already high base standards. Its walls were lined with apparatus neither of the archivists could even guess the purpose of, stuck right between tubes of carbon paper writ with similarly alien runes.\n\n\n\nThe middle of the room, however, was where its //pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance// stood.\n\n\n\nIt was a giant thing, some two meters tall and maybe three meters wide, all clean, grey panels and press modules. It looked like it cost more than a small Area in its own right. With its control buttons, circular lights, and small screens, it looked--\n\n\n\n\"...Straight out of //Star Trek//.\" Luca whispered to himself, his face a half-formed grin.\n\n\n\nHarry caught it, and smiled too, though far more widely than Luca. He was glad someone else had finally also seen his vision.\n\n\n\n\"See?\" Lillian started walking towards the two archivists. \"I told you you two'd get along,\" she said, pointing at Luca. \"And yeah, with how much funding I needed redirected to get that thing here you can bet your ass it could belong on a set.\" Before Luca could get even more flustered by realizing that both of them had heard his comment, she continued, \"Anyway. Here's your fuckin' book, nerds. Free of all the shit that'd make you talk nonsense.\"\n\n\n\nShe pointed to a tome laying on the worktable next to the machine. It looked pretty much identical to the one that Luca had seen before, when he had been sent the initial find. The only exception was that this copy didn't have the cover the original had -- instead, it was neatly wrapped in translucent, green-ish foil, the letters still visible even despite the covering.\n\n\n\nLuca came forward, towards the book. \"So, what's your impression? Of the whole thing, I mean. Are the runes //giftschreiber// or not?\"\n\n\n\nHeather came closer, leaning against the table. \"Not by a long shot.\" She was speaking again in English now; her and Lillian had waited two hours before calling Harry and Luca in so that the effect would die down. Two hours that they'd spent actually cleaning this place up, after they drowned it in a sea of memetic symbols by untackling the composition of the book.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lillihammer chimed in. \"There's no way he's one of them. It's all too jumbled up in-between sappy metaphors to be them. They prefer using more annoying allegories.\" She crossed her arms, and for a second, the silver of her engagement ring sparkled beneath the lab's LED lights.\n\n\n\nLuca smiled again, quickly seeing very similar jewelry on Heather's own finger. These two have gone a long way since she'd first met Heather. Even though he still remained ambivalent towards Lillian (admiration was a strange mix when confronted with irritation), he was happy they'd found each other. He knew all too well how solitary it could get, here in the Foundation, for people like them. For people that weren't made to fit the mold of a standard researcher that asked no questions and had no doubts. Even with a dating pool as diverse and as global as the one offered by their shared conspiracy, finding someone of kindred spirit wasn't easy. He sure as hell wasn't any closer to figuring it all out, even all those years later. Truth be told, he didn't even want to consider the meeting he had last week to have been a date. It was a mess.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't need another STEM guy who thinks literature isn't worth his precious time.\n\n\n\nIt was a heavy burden, his search for a significant other, one he had struggled through most of his life; one he figured he'd spend some time more still unraveling. \n\n\n\nThese two, however, were made for each other. He was glad they didn't have to go through the same nonsense he had to.\n\n\n\nThey'd do great things together. Of that, he was sure.\n\n\n\n\"What about you?\" Heather asked. \"How's your front holding up? Not a //giftschreiber//?\"\n\n\n\nHarry nodded. \"Not a //giftschreiber//. Some flavor of memetic and vaguely pretentious but definitely not one of the nutcases.\"\n\n\n\nLillian. \"Good. That's good.\" She put her hands together, and eyed the two archivists. \"Now. Now that you've got what you wanted\u2014\" She eyed the book. \"Shoo, with you two.\" She grinned, and looked at Heather, almost as if asking if this was enough to make her no longer talk about needing to help Luca. \"We've got important work to attend to. Important work that doesn't feature old nonsense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Just the new nonsense,\" Heather said, handing Luca the book. \"But yeah, as great as it was to catch up...\" She shrugged. \"Sorry, Luca. You know how it goes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Of course. I know you've got work.\"\n\n\n\nHarry rolled his eyes. \"Sure they do.\" He was already half-way through the door when he turned around to Luca, and said, \"Oh, and please try not to drop the book. I think J&M would kill us if we had to report another thing after last week's poker session with Willie.\"\n\n\n\nLuca didn't ask. He didn't even raise an eyebrow. Instead, he just grabbed the book more tightly and caught up with the other archivist.\n\n\n\nSome things, he'd found, were better left without answers.\n\n\n\nParticularly in a place like this.\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nBy the time Lillian and Heather made it to the shared Sublevel Three cafeteria to eat their last meal before calling it a day, they were fairly certain the sun had already risen, all the way up on the surface.\n\n\n\nNot that they'd notice it, of course, or even particularly care; just like with everything else, the two rarely -- if ever -- followed the expectations of others. Particularly when said expectations were as widely accepted and limiting as that of the day and night cycle.\n\n\n\nStill: when they took up their trays and loaded their food, they had to admit the place was no longer deserted, as it mostly would be during the night. Now, dozens of personnel were coming in. They were almost exclusively Janitorial & Maintenance staff, as it was an unwritten custom for them to begin work before the other sections did, and although they weren't a crowd quite yet, they were not what the two memeticist had expected.\n\n\n\nLillian sighed, and quickly sat down with Heather in the most remote table offered by the cafeteria, hoping its isolation would be enough to render them invisible to the others. She didn't hate the manual laborers of Site-43, specifically -- nobody in their right mind did. She just hated people, in general, so she thought it'd be better for her and them if she remained isolated from the forming group, especially this late into the night.\n\n\n\nThe moment their trays touched the table, Lillian sighed again, and started massaging her temples.\n\n\n\nHeather nodded. \"Yeah. Long day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Loooooong day.\" Lillian agreed. She blinked twice, and started playing with the fork, vaguely poking the foot on her plate. \"Waste of time, too.\"\n\n\n\nHeather gave her a look. \"Come on, Lils. You know I couldn't say no. Not to Luca.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I know. That's why I'm complaining.\" She took a bite, only to realize she wasn't particularly hungry. She just had to wait for Heather to come to the same realization, then, before they could retire to their shared dormitory and retire for the night -- and before someone dumped another nonsense project on their lap.\n\n\n\nHeather grinned. \"Is someone jealous?\"\n\n\n\nLillian scoffed, amused. \"No. I just don't like not getting closure.\"\n\n\n\nHer partner raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"We figured out the how but not the why, is my point,\" she said, propping herself up. \"That's not good enough.\"\n\n\n\n\"And here I was, thinking you didn't want to dedicate any more time to this.\"\n\n\n\nLillian rolled her eyes. \"You're hopeless,\" she said, but smiled.\n\n\n\nThey continued like that in silence for a couple more minutes, only occasionally getting interrupted by Heather actually eating -- much to Lillian's dismay -- and the sporadic chit-chat from J&M personnel making its way from the center of the room.\n\n\n\nEventually, though, Lillian admitted: \"Fine. You're right. I'm mad we did end it like that. I wish we could've done more.\" She crossed her arms. \"Not at the cost of our actual schedule, of course, but in general.\" She waved circles with her hand, and groaned. \"It's bullshit we didn't get it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Lils, but we did. Come on. You unraveled a complicated meme in the time it takes most people to stop speaking Dutch from looking at it.\" She smiled faintly. \"Besides: getting the context of it isn't our job. It's no use troubling yourself over something that's not your responsibility.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure. But maybe actually knowing the reason they had it in their stash could help us with future nonsense.\" She sighed. \"Even knowing why he made it would help.\"\n\n\n\nHeather took another bite, and considered. When she next spoke, her meal was finished. \"If it helps, I have two hours to spare tomorrow. I can dedicate them to reverse-engineering that thing, if you'd like. Maybe getting it to work for other languages would--\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, her eyes went wide, as did Lillian's.\n\n\n\nAt the very same time, the two of them got it.\n\n\n\n\"Oh shit.\"\n\n\n\nLillian smiled, and both of them immediately stood up.\n\n\n\n\"Oh shit indeed.\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nWhen they got back to Harry's office, they soon found out that even the wonders of coffee had an upper limit to their magic. They found it out the hard way, when they sat back in their chairs and immediately felt the length of the day weigh down on their shoulders the second they made themselves comfortable.\n\n\n\nLuca endured, somehow, by browsing through the pages of the meme-free book and paying it barely any attention. The letters were starting to look very skimmable, turning into pretty much nonsense, but he was still standing, trying to make sense of what little he could make out from the actual text.\n\n\n\nHarry, however, wasn't so lucky. He gave into the exhaustion pretty much instantly, half-laying on the desk, his glasses still on his head.\n\n\n\nThey stayed like that for a while until eventually -- and without much enthusiasm -- Luca said, \"So, uh, do you speak any Dutch? Besides curses, I mean, and surface level stuff. That I can manage myself.\"\n\n\n\nLuca's voice was barely more than a whisper, but it still rippled through the silent archives like thunder.\n\n\n\nHarry jolted awake, almost hitting his head on the desk lamp above him. He looked like whatever it was he had been dreaming about, it had been far more engaging than the task at hand. \"Uh, no? Not really. I know some few words, maybe, but...\" He shrugged. Just like everyone of his background, he'd picked up French sometime along the way of personal life and academia, but he'd never been much of a polyglot. He much preferred the other kind of incomprehensible texts -- the ones they actually paid him to unravel. \n\n\n\n\"That's what Clio's for,\" Harry said, and smiled at his own joke. Luca had no way of knowing who Cliometria.aic was -- or indeed that she had been created for the express purpose of handling material incomprehensible or too memetically confusing for standard humans to get -- but that didn't stop Harry. Amusing nobody but himself was the expected baseline for his humor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nEventually, though, his smile died down, and he became serious. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\n\nLuca vaguely gestured towards the opened book. \"I'm trying to see if there's anything interesting to anyone but myself in this, or if it's just fairy tales like the file said. Whether there's something in-between the lines.\"\n\n\n\nHarry skewed his head. \"Didn't you... read it, when you actually spoke Dutch? In those two hours, I mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but it's not the same, is it? I have memories of it, sure, but... I have memories of what the text talks about, but those memories wouldn't really be the same. Translation wouldn't be as precise, either. Not exactly. It certainly seemed to click more when I actually understood the words properly. But now...\" he blew out air. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"What if that's the point?\"\n\n\n\nLuca blinked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\nHarry scratched his head. \"We've got a guy who very clearly cares about the plurality of human societies. Someone who recognizes the value of distinct cultural identities without turning that rhetoric into fascist bullshit.\" He tapped the book. \"A guy that goes out of his way to not only create a book that can make you not just see the experience of the other, but actually //feel// it. Feel it as intended, not as a flattened localization.\n\n\n\n\"What if that's the whole point?\"\n\n\n\nLuca blinked again. Both of them were too tired for the revelation to particularly strike them as much as it normally would. \"I... I suppose so? But doesn't that just feel too convenient to you? Too heartfelt?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe.\" Harry smiled. \"But in history, I've found, the most heartfelt answers are very often the best ones.\"\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Item \u2116:** SCP-XXXX {{[PENDING CLASSIFICATION]}}\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is freely available for use to all Foundation personnel, and is to remain so for the foreseeable future. To ensure maximum efficiency, its usage should first be cataloged and scheduled with the SCP-XXXX project lead, Senior Researcher Luca Armaros.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a leather-bound tome hand-written by Johan Huizinga, a Dutch historian, linguist, and thaumaturgist. The 159-page tome is entirely filled with richly illustrated Dutch fairy tales and stories from Dutch folklore.[[footnote]] Such as the stories of //Witte Wieven//, //Vrouwtje van Stavoren//, //Vliegende// Hollander, or //Bokkenrijders//. [[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX was formerly the host of a circle class hermeneutic effect which changed the linguistic capabilities of subjects interacting with it by restricting it solely to Dutch for approximately two hours, even if the affected individual previously lacked any such skills. Following in-depth research, reverse engineering, and reprogramming work performed on the object by Drs. Lillihammer, Garrison, Blank, and Sr. Res. Armaros, it is now capable of instilling such an effect in a controlled manner. The duration of the effect -- as well as the instilled language -- are no longer limited to two hours and Dutch respectively; instead, the user is now capable of choosing from a wide array of 200 languages cataloged by the Foundation and embedded into the memetic effect, selecting the effect's intended duration.\n\n\n\nAs of writing, SCP-XXXX is utilized in all Site-43 and Site-19 contacts with ESL (English as a Second Language) subjects so as to ensure no vital information and/or perspectives are lost during the translation process which would otherwise inevitably occur during interviews, interrogations, and similar occasions.\n\n\n\n**Addendum XXXX-1:** On 16/11/2024, two months following the completion of the changes done to SCP-XXXX by Foundation personnel, the object started to undergo spontaneous changes, inexplicably growing in size by almost 300 pages. Following interrogation, it was revealed that its properties have not changed, but its content has -- the fairytales contained inside were no longer solely Dutch in origin. Instead, the additional pages were found to contain material of similar nature from all around the globe, featuring legends and stories from France, China, India, Germany, Japan, Russia, and Portugal.\n\n\n\nFurther research is ongoing.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/==]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n\n[[/=]]\n", "references": ["ralliston-s-authorpage", "parker-informational-breach", "scp-8166", "the-legend-of-the-iron-goat", "scp-5382", "scp-5243", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "art-exchange", "doctor-blank", "doctor-lillihammer", "eventyr", "forgotten-memories", "on-guard-43", "tale"], "title": "Silver Hair & Silver Tongues - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/silver-hair-and-silver-tongues", "year": 2025}, "the-american-emptiness": {"created_at": "2025-01-21T04:08:00", "creator": "Harmacy", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Harmacy", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harmacy", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-21T04:08:00"}, {"author": "Diogene_s", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/diogene-s", "comment": "Added tags: bittersweet, tale.

I hope you're all bundled up this winter season, as I have quite the cold case to share with you all. The records on this one are very few and far between, but I had a friend in Canada help me with some ground research.</p>\n<p>At 7:56 PM on December 24th, 1999, a woman was kidnapped by two robed figures in front of one Mrs. Laura Chance's residence in rural Canada. Within two hours a manhunt unveiled a secret cult, merely moments after a ritualistic killing deep in the Yukon woodlands. Suspects were locked up, cleanup crews called, the incident tucked away, and the town utterly shaken to its core. A frightening and chilling case for sure \u2014 but, ultimately, a mundane one.</p>\n<p>What makes this case cold is the fact that, in spite of the tiny size of the town, no one knew who the kidnapped woman was.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 12/25/24 (WED) 14:21:50 #94926938</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Mrs. Laura Chance, age 62 and recently widowed, lived by herself in a three bedroom home just on the edge of Watson Lake, Canada. She spent most of her time knitting, reading, and watching television, occasionally visiting friends in the neighborhood. On this particular Christmas Eve in 1999, however, she's busy cleaning her home as the holiday spirit begins to set in, dutifully setting plates and hanging up decorations.</p>\n<p>At precisely 7:56 PM MST \u2014 known only because Mrs. Chance checked her watch moments earlier \u2014 a woman's scream echoes across the house. Dropping everything, Mrs. Chance runs to her front door, and is met with a terrifying sight: a cloaked figure dragging a screaming, kicking woman across her front lawn towards an unmarked black van. After a few moments of shock, she dashes for the landline and dials emergency services.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Chance speaks frantically into the phone. Although her report is sporadic and takes random turns, the dispatcher seems to pick up exactly what she's saying. Within mere minutes, a cop car is already set and ready to go. The hunt is on.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, officers in the area are quite quick to respond. Although a majority of them are off for the holidays, several are still on duty and eager for some action. Within another fifteen minutes, two more police cars mobilize and began the search, with several more gearing up for action behind them.</p>\n<p>Watson Lake, being a small Yukon town, is directly on the Alaska Highway. Getting in and out undetected is no simple feat this time of year. That meant that, with their quick work, the police could lock down the region fast and begin searching for the van with a high confidence of catching it quickly.</p>\n<p>They would not have to look for long. The van is found rapidly, within an hour of the call, abandoned by the side of the road on the edge of town. The officers step out of their car and begin examination, immediately spotting three sets of clear footprints, trailing deep into the woods.</p>\n<p>One set was uneven, and smaller than the other two. A perfect match, with not a second to lose. They had found a path straight to the perpetrators\u2026 and the victim.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 12/25/24 (WED) 14:22:02 #94926939</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Hot on the culprits' tails, the two officers at the scene \u2014 Christopher Cooper and Gwenda Dalton \u2014 set off without waiting for backup, relaying their plans to dispatch. The darkness and freezing snow means their progress is slow and difficult. However, the two persevere, even while the wind begins to pick up around them.</p>\n<p>As the tracks deepen and become more defined, Officer Dalton notices a faint glow directly ahead of them, which she immediately mentions to dispatch. When they approach, the officers soon fall completely silent, and stop walking entirely. Christopher later commented:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It was nightmarish \u2014 something you'd see out of a cheap horror film, but gritty and physical. Me 'n Gwenda just about stopped and stared for a minute, trying to comprehend what the hell we were witnessing. If what we were lookin' at was even real.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The officers' bodycams show several robed, hooded figures standing in a circle, their hands raised as the wind howls around them. In frame are the bones of several animals littering the area, and various objects hang from the nearby trees in a circle. In other words, a cliche cult circle, complete with a ringleader standing above a corpse.</p>\n<p>The moment they catch their bearings, the duo draw their weapons and promptly jump into action. Startled, several of the figures flee into the woods at the sight of the officers, while several others seem to double over or clutch their heads. The leader, in the middle, is too preoccupied with their ritual to notice.</p>\n<p>Dalton and Cooper make quick work of the group. Within minutes, nearly all the suspects still present are safely in custody, all having gone willingly. Save for one, that is: the aforementioned cult leader, who only began to struggle as the pair moved to arrest them. The other officers, arriving minutes later, help take the group in. The other cultists, however, are long gone \u2014 a prospective manhunt is called off almost immediately due to the weather.</p>\n<p>Records on the suspects in custody are sparse. There is, however, a throughline between all the records that <em>are</em> public: the cultists either suffer from amnesia, or are all very good at pretending to. No one at the cult site \u2014 save for the leader, whose transcripts aren't anywhere I can find \u2014 could remember why they were there, or what they were trying to do.</p>\n<p>The leader was one Ms. Catherine Polley, a 25-year-old who lived in the area. I couldn't find anything particularly noteworthy about her life, though apparently she had been caught stealing signs from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_Post_Forest\">Sign Post Forest</a>, a local tourist trap, several weeks earlier. Similar \u2014 though heavily damaged \u2014 signs were found near the cult site. Besides that, though, all I could find was that she'd lived in the town her whole life, and apparently was an extremely bitter and spiteful person.</p>\n<p>All these details on their own would be eyebrow-raising. A mass hysteria case led by a vindictive psychopath or people strung too far in over their heads, perhaps, but not necessarily supernatural.</p>\n<p>What seals the deal for me is not the cultists. It's the body.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 12/25/24 (WED) 14:22:08 #94926940</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It took almost no time for the police to determine that the woman was dead. Her body sat lifelessly in the now-darkened center of the cult site, snow beginning to bury her limbs. With the lead suspect in custody and the weather potentially causing issues, the shift supervisor gave approval for the body to be transferred to a nearby morgue for analysis.</p>\n<p>The autopsy of the body took place on the 26th, after the holidays. Much to the surprise of the resident pathologist, no cause of death could be determined. There was no sign of physical injury (besides a broken wrist), blunt force trauma, toxicity buildup, or anything indicating foul play. Although hypothermia was the most likely cause of death, there was also nothing on the corpse that indicated death by exposure \u2014 save for some frostbite in the arms \u2014 and it seemed unlikely the cult would let her die naturally. The cause of death would ultimately be labeled as \"<tt>Unknown, likely hypothermia.</tt>\"</p>\n<p>What's even more mysterious is that, in the ensuing days, the woman could not be identified at all. Her DNA, fingerprints, and dental records did not match anyone in any known registry. No one interviewed in the region could identify her, nor had ever even seen her before. Even a vehicle found near the location of the kidnapping \u2014 believed to be owned by the victim \u2014 could not be traced to a specific owner.</p>\n<p>It was though she had simply materialized from thin air, for the sole purpose of being killed.</p>\n<p>At this point, records become practically non-existent. My best guess is that CSIS (Canada's FBI-equivalent) got involved and shut their investigation under a tight lock. That, unfortunately, gives us almost nothing to work with. Whether they're just as puzzled as us or have long solved the case, I have no idea. What I <em>do</em> know, though, is that within a week, every single outlet that had previously been following the story completely dropped it. Within a year, no one was talking about it anymore at all.</p>\n<p>My own efforts to unravel this mystery \u2014 or, at least, <em>write</em> about it \u2014 have been mostly fruitless. No missing persons cases across Canada or the US even remotely match her description. No one's come forward online claiming to have known her. Her car has no prior sightings or records associated with the license plate. Barely anyone even <em>mentions</em> the case anymore, even the content farms that pump out true crime stories. Dead end after dead end.</p>\n<p>Was she from a parallel universe? Was the cult? Did the cult's ritual somehow partially summon her into existence? Why? Is the government involved? Is the victim a foreign government agent, attempting to infiltrate some random Yukon town? Did <em>she</em> even know how she got there? Did the fact it happen on Christmas have anything to do with it at all?</p>\n<p>I have no idea. Truthfully, I don't think we'll ever really know. The whole thing reeks of conspiracy or a supernatural phenomenon. Whatever the case may be, we can only hope that she's at peace now, whoever she was.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 12/25/24 (WED) 14:25:29 #94926943</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>But that's not really a satisfying ending, and I wouldn't leave you all with nothing of substance to chew on.</p>\n<p>About a year after I initially shelved this post, a friend of mine \u2014 who wishes to remain anonymous \u2014 told me they were taking a trip through the Yukon. I remembered this case, and asked them if they'd do some ground research for me. They said yes.</p>\n<p>I wish I could say they cracked the case open, but all I've got is more questions. Still, I think the questions are different enough to make this case worth sharing now.</p>\n<p>To start off, some newspaper clippings in the local library reveal the ultimate fate of Ms. Polley: first-degree murder, kidnapping, and property theft charges, incurring a life sentence. That feels a little overkill to me personally, especially since we don't even know who the victim is or how she died. But, I'm not Canadian, so who can say.</p>\n<p>Her current whereabouts are unknown, though presumably she's behind bars.</p>\n<p>A different clipping \u2014 buried deep in the library's archives \u2014 reveals more about the cult site itself, though I don't know how much it illuminates. There were several urns containing ground-up bones, crow feathers, and other cult-adjacent items. There was a single burnt Polaroid, though it was too damaged to be legible.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most baffling, though, were several license plates, road signs, and other similar landmark items stolen from the aforementioned Sign Post Forest, scattered around the area. All of them seem to have had the names of places they were from removed, almost seamlessly. No clue what to make of that, personally.</p>\n<p>After that, my friend didn't seem to make much further progress.

I hope you're all bundled up this winter season, as I have quite the cold case to share with you all. The records on this one are very few and far between, but I had a friend in Canada help me with some ground research.\n\n\n\nAt 7:56 PM on December 24th, 1999, a woman was kidnapped by two robed figures in front of one Mrs. Laura Chance's residence in rural Canada. Within two hours a manhunt unveiled a secret cult, merely moments after a ritualistic killing deep in the Yukon woodlands. Suspects were locked up, cleanup crews called, the incident tucked away, and the town utterly shaken to its core. A frightening and chilling case for sure -- but, ultimately, a mundane one.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this case cold is the fact that, in spite of the tiny size of the town, no one knew who the kidnapped woman was.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 12/25/24 (WED) 14:21:50 #94926938\n\n----\n\n\n\nMrs. Laura Chance, age 62 and recently widowed, lived by herself in a three bedroom home just on the edge of Watson Lake, Canada. She spent most of her time knitting, reading, and watching television, occasionally visiting friends in the neighborhood. On this particular Christmas Eve in 1999, however, she's busy cleaning her home as the holiday spirit begins to set in, dutifully setting plates and hanging up decorations.\n\n\n\nAt precisely 7:56 PM MST \u2014 known only because Mrs. Chance checked her watch\u00a0\u00a0moments earlier \u2014 a woman's scream echoes across the house. Dropping everything, Mrs. Chance runs to her front door, and is met with a terrifying sight: a cloaked figure dragging a screaming, kicking woman across her front lawn towards an unmarked black van. After a few moments of shock, she dashes for the landline and dials emergency services.\n\n\n\nMrs. Chance speaks frantically into the phone. Although her report is sporadic and takes random turns, the dispatcher seems to pick up exactly what she's saying. Within mere minutes, a cop car is already set and ready to go. The hunt is on.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, officers in the area are quite quick to respond. Although a majority of them are off for the holidays, several are still on duty and eager for some action. Within another fifteen minutes, two more police cars mobilize and began the search, with several more gearing up for action behind them.\n\n\n\nWatson Lake, being a small Yukon town, is directly on the Alaska Highway. Getting in and out undetected is no simple feat this time of year. That meant that, with their quick work, the police could lock down the region fast and begin searching for the van with a high confidence of catching it quickly.\n\n\n\nThey would not have to look for long. The van is found rapidly, within an hour of the call, abandoned by the side of the road on the edge of town. The officers step out of their car and begin examination, immediately spotting three sets of clear footprints, trailing deep into the woods. \n\n\n\nOne set was uneven, and smaller than the other two. A perfect match, with not a second to lose. They had found a path straight to the perpetrators... and the victim.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 12/25/24 (WED) 14:22:02 #94926939\n\n----\n\n\n\nHot on the culprits' tails, the two officers at the scene \u2014 Christopher Cooper and Gwenda Dalton \u2014 set off without waiting for backup, relaying their plans to dispatch. The darkness and freezing snow means their progress is slow and difficult. However, the two persevere, even while the wind begins to pick up around them.\n\n\n\nAs the tracks deepen and become more defined, Officer Dalton notices a faint glow directly ahead of them, which she immediately mentions to dispatch. When they approach, the officers soon fall completely silent, and stop walking entirely. Christopher later commented:\n\n\n\n> //It was nightmarish \u2014 something you'd see out of a cheap horror film, but gritty and physical. Me 'n Gwenda just about stopped and stared for a minute, trying to comprehend what the hell we were witnessing. If what we were lookin' at was even real.//\n\n\n\nThe officers' bodycams show several robed, hooded figures standing in a circle, their hands raised as the wind howls around them. In frame are the bones of several animals littering the area, and various objects hang from the nearby trees in a circle. In other words, a cliche cult circle, complete with a ringleader standing above a corpse.\n\n\n\nThe moment they catch their bearings, the duo draw their weapons and promptly jump into action. Startled, several of the figures flee into the woods at the sight of the officers, while several others seem to double over or clutch their heads. The leader, in the middle, is too preoccupied with their ritual to notice.\n\n\n\nDalton and Cooper make quick work of the group. Within minutes, nearly all the suspects still present are safely in custody, all having gone willingly. Save for one, that is: the aforementioned cult leader, who only began to struggle as the pair moved to arrest them. The other officers, arriving minutes later, help take the group in. The other cultists, however, are long gone \u2014 a prospective manhunt is called off almost immediately due to the weather.\n\n\n\nRecords on the suspects in custody are sparse. There is, however, a throughline between all the records that //are// public: the cultists either suffer from amnesia, or are all very good at pretending to. No one at the cult site \u2014 save for the leader, whose transcripts aren't anywhere I can find \u2014 could remember why they were there, or what they were trying to do. \n\n\n\nThe leader was one Ms. Catherine Polley, a 25-year-old who lived in the area. I couldn't find anything particularly noteworthy about her life, though apparently she had been caught stealing signs from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_Post_Forest Sign Post Forest], a local tourist trap, several weeks earlier. Similar \u2014 though heavily damaged \u2014 signs were found near the cult site. Besides that, though, all I could find was that she'd lived in the town her whole life, and apparently was an extremely bitter and spiteful person.\n\n\n\nAll these details on their own would be eyebrow-raising. A mass hysteria case led by a vindictive psychopath or people strung too far in over their heads, perhaps, but not necessarily supernatural. \n\n\n\nWhat seals the deal for me is not the cultists. It's the body.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 12/25/24 (WED) 14:22:08 #94926940\n\n----\n\n\n\nIt took almost no time for the police to determine that the woman was dead. Her body sat lifelessly in the now-darkened center of the cult site, snow beginning to bury her limbs. With the lead suspect in custody and the weather potentially causing issues, the shift supervisor gave approval for the body to be transferred to a nearby morgue for analysis. \n\n\n\nThe autopsy of the body took place on the 26th, after the holidays. Much to the surprise of the resident pathologist, no cause of death could be determined. There was no sign of physical injury (besides a broken wrist), blunt force trauma, toxicity buildup, or anything indicating foul play. Although hypothermia was the most likely cause of death, there was also nothing on the corpse that indicated death by exposure \u2014 save for some frostbite in the arms \u2014 and it seemed unlikely the cult would let her die naturally. The cause of death would ultimately be labeled as \"{{Unknown, likely hypothermia.}}\"\n\n\n\nWhat's even more mysterious is that, in the ensuing days, the woman could not be identified at all. Her DNA, fingerprints, and dental records did not match anyone in any known registry. No one interviewed in the region could identify her, nor had ever even seen her before. Even a vehicle found near the location of the kidnapping \u2014 believed to be owned by the victim \u2014 could not be traced to a specific owner. \n\n\n\nIt was though she had simply materialized from thin air, for the sole purpose of being killed.\n\n\n\nAt this point, records become practically non-existent. My best guess is that CSIS (Canada's FBI-equivalent) got involved and shut their investigation under a tight lock. That, unfortunately, gives us almost nothing to work with. Whether they're just as puzzled as us or have long solved the case, I have no idea. What I //do// know, though, is that within a week, every single outlet that had previously been following the story completely dropped it. Within a year, no one was talking about it anymore at all.\n\n\n\nMy own efforts to unravel this mystery \u2014 or, at least, //write// about it \u2014 have been mostly fruitless. No missing persons cases across Canada or the US even remotely match her description. No one's come forward online claiming to have known her. Her car has no prior sightings or records associated with the license plate. Barely anyone even //mentions// the case anymore, even the content farms that pump out true crime stories. Dead end after dead end.\n\n\n\nWas she from a parallel universe? Was the cult? Did the cult's ritual somehow partially summon her into existence? Why? Is the government involved? Is the victim a foreign government agent, attempting to infiltrate some random Yukon town? Did //she// even know how she got there? Did the fact it happen on Christmas have anything to do with it at all?\n\n\n\nI have no idea. Truthfully, I don't think we'll ever really know. The whole thing reeks of conspiracy or a supernatural phenomenon. Whatever the case may be, we can only hope that she's at peace now, whoever she was.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 12/25/24 (WED) 14:25:29 #94926943\n\n----\n\n\n\nBut that's not really a satisfying ending, and I wouldn't leave you all with nothing of substance to chew on.\n\n\n\nAbout a year after I initially shelved this post, a friend of mine \u2014 who wishes to remain anonymous \u2014 told me they were taking a trip through the Yukon. I remembered this case, and asked them if they'd do some ground research for me. They said yes.\n\n\n\nI wish I could say they cracked the case open, but all I've got is more questions. Still, I think the questions are different enough to make this case worth sharing now.\n\n\n\nTo start off, some newspaper clippings in the local library reveal the ultimate fate of Ms. Polley: first-degree murder, kidnapping, and property theft charges, incurring a life sentence. That feels a little overkill to me personally, especially since we don't even know who the victim is or how she died. But, I'm not Canadian, so who can say. \n\n\n\nHer current whereabouts are unknown, though presumably she's behind bars.\n\n\n\nA different clipping \u2014 buried deep in the library's archives \u2014 reveals more about the cult site itself, though I don't know how much it illuminates. There were several urns containing ground-up bones, crow feathers, and other cult-adjacent items. There was a single burnt Polaroid, though it was too damaged to be legible.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most baffling, though, were several license plates, road signs, and other similar landmark items stolen from the aforementioned Sign Post Forest, scattered around the area. All of them seem to have had the names of places they were from removed, almost seamlessly. No clue what to make of that, personally.\n\n\n\nAfter that, my friend didn't seem to make much further progress. Asking the townsfolk was mostly a dead end; no one knew anything more than we did, in spite of the fact that it happened in that very same town. \n\n\n\nThere was still one more lead that we wanted to follow through on, though: Laura Chance is still alive. She lives in the same three bedroom home, alone, twenty-five years later. She is currently eighty-seven, though is \u2014 from what I'm told \u2014 in relatively good health.\n\n\n\nWhen they met, she invited my friend inside for tea, and they had a pleasant chat.

She continues to be controversial to this day: some see her as a charming folk antihero, while others see her as a devious criminal who sought to undermine reality as we know it. The truth, found in her letters to and from her creator, lies somewhere in the middle. Molly Roger was a <em>complicated</em> figure, one whose steadfast belief in adventure and independence lead her to extremism.</p>\n<p>Roger Molly conjured Molly Roger into the Dreamscape accidentally, presumably while daydreaming. At the time, Roger was working as a bankteller in London, seemingly unaware of his own abilities.

Molly Joan Roger, conjured in June of 1845, is one of the most well-known psychic projections worldwide, and an early example of a projection given physical form.\n\n\n\nMuch like the flesh-and-blood pirates she was based on, Molly Roger was feared by some and beloved by others.\u00a0\u00a0She continues to be controversial to this day: some see her as a charming folk antihero, while others see her as a devious criminal who sought to undermine reality as we know it. The truth, found in her letters to and from her creator, lies somewhere in the middle.\u00a0\u00a0Molly Roger was a //complicated// figure, one whose steadfast belief in adventure and independence lead her to extremism.\n\n\n\nRoger Molly conjured Molly Roger into the Dreamscape accidentally, presumably while daydreaming. At the time, Roger was working as a bankteller in London, seemingly unaware of his own abilities. In letters to his elder sister Ruth, Roger shares his perspective as he discovers his powers and gets to know his own creation.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"estrella-paper verso\"]]\n\n\n\n+++++ From //Letters from Molly Roger://\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"eo\"]]Dearest Ruth,\n\n\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health, and your husband and boys in high spirits.\n\n\n\nI am pleased to say the bank has been light on trouble, and that the Summer sun has brought my favorite blueberries to market yet again. I am unsettled, however, that the ghost of a pirate appears to be haunting my dreams.\n\n\n\nHer name and temperament are the inverse of mine. She calls herself Molly Roger, scourge of the seas, and she carries herself with impossible merriment and ... enviable figure. She wants something of me. I know not what. In each of my dreams for a fortnight now, she has appeared, small, distant, yet everpresent, calling to me her own name as if it were my own. These are pleasant dreams, but they have been ceaseless. I catch myself wondering if Molly Roger is in some way real.\n\n\n\nYour husband works in academia.

She has carried me on many misadventures now within the world of Dreams, stealing letters from the alphabet and borders from nations.

In the past years, the buildup of filth in Pierre had been getting worse and worse, and the SCP Foundation had procured a lucrative contract with the city to clean it up.</p>\n<p>The janitors themselves, however, were not as pleased with this. The carcass's decaying flesh stank to high hell, and its exposed bones jutted out at awkward angles. Dee stared at it with disgust, and they could've sworn it was staring back with its empty eyes. It was fascinating, in a morbid sort of way.</p>\n<p>\"What the hell is this thing doing here anyway? Why would there be a <em>sea</em> monster in a <em>lake</em>?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, whatever it is, I want it gone by the hour. Dee, Gears, get shoveling.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmph,\" Dee grumbled. \"This is absolutely <em>disgusting</em>.\" They pulled out their shovel and turned to Gears, when they heard a growl from behind them.</p>\n<p>\"Moose, was that your stomach? I told you not to skip lunch!\"</p>\n<p>Moose was not behind them, as they had gone to the truck to get their custom-made fifteen-foot-long plastic bag for the dead behemoth. The only thing that <em>was</em> behind Dee was the massive animal's corpse, flies buzzing around it. Dee looked closer and realized that it had moved. <em>No\u2014 it couldn't have. It's just some dead animal,</em> they thought. <em>Did it?</em></p>\n<p>\"Hey, Gears, did you see that?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you referring to?\" Gears responded. He was staring blankly out at the lake, avoiding eye contact with the carcass.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Never mind. Just help me get rid of this mess so we can get out of here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Right. I suppose I should be taking notes.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Safe Cleanup Protocol:</strong> Object must be cleaned up as soon as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Description:</strong> Object is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"It's dead. Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.</p>\n<p>\"Are we <em>sure</em> it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't include that information for a reason. Having been employed at the Foundation for three years, one's expectations may not necessarily align with reality when it comes to cleaning operations,\" Gears remarked.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't be silly, guys,\" Moose replied, putting their disposable gloves on. \"It may look creepy but it really is just some dead animal. Now, let's get shoveling,\"</p>\n<p>With that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening <em>squelch.</em> Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"</p>\n<p>Moose looked up. \"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Like it's still alive?</p>\n<p>\"Well, yeah.\"</p>\n<p>Moose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it\u2014 it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"</p>\n<p>The last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones.

The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air. The groaning of the fallen behemoth drew in air to colossal, decaying lungs with a dreadful moan that made Dee wince; still, they were frozen in horror as they gazed upon their hard work unwrapping itself like a burrito of flesh and tissue.

In the past years, the buildup of filth in Pierre had been getting worse and worse, and the SCP Foundation had procured a lucrative contract with the city to clean it up. \n\n\n\nThe janitors themselves, however, were not as pleased with this. The carcass's decaying flesh stank to high hell, and its exposed bones jutted out at awkward angles. Dee stared at it with disgust, and they could've sworn it was staring back with its empty eyes. It was fascinating, in a morbid sort of way.\n\n\n\n\"What the hell is this thing doing here anyway? Why would there be a //sea// monster in a //lake//?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, whatever it is, I want it gone by the hour. Dee, Gears, get shoveling.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmph,\" Dee grumbled. \"This is absolutely //disgusting//.\" They pulled out their shovel and turned to Gears, when they heard a growl from behind them.\n\n\n\n\"Moose, was that your stomach? I told you not to skip lunch!\"\n\n\n\nMoose was not behind them, as they had gone to the truck to get their custom-made fifteen-foot-long plastic bag for the dead behemoth. The only thing that //was// behind Dee was the massive animal's corpse, flies buzzing around it. Dee looked closer and realized that it had moved. //No-- it couldn't have. It's just some dead animal,// they thought. //Did it?//\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Gears, did you see that?\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you referring to?\" Gears responded. He was staring blankly out at the lake, avoiding eye contact with the carcass.\n\n\n\n\"...Never mind. Just help me get rid of this mess so we can get out of here.\"\n\n\n\n\"Right. I suppose I should be taking notes.\"\n\n\n\n> ##green|**Safe Cleanup Protocol:** Object must be cleaned up as soon as possible.##\n\n> \n\n> ##green|**Description:** Object is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin.##\n\n\n\n\"It's dead. Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.\n\n\n\n\"Are we //sure// it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't include that information for a reason. Having been employed at the Foundation for three years, one's expectations may not necessarily align with reality when it comes to cleaning operations,\" Gears remarked.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, don't be silly, guys,\" Moose replied, putting their disposable gloves on. \"It may look creepy but it really is just some dead animal. Now, let's get shoveling,\"\n\n\n\nWith that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening //squelch.// Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"\n\n\n\nMoose looked up. \"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Like it's still alive? \n\n\n\n\"Well, yeah.\"\n\n\n\nMoose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it-- it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"\n\n\n\nThe last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones. The stench emanating from the creature's mouth made Dee regret having eaten lunch a couple hours prior. Nonetheless, ignoring the stink and the low growling that Moose was so sure was normal, Dee shoveled the last of it into the plastic bag, and Gears tied it shut.\n\n\n\n\"Alright, well done team,\" said Moose. \"Pat yourselves on the back-- preferably after taking your gloves off. I'll call the city and tell them we're done here.\" \n\n\n\nJust as Moose was about to dial in the number for the local authorities, the bag began to shake. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck?\" exclaimed Dee.\n\n\n\n\"It appears our specimen may still have some life in it after all,\" Gears replied.\n\n\n\n\"Ew, shit, get away from it!\" Dee slowly backed away from the bag, which was twitching violently, shaking and rattling as if the lifeless remains of the creature were fighting to escape their prison. The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air.

Fritz watched his father Fred Williams carefully coax it into the harness, and saw it slightly calm as its legs elevated, its stomach suspended in a sling.</p>\n<p>The offending foot raised to the eyeline, Fritz's father applied the starting grinder, to level the hoof and lay its cavities and fault lines bare. The hoof horn was far too pliant, its environs far too moist for far too long. Fritz's father applied the hoof-knife carefully. There was as much danger in too-flexible horn as there was in a blunt knife; it is far too easy to go too far.</p>\n<p>And as five-year-old Fritz peered around the back end of the harness in curiosity, the shit began to fall.</p>\n<p>The spray licked over his face like fire.

He poured it over his face, scrubbing the filth away with his other hand. A torrent of water. A trickle. Only when the water stopped dripping did he toss the bottle into the chemical-stinking toilet and open his eyes.</p>\n<p>Eyes still stinging, he looked at his dirty reflection in the puddle on the floor and saw his five-year-old self inside.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Five-year-old Fritz turned away from the mirror. He heard whispers outside, blaming his father for keeping his focus on the bull and not making sure his son was all right. He crept out of the bathroom, hair still dripping and face still red from his lavations. He looked down at the bottle on the edge of the sink and anxiety crossed his face. He walked in the direction of the harness, clutching his father's water bottle the whole way.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>35-year old Fritz looked down into the chemical toilet. He reached his arm in up to the shoulder. Finally, he pulled out the sewage-filled bottle. It was old and thin plastic, covered in rictus cracks, never meant to last more than a day. He traced the seams in the duct tape that kept it together.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was just the port-a-potty fumes he was breathing, but Fritz felt an unmistakable connection to that day so many years ago.</p>\n<p>He went back through his mind's eye. The construction and demolition tools in his truck. The widths of the building's doors. The patterns of the Thing's movement. Never resolving until he looked, like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\u2026</p>\n<p>And he pushed open the chemical toilet door, and closed his eyes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Five-year-old Fritz crested the hill and stopped when he saw what his father was doing.</p>\n<p>Fred Williams placed his hand on the bull's nose. He whispered to it softly, caressing its head and flanks. Finally, he knelt back down, tilted back his head, and closed his eyes in a wide smile, as if offering an opportunity for a second kick.</p>\n<p>And the bull kicked Fred again. He fell back and cursed. The kick was made less by the harness, but it still hurt. Fritz rushed to him down the hill and offered him the water bottle.</p>\n<p>Fred took the water bottle, and, rubbing his own neck, offered it to the bull. The bull grasped it in its jaws. Water fell frothing from its mouth as it drank. At last it dropped the bottle and offered its hoof once more.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>35-year-old Fritz crawled through the abandoned building, his eyes firmly shut. He heard the scraping of concrete all around him. He continued his blind journey.</p>\n<p>Leaving the building, Fritz at last opened his eyes. He stumbled to his truck, opened the side compartments, and pulled out the hammer, the chisel, and the hose. He looked back at the door of the building. The Thing stood behind it, far too big to fit through. And deathly still.</p>\n<p>Fritz approached the Thing in the doorway. He ran his hand over its concrete hide and brushed away some of the caked effluence. Deep within it echoed a tremble.</p>\n<p>He told it what he was going to do, step by step. With the hose, he filled the bottle with clean water once more, and poured it over the Thing's clogged concrete pores. Again and again he did this, interspersing with a pressurized hose spray, until the water ran clean down its body.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fred took back his knife and commenced carving the hoof again. He squeezed various areas until he heard pain, and then focused his carving there. His scraping uncovered a small hole from which stinking liquid sprayed out, and the bull groaned in relief, the pressure in the cavity finally relieved.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fritz tapped his chisel all over the Thing until he felt it shudder, and began his chiseling there. It was tough work, and concrete dust flew out and up into his lungs, but a spray of the hose here and there helped it coagulate on the ground. He tapped into a cavity from which putrescence flowed, and rinsed it out. The shuddering of the concrete switched frequency; the rattling was now a purr.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fred exposed the whole of the hoof-horn cavity to the light. The unnatural hollow could trap no more blood or mud where it could bother the bull. He made sure to leave enough horn on the outer edge to support the bull's weight, and he glued on a block to keep the weight off the sensitive hollow until the hoof grew back. When the glue had set, he released the bull from the harness and backed away.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow the neck injury he was ignoring would land him a several month stay in the hospital, worsened by the delay in treatment.

Did you see my water bottle anywhere?\"\n\n\n\nThe bloodshot bull limped in the right foreleg, but it quivered with energy and pain. Fritz watched his father Fred Williams carefully coax it into the harness, and saw it slightly calm as its legs elevated, its stomach suspended in a sling.\n\n\n\nThe offending foot raised to the eyeline, Fritz's father applied the starting grinder, to level the hoof and lay its cavities and fault lines bare. The hoof horn was far too pliant, its environs far too moist for far too long. Fritz's father applied the hoof-knife carefully. There was as much danger in too-flexible horn as there was in a blunt knife; it is far too easy to go too far.\n\n\n\nAnd as five-year-old Fritz peered around the back end of the harness in curiosity, the shit began to fall.\n\n\n\nThe spray licked over his face like fire. His caked eyes stung and watered, and as he fell back screaming, it entered his mouth. Too much for him. Too much for the bull, the screaming.\n\n\n\nThe bull squirmed in the harness. It kicked, as much as its uplifted legs would allow, as it swung fore and aft, and hit Fritz's father in the neck. He fell back amid a clattering of his instruments, and the last Fritz knew before he was taken away, the bull still roared.\n\n\n\n------\n\n+ 2003\n\n\n\nFritz was there when the shit was a tidal wave.\n\n\n\nHis whole clique was there with him, surveying the site cheap enough for his new company's needs. An old Prometheus building Anna Scranton assured him was a real fixer-upper, only needing nineteen separate EPA Superfund operations to make it habitable.\n\n\n\nThe shipping container stood in the center of the warehouse, angled seventeen degrees from the wall.

The politicians said it was a waste of money we could have spent on more guns, planes, bombs. The media only saw the collateral damage - the skyscrapers sheared in half and the container ships crushed like soda cans. The environmentalists pointed at its corpse and said that the consequences of its blood leaking into the soil could be catastrophic, taint the seas for generations to come.</p>\n<p>The day the Dragonslayer fell, the world stopped being afraid of dragons, and decided they didn't need us anymore.</p>\n<p>They were wrong, of course. They always are.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\">\u2014 Fleet Admiral Torvald Halbaum, Global Occult Coalition (Project Armada CO)</span></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fifteen years ago, a monsoon making its way up the California coast was unthinkable. But a lot has changed in fifteen years.</p>\n<p>The tempest settles over San Francisco under the cover of night. Gale-force winds pick up, whipping sheets of rain onto the asphalt \u2014 the trees go from bending and swaying to being snapped in two and dragged into the air. Klaxons scream to an audience of none at every empty traffic intersection. For a dirty moment, San Francisco holds its breath. Most people are crouched with their loved ones in attics and closets. The public emergency shelters are full of people packed like sardines, listening to the storm rage aboveground. The faithful have prayer books, the paranoid have canned food, and General Sarah Jung has a job to do.</p>\n<p>She's sitting in her office, tastefully decorated and blessedly soundproofed. She is idly sipping at a small cup of Earl Grey tea. If she had windows, they'd look out over the bay in turmoil as the storm made its slow, violent advance into the city. But no \u2014 the office is all mahogany paneling and steel accents, monitors hanging from the walls. The largest, on the far wall and the size of a whiteboard, shows a live satellite map of the West Coast, stretching from Baja to Vancouver. A large red dot hangs off the coast of California. The map updates, and the dot ticks another inch closer to San Francisco. General Sarah Jung finishes her tea and rises, striding out of the office into the command center.</p>\n<p>The Block is an ugly blight on the San Francisco skyline. A featureless gray metal rectangle 150 feet tall, one side dominated by a massive set of hangar doors that go nearly all the way up. It sticks out like a sore, hypoxic thumb, and no one enjoys its presence. As of five hours and twelve minutes ago, it is the most important building in the city. Most of it is empty space inside, for obvious reasons. But the topmost three floors are dedicated to data \u2014 this the brain. The nervous system that the GOC has draped across the western seaboard terminates here, in this room. It is some cross between NASA\u2019s mission control and an aircraft carrier\u2019s combat information center; stepped rows of terminals arranged in concentric circles.</p>\n<p>General Jung has called all hands on deck; every terminal is occupied by an operator in blue fatigues and a headset, dutifully analyzing the information stream at it comes in, speaking into their microphones. As the door to her office opens and she steps out, a cloud forms around her of analysts trying to get her attention, tablets of readings and maps being waved in her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral, the Air Force has authorized air support from Fort Bragg\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014 trying to reestablish radio contact with the advance ships outside the bay, they\u2019re\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cTyphoon is six klicks away from the Black Line, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>That last one is the only important one.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny changes in trajectory?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNegative, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s only getting faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>She acknowledges it with a swift nod but doesn\u2019t stop walking, and the cloud follows her. The center of the room is dominated by a massive, holographic display of the earth, slowly spinning; a number of dots are marked out, most colored green or yellow and drifting comfortably in the deep ocean, far from any shores. A single, ugly red dot hangs nearly on top of San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Jung stops walking when she reaches one terminal. She looks over the top of the monitor at the analyst behind it; a dark-skinned young man, a laser-focused attentiveness dancing in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSergeant Mallory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d Those eyes don\u2019t leave the screen to meet hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a room full of analysts who could give you a detailed breakdown of the probabilities at play here. Ma\u2019am. And they\u2019ll all tell you that past incidents tell us there\u2019s a 73.4% chance that Typhoon will turn around before it enters the Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She could reprimand him for that, but both of them know she won\u2019t. A perfectly-manicured finger comes down on the head of the Godzilla bobblehead on his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is in poor taste?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer to focus on the actual conflicts as opposed to the imagined ones, ma\u2019am.\u201d The ghost of a smile dances on his lips. He knows he\u2019s getting away with a lot right now; the circumstances allow some latitude.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen quit futzing around and tell me what <em>you</em> think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTyphoon isn\u2019t violent by nature. He hasn\u2019t come within fifty kilometers of the city in ten years. When he does get close, the high-frequency soundbursts make him turn around just fine; this is uncharacteristic. I think the storm has something to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Black Line is forty kilometers out from the city. He\u2019s six away from breaching it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour now,\u201d an aide chimes in.</p>\n<p>Jung crosses her arms. \u201cSo he\u2019s never gotten this close before. I know that already. I\u2019m asking what <em>you</em> think we should do, as someone who\u2019s been watching his movements a lot longer than I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mallory looked up at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking if you should give the scramble order or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>This gives him pause. He stops looking at the screen, leans back, lost in thought. Then, a few seconds later, he returns, and finally looks up at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Typhoon\u2019s not turning around. I think you should given it five minutes ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns on her heel and gives a sharp nod to one of the warrant officers standing by the wall. He flicks a switch next to him; the dome light overhead turns green. Outside, the keen-eyed can hear a distinct shift in the sirens across the city; going from a low, warning droning to an active air-raid warbling.</p>\n<p>Inside, the General\u2019s voice overpowers it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAttention! We\u2019ve been lucky enough to avoid this situation so far. But that means many of you have only worked on training exercises before. This is not a training exercise; everything about this situation is real, including the lives riding on your shoulders today. Don\u2019t ignore that weight. Feel it. Let it remind you what you\u2019re fighting for today.\u201d</p>\n<p>A familiar rumbling begins to shake the building from underfoot. A few of the soldiers look pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo minutes to launch. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A god fell into the sea in 1998.</p>\n<p>We were told to dredge her corpse and dispose of her. Her mission was over; the Crocosquid was a charred husk lying on a beach a few kilometers away. But it was a pyrrhic victory. Too much damage. Too much exertion. Firing the Sun Vent that incinerated LSA-Brasil-01 had nearly destroyed the Dragonslayer too.</p>\n<p>But we won. That was what mattered to the Foundation\u2019s Council, to the public. Maybe we lost the greatest weapon humanity had ever created, but in the end, we won. The remaining LSAs were docile, avoiding populated areas and preferring to stay in the open ocean. We were safe, we could begin to rebuild. Ease the belt on a war economy. Make it so that maybe our kids could live in a world like the one we grew up in.</p>\n<p>But the second nastiest thing about superweapons is that they have a function in peacetime too. No one knows when war will come to your shores. No one could guarantee that something wouldn\u2019t drive the kaiju back into animalistic fury. That there wasn\u2019t another crocosquid somewhere out there, slumbering in an undersea crevasse, waiting for her chance to come to the surface for round two. We barely won last time. And the GOC doesn\u2019t take chances.</p>\n<p>So maybe we were handed orders from D\u00fcsseldorf not to melt down the parts of 5514 that we pulled from the sea floor. Maybe we lied to the Foundation, said more components of the Dragonslayer were unrecoverable than we first estimated. Maybe they were packed up, shipped off to a score of blacksites across the world to be replicated and reconstructed. Maybe, not three months after the war ended, we were already preparing for the next one.</p>\n<p>Hm? Oh, yes. The other nastiest things about superweapons: you can never just have one.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\">\u2014 Commander Hans Demwar, Operation ANGLER GREEN (SCP-5514 Recovery and Disposal) CO</span></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Chris braced himself against the railing. The waves were so violent it took both hands to keep him steady, and he was completely soaked to the bone even through two ponchos, his high-vis vest pulled over top. But like everyone else, he had a job to do tonight.</p>\n<p>His little tugboat was just a lookout. They were moored right near the entrance to the San Francisco bay, starboard side facing the open waters of the Pacific. Every floodlight on the ship was on, providing some meager visibility. Really, the most it did was make sure he was visible to the other four ships he could see doing the same across the waters.</p>\n<p>The rain was becoming a problem; the radar dish on top of the wheelhouse had been damaged, making communication with Command inconsistent and unreliable. The most they could get through were static-filled messages, and the storm was giving so much interference that satellite communication was struggling too.</p>\n<p>He cursed out loud to no one in particular. Then his thoughts were broken by a sound cutting through the sturmundrang; a low, shrill howl, like a mournful whale\u2019s call. For a split second, it pierced through the thunder and waves, then fell below again. He froze, wide-eyed, for a second \u2014 then nearly slipped as another crashing wave hit the side of the ship.</p>\n<p>Scrabbling to the railing to pull himself up, he yanked the binoculars from around his neck and to his eyes. Total darkness, of course. Shaking fingers scrabbled across their surface until he found the dial and flicked it. Suddenly, everything was cast in shades of white and grey; active night-vision. He cast his vision left-to-right, trying to get a bead on anything except an endless sea of grey waves and black sky. Nothing. Nothing. Noth\u2014 wait.</p>\n<p>He did a double-take, bringing his sight back to that spot and staring directly at it. Ten seconds passed, then thirty. He was about to pass it off as a trick of the eye, then\u2014</p>\n<p>His eyes widened.</p>\n<p>Even from this distance, it was gargantuan. Some cross between a lizard and a seal, breaching gracefully out of the water like a whale, accompanied by that same mournful, shrill cry. It hung in the air for a second before crashing back down under the waves.</p>\n<p>Struggling violently, he grabbed ahold of his radio, shouting into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Unit-3 Calloway! I have eyes on LSA-Typhoon-01, 290\u2014 no, 292 west-by-northwest! Moving actively towards the Black Line!\u201d</p>\n<p>Static on the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p>\n<p>Another wave shook the ship, no doubt the wake of the Typhoon\u2019s re-entry. Chris abandoned the railing, racing around the ship as fast as he could, trying to get to the satellite phone on the other side. Maybe, just maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>He froze. He was on the port side now, staring back at the San Francisco skyline. And there was something there.</p>\n<p>It was hard to see, cast into silhouette by the lights of the city. But it was big. It was humanoid. And it was moving. Logically, he knew there was only one thing it could be, but he kept staring. He kept staring as it progressed from slow, unsteady steps to a confident stride, then into long, loping dashes, throwing up water from the bay as it ran towards him. He stared at it right up until it was nearly on top of the ship.</p>\n<p>And then, finally, it was cast in sharp relief. A well-armored mech two hundred feet tall, painted in sharp maroon, blades portruding from each hand. Its \u2018face\u2019 was dominated by a single red circle. He watched it in slow motion as it leapt, jumped entirely over his ship, and slammed clear on the other side, never so much as stopping its charge.</p>\n<p>The radio crackled to life, breaking through the static for a single moment as he watched its back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll advance ships, be advised: Black Suit Voodoo Ranger is on scene and actively engaging LSA-Typhoon-01. Stay out of the way.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Voodoo Ranger was the first and best of the Dragonslayer\u2019s children.</p>\n<p>We recovered what we could, of course, but the issues were immediate. If we transported that much hardware to one location, the Foundation would immediately realize. So we had to spread it out. The Plasma Wristblade ended up in Sydney. The ESA landed in Sri Lanka. Et cetera. The result was that every Black Suit was vastly divergent in design, each molded around a different organ from their mother, operating on different strategies and excelling in different situations.</p>\n<p>But San Francisco was the largest city in close proximity to the most LSAs, and as such, we received the lion\u2019s share of original Dragonslayer components. It took years to get them back in working condition and miniaturize them. Funding was a constant battle, as was keeping it quiet from the Foundation. But PTOLEMY has the best scientists in the world. We got the job done.</p>\n<p>The other suits might have their unique talents or specializations, but Voodoo Ranger is the only one built from SCP-5514\u2019s bones and organs. The armor plating was smelted down and reforged. The original computer systems were reincorporated at every opportunity. The weapons were refitted for a suit half the size of the original.

Repeat, can you hear me, Captain Rosales?\u201d</p>\n<p>The radio inside Castor\u2019s helmet finally broke through the static.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, not loud and clear, but I can hear you. Think I might be through the interference zone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hanging from his harness inside the head of the mech, he pushed his legs, the suit reading his movements and sending the physical data into the computers that dispersed them to the thousands of servos throughout the Black Suit. The delay was nearly nonexistent; the suit moved in perfect time with him. The camera feeds around the \u2018head\u2019 were wired directly into the helmet\u2019s visor; he saw the sea around him. The overall effect was that the mech was an extension of his body, of himself.</p>\n<p>Another leap over another ship, spraying water everywhere. He was a warrior in a billion-dollar war machine; he was a kid in a pool.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a training exercise, Captain Rosales. Don\u2019t take any risks you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Typhoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLast known location is about four-point-five klicks from your current position, seven degrees south of your current heading.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castor pivoted his head, scanning the roiling waters. Nothing. He thought \u2018infrared\u2019, and his visor lit up in shades of blues and purple, with a decided lack of red or orange.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s coldblooded; if he\u2019s underwater, infrared won\u2019t help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t sass me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ignored her, turning off infrared mode and going back to his naked eye. Typhoon was a big bastard; he <em>should</em> be able to see\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p>\n<p>Castor stumbled forward, an impact shaking the Black Suit. He felt it transmitted as tiny vibrations all across his skin; haptic feedback, critical to his synchronicity with Voodoo Ranger. He needed to feel everything the suit felt, and right now, he felt like he\u2019d been punched in the back.</p>\n<p>Kicking his leg out and spinning onto his heel, he did a 180, facing whatever had shoved him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, hello, ugly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Typhoon was some disgusting cross between the body shape of a komodo dragon with the skin and blubber of a seal and the face of a moray eel. It was standing on his back two webbed feet, the front pair hovering in front of it. Castor couldn\u2019t be sure, but he felt the expression on its face could only be of surprise as his six-ton hand come around, catching it directly in the jaw. It bellowed in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it go for the water!\u201d</p>\n<p>Prophetically, its next move was to drop like a rock, diving back into the waves \u2014 or it least, it tried to. Still half-kneeling, Castor wrapped his other hand around its neck, yanking it back up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he grunted into the radio as it writhed violently, trying to flop itself free.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as its on its feet, you\u2019re fighting on your turf. Don\u2019t let it get into the water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides that!\u201d He slammed another fist into its head, inciting another pained bellowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the past, Typhoon\u2019s proven susceptible to prolonged physical trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took a second for the phrase to register. \u201cYou mean beat the shit out of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I mean beat the shit out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWilc\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His response was cut off. Finally sick of the chokehold, Typhoon lunged, biting those massive jaws down. Castor jerked his hand back, but not fast enough. The huge toothed jaws caught the suit\u2019s forearm, trying to rip it off. His other fist came around, smashing the back of the monster\u2019s skull, but not hard enough to dislodge its hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cPiece of shit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVent your exhaust through the upper ports!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p>\n<p>He thought, and it was so. Typhoon jerked back violently, releasing the grip on the forearm that was now suddenly spewing skin-meltingly hot exhaust gases through a series of vent ports.</p>\n<p>\u201cHandy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sure is. Now go beat the shit out of that lizard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castor lunged, catching the still-confused sea beast with a glancing blow. The blades on his arms extended, slashing the soft underbelly. It bellowed in pain again, but this time with an edge of rage to it. Blood spilled out; Castor was sure that if it was morning, he would see the water turning into a frothing red maelstrom. Looking up, Typhoon roared, a guttural sound audible even inside the suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I made it mad!\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have time to hear the response, because Typhoon lunged right back, claws now fully extended as it hammered blows onto Ranger\u2019s armor. The claws were sharp and strong enough to leave gouges in the plating. Castor jerked as his pain receptors lit up; it was psychosomatic, but it still hurt like a bitch.</p>\n<p><em>Time to fight fire with fire.</em></p>\n<p>He willed his blades to extend. They telescoped forward, going from his forearm to extending past his arms, and he brought them crashing down on Typhoon\u2019s head, forcing it underwater.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep his head underwater if you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? He\u2019s a fish!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a reptile, you idiot! He doesn\u2019t have gills, he still needs to breathe!\u201d</p>\n<p>Castor obeyed, putting his weight down onto the monster\u2019s head. It only took a few seconds for Typhoon to start thrashing, before suddenly stopping.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2014 WOAH!\u201d</p>\n<p>Typhoon rocketed forward, trying to pull his captor down with him. Castor braced his legs, pulling on Typhoon\u2019s neck like an angler on the line. His jaw strained, and sweat beaded on his brow inside the helmet.</p>\n<p>Then he suddenly pushed. The jets on each elbow fired in a short burst, giving him the momentum he needed to slam the monster\u2019s head against the sea floor, momentarily dazing it. Then he yanked it back onto its feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cCastor\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot now!\u201d</p>\n<p>He slammed another punch into its gut, and then another into its head. That soft underbelly was still bleeding into the surrounding water, illuminated by the lightning flickering overhead.</p>\n<p><em>You like that, you big piece of shit?</em></p>\n<p>One more shove, sending Typhoon stumbling backward, clutching its head almost comically. It wasn\u2019t fighting back; that meant he was winning, right? It\u2019d be retreating any second now. Maybe a few more to really hammer in the lesson.</p>\n<p>He lunged, hitting it in the jaw with an uppercut. He didn\u2019t notice the strange flickering on its spines.</p>\n<p>\u201cCastor!\u201d</p>\n<p>He wrapped a massive hand against one of its arms, pinning it back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go of it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in her voice made him obey without questioning for once. But he wasn\u2019t fast enough; one hand was still grazing against Typhoon\u2019s skin when the entire sky suddenly lit up. Castor shut his eyes reflexively, but he still saw the lightning bolt smash directly into Typhoon\u2019s open-mouthed head. The monster groaned, lighting up in patterns of blue and yellow for a split second as energy poured out of it.</p>\n<p>The entire suit was launched backward a hundred feet from the pure force of it, landing with a stumble on its ass.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2014 the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castor looked up, his helmet visor screaming alarms at him as his systems rebooted. Comms was one of the first to come back online as he struggled to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when the fuck can it do that?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has to be the storm!\u201d</p>\n<p>Seemed plausible. Typhoon\u2019s skin was decorating in electrifying patterns, like a bolt snaking across the sky. Its spines danced with energy. It bellowed again, daring him to try \u2014 and as it did, he could see the blue energy in its gullet.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow am I supposed to hit it without touching it?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFigure something out!\u201d</p>\n<p>Voodoo Ranger finally struggled to its feet just as Typhoon began to bumrush him, carving a path as it half-ran-half-swam through the water. Castor threw himself out of the way of the charge; the jets on his legs swiveled and fired, thrusting him in the right direction to miss Typhoon by just a few feet.</p>\n<p>He pivoted back, trying to put distance between them. Typhoon was completely different now; skin glowing with energy, pushing aggressively where it had been cowardly just a few minutes ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p>\n<p>He could hear the tension on the other end.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it was constantly releasing charge, the water around you would be electrified, but it\u2019s not. That means it\u2019s a controlled release.\u201d</p>\n<p>He dodged out of the way again as Typhoon lunged with another bite.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how do I make sure it doesn\u2019t release into <em>me?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Another lightning strike, but this one didn\u2019t connect with Typhoon. Just lit up the sky in cold blue light, letting Castor see just how violent the waves they were knee-deep in were becoming. And letting him see an opening.</p>\n<p>Typhoon was waving its arms up and down, no doubt trying to appear bigger. But that revealed a tiny soft spot in its hard, leathery skin right near the armpit. Before he could think, Castor lunged forward, jets thrusting the two-hundred-foot machine ahead.</p>\n<p>\u201cCastor, don\u2019t!\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Too late.</p>\n<p>His bladed fist connected with the soft skin, and sank through it like butter through a knife. Typhoon roared again, an animal, guttural noise of pain, and writhed. Then its head turned down to look at its aggressor.</p>\n<p>Castor knew it couldn\u2019t see into the cockpit, but for a moment, it felt like they saw each other. Then he noticed a telltale blue crackling in the reptile\u2019s eyes, and his own widened. Typhoon\u2019s skin lit up as electricity poured out of it and into Voodoo Ranger. Castor couldn\u2019t hear the alarms going off over the sound of his own screaming, and then he didn\u2019t hear anything at all.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Black Suits were built around anomalies. Compare that to the White and Orange suits; they utilized paratechnology, but that\u2019s not the same thing. Paratechnology refers to technology that we approximately understand the workings of, even if modern science doesn\u2019t. Anomalies exist outside that understanding. We were desperate for any advantage against LSA-Brasil, and so we deployed weapons we didn\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the Black Suits exhibit\u2026 quirks. Things that don\u2019t quite make sense, given what we know about their construction and components. Things that make some of the engineers nervous to work on them. Sometimes Voodoo Ranger\u2019s servos twitch without anyone piloting it. Sometimes the cameras in the hangar will mysteriously turn off in the wee hours of the night. Sometimes the training pilots report faint voices in the cockpit.</p>\n<p>Nothing has ever been confirmed, obviously. We\u2019d have to ground the entire fleet; twenty Black Suits, the thin line between humanity and the monsters, suddenly unable to defend us in case a kaiju decides it\u2019s hungry. We\u2019d be left defenseless, and every single man working on Project Armada knows that.</p>\n<p>So no, nothing\u2019s ever been confirmed.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\">\u2014 Colonel James Meyel, Black Suit Training Officer (VOODOO RANGER)</span></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Castor couldn\u2019t feel where his body ended and the abyss began.</p>\n<p>He was still wearing his suit, he was pretty sure; the visor clouded his vision. But he didn\u2019t feel tethered. He lifted a hand, and glided forward through the black emptiness. This was nice. This was safe.</p>\n<p>He leaned back. He could get used to this. There was nothing here, but that also meant nothing to hurt him. No pain.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t sure how long he floated before he heard the voice. A familiar, warm voice, like honey on toast. He\u2019d heard it before, but he wasn\u2019t sure where.</p>\n<p>\u201cWake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He groaned in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sleeping on the job, hun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re blowing it out there, darling. This is what you wanted to do, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Could\u2019ve had a cushy job as a Foundation nepo baby. Mommy and Daddy saved the world, you could\u2019ve made Site Director by thirty just off their coattails.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why you came running when the GOC called jangling the keys to a Black Suit. A chance to make your own legacy, the same way your parents did. You have that chance now, and you\u2019re wasting it floating around, hun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t saving the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t. But it\u2019s still saving a city of millions. You\u2019re young; you have plenty of time to work your way up to saving the world. What are you gonna do? Let a bunch of families die because they\u2019re not the whole world.\u201d</p>\n<p>He snapped, an annoyed twinge in his voice. \u201cWho the hell are you, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know who I am, hun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you know what you need to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 What if I lose? What if I disappoint them?\u201d</p>\n<p>This got a laugh from the voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna lose, hun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m right beside you, stupid. And I didn\u2019t lose to the Crocosquid, what makes you think I\u2019m gonna lose to a shrimpy lizard-seal? Now get going, you have a fight to win.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Castor screamed himself back awake.</p>\n<p>The electricity was still coursing through the body of the Black Suit \u2014 but it was different. It was burning without being agonizing, flowing through every servo of the mech, raw unfiltered energy filling every atom of its being. It was like being on fire without the pain.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t bother answering the radio hail before he sank his other blade into Typhoon\u2019s other arm. The lizard\u2019s mouth was agape, and its skin was losing its luster. Voodoo Ranger was draining the energy out of it, taking it into itself. The beast screamed, and Castor screamed back, slamming his fists into its jaw again and again and again. It buckled, then crumpled, folding into the water, thousand tiny shocks being delivered to every inch of skin Castor pummeled. He felt the lightning in his guts and in his veins.</p>\n<p>The radio call screamed through the buzzing in his head. \u201c\u2014 Need to release it! You\u2019re gonna blow up the suit!\u201d A quick check of his systems confirmed it. The reactor systems were going completely insane. The suit couldn\u2019t handle this for more than a few minutes, max. He needed to finish this, fast.</p>\n<p>He shoved a hand into the water, grabbing Typhoon\u2019s neck and dragging it back up onto its feet. He held him there, steady, while he aimed, steadied, then\u2014 fire.</p>\n<p>The taser on his right fist slammed into Typhoon\u2019s neck, dumping every spare volt of electricity directly into the beast. It screamed again, writhing in pain, eyes alight, before falling backward limply into the drink. The water roiled for a few seconds before, under the surface, it came to its senses and began to flounder away. Away from the city, out of the bay.</p>\n<p>Castor released a breathe he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been holding. Over the radio, the channel was being flooded. Cheers, congratulations, data requests. He dialed the radio in to one particular frequency.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still there, sis?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m still here, stupid. Are you still alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so. How\u2019d I do?\u201d He massaged his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been a lot worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh. Come on back.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After the first death of the Crocosquid, the GOC fell under the illusion everyone else did: that our victory meant we were safe. We grew fat, lazy, complacent. A mistake that nearly resulted in our extinction. The reality is that as long as large-scale aggressors exist, humanity will never be truly safe.</p>\n<p>The threat remains, and the GOC remains to defend against it. The Foundation can be as enraged as they want. The governments can hate us as much as they want. The Fivefold Mission is too important to be put on hold.</p>\n<p>The GOC will continue to defend humanity, whether they like it or not.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\">\u2014 Fleet Admiral Torvald Halbaum, Global Occult Coalition (Project Armada CO)</span></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"armada\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">PROJECT\u00a0ARMADA\u00a0BLACK\u00a0SUIT\u00a0DIRECTORY</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"arm-box\">\n<div class=\"arm-column\">\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/voodoo-ranger\">1.

But a lot has changed in fifteen years.\n\n\n\nThe tempest settles over San Francisco under the cover of night. Gale-force winds pick up, whipping sheets of rain onto the asphalt -- the trees go from bending and swaying to being snapped in two and dragged into the air. Klaxons scream to an audience of none at every empty traffic intersection. For a dirty moment, San Francisco holds its breath. Most people are crouched with their loved ones in attics and closets. The public emergency shelters are full of people packed like sardines, listening to the storm rage aboveground. The faithful have prayer books, the paranoid have canned food, and General Sarah Jung has a job to do.\n\n\n\nShe's sitting in her office, tastefully decorated and blessedly soundproofed. She is idly sipping at a small cup of Earl Grey tea. If she had windows, they'd look out over the bay in turmoil as the storm made its slow, violent advance into the city. But no \u2014 the office is all mahogany paneling and steel accents, monitors hanging from the walls. The largest, on the far wall and the size of a whiteboard, shows a live satellite map of the West Coast, stretching from Baja to Vancouver. A large red dot hangs off the coast of California. The map updates, and the dot ticks another inch closer to San Francisco. General Sarah Jung finishes her tea and rises, striding out of the office into the command center.\n\n\n\nThe Block is an ugly blight on the San Francisco skyline. A featureless gray metal rectangle 150 feet tall, one side dominated by a massive set of hangar doors that go nearly all the way up. It sticks out like a sore, hypoxic thumb, and no one enjoys its presence. As of five hours and twelve minutes ago, it is the most important building in the city. Most of it is empty space inside, for obvious reasons. But the topmost three floors are dedicated to data \u2014 this the brain. The nervous system that the GOC has draped across the western seaboard terminates here, in this room. It is some cross between NASA\u2019s mission control and an aircraft carrier\u2019s combat information center; stepped rows of terminals arranged in concentric circles. \n\n\n\nGeneral Jung has called all hands on deck; every terminal is occupied by an operator in blue fatigues and a headset, dutifully analyzing the information stream at it comes in, speaking into their microphones. As the door to her office opens and she steps out, a cloud forms around her of analysts trying to get her attention, tablets of readings and maps being waved in her face.\n\n\n\n\u201cGeneral, the Air Force has authorized air support from Fort Bragg\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014 trying to reestablish radio contact with the advance ships outside the bay, they\u2019re\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cTyphoon is six klicks away from the Black Line, ma\u2019am.\u201d \n\n\n\nThat last one is the only important one.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny changes in trajectory?\u201d she asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cNegative, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s only getting faster.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe acknowledges it with a swift nod but doesn\u2019t stop walking, and the cloud follows her. The center of the room is dominated by a massive, holographic display of the earth, slowly spinning; a number of dots are marked out, most colored green or yellow and drifting comfortably in the deep ocean, far from any shores. A single, ugly red dot hangs nearly on top of San Francisco.\n\n\n\nJung stops walking when she reaches one terminal. She looks over the top of the monitor at the analyst behind it; a dark-skinned young man, a laser-focused attentiveness dancing in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cSergeant Mallory.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d Those eyes don\u2019t leave the screen to meet hers.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on this?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have a room full of analysts who could give you a detailed breakdown of the probabilities at play here. Ma\u2019am. And they\u2019ll all tell you that past incidents tell us there\u2019s a 73.4% chance that Typhoon will turn around before it enters the Bay.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe could reprimand him for that, but both of them know she won\u2019t. A perfectly-manicured finger comes down on the head of the Godzilla bobblehead on his desk.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is in poor taste?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI prefer to focus on the actual conflicts as opposed to the imagined ones, ma\u2019am.\u201d The ghost of a smile dances on his lips. He knows he\u2019s getting away with a lot right now; the circumstances allow some latitude.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen quit futzing around and tell me what //you// think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTyphoon isn\u2019t violent by nature. He hasn\u2019t come within fifty kilometers of the city in ten years. When he does get close, the high-frequency soundbursts make him turn around just fine; this is uncharacteristic. I think the storm has something to do with it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Black Line is forty kilometers out from the city. He\u2019s six away from breaching it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFour now,\u201d an aide chimes in.\n\n\n\nJung crosses her arms. \u201cSo he\u2019s never gotten this close before. I know that already. I\u2019m asking what //you// think we should do, as someone who\u2019s been watching his movements a lot longer than I have.\u201d\n\n\n\nMallory looked up at her.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking if you should give the scramble order or not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis gives him pause. He stops looking at the screen, leans back, lost in thought. Then, a few seconds later, he returns, and finally looks up at her.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think Typhoon\u2019s not turning around. I think you should given it five minutes ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe turns on her heel and gives a sharp nod to one of the warrant officers standing by the wall. He flicks a switch next to him; the dome light overhead turns green. Outside, the keen-eyed can hear a distinct shift in the sirens across the city; going from a low, warning droning to an active air-raid warbling.\n\n\n\nInside, the General\u2019s voice overpowers it.\n\n\n\n\u201cAttention! We\u2019ve been lucky enough to avoid this situation so far. But that means many of you have only worked on training exercises before. This is not a training exercise; everything about this situation is real, including the lives riding on your shoulders today. Don\u2019t ignore that weight. Feel it. Let it remind you what you\u2019re fighting for today.\u201d\n\n\n\nA familiar rumbling begins to shake the building from underfoot. A few of the soldiers look pale.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo minutes to launch. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\n\n----\n\n> A god fell into the sea in 1998.\n\n> \n\n> We were told to dredge her corpse and dispose of her. Her mission was over; the Crocosquid was a charred husk lying on a beach a few kilometers away. But it was a pyrrhic victory. Too much damage. Too much exertion. Firing the Sun Vent that incinerated LSA-Brasil-01 had nearly destroyed the Dragonslayer too. \n\n> \n\n> But we won. That was what mattered to the Foundation\u2019s Council, to the public. Maybe we lost the greatest weapon humanity had ever created, but in the end, we won. The remaining LSAs were docile, avoiding populated areas and preferring to stay in the open ocean. We were safe, we could begin to rebuild. Ease the belt on a war economy. Make it so that maybe our kids could live in a world like the one we grew up in.\n\n> \n\n> But the second nastiest thing about superweapons is that they have a function in peacetime too. No one knows when war will come to your shores. No one could guarantee that something wouldn\u2019t drive the kaiju back into animalistic fury. That there wasn\u2019t another crocosquid somewhere out there, slumbering in an undersea crevasse, waiting for her chance to come to the surface for round two. We barely won last time. And the GOC doesn\u2019t take chances.\n\n> \n\n> So maybe we were handed orders from D\u00fcsseldorf not to melt down the parts of 5514 that we pulled from the sea floor. Maybe we lied to the Foundation, said more components of the Dragonslayer were unrecoverable than we first estimated. Maybe they were packed up, shipped off to a score of blacksites across the world to be replicated and reconstructed. Maybe, not three months after the war ended, we were already preparing for the next one.\n\n> \n\n> Hm? Oh, yes. The other nastiest things about superweapons: you can never just have one.\n\n> \n\n> [[>]]\n\n> [[span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\"]]-- Commander Hans Demwar, Operation ANGLER GREEN (SCP-5514 Recovery and Disposal) CO[[/span]]\n\n> [[/>]]\n\n----\n\nChris braced himself against the railing. The waves were so violent it took both hands to keep him steady, and he was completely soaked to the bone even through two ponchos, his high-vis vest pulled over top. But like everyone else, he had a job to do tonight.\n\n\n\nHis little tugboat was just a lookout. They were moored right near the entrance to the San Francisco bay, starboard side facing the open waters of the Pacific. Every floodlight on the ship was on, providing some meager visibility. Really, the most it did was make sure he was visible to the other four ships he could see doing the same across the waters.\n\n\n\nThe rain was becoming a problem; the radar dish on top of the wheelhouse had been damaged, making communication with Command inconsistent and unreliable. The most they could get through were static-filled messages, and the storm was giving so much interference that satellite communication was struggling too.\n\n\n\nHe cursed out loud to no one in particular. Then his thoughts were broken by a sound cutting through the sturmundrang; a low, shrill howl, like a mournful whale\u2019s call. For a split second, it pierced through the thunder and waves, then fell below again. He froze, wide-eyed, for a second \u2014 then nearly slipped as another crashing wave hit the side of the ship.\n\n\n\nScrabbling to the railing to pull himself up, he yanked the binoculars from around his neck and to his eyes. Total darkness, of course. Shaking fingers scrabbled across their surface until he found the dial and flicked it. Suddenly, everything was cast in shades of white and grey; active night-vision. He cast his vision left-to-right, trying to get a bead on anything except an endless sea of grey waves and black sky. Nothing. Nothing. Noth-- wait.\n\n\n\nHe did a double-take, bringing his sight back to that spot and staring directly at it. Ten seconds passed, then thirty. He was about to pass it off as a trick of the eye, then\u2014\n\n\n\nHis eyes widened. \n\n\n\nEven from this distance, it was gargantuan. Some cross between a lizard and a seal, breaching gracefully out of the water like a whale, accompanied by that same mournful, shrill cry. It hung in the air for a second before crashing back down under the waves.\n\n\n\nStruggling violently, he grabbed ahold of his radio, shouting into it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is Unit-3 Calloway! I have eyes on LSA-Typhoon-01, 290\u2014 no, 292 west-by-northwest! Moving actively towards the Black Line!\u201d\n\n\n\nStatic on the line. \n\n\n\n\u201cDammit!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother wave shook the ship, no doubt the wake of the Typhoon\u2019s re-entry. Chris abandoned the railing, racing around the ship as fast as he could, trying to get to the satellite phone on the other side. Maybe, just maybe\u2014\n\n\n\nHe froze. He was on the port side now, staring back at the San Francisco skyline. And there was something there.\n\n\n\nIt was hard to see, cast into silhouette by the lights of the city. But it was big. It was humanoid. And it was moving. Logically, he knew there was only one thing it could be, but he kept staring. He kept staring as it progressed from slow, unsteady steps to a confident stride, then into long, loping dashes, throwing up water from the bay as it ran towards him. He stared at it right up until it was nearly on top of the ship. \n\n\n\nAnd then, finally, it was cast in sharp relief. A well-armored mech two hundred feet tall, painted in sharp maroon, blades portruding from each hand. Its \u2018face\u2019 was dominated by a single red circle. He watched it in slow motion as it leapt, jumped entirely over his ship, and slammed clear on the other side, never so much as stopping its charge.\n\n\n\nThe radio crackled to life, breaking through the static for a single moment as he watched its back.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll advance ships, be advised: Black Suit Voodoo Ranger is on scene and actively engaging LSA-Typhoon-01. Stay out of the way.\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n> Voodoo Ranger was the first and best of the Dragonslayer\u2019s children.\n\n> \n\n> We recovered what we could, of course, but the issues were immediate. If we transported that much hardware to one location, the Foundation would immediately realize. So we had to spread it out. The Plasma Wristblade ended up in Sydney. The ESA landed in Sri Lanka. Et cetera. The result was that every Black Suit was vastly divergent in design, each molded around a different organ from their mother, operating on different strategies and excelling in different situations.\n\n> \n\n> But San Francisco was the largest city in close proximity to the most LSAs, and as such, we received the lion\u2019s share of original Dragonslayer components. It took years to get them back in working condition and miniaturize them. Funding was a constant battle, as was keeping it quiet from the Foundation. But PTOLEMY has the best scientists in the world. We got the job done.\n\n> \n\n> The other suits might have their unique talents or specializations, but Voodoo Ranger is the only one built from SCP-5514\u2019s bones and organs. The armor plating was smelted down and reforged. The original computer systems were reincorporated at every opportunity. The weapons were refitted for a suit half the size of the original. Smaller, faster, stronger; he is every bit his mother\u2019s son.\n\n> \n\n> Naturally, there was really only one person we could get to pilot it.\n\n> \n\n> [[>]]\n\n> [[span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\"]]\u2014 Doctor Arjun Patel, Project WYRMRISE, San Francisco Facility Head Scientist[[/span]]\n\n> [[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\u201c\u2014 hear me? Repeat, can you hear me, Captain Rosales?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe radio inside Castor\u2019s helmet finally broke through the static.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, not loud and clear, but I can hear you. Think I might be through the interference zone.\u201d\n\n\n\nHanging from his harness inside the head of the mech, he pushed his legs, the suit reading his movements and sending the physical data into the computers that dispersed them to the thousands of servos throughout the Black Suit. The delay was nearly nonexistent; the suit moved in perfect time with him. The camera feeds around the \u2018head\u2019 were wired directly into the helmet\u2019s visor; he saw the sea around him. The overall effect was that the mech was an extension of his body, of himself. \n\n\n\nAnother leap over another ship, spraying water everywhere. He was a warrior in a billion-dollar war machine; he was a kid in a pool.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a training exercise, Captain Rosales. Don\u2019t take any risks you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Typhoon?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLast known location is about four-point-five klicks from your current position, seven degrees south of your current heading.\u201d\n\n\n\nCastor pivoted his head, scanning the roiling waters. Nothing. He thought \u2018infrared\u2019, and his visor lit up in shades of blues and purple, with a decided lack of red or orange.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coldblooded; if he\u2019s underwater, infrared won\u2019t help.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sass me.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe ignored her, turning off infrared mode and going back to his naked eye. Typhoon was a big bastard; he //should// be able to see\u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d\n\n\n\nCastor stumbled forward, an impact shaking the Black Suit. He felt it transmitted as tiny vibrations all across his skin; haptic feedback, critical to his synchronicity with Voodoo Ranger. He needed to feel everything the suit felt, and right now, he felt like he\u2019d been punched in the back. \n\n\n\nKicking his leg out and spinning onto his heel, he did a 180, facing whatever had shoved him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, hello, ugly.\u201d\n\n\n\nTyphoon was some disgusting cross between the body shape of a komodo dragon with the skin and blubber of a seal and the face of a moray eel. It\u00a0\u00a0was standing on his back two webbed feet, the front pair hovering in front of it. Castor couldn\u2019t be sure, but he felt the expression on its face could only be of surprise as his six-ton hand come around, catching it directly in the jaw. It bellowed in pain.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it go for the water!\u201d\n\n\n\nProphetically, its next move was to drop like a rock, diving back into the waves \u2014 or it least, it tried to. Still half-kneeling, Castor wrapped his other hand around its neck, yanking it back up. \n\n\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d he grunted into the radio as it writhed violently, trying to flop itself free.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as its on its feet, you\u2019re fighting on your turf. Don\u2019t let it get into the water.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBesides that!\u201d He slammed another fist into its head, inciting another pained bellowing. \n\n\n\n\u201cIn the past, Typhoon\u2019s proven susceptible to prolonged physical trauma.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt took a second for the phrase to register. \u201cYou mean beat the shit out of it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, I mean beat the shit out of it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWilc--\u201d\n\n\n\nHis response was cut off. Finally sick of the chokehold, Typhoon lunged, biting those massive jaws down. Castor jerked his hand back, but not fast enough. The huge toothed jaws caught the suit\u2019s forearm, trying to rip it off. His other fist came around, smashing the back of the monster\u2019s skull, but not hard enough to dislodge its hold.\n\n\n\n\u201cPiece of shit!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cVent your exhaust through the upper ports!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe thought, and it was so. Typhoon jerked back violently, releasing the grip on the forearm that was now suddenly spewing skin-meltingly hot exhaust gases through a series of vent ports. \n\n\n\n\u201cHandy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt sure is. Now go beat the shit out of that lizard.\u201d\n\n\n\nCastor lunged, catching the still-confused sea beast with a glancing blow. The blades on his arms extended, slashing the soft underbelly. It bellowed in pain again, but this time with an edge of rage to it. Blood spilled out; Castor was sure that if it was morning, he would see the water turning into a frothing red maelstrom. Looking up, Typhoon roared, a guttural sound audible even inside the suit.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think I made it mad!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t have time to hear the response, because Typhoon lunged right back, claws now fully extended as it hammered blows onto Ranger\u2019s armor. The claws were sharp and strong enough to leave gouges in the plating. Castor jerked as his pain receptors lit up; it was psychosomatic, but it still hurt like a bitch.\n\n\n\n//Time to fight fire with fire.//\n\n\n\nHe willed his blades to extend. They telescoped forward, going from his forearm to extending past his arms, and he brought them crashing down on Typhoon\u2019s head, forcing it underwater.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeep his head underwater if you can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy? He\u2019s a fish!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a reptile, you idiot! He doesn\u2019t have gills, he still needs to breathe!\u201d\n\n\n\nCastor obeyed, putting his weight down onto the monster\u2019s head. It only took a few seconds for Typhoon to start thrashing, before suddenly stopping.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2014 WOAH!\u201d\n\n\n\nTyphoon rocketed forward, trying to pull his captor down with him. Castor braced his legs, pulling on Typhoon\u2019s neck like an angler on the line. His jaw strained, and sweat beaded on his brow inside the helmet.\n\n\n\nThen he suddenly pushed. The jets on each elbow fired in a short burst, giving him the momentum he needed to slam the monster\u2019s head against the sea floor, momentarily dazing it. Then he yanked it back onto its feet.\n\n\n\n\u201cCastor--\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot now!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe slammed another punch into its gut, and then another into its head. That soft underbelly was still bleeding into the surrounding water, illuminated by the lightning flickering overhead.\n\n\n\n//You like that, you big piece of shit?//\n\n\n\nOne more shove, sending Typhoon stumbling backward, clutching its head almost comically. It wasn\u2019t fighting back; that meant he was winning, right? It\u2019d be retreating any second now. Maybe a few more to really hammer in the lesson.\n\n\n\nHe lunged, hitting it in the jaw with an uppercut. He didn\u2019t notice the strange flickering on its spines.\n\n\n\n\u201cCastor!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe wrapped a massive hand against one of its arms, pinning it back.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLet go of it!\u201d\n\n\n\nSomething in her voice made him obey without questioning for once. But he wasn\u2019t fast enough; one hand was still grazing against Typhoon\u2019s skin when the entire sky suddenly lit up. Castor shut his eyes reflexively, but he still saw the lightning bolt smash directly into Typhoon\u2019s open-mouthed head. The monster groaned, lighting up in patterns of blue and yellow for a split second as energy poured out of it. \n\n\n\nThe entire suit was launched backward a hundred feet from the pure force of it, landing with a stumble on its ass.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 the fuck?\u201d\n\n\n\nCastor looked up, his helmet visor screaming alarms at him as his systems rebooted. Comms was one of the first to come back online as he struggled to his feet.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince when the fuck can it do that?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has to be the storm!\u201d\n\n\n\nSeemed plausible. Typhoon\u2019s skin was decorating in electrifying patterns, like a bolt snaking across the sky. Its spines danced with energy. It bellowed again, daring him to try \u2014 and as it did, he could see the blue energy in its gullet.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow am I supposed to hit it without touching it?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFigure something out!\u201d\n\n\n\nVoodoo Ranger finally struggled to its feet just as Typhoon began to bumrush him, carving a path as it half-ran-half-swam through the water. Castor threw himself out of the way of the charge; the jets on his legs swiveled and fired, thrusting him in the right direction to miss Typhoon by just a few feet.\n\n\n\nHe pivoted back, trying to put distance between them. Typhoon was completely different now; skin glowing with energy, pushing aggressively where it had been cowardly just a few minutes ago. \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe could hear the tension on the other end.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf it was constantly releasing charge, the water around you would be electrified, but it\u2019s not. That means it\u2019s a controlled release.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe dodged out of the way again as Typhoon lunged with another bite.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo how do I make sure it doesn\u2019t release into //me?//\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother lightning strike, but this one didn\u2019t connect with Typhoon. Just lit up the sky in cold blue light, letting Castor see just how violent the waves they were knee-deep in were becoming. And letting him see an opening. \n\n\n\nTyphoon was waving its arms up and down, no doubt trying to appear bigger. But that revealed a tiny soft spot in its hard, leathery skin right near the armpit. Before he could think, Castor lunged forward, jets thrusting the two-hundred-foot machine ahead.\n\n\n\n\u201cCastor, don\u2019t!\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nToo late.\n\n\n\nHis bladed fist connected with the soft skin, and sank through it like butter through a knife. Typhoon roared again, an animal, guttural noise of pain, and writhed. Then its head turned down to look at its aggressor. \n\n\n\nCastor knew it couldn\u2019t see into the cockpit, but for a moment, it felt like they saw each other. Then he noticed a telltale blue crackling in the reptile\u2019s eyes, and his own widened. Typhoon\u2019s skin lit up as electricity poured out of it and into Voodoo Ranger. Castor couldn\u2019t hear the alarms going off over the sound of his own screaming, and then he didn\u2019t hear anything at all.\n\n----\n\n> The Black Suits were built around anomalies. Compare that to the White and Orange suits; they utilized paratechnology, but that\u2019s not the same thing. Paratechnology refers to technology that we approximately understand the workings of, even if modern science doesn\u2019t. Anomalies exist outside that understanding. We were desperate for any advantage against LSA-Brasil, and so we deployed weapons we didn\u2019t understand.\n\n> \n\n> Consequently, the Black Suits exhibit\u2026 quirks. Things that don\u2019t quite make sense, given what we know about their construction and components. Things that make some of the engineers nervous to work on them. Sometimes Voodoo Ranger\u2019s servos twitch without anyone piloting it. Sometimes the cameras in the hangar will mysteriously turn off in the wee hours of the night. Sometimes the training pilots report faint voices in the cockpit. \n\n> \n\n> Nothing has ever been confirmed, obviously. We\u2019d have to ground the entire fleet; twenty Black Suits, the thin line between humanity and the monsters, suddenly unable to defend us in case a kaiju decides it\u2019s hungry. We\u2019d be left defenseless, and every single man working on Project Armada knows that.\n\n> \n\n> So no, nothing\u2019s ever been confirmed.\n\n> \n\n> [[>]]\n\n> [[span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\"]]-- Colonel James Meyel, Black Suit Training Officer (VOODOO RANGER)[[/span]]\n\n> [[/>]]\n\n----\n\nCastor couldn\u2019t feel where his body ended and the abyss began. \n\n\n\nHe was still wearing his suit, he was pretty sure; the visor clouded his vision. But he didn\u2019t feel tethered. He lifted a hand, and glided forward through the black emptiness. This was nice. This was safe. \n\n\n\nHe leaned back. He could get used to this. There was nothing here, but that also meant nothing to hurt him. No pain. \n\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how long he floated before he heard the voice. A familiar, warm voice, like honey on toast. He\u2019d heard it before, but he wasn\u2019t sure where.\n\n\n\n\u201cWake up.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe groaned in response.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo sleeping on the job, hun.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother groan.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blowing it out there, darling. This is what you wanted to do, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Could\u2019ve had a cushy job as a Foundation nepo baby. Mommy and Daddy saved the world, you could\u2019ve made Site Director by thirty just off their coattails.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why you came running when the GOC called jangling the keys to a Black Suit. A chance to make your own legacy, the same way your parents did. You have that chance now, and you\u2019re wasting it floating around, hun.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t saving the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. But it\u2019s still saving a city of millions. You\u2019re young; you have plenty of time to work your way up to saving the world. What are you gonna do? Let a bunch of families die because they\u2019re not the whole world.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe snapped, an annoyed twinge in his voice. \u201cWho the hell are you, anyway?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know who I am, hun.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you know what you need to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 What if I lose? What if I disappoint them?\u201d\n\n\n\nThis got a laugh from the voice. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna lose, hun.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m right beside you, stupid. And I didn\u2019t lose to the Crocosquid, what makes you think I\u2019m gonna lose to a shrimpy lizard-seal? Now get going, you have a fight to win.\u201d\n\n----\n\nCastor screamed himself back awake. \n\n\n\nThe electricity was still coursing through the body of the Black Suit \u2014 but it was different. It was burning without being agonizing, flowing through every servo of the mech, raw unfiltered energy filling every atom of its being. It was like being on fire without the pain. \n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t bother answering the radio hail before he sank his other blade into Typhoon\u2019s other arm. The lizard\u2019s mouth was agape, and its skin was losing its luster. Voodoo Ranger was draining the energy out of it, taking it into itself. The beast screamed, and Castor screamed back, slamming his fists into its jaw again and again and again. It buckled, then crumpled, folding into the water, thousand tiny shocks being delivered to every inch of skin Castor pummeled. He felt the lightning in his guts and in his veins. \n\n\n\nThe radio call screamed through the buzzing in his head. \u201c\u2014 Need to release it! You\u2019re gonna blow up the suit!\u201d A quick check of his systems confirmed it. The reactor systems were going completely insane. The suit couldn\u2019t handle this for more than a few minutes, max. He needed to finish this, fast.\n\n\n\nHe shoved a hand into the water, grabbing Typhoon\u2019s neck and dragging it back up onto its feet. He held him there, steady, while he aimed, steadied, then\u2014 fire.\n\n\n\nThe taser on his right fist slammed into Typhoon\u2019s neck, dumping every spare volt of electricity directly into the beast. It screamed again, writhing in pain, eyes alight, before falling backward limply into the drink. The water roiled for a few seconds before, under the surface, it came to its senses and began to flounder away. Away from the city, out of the bay.\n\n\n\nCastor released a breathe he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been holding. Over the radio, the channel was being flooded. Cheers, congratulations, data requests. He dialed the radio in to one particular frequency.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou still there, sis?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m still here, stupid. Are you still alive?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think so. How\u2019d I do?\u201d He massaged his neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cCould\u2019ve been a lot worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBetter than you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Come on back.\u201d\n\n----\n\n> After the first death of the Crocosquid, the GOC fell under the illusion everyone else did: that our victory meant we were safe. We grew fat, lazy, complacent. A mistake that nearly resulted in our extinction. The reality is that as long as large-scale aggressors exist, humanity will never be truly safe. \n\n> \n\n> The threat remains, and the GOC remains to defend against it. The Foundation can be as enraged as they want. The governments can hate us as much as they want. The Fivefold Mission is too important to be put on hold.\n\n> \n\n> The GOC will continue to defend humanity, whether they like it or not.\n\n> \n\n> [[>]]\n\n> [[span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 90%;\"]]-- Fleet Admiral Torvald Halbaum, Global Occult Coalition (Project Armada CO)[[/span]]\n\n> [[/>]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"armada\"]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"PROJECT ARMADA BLACK SUIT DIRECTORY\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"arm-box\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"arm-column\"]]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/voodoo-ranger 1.

is\u2026 tolerable.</p>\n<p>Better than tolerable\u2026 he's nice. His hair is clean and styled, tastefully slicked back. He looks like a character in a movie, except he's real and he's sitting right across from her. It's well into the evening, the sky dark, they're sitting outside an Italian restaurant. Elstrom would have preferred to be <em>inside</em> somewhere a bit nicer, but she can stomach Italian just fine. The way the surrounding fairy lights reflect off his big brown eyes is cute.</p>\n<p>\"So, your profile was a bit vague on what you do for a living,\" he says. He's got an accent, French maybe? It's nice, just enough to sound attractive without being too thick or forced.</p>\n<p>\"I work as an administrator for a large, privately owned company.\" Close enough to the truth. \"And you?\"</p>\n<p>\"I work in sales for a tech manufacturing company.\" Sounds like there's money in that. Good money too by the looks of his freshly pressed suit. She's never been particularly hurting for cash, but financial stability is always a sexy trait. Rich, well dressed, an hour into the date without a single perverted comment\u2026</p>\n<p>This man might be perfect.</p>\n<p>And then he laughs, throwing his head back, his mouth far too wide, too many teeth. Elstrom can barely remember what it is she said, too distracted staring up his nose. There's something deeply unpleasant about seeing him from the angle. What a grating sound to accompany it, and now that she thinks about it, his accent is annoying. And his teeth are far too white, the light is shining off of them.</p>\n<p>As she thinks about it more\u2026 <em>sales for a tech manufacturing company?</em> He had to gall to call her vague? That suit could be rented, this whole air of competency an act. He'll pay for this first date, and then hold it over her head next time. That suit looks raggedy anyway, even if he's got good money he has poor taste. He could use a better barber too, and a different scent of cologne, and more interesting food preferences.</p>\n<p>And his smile is weird. Shows off only his top row of teeth.</p>\n<p>And his cheeks are too thin. Too much emphasis on his jawline.</p>\n<p>And Elstrom can't picture herself waking up in the morning and sitting across from him and happily eating breakfast every morning.</p>\n<p>\"I had a lovely night,\" he says, taking her by the hand. Too firm, too warm. \"I'd love to meet up again. Perhaps for coffee?\"</p>\n<p>She grimaces, teeth bared. \"No thank you. I appreciate your time, but I don't think we'll be meeting again.\"</p>\n<p>He frowns, shoulders slumping, but he plasters on a smile anyway. \"I understand. I hope this was a good time for you nonetheless.\" He shakes her hand and with his head hung low, he politely leaves her be. She pictures him slumping away into a moldy apartment, dirty and unattractive, complaining to his similarly sloppy friends about some <em>bitch</em> he went on a date with the other night, and she feels no regret ending this night.</p>\n<p>She walks home shrouded in darkness, feeling the same as she always does.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy bags hang under her eyes. She's never quite been able to get rid of them, but a layer of concealer usually does the trick. While she's contemplating her most recent failed romance, McInnis passes by her desk and pauses, a sheet of paper in his hand.</p>\n<p>\"A health inspector will be at the site in twenty minutes. I hate to spring this on you, but would you greet them and show them around the site for the next few days? I may find myself busy.\" He places the paper on top of what Elstrom is already looking at.</p>\n<p>There's nothing she would like to do <em>less</em> than greet someone new, however McInnis has always been too <em>kind</em> to just outright say no to on matters like this. Fuck him really for just being naturally nice and charismatic. \"Alright.\"</p>\n<p>\"Try to make a good impression for us,\" he says with a friendly sort of smile and then leaves her be.</p>\n<p>After fifteen minutes, she begins her trek towards the site entrance. According to the paper, the inspector's name is Aubrey Al-Khafaji. Elstrom can already picture the sort of man this <em>Al-Khafaji</em> will be. He'll show up well-dressed in a suit and clipboard, oozing with professionalism. He'll try to make nice small talk around the site. Then, when they're alone, he'll make his true intentions known like the real creep he is. <em>Like every single other person they send to this site.</em></p>\n<p><em>She should've just passed this off to someone else\u2026 too late now.</em></p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji is waiting for her, in a suit and holding a clipboard like Elstrom guessed, a tasteful leather satchel around his shoulders. He's a portly man, bit shorter than Elstrom, with black skin and a visor pinning an afro out of his face. He smiles as she approaches, the wrinkles around his lips and eyes indicating he's one to smile often. Hand outstretched to take hers, Al-Khafaji speaks and Elstrom realizes she made one snap judgement far too quickly.</p>\n<p><em>This Al-Khafaji is a woman.</em></p>\n<p>\"Good to finally see someone! Though, I figure you're not Allen McInnis,\" she says like they're sharing some sort of joke. She has an accent, not one Elstrom immediately recognizes, but possibly Arabic? She takes her hand, her mind lagging as she decides her next move.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not, however I will be the one showing you around today. I'm Karen Elstrom, Karen is fine.\" Karen is fine? Since when is <em>Karen fine</em>? Why did she say that?</p>\n<p>\"Well then, Karen, Aubrey Al-Khafaji at your service!\" She gives Elstrom's hand a hardy shake. \"Feel free to lead the way! Lot of ground to cover.\"</p>\n<p>Keeping her posture straight and her head forward, Elstrom marches down the halls. Now that this interaction has begun, it's her next goal to end it as quickly as possible. There's a comfortable well of solitude waiting for her at her desk.</p>\n<p>They pass by each department, Al-Khafaji pausing their tour to chat with the department director and take notes on her clipboard. While she's taking notes on the state of Theology and Teleology, Elstrom clears her throat and asks, \"Why does the Foundation need a health inspector?\" It sounded a lot less rude in her head.</p>\n<p>\"Are you kidding? I would say the Foundation needs health inspectors more than anyone.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom stiffens, uncomfortable. \"I meant, we have Janitorial and Maintenance. Doesn't that cover health and safety?\"</p>\n<p>\"You would think! But someone-\" she taps her chest with her pen, \"-impartial has to make sure certain health standards are <em>actually</em> being met. There's a lot more dangers to working than whatever horrors you have locked up here.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom nods once. \"Logical enough.\"</p>\n<p>They continue on to Replication Studies. While they're idling by the break room, Dr. Wettle passes by holding a mug and strikes his head against an open cabinet door. Elstrom winces, sucking in a breath through her teeth. She never quite got the same <em>pleasure</em> out of seeing Wettle hurt himself as her peers, she found it more\u2026 <em>pitiful.</em> Al-Khafaji on the other hand stops what she's doing and rushes forward.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, are you alright?\" she reaches up to put a hand on Wettle's shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"What?\" he asks that it's the first time he's ever heard those words. \"Yes I'm fine. I just-\" he bumps his elbow against the counter and dumps his coffee onto her. Al-Khafaji gasps and backs up. \"I'm so sorry about that!\" He grabs a large handful of napkins and presses them into her chest. He then appears to think about where he's putting his hands, recoils, and dumps the rest of his coffee on himself. \"Fuck!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey buddy, it's fine!\" she says.</p>\n<p>He groans. \"Sorry.\" Deciding he's made enough of a fool of himself, he turns around and leaves, empty mug in hand.</p>\n<p>\"Bewildering\u2026\" Al-Khafaji gathers up the napkins and drops them in the trash.</p>\n<p>\"Your shirt,\" Elstrom says, for once at a total loss.</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry about it. Trust me, lukewarm coffee doesn't even make the list of the worst things people have spilled on me at work.\" She unbuttons her suit jacket and swings it over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"There's a bathroom over here.\" She gently takes her arm and leads her to said bathroom. Arms crossed behind her back, she waits by a stall for Al-Khafaji. The strangest feeling passes over her; the urge to fill the silence. \"So, what's the worst mess you've ever been in while working?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, now you're making me think.\" Al-Khafaji cocks her head to one side in thought. \"Maybe not the worst mess, but I was watching these folks clean the kitchen at one of those big sites, the sort of sites where all of the staff live on site. They were moving this <em>huge</em> tub of grease somewhere to dispose of it, they were showing me where they put their waste you see, and apparently this tub-\" she makes a series of hand motions, miming out the shape of this tub, \"- wasn't secure and, Allahumma a'inni, they dumped the whole thing right on me and the folks carrying it around.\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji laughs and Elstrom clutches her stomach. She can barely stand the feeling of scraping the grease off her pans at home. The thought of gallons of it getting on her, all of it's sliminess on her skin, makes her want to vomit more than anything else.</p>\n<p>\"You alright over there?\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom notices her gaze and straightens up. \"Yes, I'm fine.\" She waves her hand, dismissing Al-Khafaji's concern and clearing the air.</p>\n<p>\"Right.\" A pause. \"Sooo, after I'm done with my report I was thinking of doing a bit of a bar crawl, checking out a few of the local places. Would you care to come with?\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom's throat closes up. She had expected this sort of advancement, but that was of course before she realized she'd be showing around another woman. \"Don't you think\u2026 fraternizing after work would be a conflict of interest?\"</p>\n<p>\"What? No, why would it be?\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom thinks for a moment, trying to find the perfect excuse for why she can't. It's been a well crafted skill; coming up with the perfect realistic sounding prior engagement to get out of any situation. But, as she mills over the options, she finds she doesn't actually want to deny this invitation. When does that ever get an opportunity like this? A social call with no expectations.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 suppose if I have nothing else going on tonight.\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji clasps her hands together. \"Wonderful! Now then, I think I'd like you to show me where I'll be staying tonight.\"</p>\n\n<p>Elstrom steps off the taxi, heels clicking against the asphalt. Al-Khafaji emailed her hours earlier with details and this looks like the right place, with its flashy sign and music she can feel through the ground. There's still time for her to turn around, get back in the taxi, send Al-Khafaji an apologetic message justifying her absence.</p>\n<p>Just by coming here she's made up her mind.</p>\n<p>Passing over the door frame is like stepping into a new world, and she's literally stepped into other worlds before. Everything is bathed in purple light, the air smells sweet like soda syrup, and there's not a single man in sight. Like a fish out of water, Elstrom makes her way forward, for once very aware of how she's being looked at.</p>\n<p>Site-43 prided itself on it's inclusiveness. People forget that among all the unpopular budget cuts and policy changes, Elstrom also has a hand in every anti-discrimination rule that allowed everyone to have their <em>gay old time</em>. Elstrom is, of course, familiar with aspects of lesbian culture, such as being butch or other aspects of gender nonconformity as it pertained to her job. But knowing about it is far different from\u2026 being invited to participate.</p>\n<p>There's a seat waiting for her across from Al-Khafaji, an icy purple drink placed in front of her. While Elstrom dressed up for this invitation, Al-Khafaji dressed down. She's in a t-shirt that reveals a pair of strong arms and a tattoo on her right forearm. It's hard to tell what it's depicting, but she is momentarily captured by how well the gold patterning shows up and reflects the lights.</p>\n<p>\"Like what you see?\" she asks with that playful tone of hers. Elstrom is momentarily frozen. \"Come, sit. Don't look so frightened.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am\u2026 comfortable admitting I'm rather out of my depth here.\" At the very least, being so far out of her depth means she's at no risk of running into one of her colleagues here. Hopefully.</p>\n<p>\"No one here will bite without consent, I promise you that.\" She nudges the untouched drink closer to her. \"Take and enjoy yourself a little! Watch the dancers!\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom takes her drink and turns her head towards the dance floor. It's not a large space, but the few people there are certainly putting it to good use. None of them are <em>good</em> dancers, but they are earnest. Something about that <em>earnestness</em> both demands her attention and has her flushed and looking away. She focuses her attention on Al-Khafaji's tattoo, like staring at it will reveal a hidden image within it.</p>\n<p>\"Have something you'd like to say?\" Al-Khafaji asks, staring at her as she takes a drink.</p>\n<p>\"I was curious about your tattoo, I couldn't tell what it was in this lighting.\"</p>\n<p>She looks at her arm, then holds it out for Elstrom to observe. Elstrom gingerly takes her hand in hers. \"Was something an old friend designed for me,\" she explains, \"Based on the staff of Anubis, I'm sure you're familiar.\" She traces out the shape in the air. \"The pattern work is all hers.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" Elstrom nods, letting go. \"Do the patterns have any particular meaning? They're not memetic, I hope?\"</p>\n<p>\"You take me for one to tattoo a memetic hazard to my body.\" She shakes her head, still smiling. \"That pattern has no meaning, not anymore. I have some other tattoos I wouldn't mind showing off, but we may need to go somewhere a bit more private.\" She winks, effortlessly sliding from gently somber to flirty.</p>\n<p>\"In my work it's hardly an unreasonable question,\" she says, pointedly ignoring the rest of that sentence.</p>\n<p>\"I see. I must ask, how did you end up working here? For your Site-43?\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom looks around, unsure of how much she should say in a veiled space such as this. \"Director McInnis found me unwittingly <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/11-turnover\">working for an anomalous bank</a>. Offered me a job soon after.\"</p>\n<p>\"Anomalous bank? Sounds interesting.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was not.\" After a beat, she catches the social cue to ask Al-Khafaji the same, \"So how did you end up working for us?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was born in Qena, Egypt. That is also where my home site is stationed, when I'm not traveling. When I was in college I needed a job, and so one day I appeared at Site-343 with my resume.\" She pauses to empty her glass. \"They gave me a job as a filing clerk, with orders to never open a file! Then, when I graduated, they let me in on what they were really doing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really? It was that simple for you?\"</p>\n<p>She shrugs. \"It's a small site, they needed any extra hands they could get. Of course, these days I'm sure I spend more time traveling and looking at sites like yours than I do back home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you like that? Being so far from home?\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you kidding? It's a dream! I don't think I could ever stay rooted to one spot again.\" She pauses. \"At least, not unless I was <em>sure</em> I had something worth settling down for. I'm always willing to have my mind changed.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you don't mind me asking, do your parents know what you do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose I couldn't stop you from asking even if I did mind!\" She laughs and Elstrom blanches. \"They know I am a health inspector, they need not know much more than that. And yours? I'm sure whatever they know, they are impressed to have such a hard working daughter.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom scoffs. \"They're both still veiled. Last I checked, my father was the sort of college professor other teachers fearmonger about, and my mother did interior design.\" She tugs at her shirt collar. \"My mother gained a fascination in minimalism before that even became common, always obsessed with having as little stuff as possible to avoid clutter. I used to hide all of my toys in case they did not fit her <em>aesthetic</em>.\" She pauses, realizing that's not the <em>funny childhood anecdote</em> she thought it was. \"I'm sure they think I'm dead.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see\u2026\" Al-Khafaji says, and Elstrom questions why she said so much. She realizes her drink is empty and Al-Khafaji motions for them to move closer to the bar for refills. Elstrom looks down as the bartender approaches and refills their drinks.</p>\n<p>\"I apologize if I have dominated the conversation.\"</p>\n<p>She smiles, the skin around her nose scrunching up. \"I like hearing you talk.\" She leans in an throws an arm around Elstrom's shoulders, a gesture she would never normally allow if she weren't feeling particularly charitable tonight. \"My mother, in our small kitchen, would cook enough food daily to feed forty families. People would come to our home with dishware and money. My father, he wires houses. A <em>freelancer</em> you might call him.\" She cocks her head to the side. \"Now we have both overshared!\"</p>\n<p>At the end of the night Elstrom finally sees a benefit for wearing multiple layers. A cold breeze passes by, making Al-Khafaji shiver. Elstrom considers stripping off her cardigan and handing it over in some mock imitation of a romantic gesture. She hesitates for too long to make a choice on the matter.</p>\n<p>\"You took a cab here?\"</p>\n<p>\"I did.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then we can share a ride back home, and I can continue to be in your presence a little longer.\" She rubs her hands together and waves down a taxi. \"If only we were back in Qena, I could take you home on my motorbike.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom has a vision of herself on the back of a bike, speeding down an open road. Her head on Al-Khafaji's shoulder, her hair swept up in the wind, her hands around Al-Khafaji's soft middle. She steps into the back of the taxi in a haze.</p>\n<p>In the site, they part ways to their respective dorms, but Al-Khafaji takes her by the hand to say her peace.</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad you came out with me! It would have been no fun drinking with strangers.\" She leans in, propped up on her tip toes, and pecks Elstrom on the cheek. Momentarily stunned, Elstrom says nothing as she leaves.</p>\n<p>In Elstrom's dorm she drags herself past piles of papers and objects to the bathroom. Every time she walks past the mess she's made of her home, she pictures Dr. Ngo's voice in her head, making some statement on how she's subconsciously attempting to rebel against her mother's tendencies via developing a hoarding habit. But she by no means needs a therapist to tell her about her problems, and she's not hurting anyone but herself living like this.</p>\n<p>The bathroom mirror reveals the imprint of Al-Khafaji's lips on her cheek. She hadn't even realized she was wearing lipstick up until this moment. She presses her fingers against the marking, mind lingering in the hallway outside.</p>\n\n<p>Early in the morning, Elstrom and McInnis pass by each other on their way to their respective offices. McInnis pauses in his steps and turns to watch her pass him by. She looks odd this morning, not that McInnis would ever judge on appearance alone, but it surprises him to see her unkempt. There's a blotchy marking on her cheek, almost like a bruise.</p>\n<p>\"Karen?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm?\" She turns to face him, revealing the lipstick mark on her cheek.</p>\n<p>\"You've\u2026 got something on your cheek.\" He points to his cheek.</p>\n<p>Elstrom tenderly touches the marking, mumbling out a soft, \"Oh.\" She turns her back to him and shuffles off to the bathroom and McInnis continues on to his office.</p>\n<p>The dried splotch comes off with a wet wipe, it would've cleaned off easier if she hadn't slept in it. Now that she thinks about it, she hasn't touched up her make-up, or really done anything to her appearance besides a change of clothes. She simply rolled out of bed. Her <em>just rolled out of bed</em> may be the average person's <em>several hour make-up routine</em>, but can she really let herself be seen this way?</p>\n<p>Can she really let Al-Khafaji see her this way?</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji's grinning face appears in her vision, and a hot pain creeps up in her stomach. It's different than the usual nausea she gets. It's less like she's going to throw up and more like she's collapsing in on herself. Not willing to take the risk either way, she runs into the nearest stall.</p>\n<p>Her breathing is heavy and labored. That's the thing in these types of situations right, she needs to get her breathing under control. She would take slow, deep breaths, but she's in a public bathroom. She doesn't even like breathing too much in her own bathroom.</p>\n<p><em>What the hell is her problem anyway?</em> Is she so insecure that even the <em>thought</em> of showing her natural face brings her to her knees? Or is it simply Al-Khafaji's approval of her that has her sickened? And which is more or less mortifying?</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Elstrom, are you alright in there?\" McInnis calls. Elstrom says nothing, stunned to silence. \"I ask because it's been quite a while, and I can hear you hyperventilating. If you are sick, it would be no trouble to send you home.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine, sir.\" She swallows and tells herself she means it.</p>\n<p>After a moment of silence, McInnis says, \"If you say so. How is your progress on the inspection?\"</p>\n<p>She gets out of the stall and splashes a bit of water onto her face. \"There have been no notable incidents, though I couldn't tell you for certain what Dr. Al-Khafaji has been writing.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. I hope the rest goes just as well.\" She hears him start walking away.</p>\n<p>\"Sir! Before you go\u2026 could I ask some advice of you?\"</p>\n<p>He stops. \"Of course you may.\"</p>\n<p>\"There's something that I\u2026 want. And even though I have pursued similar things, I\u2026 find myself hesitating and I'm not sure why.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sounds like you're nervous about potential consequences. But I believe if you think this <em>thing</em>, whatever it is you desire, will make you happy, then you should continue to pursue it. Even if it might not be simple, or entirely painless.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom looks at her hands, pointedly not observing her reflection. \"I see, thank you, sir. That's all.\" After a silence, she hears McInnis's footsteps. When they're no long audible, she runs a hand through her hair to smooth it out, and turns to leave.</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji is waiting for her outside of Identity and Technocryptography. She waves as Elstrom approaches. Elstrom steels herself, the words she wants to say hanging at the end of her tongue. <em>Dinner at my place tonight.</em></p>\n<p>\"Looking bright and eager this morning!\" She says with a tip of her visor. \"On with the tour?\"</p>\n<p>\"Right.\" <em>Say it. Say it now.</em></p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji walks a few paces in front of her, leaving Elstrom to wonder why she even needs a guide when she's clearly capable of navigating herself. Back against the wall, she watches her pull out her phone and start taking pictures. Did she find some sort of issue in the walls and ceiling? She's still now, perfect opportunity to strike up conversation.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Al-\"</p>\n<p><em>THUNK!</em> \"Oh, goddamn it!\"</p>\n<p>The exclamation startles both of them, and they both swivel to see Phillip Deering struggling with a janitorial cart. One of the front wheels is twisted at an angle and Deering gives it a few kicks back into place. Prepared to ignore him, Elstrom turns to continue her conversation, but Al-Khafaji walks past her.</p>\n<p>\"Do you need a hand?\"</p>\n<p>Deering looks taken aback. \"Oh, well you don't have to. I've\u2026\" Before he can stutter out a few more dismissals she's already dropped down and twisted the wheel back into place. Deering's mirror monster says something that makes his head jerk in frustration.</p>\n<p>\"Can I ask you a few questions about your experiences working in Janitorial and Maintenance here?\" She leans in, notepad and pen in hand.</p>\n<p>He looks around and shrugs. \"I guess so. Are we in trouble or something?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, <em>no</em>, of course not. It's just my job to assure your health and safety.\" She gives a disarming smile, eyes not even flickering toward the mirrors. \"How often are there injuries on site unrelated to anomalous happenings?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not very often. I mean there's Dr. Wettle, he's in replications, he gets hurt sometimes. Though that might be a sort of\u2026 anomalous happening.\" He takes a deep breath. \"Other than that, no I don't think so. Though I'm sure the medical folks could answer that better than me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. And your boss.\" She pulls a paper out of her satchel to double check her notes. \"Ms. Amelia Torosyan-Deering. How lenient would you say she is with with the Foundation health and safety guidelines?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's uh- Mrs. actually. And she's not lenient at all, she makes sure everything is right up to code! Maybe even above code!\" Now he has some energy to him; he quickly tacks on, \"But y'know she doesn't overwork us, treats us all fairly. <em>Shut up, Doug.</em>\" He whispers that last part.</p>\n<p>If Elstrom had any desire to join this conversation, she'd point out that Deering is incredibly biased. But she doesn't and it goes unspoken. Her foot <em>tap tap taps</em> against the ground as this impromptu interview continues. She checks her watch, the wall clock, her watch again. It's not as though they're particularly low on time, it's still early and there's still tomorrow to finish this, but there's something hot burning in her veins.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 and would you say-\" Deering gestures for Al-Khafaji to stop, perhaps sensing Elstrom's impatience.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry I uh, I don't mind talking but I should get moving. I hope your inspection goes well.\" He pushes the cart forward without much struggle.</p>\n<p>\"Alright! Have a good day!\" She waves him off. \"And you too!\" She says to the mirror before the mirror monster promptly disappears.</p>\n<p>\"Usually people are a little more\u2026 off put by him,\" Elstrom says, watching Deering go.</p>\n<p>\"Him? He seemed rather normal.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not him per se, the thing following him.\"</p>\n<p>From her satchel Al-Khafaji pulls out a pamphlet. \"I was given this before arriving. Nice little explanation of your containment habits. Though, it's not too different from how things are done back home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that so? What sort of anomalies are contained in Qena?\"</p>\n<p>\"We hardly contain at all! A lot of the things your people call <em>anomalous</em> are what my home would call <em>superstitions</em>. Rarely is anything so harmful it must be hidden.\" She says as though it's completely obvious, which it very well might be.</p>\n<p>\"Hm, it never occurred to me that there would be\u2026 different types of normalcy.\" They're talking now, Elstrom realizes, her heart jumping into her throat. They're talking and she should say it, <em>say it now</em>! \"Are in interested in dinner tonight?\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji gives her a funny look. \"I'm interested in dinner every night.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom swallows. \"My home. Tonight.\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji smiles, her cheeks pushing up her eyes. \"Now that just sounds wonderful!\"</p>\n\n<p>Elstrom crosses her dorm again. She's counted: it takes twenty long strides to go from her bedroom door, to the kitchen fridge, to her bedroom door again. This she time makes the trek in nineteen steps, which is strange because she would expect it to take an even amount of steps no matter what. Which corner did she cut the first time that she didn't the second time?</p>\n<p>Something much more important comes knocking on her door. One of the chefs from the cafeteria pushes in a cart with four dishes, still steaming hot. \"Put everything on the dining table except the dessert. You can put that in the kitchen,\" Elstrom says as she pulls out her wallet.</p>\n<p>\"Got it,\" says the chef. They place three dishes on the table: a plate of six hawawshi sandwiches, a dish of Koshari, and a dish of Egyptian Moussaka. The two glasses, Elstrom had made a specific request for the nicest dishware they had, of Roz Bel Laban go the the kitchen. \"You've got a nice place here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks,\" she replies politely. Most of the clutter that's usually spread across her dorm has been moved to her bedroom and living room where it will hopefully go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Contacting the cafeteria staff for personal calls like this was hardly out of the ordinary, but Elstrom had called in about and hour and a half earlier with a very strict time frame and a rather unorthodox order. This would cost her, but between having her date crashed by a sentient boat or finding herself in her twenties again, a simple dinner in the comfort of her own home is priceless.</p>\n<p>She places two thousand dollars in the chef's hands to be divided amongst the staff. The chef lets out a low whistle, counting and recounting just to make sure they had that number correct.</p>\n<p>\"Pleasure doing business with you, ma'am!\" they tip their hat on their way out.</p>\n<p>Now the real waiting begins and Elstrom returns to her pacing with fervor. If she keeps moving she doesn't have to ask herself <em>why</em> the idea of meeting with Al-Khafaji brings her such anxiety. It's only the first time she's let someone into her private space in\u2026 And it's not like it's any scarier than the dates she usually goes on. Not that this is a date! Very much <em>not a date</em>! Just a\u2026 dinner between acquaintances.</p>\n<p>That she just been two grand on\u2026 Which! Might be cheaper than the money she usually spends on dates, often on new clothes before and after, which makes this all reasonable!</p>\n<p>A knock on the door. Elstrom dabs the sweat from her forehead, double checks her makeup, and opens the door. Al-Khafaji is leaning up against the door frame, wearing a brown striped button down with a pressed violet pinned over her heart. The sleeves are rolled up, showing off those strong forearms of hers and that intricate tattoo on her forearm. It's almost <em>infuriating</em> how well she makes such a simple outfit look.</p>\n<p>It's most certainly <em>fury</em> that's making Elstrom's entire body so warm\u2026</p>\n<p>\"I knew I smelled something <em>real</em> good on my way here. You didn't go all out for little ole me, did you?\" she asks with a flutter of her eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\"No, of course not,\" she says perhaps a little too quickly and far too defensively. Al-Khafaji's demeanor wavers. \"Come in.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh wow, you really did go all out!\" she exclaims as she observes the table spread. \"Do we say grace and just dig in?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm\u2026 not Christian.\"</p>\n<p>\"I would hope not.\" She sits and breathes in the air. \"Alhamdulillah, it's like I'm on the streets back home. Is this homemade?\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom pauses. \"Yes.\" Not a lie, it was made here, in her home at Site-43.</p>\n<p>\"You are wonderful!\" she says, clasping her hands together. \"Forgive me, but I've always had preference for women who can cook.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom lifts her glass of sparkling water to her lips, coolly deflecting this discussion.</p>\n<p>\"May I?\" she asks, hand hovering over the hawawshi.</p>\n<p>\"Do help yourself.\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji loads her plate and Elstrom does the same. This is the part of the not-date where she's supposed to make small talk, but she's never spoken small in her life. And she's far too preoccupied with watching Al-Khafaji's hands move and her lips part to figure out how to do it now.</p>\n<p>\"What do you do for fun?\" she asks between bites, catching Elstrom off guard. She has no pre-scripted line for this question; in fact, she has no answer at all.</p>\n<p>\"You first.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, making <em>me</em> carry the conversation, huh? I see how it is.\" She tilts her head slightly upward when she's thinking. \"I've gained a fascination for styles of architecture.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that so?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose when you spend your job in so many different buildings, picking all the little flaws out, you start to notice what the buildings themselves look like.\" She punctuates her sentences by taking a drink. \"You may have seen me taking photos of your site, soon I'll have the exact words to describe it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I had assumed those were for your work. I'd never considered that there's anything special to how a building appears.\" She tabs her nails rhythmically against the table. \"What's your favorite style?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm\u2026 googie.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom chokes on a surprised chuckle. \"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"It was a style I encountered while inspecting America's <em>Las Vegas</em>. It's what you may call a type of futurist architecture, it's all about angles but also curves and arches.\" She shakes her head. \"Perhaps not the most interesting choice, but that name certainly got a laugh out of you!\"</p>\n<p>\"Without context it sounds quite strange.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure. But that's enough out of me.\" The table creeks as Al-Khafaji leans forward and puts her weight on it. \"You can not keep up this air of mysticism you're so found of forever. Tell me, what do you do for fun.\"</p>\n<p>She opens her mouth and keeps it open for several seconds. \"I\u2026 don't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm?\"</p>\n<p>\"I go on dates occasionally, and I buy new clothes. But\u2026 that's not really fun, is it?\" she asks herself out loud, as though this is the first time she's come to this conclusion.</p>\n<p>The chair legs scrape against the floor as Al-Khafaji shifts uncomfortably. \"Clothes? I've noticed the fancy fabrics on you. Why don't you tell me about that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I don't know all the fashion terms like you might with architecture. However, I often buy anything new and high end I can get my hands on. So, I have quite the wardrobe, so to speak.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that so? Well I certainly wouldn't mind a fashion show, if you'd ever like to show off.\" Al-Khafaji raises her glass to her lips and wiggles her eyebrows. Elstrom thinks about it, and then she thinks about the mess she spent today shoving into her bedroom, and shame boils up inside of her.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps another time.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see, you're not the type to just let anyone into your bedroom.\"</p>\n<p>By this point they've cleared their plates, or at least Al-Khafaji has and Elstrom has had her fill. She stands and steps into the kitchen, returning with the Roz Bal Laban. Al-Khafaji throws her head back with a laugh.</p>\n<p>\"When I think I can't be spoiled enough! You'll make me rotten at this rate!\" She takes the glass graciously.</p>\n<p>\"Believe me, you could be far more spoiled.\" Elstrom nudges her pudding with a spoon, more interested in watching Al-Khafaji for longer. She could not stomach another bite, but there's joy to be had in watching someone else enjoy themselves.</p>\n<p>As their dinner comes to a close, they both raise to their feet. Elstrom is about to speak, but Al-Khafaji beats her to the punch. She puts her hand on Elstrom's hip and Elstrom is helpless.</p>\n<p>\"Karen,\" her heart skips a beat hearing her name on the other woman's lips, \"You have given me a wonderful night, and you are undeniably beautiful. I must show you my affection.\" She leans in, pressing their chests together, and sealing them in a kiss.</p>\n<p>In half a second Elstrom realizes three very important things. One, Al-Khafaji is very warm. Burning even with how much she radiates and fills the space around her. Two, this is the first time a date non-date has ever made it to a kiss. The kiss is nice too, like they were made to be slotted together. Three, this is the most terrified Elstrom has ever been in her life.</p>\n<p>The moment that half a second ends, she puts her entire strength into shoving Al-Khafaji off. She stumbles back, catching herself on the table, and looks back with the expression of a kicked puppy. Elstrom pants and trembles and stares back with wide eyes. Slowly, Al-Khafaji straightens herself out.</p>\n<p>\"I see I've misunderstood the situation.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom swallows thickly. \"That's correct.\"</p>\n<p>She gestures to the table. \"Do you care to keep the leftovers?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 you may take them with you.\" She quietly steps into the kitchen, selecting three tupperware containers and handing them over. She turns her back to Al-Khafaji as she fills them up. Al-Khafaji hovers by the door once she's finished.</p>\n<p>\"I apologize for\u2026 making it awkward, so to speak.\"</p>\n<p>This is where Elstrom is to dispense some form of admonishment or forgiveness, but she finds she has neither to give. With a sigh, Al-Khafaji leaves.</p>\n\n<p>At eight fourteen in the morning Elstrom rolls over in bed and picks her phone off of the nightstand. \"Hello, I've come down with a stomach bug this morning and I won't be coming to work today. Anything important can be left on my desk until tomorrow.\" She doesn't need to act to make herself sound sick, and it's a common enough occurrence that McInnis won't ask for proof.</p>\n<p>In ten hours Al-Khafaji will be done with her report and she'll be gone from this site for good. Those ten hours can't move fast enough in her opinion. If she were to be smart about this, she'd use this free time she's given herself to make something presentable of her home. And yet all she can get herself to do is wrap herself even tighter in her blanket.</p>\n<p>Logically, this shouldn't bother her. It's hardly the first time a fellow coworker hit on her, hell it's not even the first time a fellow woman has hit on her. Yet something in her stomach aches, not the usual sick she feels, but like something is eating her. Like something has been eating her for years.</p>\n<p>Images of that bar bathed in purple lights keep flashing in her mind. She just can't stop thinking about the music, about Aubrey's hand in hers, about the lipstick mark on her cheek, about how causally she went in for the kiss, like she knew exactly what she wanted.</p>\n<p>She can't stop thinking about <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/transposthumousism\">Quinn Law</a>.</p>\n<p>Quinn Law appeared in front of Elstrom when she was still reeling in the death of her most recent horrible date. <em>There's a woman who knows exactly where she is in the world,</em> Elstrom thought as Law took her my the arm and dragged her across Three Portlands.</p>\n<p>Law was beautiful, <em>is</em> beautiful. And confident in a way Elstrom could never be. Whether fueled by bravery or ignorance, Law went through every area like she knew she belonged there. And she looked at Elstrom, the woman she thought Elstrom was, with such affection. Like there was something in her, something real, that could be desired.</p>\n<p>And it never could've worked out.</p>\n<p>Law was taken for one, which isn't necessarily an obstacle. Monogamy is an outdated practice and Elstrom has seen firsthand how open and non-conventional relationships can work. But it's simply not what appeals to her.</p>\n<p>Law was also UIU. Even if Elstrom could handle the distance between 3ports and Canada, a relationship between a UIU agent and a Foundation bureaucrat just wouldn't work out. The hostilities between their two groups, on top of the responsibilities placed on both, it would just be too much.</p>\n<p>And most of all\u2026 Elstrom was afraid. Afraid of what Law saw when she looked at her with affection. And afraid even more so that what Law was seeing was a total fabrication, a projection of what <em>could</em> be there. Afraid of what Law would do when she found that there was simply nothing worth loving about Elstrom at all.</p>\n<p>Instead of saying any of that, she looked Law in the eyes and said, \"I prefer men.\" And Law looked away, already a million worlds away from her.</p>\n<p>If Elstrom could tell herself that it simply never could've happened, then its absence doesn't have to hurt.</p>\n<p>There's a knock at her dorm's door. The sound shocks her out of her thoughts. Surely no one would have a single good reason to bother her at this time, and yet they insist on knocking again. Like a ghost, Elstrom raises from her bed, dragging her tangled up blankets and sheets with her.</p>\n<p>Something smells good. Spending the day rotting in bed has left her starving. Opening the door just a crack reveals McInnis, some sort of dish cradled in his arms.</p>\n<p>\"I hope I didn't wake you.\"</p>\n<p>\"You didn't,\" she says, hoarse.</p>\n<p>\"Good. I brought you something I hope will make you feel a little better today.\" He shoulders the door open and places the dish in her hands. It's a macaroni and cheese, the cheese is gooey and streaming, freshly home cooked.</p>\n<p>It's thoughtful enough to bring a tear to her eye.</p>\n<p>More than that even.</p>\n<p>\"Did I offend?\" his hand hesitantly hovers over her shoulder, like if he touches her she'll shatter into dust. She backs up, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>\n<p>Aubrey's face appears in her vision. The dish is warm against Elstrom's chest and she's thinking about Aubrey embracing her, that moment where their bodies pressed together, right before Elstrom pulled away. How she wishes she had to foresight to wrap her arms around Aubrey's waist and pull her closer.</p>\n<p>And Elstrom can picture herself waking up in the morning and sitting across from her and happily eating breakfast every morning.</p>\n<p>\"I just realized I have to do something!\" She slams the door shut in his face and runs to set down the dish and put on shoes. Any shoes will do.</p>\n<p>It's almost five pm, Al-Khafaji should still be on site, if only Elstrom could get there a little quicker\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Al-Khafaji sits on the edge of a parking lot, clicking her pen rhythmically. There's a warm space welcome to her back inside the site, but she would rather wait for the helicopter to come pick her up out here. She looks at her watch again and it tells her it's been a full minute since she looked at her watch last.</p>\n<p>She takes in a deep breath of the cold evening air and lets it all out in a huff. In the distance she can hear the hum of a helicopter blade, and see the tiny black dot in the sky grow ever larger. Raising to her feet, she brushes the dust off her pants, ready to rid herself of this place.</p>\n<p>\"Aubrey!\" Al-Khafaji stops in her tracks and reels her head around. Pulling down her visor to block out the sun, she spots another little dot approaching her. Elstrom comes to a stop before her, breathing loudly, hunched over with her hands on her knees.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Elstrom, I thought you were sick,\" she says with a playful, yet professional tone, the way one might joke with a total stranger. She turns just slightly to avoid looking Elstrom in the eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I need to say something to you.\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji looks over her shoulder with a weary frown. \"Well don't feel the need to hurry.\"</p>\n<p>Elstrom freezes, standing up straight like a deer in the headlights. She looks a bit like a deer that wasn't quick enough getting out of the road. Her hair is unkempt, she's still in her uniform from yesterday with is now soaked in sweat and sticking to her skin, and she hasn't done her make-up, showing up every wrinkle to the world. And she needs to say <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>After a minute of silence, Al-Khafaji sighs and turns her back to Elstrom. \"Look, Karen, you're a beautiful woman. But I know the sort of person you are, and I'm just not interested in getting caught up in whatever argument you're having with yourself. Either you <em>know</em> what you want, or you don't.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know what I want.\" Before she can stop herself, she goes in for a hug. Al-Khafaji tenses, more out of shock than discomfort. \"I've known what I've wanted for a long time now, and I was unfair to you. I'm so sorry for that.\"</p>\n<p>She shoulders Elstrom off so she can turn to face her. She looks her up and down, taking in every flaw in Elstrom's appearance. \"Wow, you really mean that, huh?\" Behind her the helicopter touches the ground and she glances nervously at it.</p>\n<p>Elstrom nods. \"I think you're the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I should've told you that. And I don't want you to leave.\" <em>Not now, not when she's finally let herself have this.</em></p>\n<p>\"Look, you know I can't stay. We've both got jobs to do, places to be.\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Dr. Al-Khafaji, what's the hold up!\"</em> calls the pilot over the whirl of the helicopter.</p>\n<p>She swallows, a single tear running down her cheek. \"Is that it then?\"</p>\n<p>Al-Khafaji looks at the helicopter, and then back at Elstrom, and then at the pen in her hand. \"It doesn't have to be.\" She takes Elstrom's wrist, pulls her arm and start, and scrawls her number across her forearm. Elstrom gasps and tenses at the pen's point digs into her skin.</p>\n<p>\"Aubrey\u2026\" she mumbles.</p>\n<p>\"Send me a message when I touch down in two hours, okay? Don't be shy!\" She smiles and waves her off as she makes a run to get on the helicopter. Elstrom stands there, letting the winds blow all around her, as Al-Khafaji lifts off into the air.</p>\n<p>She wishes she had kissed her.</p>\n\n<p><em>Breathe Elstrom, keep it together.</em></p>\n<div class=\"text-container-wrap\">\n<div class=\"text-container\">\n<div class=\"sent\">\n<p><span class=\"text\"><strong>K_Elstrom</strong><br/>\nHello, this is Dr. Elstrom.

His hair is clean and styled, tastefully slicked back. He looks like a character in a movie, except he's real and he's sitting right across from her. It's well into the evening, the sky dark, they're sitting outside an Italian restaurant. Elstrom would have preferred to be //inside// somewhere a bit nicer, but she can stomach Italian just fine. The way the surrounding fairy lights reflect off his big brown eyes is cute. \n\n\n\n\"So, your profile was a bit vague on what you do for a living,\" he says. He's got an accent, French maybe? It's nice, just enough to sound attractive without being too thick or forced. \n\n\n\n\"I work as an administrator for a large, privately owned company.\" Close enough to the truth. \"And you?\"\n\n\n\n\"I work in sales for a tech manufacturing company.\" Sounds like there's money in that. Good money too by the looks of his freshly pressed suit. She's never been particularly hurting for cash, but financial stability is always a sexy trait. Rich, well dressed, an hour into the date without a single perverted comment...\n\n\n\nThis man might be perfect.\n\n\n\nAnd then he laughs, throwing his head back, his mouth far too wide, too many teeth. Elstrom can barely remember what it is she said, too distracted staring up his nose. There's something deeply unpleasant about seeing him from the angle. What a grating sound to accompany it, and now that she thinks about it, his accent is annoying. And his teeth are far too white, the light is shining off of them. \n\n\n\nAs she thinks about it more... //sales for a tech manufacturing company?// He had to gall to call her vague? That suit could be rented, this whole air of competency an act. He'll pay for this first date, and then hold it over her head next time. That suit looks raggedy anyway, even if he's got good money he has poor taste. He could use a better barber too, and a different scent of cologne, and more interesting food preferences. \n\n\n\nAnd his smile is weird. Shows off only his top row of teeth.\n\n\n\nAnd his cheeks are too thin. Too much emphasis on his jawline.\n\n\n\nAnd Elstrom can't picture herself waking up in the morning and sitting across from him and happily eating breakfast every morning.\n\n\n\n\"I had a lovely night,\" he says, taking her by the hand. Too firm, too warm. \"I'd love to meet up again. Perhaps for coffee?\"\n\n\n\nShe grimaces, teeth bared. \"No thank you. I appreciate your time, but I don't think we'll be meeting again.\"\n\n\n\nHe frowns, shoulders slumping, but he plasters on a smile anyway. \"I understand. I hope this was a good time for you nonetheless.\" He shakes her hand and with his head hung low, he politely leaves her be. She pictures him slumping away into a moldy apartment, dirty and unattractive, complaining to his similarly sloppy friends about some //bitch// he went on a date with the other night, and she feels no regret ending this night. \n\n\n\nShe walks home shrouded in darkness, feeling the same as she always does.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nHeavy bags hang under her eyes. She's never quite been able to get rid of them, but a layer of concealer usually does the trick. While she's contemplating her most recent failed romance, McInnis passes by her desk and pauses, a sheet of paper in his hand. \n\n\n\n\"A health inspector will be at the site in twenty minutes. I hate to spring this on you, but would you greet them and show them around the site for the next few days? I may find myself busy.\" He places the paper on top of what Elstrom is already looking at.\n\n\n\nThere's nothing she would like to do //less// than greet someone new, however McInnis has always been too //kind// to just outright say no to on matters like this. Fuck him really for just being naturally nice and charismatic. \"Alright.\"\n\n\n\n\"Try to make a good impression for us,\" he says with a friendly sort of smile and then leaves her be. \n\n\n\nAfter fifteen minutes, she begins her trek towards the site entrance. According to the paper, the inspector's name is Aubrey Al-Khafaji. Elstrom can already picture the sort of man this //Al-Khafaji// will be. He'll show up well-dressed in a suit and clipboard, oozing with professionalism. He'll try to make nice small talk around the site. Then, when they're alone, he'll make his true intentions known like the real creep he is. //Like every single other person they send to this site.//\n\n\n\n//She should've just passed this off to someone else... too late now.//\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji is waiting for her, in a suit and holding a clipboard like Elstrom guessed, a tasteful leather satchel around his shoulders. He's a portly man, bit shorter than Elstrom, with black skin and a visor pinning an afro out of his face. He smiles as she approaches, the wrinkles around his lips and eyes indicating he's one to smile often. Hand outstretched to take hers, Al-Khafaji speaks and Elstrom realizes she made one snap judgement far too quickly.\n\n\n\n//This Al-Khafaji is a woman.//\n\n\n\n\"Good to finally see someone! Though, I figure you're not Allen McInnis,\" she says like they're sharing some sort of joke. She has an accent, not one Elstrom immediately recognizes, but possibly Arabic? She takes her hand, her mind lagging as she decides her next move. \n\n\n\n\"I'm not, however I will be the one showing you around today. I'm Karen Elstrom, Karen is fine.\" Karen is fine? Since when is //Karen fine//? Why did she say that? \n\n\n\n\"Well then, Karen, Aubrey Al-Khafaji at your service!\" She gives Elstrom's hand a hardy shake. \"Feel free to lead the way! Lot of ground to cover.\"\n\n\n\nKeeping her posture straight and her head forward, Elstrom marches down the halls. Now that this interaction has begun, it's her next goal to end it as quickly as possible. There's a comfortable well of solitude waiting for her at her desk.\n\n\n\nThey pass by each department, Al-Khafaji pausing their tour to chat with the department director and take notes on her clipboard. While she's taking notes on the state of Theology and Teleology, Elstrom clears her throat and asks, \"Why does the Foundation need a health inspector?\" It sounded a lot less rude in her head.\n\n\n\n\"Are you kidding? I would say the Foundation needs health inspectors more than anyone.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom stiffens, uncomfortable. \"I meant, we have Janitorial and Maintenance. Doesn't that cover health and safety?\"\n\n\n\n\"You would think! But someone-\" she taps her chest with her pen, \"-impartial has to make sure certain health standards are //actually// being met. There's a lot more dangers to working than whatever horrors you have locked up here.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom nods once. \"Logical enough.\"\n\n\n\nThey continue on to Replication Studies. While they're idling by the break room, Dr. Wettle passes by holding a mug and strikes his head against an open cabinet door. Elstrom winces, sucking in a breath through her teeth. She never quite got the same //pleasure// out of seeing Wettle hurt himself as her peers, she found it more... //pitiful.// Al-Khafaji on the other hand stops what she's doing and rushes forward.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, are you alright?\" she reaches up to put a hand on Wettle's shoulder. \n\n\n\n\"What?\" he asks that it's the first time he's ever heard those words. \"Yes I'm fine. I just-\" he bumps his elbow against the counter and dumps his coffee onto her. Al-Khafaji gasps and backs up. \"I'm so sorry about that!\" He grabs a large handful of napkins and presses them into her chest. He then appears to think about where he's putting his hands, recoils, and dumps the rest of his coffee on himself. \"Fuck!\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey buddy, it's fine!\" she says. \n\n\n\nHe groans. \"Sorry.\" Deciding he's made enough of a fool of himself, he turns around and leaves, empty mug in hand. \n\n\n\n\"Bewildering...\" Al-Khafaji gathers up the napkins and drops them in the trash.\n\n\n\n\"Your shirt,\" Elstrom says, for once at a total loss. \n\n\n\n\"Don't worry about it. Trust me, lukewarm coffee doesn't even make the list of the worst things people have spilled on me at work.\" She unbuttons her suit jacket and swings it over her shoulder. \n\n\n\n\"There's a bathroom over here.\" She gently takes her arm and leads her to said bathroom. Arms crossed behind her back, she waits by a stall for Al-Khafaji. The strangest feeling passes over her; the urge to fill the silence. \"So, what's the worst mess you've ever been in while working?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, now you're making me think.\" Al-Khafaji cocks her head to one side in thought. \"Maybe not the worst mess, but I was watching these folks clean the kitchen at one of those big sites, the sort of sites where all of the staff live on site. They were moving this //huge// tub of grease somewhere to dispose of it, they were showing me where they put their waste you see, and apparently this tub-\" she makes a series of hand motions, miming out the shape of this tub, \"- wasn't secure and, Allahumma a'inni, they dumped the whole thing right on me and the folks carrying it around.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji laughs and Elstrom clutches her stomach. She can barely stand the feeling of scraping the grease off her pans at home. The thought of gallons of it getting on her, all of it's sliminess on her skin, makes her want to vomit more than anything else.\n\n\n\n\"You alright over there?\"\n\n\n\nElstrom notices her gaze and straightens up. \"Yes, I'm fine.\" She waves her hand, dismissing Al-Khafaji's concern and clearing the air. \n\n\n\n\"Right.\" A pause. \"Sooo, after I'm done with my report I was thinking of doing a bit of a bar crawl, checking out a few of the local places. Would you care to come with?\"\n\n\n\nElstrom's throat closes up. She had expected this sort of advancement, but that was of course before she realized she'd be showing around another woman. \"Don't you think... fraternizing after work would be a conflict of interest?\"\n\n\n\n\"What? No, why would it be?\" \n\n\n\nElstrom thinks for a moment, trying to find the perfect excuse for why she can't. It's been a well crafted skill; coming up with the perfect realistic sounding prior engagement to get out of any situation. But, as she mills over the options, she finds she doesn't actually want to deny this invitation. When does that ever get an opportunity like this? A social call with no expectations.\n\n\n\n\"I... suppose if I have nothing else going on tonight.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji clasps her hands together. \"Wonderful! Now then, I think I'd like you to show me where I'll be staying tonight.\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nElstrom steps off the taxi, heels clicking against the asphalt. Al-Khafaji emailed her hours earlier with details and this looks like the right place, with its flashy sign and music she can feel through the ground. There's still time for her to turn around, get back in the taxi, send Al-Khafaji an apologetic message justifying her absence.\n\n\n\nJust by coming here she's made up her mind.\n\n\n\nPassing over the door frame is like stepping into a new world, and she's literally stepped into other worlds before. Everything is bathed in purple light, the air smells sweet like soda syrup, and there's not a single man in sight. Like a fish out of water, Elstrom makes her way forward, for once very aware of how she's being looked at.\n\n\n\nSite-43 prided itself on it's inclusiveness. People forget that among all the unpopular budget cuts and policy changes, Elstrom also has a hand in every anti-discrimination rule that allowed everyone to have their //gay old time//. Elstrom is, of course, familiar with aspects of lesbian culture, such as being butch or other aspects of gender nonconformity as it pertained to her job. But knowing about it is far different from... being invited to participate. \n\n\n\nThere's a seat waiting for her across from Al-Khafaji, an icy purple drink placed in front of her. While Elstrom dressed up for this invitation, Al-Khafaji dressed down. She's in a t-shirt that reveals a pair of strong arms and a tattoo on her right forearm. It's hard to tell what it's depicting, but she is momentarily captured by how well the gold patterning shows up and reflects the lights.\n\n\n\n\"Like what you see?\" she asks with that playful tone of hers. Elstrom is momentarily frozen. \"Come, sit. Don't look so frightened.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am... comfortable admitting I'm rather out of my depth here.\" At the very least, being so far out of her depth means she's at no risk of running into one of her colleagues here. Hopefully.\n\n\n\n\"No one here will bite without consent, I promise you that.\" She nudges the untouched drink closer to her. \"Take and enjoy yourself a little! Watch the dancers!\" \n\n\n\nElstrom takes her drink and turns her head towards the dance floor. It's not a large space, but the few people there are certainly putting it to good use. None of them are //good// dancers, but they are earnest. Something about that //earnestness// both demands her attention and has her flushed and looking away. She focuses her attention on Al-Khafaji's tattoo, like staring at it will reveal a hidden image within it. \n\n\n\n\"Have something you'd like to say?\" Al-Khafaji asks, staring at her as she takes a drink. \n\n\n\n\"I was curious about your tattoo, I couldn't tell what it was in this lighting.\"\n\n\n\nShe looks at her arm, then holds it out for Elstrom to observe. Elstrom gingerly takes her hand in hers. \"Was something an old friend designed for me,\" she explains, \"Based on the staff of Anubis, I'm sure you're familiar.\" She traces out the shape in the air. \"The pattern work is all hers.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see,\" Elstrom nods, letting go. \"Do the patterns have any particular meaning? They're not memetic, I hope?\"\n\n\n\n\"You take me for one to tattoo a memetic hazard to my body.\" She shakes her head, still smiling. \"That pattern has no meaning, not anymore. I have some other tattoos I wouldn't mind showing off, but we may need to go somewhere a bit more private.\" She winks, effortlessly sliding from gently somber to flirty.\n\n\n\n\"In my work it's hardly an unreasonable question,\" she says, pointedly ignoring the rest of that sentence.\n\n\n\n\"I see. I must ask, how did you end up working here? For your Site-43?\"\n\n\n\nElstrom looks around, unsure of how much she should say in a veiled space such as this. \"Director McInnis found me unwittingly [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/11-turnover working for an anomalous bank]. Offered me a job soon after.\"\n\n\n\n\"Anomalous bank? Sounds interesting.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was not.\" After a beat, she catches the social cue to ask Al-Khafaji the same, \"So how did you end up working for us?\"\n\n\n\n\"I was born in Qena, Egypt. That is also where my home site is stationed, when I'm not traveling. When I was in college I needed a job, and so one day I appeared at Site-343 with my resume.\" She pauses to empty her glass. \"They gave me a job as a filing clerk, with orders to never open a file! Then, when I graduated, they let me in on what they were really doing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Really? It was that simple for you?\"\n\n\n\nShe shrugs. \"It's a small site, they needed any extra hands they could get. Of course, these days I'm sure I spend more time traveling and looking at sites like yours than I do back home.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you like that? Being so far from home?\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you kidding? It's a dream! I don't think I could ever stay rooted to one spot again.\" She pauses. \"At least, not unless I was //sure// I had something worth settling down for. I'm always willing to have my mind changed.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you don't mind me asking, do your parents know what you do?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose I couldn't stop you from asking even if I did mind!\" She laughs and Elstrom blanches. \"They know I am a health inspector, they need not know much more than that. And yours? I'm sure whatever they know, they are impressed to have such a hard working daughter.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom scoffs. \"They're both still veiled. Last I checked, my father was the sort of college professor other teachers fearmonger about, and my mother did interior design.\" She tugs at her shirt collar. \"My mother gained a fascination in minimalism before that even became common, always obsessed with having as little stuff as possible to avoid clutter. I used to hide all of my toys in case they did not fit her //aesthetic//.\" She pauses, realizing that's not the //funny childhood anecdote// she thought it was. \"I'm sure they think I'm dead.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see...\" Al-Khafaji says, and Elstrom questions why she said so much. She realizes her drink is empty and Al-Khafaji motions for them to move closer to the bar for refills. Elstrom looks down as the bartender approaches and refills their drinks. \n\n\n\n\"I apologize if I have dominated the conversation.\"\n\n\n\nShe smiles, the skin around her nose scrunching up. \"I like hearing you talk.\" She leans in an throws an arm around Elstrom's shoulders, a gesture she would never normally allow if she weren't feeling particularly charitable tonight. \"My mother, in our small kitchen, would cook enough food daily to feed forty families. People would come to our home with dishware and money. My father, he wires houses. A //freelancer// you might call him.\" She cocks her head to the side. \"Now we have both overshared!\"\n\n\n\nAt the end of the night Elstrom finally sees a benefit for wearing multiple layers. A cold breeze passes by, making Al-Khafaji shiver. Elstrom considers stripping off her cardigan and handing it over in some mock imitation of a romantic gesture. She hesitates for too long to make a choice on the matter.\n\n\n\n\"You took a cab here?\"\n\n\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then we can share a ride back home, and I can continue to be in your presence a little longer.\" She rubs her hands together and waves down a taxi. \"If only we were back in Qena, I could take you home on my motorbike.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom has a vision of herself on the back of a bike, speeding down an open road. Her head on Al-Khafaji's shoulder, her hair swept up in the wind, her hands around Al-Khafaji's soft middle. She steps into the back of the taxi in a haze.\n\n\n\nIn the site, they part ways to their respective dorms, but Al-Khafaji takes her by the hand to say her peace. \n\n\n\n\"I'm glad you came out with me! It would have been no fun drinking with strangers.\" She leans in, propped up on her tip toes, and pecks Elstrom on the cheek. Momentarily stunned, Elstrom says nothing as she leaves.\n\n\n\nIn Elstrom's dorm she drags herself past piles of papers and objects to the bathroom. Every time she walks past the mess she's made of her home, she pictures Dr. Ngo's voice in her head, making some statement on how she's subconsciously attempting to rebel against her mother's tendencies via developing a hoarding habit. But she by no means needs a therapist to tell her about her problems, and she's not hurting anyone but herself living like this. \n\n\n\nThe bathroom mirror reveals the imprint of Al-Khafaji's lips on her cheek. She hadn't even realized she was wearing lipstick up until this moment. She presses her fingers against the marking, mind lingering in the hallway outside. \n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nEarly in the morning, Elstrom and McInnis pass by each other on their way to their respective offices. McInnis pauses in his steps and turns to watch her pass him by. She looks odd this morning, not that McInnis would ever judge on appearance alone, but it surprises him to see her unkempt. There's a blotchy marking on her cheek, almost like a bruise.\n\n\n\n\"Karen?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm?\" She turns to face him, revealing the lipstick mark on her cheek. \n\n\n\n\"You've... got something on your cheek.\" He points to his cheek.\n\n\n\nElstrom tenderly touches the marking, mumbling out a soft, \"Oh.\" She turns her back to him and shuffles off to the bathroom and McInnis continues on to his office. \n\n\n\nThe dried splotch comes off with a wet wipe, it would've cleaned off easier if she hadn't slept in it. Now that she thinks about it, she hasn't touched up her make-up, or really done anything to her appearance besides a change of clothes. She simply rolled out of bed. Her //just rolled out of bed// may be the average person's //several hour make-up routine//, but can she really let herself be seen this way? \n\n\n\nCan she really let Al-Khafaji see her this way?\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji's grinning face appears in her vision, and a hot pain creeps up in her stomach. It's different than the usual nausea she gets. It's less like she's going to throw up and more like she's collapsing in on herself. Not willing to take the risk either way, she runs into the nearest stall. \n\n\n\nHer breathing is heavy and labored. That's the thing in these types of situations right, she needs to get her breathing under control. She would take slow, deep breaths, but she's in a public bathroom. She doesn't even like breathing too much in her own bathroom.\n\n\n\n//What the hell is her problem anyway?// Is she so insecure that even the //thought// of showing her natural face brings her to her knees? Or is it simply Al-Khafaji's approval of her that has her sickened? And which is more or less mortifying?\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Elstrom, are you alright in there?\" McInnis calls. Elstrom says nothing, stunned to silence. \"I ask because it's been quite a while, and I can hear you hyperventilating. If you are sick, it would be no trouble to send you home.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm fine, sir.\" She swallows and tells herself she means it.\n\n\n\nAfter a moment of silence, McInnis says, \"If you say so. How is your progress on the inspection?\"\n\n\n\nShe gets out of the stall and splashes a bit of water onto her face. \"There have been no notable incidents, though I couldn't tell you for certain what Dr. Al-Khafaji has been writing.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. I hope the rest goes just as well.\" She hears him start walking away.\n\n\n\n\"Sir! Before you go... could I ask some advice of you?\"\n\n\n\nHe stops. \"Of course you may.\" \n\n\n\n\"There's something that I... want. And even though I have pursued similar things, I... find myself hesitating and I'm not sure why.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sounds like you're nervous about potential consequences. But I believe if you think this //thing//, whatever it is you desire, will make you happy, then you should continue to pursue it. Even if it might not be simple, or entirely painless.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom looks at her hands, pointedly not observing her reflection. \"I see, thank you, sir. That's all.\" After a silence, she hears McInnis's footsteps. When they're no long audible, she runs a hand through her hair to smooth it out, and turns to leave. \n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji is waiting for her outside of Identity and Technocryptography. She waves as Elstrom approaches. Elstrom steels herself, the words she wants to say hanging at the end of her tongue. //Dinner at my place tonight.//\n\n\n\n\"Looking bright and eager this morning!\" She says with a tip of her visor. \"On with the tour?\"\n\n\n\n\"Right.\" //Say it. Say it now.//\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji walks a few paces in front of her, leaving Elstrom to wonder why she even needs a guide when she's clearly capable of navigating herself. Back against the wall, she watches her pull out her phone and start taking pictures. Did she find some sort of issue in the walls and ceiling? She's still now, perfect opportunity to strike up conversation. \n\n\n\n\"Dr. Al-\"\n\n\n\n//THUNK!// \"Oh, goddamn it!\" \n\n\n\nThe exclamation startles both of them, and they both swivel to see Phillip Deering struggling with a janitorial cart. One of the front wheels is twisted at an angle and Deering gives it a few kicks back into place. Prepared to ignore him, Elstrom turns to continue her conversation, but Al-Khafaji walks past her. \n\n\n\n\"Do you need a hand?\"\n\n\n\nDeering looks taken aback. \"Oh, well you don't have to. I've...\" Before he can stutter out a few more dismissals she's already dropped down and twisted the wheel back into place. Deering's mirror monster says something that makes his head jerk in frustration. \n\n\n\n\"Can I ask you a few questions about your experiences working in Janitorial and Maintenance here?\" She leans in, notepad and pen in hand. \n\n\n\nHe looks around and shrugs. \"I guess so. Are we in trouble or something?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, //no//, of course not. It's just my job to assure your health and safety.\" She gives a disarming smile, eyes not even flickering toward the mirrors. \"How often are there injuries on site unrelated to anomalous happenings?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not very often. I mean there's Dr. Wettle, he's in replications, he gets hurt sometimes. Though that might be a sort of... anomalous happening.\" He takes a deep breath. \"Other than that, no I don't think so. Though I'm sure the medical folks could answer that better than me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. And your boss.\" She pulls a paper out of her satchel to double check her notes. \"Ms. Amelia Torosyan-Deering. How lenient would you say she is with with the Foundation health and safety guidelines?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's uh- Mrs. actually. And she's not lenient at all, she makes sure everything is right up to code! Maybe even above code!\" Now he has some energy to him; he quickly tacks on, \"But y'know she doesn't overwork us, treats us all fairly. //Shut up, Doug.//\" He whispers that last part.\n\n\n\nIf Elstrom had any desire to join this conversation, she'd point out that Deering is incredibly biased. But she doesn't and it goes unspoken. Her foot //tap tap taps// against the ground as this impromptu interview continues. She checks her watch, the wall clock, her watch again. It's not as though they're particularly low on time, it's still early and there's still tomorrow to finish this, but there's something hot burning in her veins.\n\n\n\n\"... and would you say-\" Deering gestures for Al-Khafaji to stop, perhaps sensing Elstrom's impatience. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry I uh, I don't mind talking but I should get moving. I hope your inspection goes well.\" He pushes the cart forward without much struggle. \n\n\n\n\"Alright! Have a good day!\" She waves him off. \"And you too!\" She says to the mirror before the mirror monster promptly disappears. \n\n\n\n\"Usually people are a little more... off put by him,\" Elstrom says, watching Deering go.\n\n\n\n\"Him? He seemed rather normal.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not him per se, the thing following him.\"\n\n\n\nFrom her satchel Al-Khafaji pulls out a pamphlet. \"I was given this before arriving. Nice little explanation of your containment habits. Though, it's not too different from how things are done back home.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that so? What sort of anomalies are contained in Qena?\"\n\n\n\n\"We hardly contain at all! A lot of the things your people call //anomalous// are what my home would call //superstitions//. Rarely is anything so harmful it must be hidden.\" She says as though it's completely obvious, which it very well might be.\n\n\n\n\"Hm, it never occurred to me that there would be... different types of normalcy.\" They're talking now, Elstrom realizes, her heart jumping into her throat. They're talking and she should say it, //say it now//! \"Are in interested in dinner tonight?\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji gives her a funny look. \"I'm interested in dinner every night.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom swallows. \"My home. Tonight.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji smiles, her cheeks pushing up her eyes. \"Now that just sounds wonderful!\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nElstrom crosses her dorm again. She's counted: it takes twenty long strides to go from her bedroom door, to the kitchen fridge, to her bedroom door again. This she time makes the trek in nineteen steps, which is strange because she would expect it to take an even amount of steps no matter what. Which corner did she cut the first time that she didn't the second time?\n\n\n\nSomething much more important comes knocking on her door. One of the chefs from the cafeteria pushes in a cart with four dishes, still steaming hot. \"Put everything on the dining table except the dessert. You can put that in the kitchen,\" Elstrom says as she pulls out her wallet. \n\n\n\n\"Got it,\" says the chef. They place three dishes on the table: a plate of six hawawshi sandwiches, a dish of Koshari, and a dish of Egyptian Moussaka. The two glasses, Elstrom had made a specific request for the nicest dishware they had, of Roz Bel Laban go the the kitchen. \"You've got a nice place here.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" she replies politely. Most of the clutter that's usually spread across her dorm has been moved to her bedroom and living room where it will hopefully go unnoticed.\n\n\n\nContacting the cafeteria staff for personal calls like this was hardly out of the ordinary, but Elstrom had called in about and hour and a half earlier with a very strict time frame and a rather unorthodox order. This would cost her, but between having her date crashed by a sentient boat or finding herself in her twenties again, a simple dinner in the comfort of her own home is priceless.\n\n\n\nShe places two thousand dollars in the chef's hands to be divided amongst the staff. The chef lets out a low whistle, counting and recounting just to make sure they had that number correct.\n\n\n\n\"Pleasure doing business with you, ma'am!\" they tip their hat on their way out.\n\n\n\nNow the real waiting begins and Elstrom returns to her pacing with fervor. If she keeps moving she doesn't have to ask herself //why// the idea of meeting with Al-Khafaji brings her such anxiety. It's only the first time she's let someone into her private space in... And it's not like it's any scarier than the dates she usually goes on. Not that this is a date! Very much //not a date//! Just a... dinner between acquaintances. \n\n\n\nThat she just been two grand on... Which! Might be cheaper than the money she usually spends on dates, often on new clothes before and after, which makes this all reasonable!\n\n\n\nA knock on the door. Elstrom dabs the sweat from her forehead, double checks her makeup, and opens the door. Al-Khafaji is leaning up against the door frame, wearing a brown striped button down with a pressed violet pinned over her heart. The sleeves are rolled up, showing off those strong forearms of hers and that intricate tattoo on her forearm. It's almost //infuriating// how well she makes such a simple outfit look.\n\n\n\nIt's most certainly //fury// that's making Elstrom's entire body so warm...\n\n\n\n\"I knew I smelled something //real// good on my way here. You didn't go all out for little ole me, did you?\" she asks with a flutter of her eyelashes. \n\n\n\n\"No, of course not,\" she says perhaps a little too quickly and far too defensively. Al-Khafaji's demeanor wavers. \"Come in.\" \n\n\n\n\"Oh wow, you really did go all out!\" she exclaims as she observes the table spread. \"Do we say grace and just dig in?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm... not Christian.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would hope not.\" She sits and breathes in the air. \"Alhamdulillah, it's like I'm on the streets back home. Is this homemade?\"\n\n\n\nElstrom pauses. \"Yes.\" Not a lie, it was made here, in her home at Site-43. \n\n\n\n\"You are wonderful!\" she says, clasping her hands together. \"Forgive me, but I've always had preference for women who can cook.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom lifts her glass of sparkling water to her lips, coolly deflecting this discussion.\n\n\n\n\"May I?\" she asks, hand hovering over the hawawshi.\n\n\n\n\"Do help yourself.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji loads her plate and Elstrom does the same. This is the part of the not-date where she's supposed to make small talk, but she's never spoken small in her life. And she's far too preoccupied with watching Al-Khafaji's hands move and her lips part to figure out how to do it now. \n\n\n\n\"What do you do for fun?\" she asks between bites, catching Elstrom off guard. She has no pre-scripted line for this question; in fact, she has no answer at all. \n\n\n\n\"You first.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, making //me// carry the conversation, huh? I see how it is.\" She tilts her head slightly upward when she's thinking. \"I've gained a fascination for styles of architecture.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose when you spend your job in so many different buildings, picking all the little flaws out, you start to notice what the buildings themselves look like.\" She punctuates her sentences by taking a drink. \"You may have seen me taking photos of your site, soon I'll have the exact words to describe it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I had assumed those were for your work. I'd never considered that there's anything special to how a building appears.\" She tabs her nails rhythmically against the table. \"What's your favorite style?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm... googie.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom chokes on a surprised chuckle. \"What?\"\n\n\n\n\"It was a style I encountered while inspecting America's //Las Vegas//. It's what you may call a type of futurist architecture, it's all about angles but also curves and arches.\" She shakes her head. \"Perhaps not the most interesting choice, but that name certainly got a laugh out of you!\"\n\n\n\n\"Without context it sounds quite strange.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure. But that's enough out of me.\" The table creeks as Al-Khafaji leans forward and puts her weight on it. \"You can not keep up this air of mysticism you're so found of forever. Tell me, what do you do for fun.\"\n\n\n\nShe opens her mouth and keeps it open for several seconds. \"I... don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\n\n\"I go on dates occasionally, and I buy new clothes. But... that's not really fun, is it?\" she asks herself out loud, as though this is the first time she's come to this conclusion.\n\n\n\nThe chair legs scrape against the floor as Al-Khafaji shifts uncomfortably. \"Clothes? I've noticed the fancy fabrics on you. Why don't you tell me about that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I don't know all the fashion terms like you might with architecture. However, I often buy anything new and high end I can get my hands on. So, I have quite the wardrobe, so to speak.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that so? Well I certainly wouldn't mind a fashion show, if you'd ever like to show off.\" Al-Khafaji raises her glass to her lips and wiggles her eyebrows. Elstrom thinks about it, and then she thinks about the mess she spent today shoving into her bedroom, and shame boils up inside of her.\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps another time.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see, you're not the type to just let anyone into your bedroom.\"\n\n\n\nBy this point they've cleared their plates, or at least Al-Khafaji has and Elstrom has had her fill. She stands and steps into the kitchen, returning with the Roz Bal Laban. Al-Khafaji throws her head back with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\"When I think I can't be spoiled enough! You'll make me rotten at this rate!\" She takes the glass graciously.\n\n\n\n\"Believe me, you could be far more spoiled.\" Elstrom nudges her pudding with a spoon, more interested in watching Al-Khafaji for longer. She could not stomach another bite, but there's joy to be had in watching someone else enjoy themselves. \n\n\n\nAs their dinner comes to a close, they both raise to their feet. Elstrom is about to speak, but Al-Khafaji beats her to the punch. She puts her hand on Elstrom's hip and Elstrom is helpless.\n\n\n\n\"Karen,\" her heart skips a beat hearing her name on the other woman's lips, \"You have given me a wonderful night, and you are undeniably beautiful. I must show you my affection.\" She leans in, pressing their chests together, and sealing them in a kiss. \n\n\n\nIn half a second Elstrom realizes three very important things. One, Al-Khafaji is very warm. Burning even with how much she radiates and fills the space around her. Two, this is the first time a date non-date has ever made it to a kiss. The kiss is nice too, like they were made to be slotted together. Three, this is the most terrified Elstrom has ever been in her life. \n\n\n\nThe moment that half a second ends, she puts her entire strength into shoving Al-Khafaji off. She stumbles back, catching herself on the table, and looks back with the expression of a kicked puppy. Elstrom pants and trembles and stares back with wide eyes. Slowly, Al-Khafaji straightens herself out. \n\n\n\n\"I see I've misunderstood the situation.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom swallows thickly. \"That's correct.\"\n\n\n\nShe gestures to the table. \"Do you care to keep the leftovers?\"\n\n\n\n\"... you may take them with you.\" She quietly steps into the kitchen, selecting three tupperware containers and handing them over. She turns her back to Al-Khafaji as she fills them up. Al-Khafaji hovers by the door once she's finished. \n\n\n\n\"I apologize for... making it awkward, so to speak.\" \n\n\n\nThis is where Elstrom is to dispense some form of admonishment or forgiveness, but she finds she has neither to give. With a sigh, Al-Khafaji leaves.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAt eight fourteen in the morning Elstrom rolls over in bed and picks her phone off of the nightstand. \"Hello, I've come down with a stomach bug this morning and I won't be coming to work today. Anything important can be left on my desk until tomorrow.\" She doesn't need to act to make herself sound sick, and it's a common enough occurrence that McInnis won't ask for proof.\n\n\n\nIn ten hours Al-Khafaji will be done with her report and she'll be gone from this site for good. Those ten hours can't move fast enough in her opinion. If she were to be smart about this, she'd use this free time she's given herself to make something presentable of her home. And yet all she can get herself to do is wrap herself even tighter in her blanket.\n\n\n\nLogically, this shouldn't bother her. It's hardly the first time a fellow coworker hit on her, hell it's not even the first time a fellow woman has hit on her. Yet something in her stomach aches, not the usual sick she feels, but like something is eating her. Like something has been eating her for years. \n\n\n\nImages of that bar bathed in purple lights keep flashing in her mind. She just can't stop thinking about the music, about Aubrey's hand in hers, about the lipstick mark on her cheek, about how causally she went in for the kiss, like she knew exactly what she wanted. \n\n\n\nShe can't stop thinking about [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/transposthumousism Quinn Law].\n\n\n\nQuinn Law appeared in front of Elstrom when she was still reeling in the death of her most recent horrible date. //There's a woman who knows exactly where she is in the world,// Elstrom thought as Law took her my the arm and dragged her across Three Portlands.\n\n\n\nLaw was beautiful, //is// beautiful. And confident in a way Elstrom could never be. Whether fueled by bravery or ignorance, Law went through every area like she knew she belonged there. And she looked at Elstrom, the woman she thought Elstrom was, with such affection. Like there was something in her, something real, that could be desired.\n\n\n\nAnd it never could've worked out.\n\n\n\nLaw was taken for one, which isn't necessarily an obstacle. Monogamy is an outdated practice and Elstrom has seen firsthand how open and non-conventional relationships can work. But it's simply not what appeals to her.\n\n\n\nLaw was also UIU. Even if Elstrom could handle the distance between 3ports and Canada, a relationship between a UIU agent and a Foundation bureaucrat just wouldn't work out. The hostilities between their two groups, on top of the responsibilities placed on both, it would just be too much.\n\n\n\nAnd most of all... Elstrom was afraid. Afraid of what Law saw when she looked at her with affection. And afraid even more so that what Law was seeing was a total fabrication, a projection of what //could// be there. Afraid of what Law would do when she found that there was simply nothing worth loving about Elstrom at all.\n\n\n\nInstead of saying any of that, she looked Law in the eyes and said, \"I prefer men.\" And Law looked away, already a million worlds away from her. \n\n\n\nIf Elstrom could tell herself that it simply never could've happened, then its absence doesn't have to hurt.\n\n\n\nThere's a knock at her dorm's door. The sound shocks her out of her thoughts. Surely no one would have a single good reason to bother her at this time, and yet they insist on knocking again. Like a ghost, Elstrom raises from her bed, dragging her tangled up blankets and sheets with her.\n\n\n\nSomething smells good. Spending the day rotting in bed has left her starving. Opening the door just a crack reveals McInnis, some sort of dish cradled in his arms. \n\n\n\n\"I hope I didn't wake you.\"\n\n\n\n\"You didn't,\" she says, hoarse. \n\n\n\n\"Good. I brought you something I hope will make you feel a little better today.\" He shoulders the door open and places the dish in her hands. It's a macaroni and cheese, the cheese is gooey and streaming, freshly home cooked.\n\n\n\nIt's thoughtful enough to bring a tear to her eye.\n\n\n\nMore than that even.\n\n\n\n\"Did I offend?\" his hand hesitantly hovers over her shoulder, like if he touches her she'll shatter into dust. She backs up, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\n\n\nAubrey's face appears in her vision. The dish is warm against Elstrom's chest and she's thinking about Aubrey embracing her, that moment where their bodies pressed together, right before Elstrom pulled away. How she wishes she had to foresight to wrap her arms around Aubrey's waist and pull her closer. \n\n\n\nAnd Elstrom can picture herself waking up in the morning and sitting across from her and happily eating breakfast every morning.\n\n\n\n\"I just realized I have to do something!\" She slams the door shut in his face and runs to set down the dish and put on shoes. Any shoes will do.\n\n\n\nIt's almost five pm, Al-Khafaji should still be on site, if only Elstrom could get there a little quicker...\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji sits on the edge of a parking lot, clicking her pen rhythmically. There's a warm space welcome to her back inside the site, but she would rather wait for the helicopter to come pick her up out here. She looks at her watch again and it tells her it's been a full minute since she looked at her watch last.\n\n\n\nShe takes in a deep breath of the cold evening air and lets it all out in a huff. In the distance she can hear the hum of a helicopter blade, and see the tiny black dot in the sky grow ever larger. Raising to her feet, she brushes the dust off her pants, ready to rid herself of this place.\n\n\n\n\"Aubrey!\" Al-Khafaji stops in her tracks and reels her head around. Pulling down her visor to block out the sun, she spots another little dot approaching her. Elstrom comes to a stop before her, breathing loudly, hunched over with her hands on her knees.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Dr. Elstrom, I thought you were sick,\" she says with a playful, yet professional tone, the way one might joke with a total stranger. She turns just slightly to avoid looking Elstrom in the eyes. \n\n\n\n\"I need to say something to you.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji looks over her shoulder with a weary frown. \"Well don't feel the need to hurry.\"\n\n\n\nElstrom freezes, standing up straight like a deer in the headlights. She looks a bit like a deer that wasn't quick enough getting out of the road. Her hair is unkempt, she's still in her uniform from yesterday with is now soaked in sweat and sticking to her skin, and she hasn't done her make-up, showing up every wrinkle to the world. And she needs to say //something//. \n\n\n\nAfter a minute of silence, Al-Khafaji sighs and turns her back to Elstrom. \"Look, Karen, you're a beautiful woman. But I know the sort of person you are, and I'm just not interested in getting caught up in whatever argument you're having with yourself. Either you //know// what you want, or you don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know what I want.\" Before she can stop herself, she goes in for a hug. Al-Khafaji tenses, more out of shock than discomfort. \"I've known what I've wanted for a long time now, and I was unfair to you. I'm so sorry for that.\"\n\n\n\nShe shoulders Elstrom off so she can turn to face her. She looks her up and down, taking in every flaw in Elstrom's appearance. \"Wow, you really mean that, huh?\" Behind her the helicopter touches the ground and she glances nervously at it. \n\n\n\nElstrom nods. \"I think you're the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I should've told you that. And I don't want you to leave.\" //Not now, not when she's finally let herself have this.//\n\n\n\n\"Look, you know I can't stay. We've both got jobs to do, places to be.\"\n\n\n\n//\"Dr. Al-Khafaji, what's the hold up!\"// calls the pilot over the whirl of the helicopter. \n\n\n\nShe swallows, a single tear running down her cheek. \"Is that it then?\"\n\n\n\nAl-Khafaji looks at the helicopter, and then back at Elstrom, and then at the pen in her hand. \"It doesn't have to be.\" She takes Elstrom's wrist, pulls her arm and start, and scrawls her number across her forearm. Elstrom gasps and tenses at the pen's point digs into her skin. \n\n\n\n\"Aubrey...\" she mumbles. \n\n\n\n\"Send me a message when I touch down in two hours, okay? Don't be shy!\" She smiles and waves her off as she makes a run to get on the helicopter. Elstrom stands there, letting the winds blow all around her, as Al-Khafaji lifts off into the air. \n\n\n\nShe wishes she had kissed her.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n//Breathe Elstrom, keep it together.//\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**K_Elstrom**\n\nHello, this is Dr. Elstrom.

Florence had already told them where to go.</p>\n<p>Thorne had never been to Duluth, but they recognized the old pier immediately. Even after three decades and change, it remained nearly identical to the image of recorded memory that Florence had left in her journal.

There was an eerie stillness about him, as if he had surrendered to death long ago and was merely waiting for it to notice. Looking at him, Thorne almost felt pity for the broken man before them.</p>\n<p>Keeping a hand on their mother's necklace, they thought about Westbrook.

He is not your father, and you owe him nothing.</em></p>\n<p>That banished any hint of sympathy they might have felt. Drawing on the memory of their mother's anger to steel themself, they stepped forward into Westbrook's peripheral vision.</p>\n<p>\"Director Westbrook?\"</p>\n<p>\"Unfortunately.\" He turned to look at them. His eyes were like dry wells \u2014 deep and dark and empty and haunted by the ghost of better years \u2014 but a spark of cunning intellect flared within them as he studied Thorne. He had fallen far, but this man had once been the rising star of the Foundation, the young task force commander already on the fast track for a Directorship. He had been fearless, brilliant, charming, and above all else <em>cool</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, he was just one of those things. And the world had enough of his kind of brilliance, so it had set him aside.</p>\n<p>The moment of recognition was obvious and almost immediate. \"This was her favorite spot on the lake, you know.\" He put so much emotion behind the pronoun '<em>her</em>' \u2014 so much pain and longing and regret \u2014 that it needed no antecedent. \"We used to come here on shore leave, to talk or just to watch the ships. She would\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't.\" Thorne cut him off. \"Just don't. You're not my father, you're not going to win any brownie points with me by reminiscing about my mother. I mean, I knew her a hell of a lot longer than you did \u2014 she was with the Foundation for, what, barely five years? You can't tell me anything I don't already know.\"</p>\n<p>The barest hint of a smile crept onto his face. \"Oh, I very much doubt that. She never told you about me, did she?\"</p>\n<p>That was true, and it was one of the first things Thorne had tried to find an answer for within the gem of memories. At first, it had been for safety \u2014 knowing anything about their father could have put both Robin and Florence in jeopardy. But Florence had kept his identity hidden long past that point, and there had been no pure or altruistic motive for it.</p>\n<p>It had been to hurt him.</p>\n<p>\"She never told <em>you</em> about <em>me</em> either, and I think that says a lot more about you than it does about me,\" Thorne countered, delivering the hurt just as intended. At a different time, in a different place, in a different circumstance, they might have done something different \u2014 might have refused to be their mother's instrument, might have offered Westbrook an olive branch, might have tried to have some kind of relationship with the man who could have been their father if he had only made a better choice.</p>\n<p>But it was this time, in this place, in this circumstance. So Thorne continued, \"I have her journal, I know exactly what she thought of you, and I know better than to trust you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that so?\" He raised an eyebrow, trying to appear unfazed. \"Why are you here then? Just to torment an old man with the price of his mistakes? To show me just how much I lost? Some final act of misguided revenge on her behalf?\"</p>\n<p>All of those had been among Florence's reasons, and Thorne didn't disagree with them. But there was something much more important than revenge.</p>\n<p>Justice.</p>\n<p>They looked him dead in the eyes. \"Did you kill her?\"</p>\n<p>He recoiled. \"What?\"</p>\n<p>They grabbed the front of his jacket and pulled him closer. \"Look at me when I'm speaking to you. Did you kill her? Did you order her death?\"</p>\n<p>\"How could\u2014 no, of course not! How could you even ask that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because she thought you did!\"</p>\n<p>Westbrook gasped. It was an anguished death rattle, totally inappropriate from a still-living throat. He sounded like a ruptured balloon. He sounded like a deflating airbag. He sounded like he had just been punched in the chest.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't give the order,\" Cody Westbrook said truthfully. It might have been the first true thing he had said in thirty-four years.</p>\n<p>Then, after a few more shaky breaths, he did it again. \"But I know who did.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne inhaled. This was what they had been working towards since Spencer had given them the oneirograph.</p>\n<p>They leaned in. \"Tell me.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was the Overseers.\" Westbrook sighed, finally unburdened by the secret he had carried for sixteen years. \"I don't know which ones, but they had a full vote of the Council. It was an official operation.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne released their grip on his collar. It was exactly what they had expected, and the last thing they had wanted to hear. Maybe that was part of why they had come to Westbrook \u2014 in the hopes that he would tell one more lie.</p>\n<p>\"How do you know?\" They asked. The question was curt, perfunctory, more the result of their interrogation instincts taking over automatically than anything.</p>\n<p>\"Corwin told me, after the vote.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne let their thumb brush against the edge of the sunstone, receiving an answer without any question. \"Director Corwin? From Site-64?\"</p>\n<p>Westbrook nodded. \"Yes, but he wasn't a Site Director anymore. This was when he was O5-7.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne didn't know what to say. The identities of the Overseers were the Foundation's most closely guarded secret. There were many organizations, including the UIU, which maintained a standing bounty for any information that would lead to the identity of even one Overseer. Having it confirmed, and so easily, was an unexpected coup \u2014 one that they were entirely unable to celebrate, considering the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Finally, they asked, \"Where is he?\"</p>\n<p>Westbrook shook his head. \"You're too late. He died years ago. I have no idea who replaced him.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne couldn't be disappointed. It was just too predictable.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry,\" Westbrook said. \"I wish there was more I could do. I couldn't stop them.\"</p>\n<p>Thorne clenched their fists. They took a few breaths. They exhaled and relaxed. There was nothing that could be done now. It had simply been too long. The universal statute of limitations had lapsed.</p>\n<p>\"I loved her,\" he said.</p>\n<p>They stared off into the distance as they nodded slowly, then removed the necklace and offered it to Westbrook. \"Here. She would have wanted you to have this.\"</p>\n<p>A flash of gratitude sparked in his eyes as he looked at them in surprise. Smiling broadly in the first true sign of happiness that they'd seen from him, he reached out to take the gem from their outstretched hand.</p>\n<p>They punched him in the gut.</p>\n<p>The blow caught him completely off guard, knocking the wind from his lungs and sending him stumbling backwards. He doubled over in pain, unable to do anything but gasp for air.</p>\n<p>\"How dare you,\" Thorne said, eyes blazing with fury as they loomed over him. \"How dare you call yourself my father. How dare you say you loved her. How dare you consider yourself the victim here, after everything you did. You have no idea how much you hurt her, how much pain you caused her. But you will.\"</p>\n<p>Grabbing his wrist, they pressed the gem into the palm of his hand. As they did so, they reached deep into the matrix of the spell and called forth the memories buried there \u2014 some of the earliest memories recorded in it, from the exact moment when, thirty-four years ago on this very same pier, Westbrook had destroyed Florence's life with the revelation of his treachery. They called up all the pain, the rage, the despair, and the hatred that Florence had felt in that moment, and in all the moments since then whenever she had thought of Westbrook. Then, using that unbreakable link that was the terrible evidence of their parentage, Thorne forced him to experience all of it.</p>\n<p>He opened his mouth to scream, but there was only enough air in his lungs for him to choke out a whimper. What they were doing was dangerous \u2014 as the target of most of the emotions that he was now receiving, experiencing them like this could shatter his psyche and destroy his sense of self \u2014 but Thorne didn't care. They were getting all of those emotions too, and right now they were gripped by a ferocious hatred of Westbrook \u2014 a hatred that Florence had concealed from them, even as she had nurtured it over the years.</p>\n<p>Thorne had come to the pier fully prepared to kill the man who should have been their father. But now they realized that was too good for him.</p>\n<p>\"There was nothing you could do?\" They demanded. \"Nothing? You knew it was going to happen, and you couldn't do anything? Do you really believe that? Do you have a single ounce of shame in your worthless excuse for a soul?\"</p>\n<p>He didn't even notice as they took the necklace from his unresistant fingers and slipped it back over their neck. They gave him one last contemptuous look before turning to go.</p>\n<p>\"So glad we had this talk, <em>dad</em>. Enjoy the rest of your life, because you're going to die alone.\"</p>\n<p>Robin Thorne stalked away down the pier without looking back, leaving the man who had never been their father crying and shivering in the cold.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>do not cry for the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nightingale</span>. he is a <span style=\"color: blue\"><strong>motherfucker</strong></span></em><br/>\n<strong>\u00ab <a href=\"/calling-on-the-blackbird\">Calling on the Blackbird</a> || <a href=\"/crowne-thorne-hub\">HUB</a> || <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/decryption-by-a-necromancer\">Decryption by a Necromancer</a> \u00bb</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"/component:preview\">component:preview</a> text=Thorne had come to the pier fully prepared to kill the man who should have been their father.]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:3law\">:scp-wiki:theme:3law</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> start=--\n\n|name=GreenWolf]]\n\n**SUGGESTED LISTENING**: [https://youtu.be/T7Zhr8RQt_M?feature=shared \"New World Man\" by Rush]\n\n\n\nHere's my **[[[greenwolf-s-author-page|Author Page]]]**.\n\n\n\nThis is Part 5 of 7 of a tale series about the death of Florence Thorne, and the investigation undertaken by Robin Thorne.
