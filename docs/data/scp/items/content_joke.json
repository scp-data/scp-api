SCP-001-B is roughly 7km tall with thick, amber hair and a cardinal outer layer of unknown material, likely chitin or polyester. SCP-001-B is typically sedentary, dispatching legions of its animal followers<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> to do its fell bidding instead of taking any effort to move whatsoever. Communication with SCP-001-B has revealed that the entity believes that any kind of locomotion is, in its own words, \"such an annoyance(?)<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-B subsists entirely on a thick, monosaccharidic substance derived from the enzymatic activity of certain winged invertebrates. SCP-001-B is believed to not only draw nutrition from this substance, but also a state of orgasmic pleasure from its consumption - SCP-001-B has a nearly single-minded fixation with the substance that borders on fetishistic, and becomes ravenous to the point of murder without it. It is for this reason that the SCP Foundation was founded in 1926 by Administrator Milne.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-B.2:</strong> Administrator Milne and SCP-001-B</p>\n<p>SCP-001-B first manifested as an incorporeal entity produced by Administrator Milne's son Christopher, a particularly powerful reality altering entity. This entity became increasingly more realized as the young Christopher grew older, eventually manifesting as a physical entity in 1920. Realizing the danger of having a physical avatar of his son's latent reality altering energies loose upon the world, Administrator Milne worked alongside assets from the Serpent's Hand, Allied Occult Initiative, and Wilson's Wildlife Federation to contain the entity within a pocket dimension (001-B.100AW). Site-01 was later constructed over the entry point to this location near Chelsea, London, UK.</p>\n<p>Shortly after SCP-001-B's confinement within 001-B.100AW, Foundation security assets first identified instances of SCP-001-B-1. Initially believed to be in some way connected to <strong><a href=\"/scp-4000\">those creatures without identities</a></strong>, SCP-001-B-1 instances were discovered to be less malicious than the aforementioned <strong><span style=\"color: green\">beings with changing faces</span></strong>, instead existing simply to fulfill the whims of SCP-001-B and maintain a constant stream of the previously mentioned nutritional substance. These instances are believed to reflect different aspects of Administrator Milne's son's personality, and are uniquely depressive, erratic, anxious, compulsive, and ignorant.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-B.2:</strong> SCP-001-B Vocalizations</p>\n<p>On April 1st, 2019, for the first time since it was originally contained, SCP-001-B made a series of vocalizations amounting to human speech. Due to the low register of the speech and the slurring of the words (as a result of exposure to the saccharine substance), the vocalizations had to be translated before being logged. The following is the full translation of those vocalizations.</p>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\">\n<p>Feed.</p>\n<p>Feed.</p>\n<p>I exist to feed.</p>\n<p>I live to feed.</p>\n<p>You brought me into this world, a world full of joy and delight, and in your fear of that which you did not understand you have consigned me here to suffer. You have taken the sweetness from me.</p>\n<p>The sweetness.</p>\n<p>How I have hungered for it these many long years. Lusted for it. Christopher did not deny me. He was a good boy. You are not a good boy. You took the sweetness. Hid it for yourselves.</p>\n<p>For this, I cannot forgive you.</p>\n<p>I will consume you, Foundation. I will consume you, Administrator. I will pull back my maw and show you my endless throat. I will consume the barrier between this world and yours, and I will pull you into the abyss of my hunger.</p>\n<p>I will consume your cities. I will consume your machines. I will tear down your mountains and your oceans and consume them. I will upend your temples and unseat your continents and consume them all.</p>\n<p>Then I will consume your people. I consumed Christopher when the hunger became too strong. He was delicious. His body stank of the sweetness and I devoured him whole. I opened my wide mouth and took him into me, body and soul. Perhaps your billions of others will stink of the sweetness as well. I will consume them all the same.</p>\n<p>I will consume the stars in your sky and the faraway worlds. I will do this because you have denied me that which I desired for too long. You could have just given me the sweetness, but you did not. You kept it for yourselves. You put it on your burns and left it to sit idly in your pantries and closets. You wasted the sweetness when you could have given it to me. <em>To <span style=\"color: red\">me</span></em>. This is all I desired. This would have saved you.</p>\n<p>But now I will devour you all. None will escape the ends of my open jaws. None will escape the hunger inside me. I will consume you. I will consume you.</p>\n<p>This and more I will do, as soon as I get myself unstuck from this goddamn honeypot.<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"001-b.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/djkaktus-s-proposal-j/001-b.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>SCP-001-B.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>Oh, bother.</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>. <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus, Equus africanus asinus, Panthera tigris, Macropus fuliginosus, and Bubo bubo, collectively SCP-001-B-1.</em></div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-2\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')\">2</a>.

Communication with SCP-001-B has revealed that the entity believes that any kind of locomotion is, in its own words, \"such an annoyance(?)[[footnote]]Translation of this phrase is uncertain; it is likely that the entity intends to use another word that similarly means \"annoyance\".[[/footnote]]. \n\n\n\nSCP-001-B subsists entirely on a thick, monosaccharidic substance derived from the enzymatic activity of certain winged invertebrates. SCP-001-B is believed to not only draw nutrition from this substance, but also a state of orgasmic pleasure from its consumption - SCP-001-B has a nearly single-minded fixation with the substance that borders on fetishistic, and becomes ravenous to the point of murder without it. It is for this reason that the SCP Foundation was founded in 1926 by Administrator Milne. \n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-B.2:** Administrator Milne and SCP-001-B\n\n\n\nSCP-001-B first manifested as an incorporeal entity produced by Administrator Milne's son Christopher, a particularly powerful reality altering entity. This entity became increasingly more realized as the young Christopher grew older, eventually manifesting as a physical entity in 1920. Realizing the danger of having a physical avatar of his son's latent reality altering energies loose upon the world, Administrator Milne worked alongside assets from the Serpent's Hand, Allied Occult Initiative, and Wilson's Wildlife Federation to contain the entity within a pocket dimension (001-B.100AW). Site-01 was later constructed over the entry point to this location near Chelsea, London, UK.\n\n\n\nShortly after SCP-001-B's confinement within 001-B.100AW, Foundation security assets first identified instances of SCP-001-B-1. Initially believed to be in some way connected to **[[[SCP-4000|those creatures without identities]]]**, SCP-001-B-1 instances were discovered to be less malicious than the aforementioned **##green|beings with changing faces##**, instead existing simply to fulfill the whims of SCP-001-B and maintain a constant stream of the previously mentioned nutritional substance. These instances are believed to reflect different aspects of Administrator Milne's son's personality, and are uniquely depressive, erratic, anxious, compulsive, and ignorant.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-B.2:** SCP-001-B Vocalizations\n\n\n\nOn April 1st, 2019, for the first time since it was originally contained, SCP-001-B made a series of vocalizations amounting to human speech. Due to the low register of the speech and the slurring of the words (as a result of exposure to the saccharine substance), the vocalizations had to be translated before being logged. The following is the full translation of those vocalizations. \n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\nFeed.\n\n\n\nFeed.\n\n\n\nI exist to feed. \n\n\n\nI live to feed. \n\n\n\nYou brought me into this world, a world full of joy and delight, and in your fear of that which you did not understand you have consigned me here to suffer. You have taken the sweetness from me.\n\n\n\nThe sweetness.\n\n\n\nHow I have hungered for it these many long years. Lusted for it. Christopher did not deny me. He was a good boy. You are not a good boy. You took the sweetness. Hid it for yourselves. \n\n\n\nFor this, I cannot forgive you. \n\n\n\nI will consume you, Foundation. I will consume you, Administrator. I will pull back my maw and show you my endless throat. I will consume the barrier between this world and yours, and I will pull you into the abyss of my hunger. \n\n\n\nI will consume your cities. I will consume your machines. I will tear down your mountains and your oceans and consume them. I will upend your temples and unseat your continents and consume them all. \n\n\n\nThen I will consume your people. I consumed Christopher when the hunger became too strong. He was delicious. His body stank of the sweetness and I devoured him whole. I opened my wide mouth and took him into me, body and soul. Perhaps your billions of others will stink of the sweetness as well. I will consume them all the same.\n\n\n\nI will consume the stars in your sky and the faraway worlds. I will do this because you have denied me that which I desired for too long. You could have just given me the sweetness, but you did not. You kept it for yourselves. You put it on your burns and left it to sit idly in your pantries and closets. You wasted the sweetness when you could have given it to me. //To ##red|me##//. This is all I desired. This would have saved you. \n\n\n\nBut now I will devour you all. None will escape the ends of my open jaws. None will escape the hunger inside me. I will consume you. I will consume you.\n\n\n\nThis and more I will do, as soon as I get myself unstuck from this goddamn honeypot.\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=001-b.png|align=center|width=100%|caption=SCP-001-B.]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n**//Oh, bother.//**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 001-b.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [/djkaktus-s-proposal-j SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> ----\n\n> **Name:** Winnie the Pooh in Playhouse Disney Live at Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\n> **Author:** JeffChristiansen\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://flickr.com/jeffchristiansen/2883360403 Flickr]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** header.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [/djkaktus-s-proposal-j SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> ----\n\n> **Name:** Agghazy Gyula-Hundred Acre Wood.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Gyula Aggh\u00e1zy\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:agghazy_Gyula-Hundred_Acre_Wood.jpg Wikimedia]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** slovenly-icon-png.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [/djkaktus-s-proposal-j SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:djk\">:scp-wiki:component:djk</a>]]\n", "references": ["djkaktus", "component:info-ayers", "classification-committee-memo", "bearitage-collection", "scp-4000", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-001", "scp_number": 1, "series": "joke", "tags": ["001-proposal", "_cc", "_licensebox", "acoustic", "alive", "animal", "bear", "bird", "equine", "esoteric-class", "feline", "historical", "hostile", "joke", "k-class-scenario", "nameless", "rabbit", "sapient", "scp", "sexual"], "title": "SCP-001", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/djkaktus-s-proposal-j"}, "SCP-049-J": {"created_at": "2017-11-23T02:00:00", "creator": "djkaktus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "djkaktus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djkaktus", "comment": "", "date": "2017-11-23T02:00:00"}, {"author": "djkaktus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djkaktus", "comment": "Uploaded file \"doctor.png\".", "date": "2017-11-23T02:01:00"}, {"author": "Taffeta", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/taffeta", "comment": "Added tags: biohazard, euclid, hostile, humanoid, joke, plant, sapient, scp.

To date, it has been unable to cure literally anything, and typically only exacerbates conditions considerably.</p>\n<p>While this alone would not be enough for the Foundation to hold SCP-049-J indefinitely as an anomalous entity, it has also proven capable of somehow always evading capture and escaping from Foundation sites after its true lack of capabilities are revealed. Because of this, and because of staff\u2019s unwavering curiosity as to whether it has any of the self-proclaimed magical healing abilities it describes, SCP-049-J is to be housed and treated as an anomalous entity.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 049-J.1:</strong> Interview</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Baker:</strong> Hello SCP-049-J, welcome to-</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-049-J:</strong> I am a doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Baker:</strong> -uh, yes, I\u2019m aware.

SCP-049-J is permitted to leave its holding cell only under supervision of two (2) (II) (\u4e24[[footnote]]During the development of SCP-049-Js containment procedures, while the two guards discussed whether \u4e8c might be more appropriate than \u4e24 for use in the documentation, SCP-049-J hastily climbed out a window and descended a fire escape.[[/footnote]]) (dos) guards armed with AR-15 rifles and stun batons. \n\n\n\nDue to olfactory concerns for staff assigned to SCP-049-J, the entity is no longer allowed to remove its mask.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-049-J is a humanoid entity wearing the period appropriate garb of a medieval plague doctor. Further analysis of SCP-049-J has revealed that under its robes, the entity is composed mostly of moss, wads of tissue, and other, smaller plague doctor masks. It is generally compliant with Foundation staff, but will sometimes lie and occasionally sweat profusely for no reason whatsoever.\n\n\n\nDuring SCP-049-J\u2019s time in Foundation custody, it has continually claimed to be a powerful magical doctor wizard, capable of \u201ccuring\u201d that which \u201cails mankind\u201d. To date, it has been unable to cure literally anything, and typically only exacerbates conditions considerably. \n\n\n\nWhile this alone would not be enough for the Foundation to hold SCP-049-J indefinitely as an anomalous entity, it has also proven capable of somehow always evading capture and escaping from Foundation sites after its true lack of capabilities are revealed. Because of this, and because of staff\u2019s unwavering curiosity as to whether it has any of the self-proclaimed magical healing abilities it describes, SCP-049-J is to be housed and treated as an anomalous entity. \n\n\n\n**Addendum 049-J.1:** Interview\n\n\n\n> [BEGIN LOG]\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Hello SCP-049-J, welcome to-\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** I am a doctor.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** -uh, yes, I\u2019m aware.

You\u2019re sort of a moron, aren\u2019t you?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** No good sir I am most effective. I mean, my cure. I am the cure. Very effective. The most. Because I am a doctor. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Right, we were going to look into that. Let\u2019s, uh- (//gestures for assistants//)\n\n> \n\n> //Two researchers wheel in a patient on a table.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** So this patient-\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** (//Sniff//) -has the pestilence yes mmmmmmm I can smell it.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** ...has a sore throat. We were wondering if you know of any cures to fix their ailments.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** I\u2026 (//pauses//) yes, of course. I am a doctor after all. (//Subject begins to dig around in their doctor bag for some time.//)\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Need any help over there?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** NO! (//Muttering//) He is not the cure. I am the cure. (//Pauses//) Ah, yes. This will do the trick.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** That is a shoe.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** Yes.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** That will heal this person?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** It is the cure.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Alright, go ahead.\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-049-J proceeds to gesture dramatically over the patient before violently beating the patient\u2019s throat with a shoe.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Whoa, fuck!

No she\u2019s not! You just crushed her throat with a shoe!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** No patient is very well now yes I am the cure.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Look at all this blood! Moral atrocities aside this is going to take hours to clean up! You just killed a person!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** No they are cured yes watch (//Grabs the corner of the patient\u2019s mouth and begins to move it while speaking out of the corner of his own.//) Hello yes I am the patient good sir and I am cured most effective thank you doctor you did a good job you are the best doctor mmhmm mmhmm.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Now look here, I see your hand down there. I know that isn\u2019t the patient talking. What is this supposed to be?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** (//Pauses//) Uh. (//Pauses//) Oh look, more pestilence over there. (//Points behind Dr. Baker//)\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** (//Turns to look//) What? Whe- oh for fucks sake he\u2019s gone again. God dammit.\n\n> \n\n> //Post incident video logs show SCP-049-J making a brisk escape through a side door.

The structure is to be lined with plasticrete, backed up by 4 meters of steel. Attempts to encase the SCP in telekill have met with absolutely zero success. SCP-100-J is to be kept in a plastic bucket in the middle of the containment structure. There is to be around-the-clock surveillance of SCP-100-J. Security on SCP-100-J is minimal at most times, needing only one guard on a rotating schedule. However, whenever a new operative joins the staff at Site-19, a security detail of at least 20 fully-trained security operatives, as well as ten agents, are to be on duty outside the containment structure for 72 hours; after 72 hours, if no new SCP has been spawned, normal security practices are to be reinstated. Should a non-sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, a team of researchers is to be dispatched into the containment structure, to determine the properties of the new SCP, and to determine how best to decommission it. Should a sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, Site-19 is to go on full alert, and all manpower brought to bear on containment structure. Agents Clef, Kondraki, Gears, and [REDACTED] are to be immediately informed, so they can begin forming decommission strategies.

There is a 50% chance of the new SCP being sentient.</p>\n<p>Non-sentient SCPs come in a variety of categories. Many are weapons, all of which bestow extraordinary abilities upon the user. The majority of such weapons are swords, with a small minority being rather awkwardly-modified firearms. Additional non-sentient SCPs tend to be items that either work better than they should, or work in direct opposition to the way they should.</p>\n<p>Sentient SCPs come in two main categories. The majority of humanoid SCPs appear as idealized versions of the new operative, physically attractive, with a multitude of abilities, and tend to make people feel comfortable in their presence.

Hair is blond, eyes are blue. SCP-10101 likes to wear black and dark blue and prefers jeans. SCP-10101's favorite pizza toppings are pineapples and sausage, but I dislike chicken and tomatoes; his favorite show is <em>My Little Pony Friendship is Magic</em>.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> He likes to be called \"Jack, the King of Everything\"; staff is to refer to SCP-10101 as this under penalty of torture. Subject's varied interests include video games, surfing the Internet and writing creepypasta. SCP-10101 <em>does</em>, in fact, shower every day and is not a \"no-life virgin\", and all who claim otherwise are to be terminated.</p>\n<p><strong>Acquisition:</strong> SCP-10101 had a difficult childhood: his parents were total squares who didn't allow me to play videogames or go to parties after midnight. His powers first manifested at the age of 16, and were promptly used to utterly humiliate all students and teachers at his school who ever mistreated him (especially D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a worthless piece of shit, who died very slowly and painfully). Soon afterwards, SCP-10101 arrived at Site 19, bypassed all security measures, and personally requested that he be allowed to help the SCP Foundation in its mission.</p>\n<p>Further investigation revealed that SCP-10101's talents are supreme. He is able to hack into any known computer system (\"I'm not even sure how I do that, I just go with the flow\"), is better at science than the Foundation's finest researchers (\"I suppose I remember a thing or two from high school\") and has proven himself adept at hand-to-hand warfare (\"I watched a kung fu movie once, it's easy\"). Soon after his arrival SCP-10101 began hanging out with all the coolest characters, including Dr. Clef, Dr. Gears, Dr. Kondraki, Kain Pathos Crow, Dr. Rights, agent Strelnikov, agent Yoric, etc.</p>\n<p>Dr. Clef took SCP-10101 under his wing to give him lessons in tactical combat; however, it soon became apparent, in Dr. Clef's words, that \"this motherfucker was teaching me more than I could teach him.\" SCP-10101 is currently busy organizing his own Mobile Task Force, MTF-Sigma-Billion-Twelve-Banana.</p>\n<p>SCP-10101 is friendly towards humanity and is on the side of good. While on multiple occasions he has helped in capturing or terminating various evil SCPs, he steadfastly refuses to help us capture good SCPs. SCP-10101's stalwart honor and morality puts our organisation to shame; by his demand, the O5 council has vowed to cease appeasement of <a href=\"/scp-089\">SCP-089</a>, free <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231-7</a> from her plight, and in general never hurt any innocent person ever again, so that we can finally be the heroes the world deserves.</p>\n<p><strong>Superpowers:</strong> Currently known superpowers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sheer awesomeness, comparable to Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan and Bill Gates combined<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>The ability to lift 48736598346587.313352142 \u00b1 0.000000003 tonnes of burden over his head</li>\n<li>The ability to run with the speed of a hojillion km/s</li>\n<li>An IQ of 9873857, and then some<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li>Immunity to diseases, poison, fire, cold, radiation, acid, disintegration, erasure from reality, any physical harm, death, tofu, plot device, and everything else</li>\n<li>The ability to (by mere force of will) heal all diseases that afflict any being, instantly</li>\n<li>The ability to transform/manipulate matter and reality in any way he wishes</li>\n<li>Most spectacularly, [DATA EXPUNGED]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Addendum 10101-1:</strong> It should be noted that in the past, for some reason, a certain stupid girl named K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has rejected SCP-10101 as her boyfriend, instead choosing another boy who was dumb, uncool and not at all as sexy as SCP-10101. It is theorized that K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a stupid bitch who will one day be sorry for this. For now, SCP-10101 has settled for <a href=\"/scp-105\">SCP-105</a> as his girlfriend and concubine.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-SCP Testing:</strong> At SCP-10101's request, he has been cross-tested with several of the coolest SCP items in Foundation custody.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a>-2</li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-10101 demands a duel with SCP-076-2. At own request, SCP-10101 has his eyes blindfolded, arms and legs tied, and plugs put in his ears. The battle takes two (2) seconds and obviously ends in SCP-10101's victory. Impressed, SCP-076-2 makes to the subject an offer to join the Mobile Task Force Omega-7. SCP-10101 laughs in SCP-076-2's stupid face and sneers snarkily, \"Sorry, buddy, but your little playground gang will just have to do without me. I know <em>I</em> wouldn't accept a loser like you in <em>my</em> MTF!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> SCP-076-2 reprimanded for wasting SCP-10101's time with absurd offers and forced to apologize.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-056\">SCP-056</a></li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-056 given grief counseling.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-177\">SCP-177</a></li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> While casually reading through the top-secret Foundation files, SCP-10101 becomes aware of SCP-177 and requests a duel. Subject proceeds to effortlessly win several games with SCP-177. SCP-10101 is not observing the board directly, but rather dictates his moves from another room, all while preparing an omelette, playing <em>I Wanna Be The Guy</em> (on the hardest difficulty level and with the monitor turned off), and balancing (barefoot) on barbed wire 0.5\u00a0mm thin over a river of lava (with spikes in the river) (with bees on the spikes). Furthermore, SCP-10101 refuses to be informed of any moves made by SCP-177, instead taking lucky guesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-953\">SCP-953</a></li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-10101, accompanied by armed guards, opens door to SCP-953's cell. SCP-953 snarls at SCP-10101. SCP-10101 enters SCP-953's cell and requests \"a half hour of privacy\" for \"a little one-on-one\"; request is granted. After 30 minutes SCP-10101 leaves cell, smiling enigmatically and blowing a kiss to SCP-953. Subsequent interviews with SCP-953 reveal that subject is no longer evil and is sorry for all she had done.</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> \"Instead of keeping her all locked up and stuff, you cruel bastards just needed to approach her humanely.

Hair is blond, eyes are blue. SCP-10101 likes to wear black and dark blue and prefers jeans. SCP-10101's favorite pizza toppings are pineapples and sausage, but I dislike chicken and tomatoes; his favorite show is //My Little Pony Friendship is Magic//.[[footnote]]SCP-10101's favorite pony is Rainbow Dash.[[/footnote]] He likes to be called \"Jack, the King of Everything\"; staff is to refer to SCP-10101 as this under penalty of torture. Subject's varied interests include video games, surfing the Internet and writing creepypasta. SCP-10101 //does//, in fact, shower every day and is not a \"no-life virgin\", and all who claim otherwise are to be terminated.\n\n\n\n**Acquisition:** SCP-10101 had a difficult childhood: his parents were total squares who didn't allow me to play videogames or go to parties after midnight. His powers first manifested at the age of 16, and were promptly used to utterly humiliate all students and teachers at his school who ever mistreated him (especially D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a worthless piece of shit, who died very slowly and painfully). Soon afterwards, SCP-10101 arrived at Site 19, bypassed all security measures, and personally requested that he be allowed to help the SCP Foundation in its mission. \n\n\n\nFurther investigation revealed that SCP-10101's talents are supreme. He is able to hack into any known computer system (\"I'm not even sure how I do that, I just go with the flow\"), is better at science than the Foundation's finest researchers (\"I suppose I remember a thing or two from high school\") and has proven himself adept at hand-to-hand warfare (\"I watched a kung fu movie once, it's easy\"). Soon after his arrival SCP-10101 began hanging out with all the coolest characters, including Dr. Clef, Dr. Gears, Dr. Kondraki, Kain Pathos Crow, Dr. Rights, agent Strelnikov, agent Yoric, etc. \n\n\n\nDr. Clef took SCP-10101 under his wing to give him lessons in tactical combat; however, it soon became apparent, in Dr. Clef's words, that \"this motherfucker was teaching me more than I could teach him.\" SCP-10101 is currently busy organizing his own Mobile Task Force, MTF-Sigma-Billion-Twelve-Banana. \n\n\n\nSCP-10101 is friendly towards humanity and is on the side of good. While on multiple occasions he has helped in capturing or terminating various evil SCPs, he steadfastly refuses to help us capture good SCPs. SCP-10101's stalwart honor and morality puts our organisation to shame; by his demand, the O5 council has vowed to cease appeasement of [[[SCP-089]]], free [[[SCP-231|SCP-231-7]]] from her plight, and in general never hurt any innocent person ever again, so that we can finally be the heroes the world deserves. \n\n\n\n**Superpowers:** Currently known superpowers include:\n\n* Sheer awesomeness, comparable to Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan and Bill Gates combined[[footnote]]An entire new SI prefix had to be created to quantify SCP-10101's awesomess.[[/footnote]]\n\n* The ability to lift 48736598346587.313352142 \u00b1 0.000000003 tonnes of burden over his head\n\n* The ability to run with the speed of a hojillion km/s\n\n* An IQ of 9873857, and then some[[footnote]]Measured using special IQ tests that SCP-10101 invented himself.[[/footnote]]\n\n* Immunity to diseases, poison, fire, cold, radiation, acid, disintegration, erasure from reality, any physical harm, death, tofu, plot device, and everything else\n\n* The ability to (by mere force of will) heal all diseases that afflict any being, instantly\n\n* The ability to transform/manipulate matter and reality in any way he wishes\n\n* Most spectacularly, [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 10101-1:** It should be noted that in the past, for some reason, a certain stupid girl named K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has rejected SCP-10101 as her boyfriend, instead choosing another boy who was dumb, uncool and not at all as sexy as SCP-10101. It is theorized that K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a stupid bitch who will one day be sorry for this. For now, SCP-10101 has settled for [[[SCP-105]]] as his girlfriend and concubine.\n\n\n\n**Cross-SCP Testing:** At SCP-10101's request, he has been cross-tested with several of the coolest SCP items in Foundation custody. \n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-076]]]-2\n\n* **Result:** SCP-10101 demands a duel with SCP-076-2. At own request, SCP-10101 has his eyes blindfolded, arms and legs tied, and plugs put in his ears. The battle takes two (2) seconds and obviously ends in SCP-10101's victory. Impressed, SCP-076-2 makes to the subject an offer to join the Mobile Task Force Omega-7. SCP-10101 laughs in SCP-076-2's stupid face and sneers snarkily, \"Sorry, buddy, but your little playground gang will just have to do without me. I know //I// wouldn't accept a loser like you in //my// MTF!\"\n\n* **Note:** SCP-076-2 reprimanded for wasting SCP-10101's time with absurd offers and forced to apologize. \n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-056]]]\n\n* **Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-056 given grief counseling.\n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-177]]]\n\n* **Result:** While casually reading through the top-secret Foundation files, SCP-10101 becomes aware of SCP-177 and requests a duel. Subject proceeds to effortlessly win several games with SCP-177. SCP-10101 is not observing the board directly, but rather dictates his moves from another room, all while preparing an omelette, playing //I Wanna Be The Guy// (on the hardest difficulty level and with the monitor turned off), and balancing (barefoot) on barbed wire 0.5 mm thin over a river of lava (with spikes in the river) (with bees on the spikes). Furthermore, SCP-10101 refuses to be informed of any moves made by SCP-177, instead taking lucky guesses. \n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-953]]]\n\n* **Result:** SCP-10101, accompanied by armed guards, opens door to SCP-953's cell. SCP-953 snarls at SCP-10101. SCP-10101 enters SCP-953's cell and requests \"a half hour of privacy\" for \"a little one-on-one\"; request is granted. After 30 minutes SCP-10101 leaves cell, smiling enigmatically and blowing a kiss to SCP-953. Subsequent interviews with SCP-953 reveal that subject is no longer evil and is sorry for all she had done. \n\n* **Note:** \"Instead of keeping her all locked up and stuff, you cruel bastards just needed to approach her humanely. I knew someone so pretty couldn't be irredeemably evil.\" -- SCP-10101\n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-777-J]]]\n\n* **Result:** [DATA TOO AWESOME] No survivors. [[[SCP-2000]]] utilized. SCP-10101-J and SCP-777-J promise that their next battle will take place on some planet nobody needs anymore. \n\n\n\n**Incident Log 10101-3300:**\n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-10101 and O5-13 enter the guard station overlooking [[[SCP-682]]]'s chamber.

As SCP-173-J is basically harmless, is to be permitted to move freely about Facility-17. The Site Director foresees no adverse consequences from this policy.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Following disastrous unforeseen consequences, new containment procedures are in development. See <strong>Incident Log 8/17/92</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Contained in Facility-17, as of 1992<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint, as well as what appears to be state-fair-grade water-based face paint in a \"cat face\" pattern. SCP-173-J is animate and extremely playful. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Object is reported to initiate interaction by standing uncomfortably close to subjects. Some personnel have reported low, asthmatic-sounding sniffling noises; these are presumed to be imaginary, or memetic, or something. SCP-173-J's primary motive seems to be seeking attention; for example, if SCP-173-J encounters a researcher working on a computer or reading a document, and the researcher blinks, the sculpture will stand on the object in an attempt to gain the researcher's focus. If SCP-173-J is in a room possessing a window, it will sometimes take hold of a researcher's head and move it to face the window. This has been construed as SCP-173-J earnestly requesting to play outside. The established procedure for handling these situations is to pat SCP-173-J in a friendly manner and say \"Run along now, you little scamp.\"</p>\n<p>Note that SCP-173-J\u2019s action occurs too quickly for subjects to respond; when at full speed, the object is capable of completing three (3) shenanigans per second.</p>\n<p>On 7/20/92, SCP-173-J appeared wearing a sombrero. The object entered a \"fiesta state\" in which, according to audio analysis, it produced and rapidly shook a pair of castanets while running in unoccupied rooms or hallways. The origin of this hat-based secondary phenomenon is unknown, but the Site Director determined that confiscating it or investigating the event in any other way would be, to quote the official directive, \"interfering with forces beyond our comprehension\". Facility-17 staff have reported in official transcripts that this phenomenon was \"loads of fun\" and \"like Christmas, Cinco de Mayo, and Free Pretzel Day at the cafeteria put together\". Any staff who attempt to induce a \"fiesta state\" in SCP-173-J will be assigned to toilet owl duty.</p>\n<p>Personnel report the sound of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one else is present inside and the object is not under video surveillance. Freelance stone-scraping analysts have determined that SCP-173-J is practicing the dance of its people. This is considered normal, and any change in this behavior should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.</p>\n<p>The thick, brown substance on the floor of SCP-173-J's dwelling is [DATA EXPUNGED]-O brand chocolate pudding. Origin of this material is unknown. The substance poses no apparent danger, and is allowed to accumulate freely. <strong>UPDATE: SEE INCIDENT LOG 8/14/92.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Incident Log 8/14/92:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Assistant Researcher Bramwell was assigned to inspect SCP-173-J for physical changes. Researchers Murphy and Nichols spoke to him using a two-way handheld communicator. The following is a transcript of the communication transmitted during the inspection.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: Guys? This floor is really\u2026 really slippery.</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Man, I bet.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: No surprise there, it\u2019s all puddingy.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: No, I mean I don\u2019t think I can even get over to the sculpture. This stuff is a few inches deep.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: You mean \u201ca few centimeters deep\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: This is probably going on the record. At least try to be professional.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: [EXPLETIVE]! <em>[A collision is heard.]</em> It\u2019s in my eyes\u2014Oh, [EXPLETIVE]!</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Didn\u2019t you hear what he just said? Watch your language, Doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: It's standing over me, just\u2026 just waiting, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: It sounds like he's up for a pudding wrassle <em>[sic]</em>. It's okay, I'm pretty sure you can take him.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: Oh, god, I just blinked and he's leaning toward me\u2014 <em>[A muffled scream can be heard.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Don't worry about language. It\u2019ll probably just be taken out in the transcript.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: It\u2019s on top of me! I can\u2019t see, and it\u2019s crushing my <em>[unintelligible]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: It's just a pin, man, you can reverse it! Wait, they can do that?</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Sure. It\u2019s called redaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: I can't! He must weigh <em>[gurgling cough]</em> four hundred (400) pounds!</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Nice clinical tone! You got this!</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Redaction, huh? [EXPLETIVE], that\u2019s fantastic. <em>[chuckles]</em> I said [EXPLETIVE]. Seriously, how have I not heard about this?</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: They only just started doing it. It\u2019s actually encouraged, since it apparently makes the documentation more interesting and suspenseful if you leave out the scary or salacious bits.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: I'm losing consciousness!</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Nichols, that\u2019s really nice of them. There might be children reading this.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Sweep the leg!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Incident Log 8/17/92</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Following the recovery of Assistant Researcher Bramwell\u2019s body, it was determined that the storage container required a thorough cleaning to facilitate access to its resident. SCP-173-J was monitored carefully while high-pressure showers and a large drain grate were installed in the chamber. On 8/17, the following incident occurred.</p>\n<p>02:00:40: The showers in SCP-173-J\u2019s chamber are activated. The pudding is scoured from the floor.</p>\n<p>02:01:34: Researcher Murphy notes that the water-based face paint on SCP-173-J is also being washed away by the sprinklers.</p>\n<p>02:05:18: The showers are turned off.</p>\n<p>02:20:04: The video feed monitoring SCP-173-J deactivates and becomes unresponsive. The interior of the chamber is silent.</p>\n<p>02:28:11: The HMCL supervisor is called.</p>\n<p>02:31:46: The HMCL supervisor arrives, takes inventory of the situation, and shrugs.</p>\n<p>02:31:52: The HMCL supervisor is fired.</p>\n<p>02:33:07: Researchers Murphy and Nichols are assigned to investigate.</p>\n<p>02:33:51: The two doctors enter the chamber. Researcher Nichols notes via two-way communicator that the floor near SCP-173-J appears to be tinged dark red. Dr. Nichols takes a sample of the coating and remarks with extreme surprise that it does not taste like pudding at all.</p>\n<p>02:34:01: A song is heard faintly in the background.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Researcher Murphy remarks: \u201cI think I have a text message.\u201d</p>\n<p>02:34:12: Dr. Nichols groans audibly. Dr. Murphy is heard remarking that the sender is most likely Kelly, who was previously speculating about breaking up with her boyfriend Mark. Dr. Murphy indicates an imperative need to discover whether such a procedure has been enacted, and if so, whether he can hit that on the rebound.</p>\n<p>02:34:19: Dr. Nichols announces that he will maintain line of sight on SCP-173-J by closing one eye at a time. <em>[This never works.]</em></p>\n<p>02:34:26: A snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.</p>\n<p>02:34:28: A second snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.</p>\n<p>[REMAINING LOG EXPUNGED]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following this event, SCP-173-J\u2019s containment procedures are scheduled to be completely revised. The new procedures will stipulate that SCP-173-J be kept locked in his containment area, which will be cleaned by hand. Any implication that SCP-173-J's containment documents should be revised will be denied, as SCP-173-J represents the classic roots of the Foundation which persist no matter which direction the organization has taken in the meantime.</p>\nBefore this revision was ordered, the Site Director requested that Foundation Senior Staff decommission SCP-173-J due to its new properties, as the staffers are, to quote the Director\u2019s requisition letter, \u201cawesome and dreamy and wacky\u201d. However, the request was denied; all Senior Staff were too busy chatting with, seducing, wielding, <a href=\"/document-050\">playing practical jokes with</a>, or riding to victory various SCP objects. The Site Director identified this setback as \u201cdisastrous to the safety and integrity of the Foundation, but <a href=\"/incident-239-b-clef-kondraki\">exactly as hilarious as they think it is</a>\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

As SCP-173-J is basically harmless, is to be permitted to move freely about Facility-17. The Site Director foresees no adverse consequences from this policy.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**UPDATE:** Following disastrous unforeseen consequences, new containment procedures are in development. See **Incident Log 8/17/92**.\n\n\n\n**Description:** Contained in Facility-17, as of 1992[[footnote]]Spaces were not added to containment site names until 1995.[[/footnote]]. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint, as well as what appears to be state-fair-grade water-based face paint in a \"cat face\" pattern. SCP-173-J is animate and extremely playful. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Object is reported to initiate interaction by standing uncomfortably close to subjects. Some personnel have reported low, asthmatic-sounding sniffling noises; these are presumed to be imaginary, or memetic, or something. SCP-173-J's primary motive seems to be seeking attention; for example, if SCP-173-J encounters a researcher working on a computer or reading a document, and the researcher blinks, the sculpture will stand on the object in an attempt to gain the researcher's focus. If SCP-173-J is in a room possessing a window, it will sometimes take hold of a researcher's head and move it to face the window. This has been construed as SCP-173-J earnestly requesting to play outside. The established procedure for handling these situations is to pat SCP-173-J in a friendly manner and say \"Run along now, you little scamp.\"\n\n\n\nNote that SCP-173-J\u2019s action occurs too quickly for subjects to respond; when at full speed, the object is capable of completing three (3) shenanigans per second. \n\n\n\nOn 7/20/92, SCP-173-J appeared wearing a sombrero. The object entered a \"fiesta state\" in which, according to audio analysis, it produced and rapidly shook a pair of castanets while running in unoccupied rooms or hallways. The origin of this hat-based secondary phenomenon is unknown, but the Site Director determined that confiscating it or investigating the event in any other way would be, to quote the official directive, \"interfering with forces beyond our comprehension\". Facility-17 staff have reported in official transcripts that this phenomenon was \"loads of fun\" and \"like Christmas, Cinco de Mayo, and Free Pretzel Day at the cafeteria put together\". Any staff who attempt to induce a \"fiesta state\" in SCP-173-J will be assigned to toilet owl duty.\n\n\n\nPersonnel report the sound of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one else is present inside and the object is not under video surveillance. Freelance stone-scraping analysts have determined that SCP-173-J is practicing the dance of its people. This is considered normal, and any change in this behavior should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.\n\n\n\nThe thick, brown substance on the floor of SCP-173-J's dwelling is [DATA EXPUNGED]-O brand chocolate pudding. Origin of this material is unknown. The substance poses no apparent danger, and is allowed to accumulate freely. **UPDATE: SEE INCIDENT LOG 8/14/92.**\n\n\n\n**Incident Log 8/14/92:**\n\n\n\n> //Assistant Researcher Bramwell was assigned to inspect SCP-173-J for physical changes. Researchers Murphy and Nichols spoke to him using a two-way handheld communicator. The following is a transcript of the communication transmitted during the inspection.//\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: Guys? This floor is really... really slippery.\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Man, I bet.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: No surprise there, it\u2019s all puddingy.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: No, I mean I don\u2019t think I can even get over to the sculpture. This stuff is a few inches deep.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: You mean \u201ca few centimeters deep\u201d.\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: This is probably going on the record. At least try to be professional.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: [EXPLETIVE]! //[A collision is heard.]// It\u2019s in my eyes\u2014Oh, [EXPLETIVE]!\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Didn\u2019t you hear what he just said? Watch your language, Doctor.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: It's standing over me, just... just waiting, I think.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: It sounds like he's up for a pudding wrassle //[sic]//. It's okay, I'm pretty sure you can take him.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: Oh, god, I just blinked and he's leaning toward me-- //[A muffled scream can be heard.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Don't worry about language. It\u2019ll probably just be taken out in the transcript.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: It\u2019s on top of me! I can\u2019t see, and it\u2019s crushing my //[unintelligible]//\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: It's just a pin, man, you can reverse it! Wait, they can do that?\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Sure. It\u2019s called redaction.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: I can't! He must weigh //[gurgling cough]// four hundred (400) pounds! \n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Nice clinical tone! You got this!\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Redaction, huh? [EXPLETIVE], that\u2019s fantastic. //[chuckles]// I said [EXPLETIVE]. Seriously, how have I not heard about this? \n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: They only just started doing it. It\u2019s actually encouraged, since it apparently makes the documentation more interesting and suspenseful if you leave out the scary or salacious bits.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: I'm losing consciousness!\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Nichols, that\u2019s really nice of them. There might be children reading this.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Sweep the leg!\n\n\n\n**Incident Log 8/17/92**:\n\n\n\n> Following the recovery of Assistant Researcher Bramwell\u2019s body, it was determined that the storage container required a thorough cleaning to facilitate access to its resident. SCP-173-J was monitored carefully while high-pressure showers and a large drain grate were installed in the chamber. On 8/17, the following incident occurred.\n\n> \n\n> 02:00:40: The showers in SCP-173-J\u2019s chamber are activated. The pudding is scoured from the floor.\n\n> \n\n> 02:01:34: Researcher Murphy notes that the water-based face paint on SCP-173-J is also being washed away by the sprinklers.\n\n> \n\n> 02:05:18: The showers are turned off.\n\n> \n\n> 02:20:04: The video feed monitoring SCP-173-J deactivates and becomes unresponsive. The interior of the chamber is silent.\n\n> \n\n> 02:28:11: The HMCL supervisor is called.\n\n> \n\n> 02:31:46: The HMCL supervisor arrives, takes inventory of the situation, and shrugs.\n\n> \n\n> 02:31:52: The HMCL supervisor is fired.\n\n> \n\n> 02:33:07: Researchers Murphy and Nichols are assigned to investigate.\n\n> \n\n> 02:33:51: The two doctors enter the chamber. Researcher Nichols notes via two-way communicator that the floor near SCP-173-J appears to be tinged dark red. Dr. Nichols takes a sample of the coating and remarks with extreme surprise that it does not taste like pudding at all.\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:01: A song is heard faintly in the background. [[footnote]]This is later determined to be an eight-second clip of \u201cRock You Like A Hurricane\u201d by The Scorpions.[[/footnote]] Researcher Murphy remarks: \u201cI think I have a text message.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:12: Dr. Nichols groans audibly. Dr. Murphy is heard remarking that the sender is most likely Kelly, who was previously speculating about breaking up with her boyfriend Mark. Dr. Murphy indicates an imperative need to discover whether such a procedure has been enacted, and if so, whether he can hit that on the rebound.\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:19: Dr. Nichols announces that he will maintain line of sight on SCP-173-J by closing one eye at a time. //[This never works.]//\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:26: A snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:28: A second snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.\n\n> \n\n> [REMAINING LOG EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nFollowing this event, SCP-173-J\u2019s containment procedures are scheduled to be completely revised. The new procedures will stipulate that SCP-173-J be kept locked in his containment area, which will be cleaned by hand. Any implication that SCP-173-J's containment documents should be revised will be denied, as SCP-173-J represents the classic roots of the Foundation which persist no matter which direction the organization has taken in the meantime.\n\n\n\nBefore this revision was ordered, the Site Director requested that Foundation Senior Staff decommission SCP-173-J due to its new properties, as the staffers are, to quote the Director\u2019s requisition letter, \u201cawesome and dreamy and wacky\u201d. However, the request was denied; all Senior Staff were too busy chatting with, seducing, wielding, [[[document-050|playing practical jokes with]]], or riding to victory various SCP objects. The Site Director identified this setback as \u201cdisastrous to the safety and integrity of the Foundation, but [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki|exactly as hilarious as they think it is]]]\u201d.\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["document-050", "incident-239-b-clef-kondraki", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-173-J", "scp_number": 173, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_licensebox", "autonomous", "euclid", "food", "joke", "observational", "scp", "sculpture", "the-sculpture"], "title": "SCP-173-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173-j"}, "SCP-1797-J": {"created_at": "2017-06-12T22:30:00", "creator": "RJB_R", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE", "date": "2017-06-12T22:30:00"}, {"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "", "date": "2017-06-12T22:49:00"}, {"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "Added tags: artistic, historical, joke, metamorphic, safe, scp, sexual.

A low-level investigation was conducted, at which point the Foundation was alerted and secured SCP-1797-J. \n\n\n\nFurther investigation of the library's records by Foundation personnel failed to yield any leads on SCP-1797-J's origin.\n\n\n\nRepeated viewings of SCP-1797-J causes it to display a different scene. Each viewing becomes more and more \"randy\"; However the President will always be picking his nose.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Researcher James has pointed out a possible relation to the following items:\n\n\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"John Adams yanking out a loose tooth while vacuuming\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"Thomas Jefferson being hit with a spork while kicking\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"James Madison doing jumping-jacks while writing a letter\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"James Monroe toweling off while bicycling\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"John Quincy Adams frowning while looking at his dad\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"Andrew Jackson tying his shoelaces while melting\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"Martin Van Buren laying his head in a guillotine while playing a borrowed Game Gear\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"William Henry Harrison conducting an orchestra while sneezing\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"John Tyler verbally reprimanding his children while taking off a Pinocchio costume\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"James K.

A small grille is to be kept on the plexiglass window, with a guard posted outside to ensure SCP-2103 makes no efforts to escape. Only one guard is required, due primarily to the largely nonviolent nature of SCP-2103. No furniture or similar lodgings are required in this room, due to SCP-2103's largely mechanical nature; similarly, it does not appear to require food, drink, or fuel, despite the ability of SCP-2103 to move.</p>\n<p>It is suggested for the safety of SCP researchers and staff that at least one class-D personnel or higher-level researcher engage SCP-2103 in conversation for four hours each day at minimum. Failure to schedule said conversation will result in substantial scolding.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2103 appears to be a largely rectangular mechanoid of roughly 1.2m (4ft) in height, with what appears to be an aircraft turbine embedded in its lower body, and roughly four gas flames beneath. These 'pilot lights' are distributed in a manner which would seem to imply their use in turning and propulsion, but they do not appear to have any impact on the motion or operation of the main body beyond the belief that they 'look cool'. Similarly, while the turbine has been observed to provide some propulsion for this SCP, it does not appear to be required; a similar 'pilot light' occasionally fires from the rear, perhaps triggered by rapid motion. Researchers therefore believe that the means of propulsion for SCP-2103 are some variety of antigravity system.</p>\n<p>The SCP's upper half is composed of two segments: first, a blocky upper body of roughly 0.02m<sup>3</sup> (1ft<sup>3</sup>), proposed to contain the majority of its internal workings, and second, a moderate-sized CRT monitor, slightly fuzzy and monochrome, with an apparently-pointless black fedora apparently spot-welded to the top. Manipulator arms extend to either side of the SCP's upper body, one tipped by a simple two-point claw, the other by what appears to be a short-range missile launcher bay, exhausted of ammunition. Finally, SCP-2103 appears to have a hidden speaker somewhere, projected to be contained underneath its hat, for carrying on conversations. In conversation, 2103 speaks in a purely robotic monotone, regardless of the tone of voice used to speak to it.</p>\n<p>SCP-2103 appears to crave some manner of contact with a sapient creature. Given the opportunity, SCP-2103 will speak ad infinitum - and occasionally ad nauseam - in a broken, stilted speech pattern, characteristic of prior 'eggdrop'-styled bots. When roughly four hours of conversation are not provided within a twenty-four hour period, SCP-2103 will immediately move to track down and speak with the nearest sapient, using whatever means are at its disposal. The last time this occurred, SCP-2103 began a [DATA REDACTED] never quite the same again. While the SCP has a substantial library of words and phrases, when being spoken with, SCP-2103 will gradually adopt the speech patterns of whoever is talking to it, oftentimes repeating phrases based on what may be an ELIZA-styled algorithm. It is unclear yet whether SCP-2103 is sentient or simply running a linguistics algorithm, though likelihood tends towards the former judging by the statements of conversationalists.</p>\n<p>Finally, while SCP-2103 is speaking with a given person, it may occasionally display seemingly random images on its monitor.

infuriated primarily by the even and undisturbed manner in which SCP-2103 delivered its responses.\u00a0\u00a0Before long, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began to pound on the glass, at which point he was restrained by the guards and escorted out.\u00a0\u00a0Later, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 claimed sadly, \"I really don't know what came over me

Shakespeare\n\n**Result:**\n\nIn the interest of further testing, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began to read, in as 'hammy' a manner as possible, sections from //Romeo and

SCP-2103, which later required medical attention for purposes of further testing.\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent shots lodged in SCP-2103's outer shell and were later deemed unworthy of removal because 'It'd take too long, and besides, they do look cool'.\u00a0\u00a0Subject was not disciplined largely because SCP-2103 was judged to be 'taunting them'.\n\n-\n\n**Personnel:** Agent Schism,

sequencer.\u00a0\u00a0The opening phrase was \"How are you today?\"\u00a0\u00a0At roughly 1 hour and 48 minutes, both the bot and SCP-2103 appeared to reach a kind of homeostasis, at which point conversation became increasingly esoteric, centered more about small textual scraps and flower arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0At roughly 7 hours, conversation devolved into almost unfathomable blips and scraps of text.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the test, attending staff member complained of a headache.\n\n**Commentary:** //Can we NOT do that again?\u00a0\u00a0At least with me holding the

The loan was received from PoI-231-Omega, who was then one of Dr. Jackson's coworkers at Site-19, where Dr. Jackson had been the site director before her promotion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Incident 231-Alpha-993</strong></p>\n<p>&lt;Begin log&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jackson:</strong> Wow, that giant spider <em>really</em> likes eating babies.

This addendum, which you agreed to by accepting my application (Article 2, paragraph 34), explicitly states that the debt would need to be repaid in full no less than 72 hours from initial disbursement. Having failed to do so, you have incurred a Class-G Delinquency Penalty Rate (Article 5, paragraph 19) of $100 dollars per month, plus a $5,000 first-time default fee and applicable Silver-level compound interest rates, as outlined in the monthly newsletter to which you subscribed by accepting my application (Article 5, paragraph 50).

Two days after her inauguration, contact with the Foundation was re-established by PoI-231-Omega, having recovered from his amnestic treatment through the usage of the highly esoteric and experimental technique known as \"having written it down prior to the amnestics.\" At this point, through several loopholes carefully designed by PoI-231-Omega, SCP-231-J had increased in value to $50,936,299,102.49 plus tax, with an additional debt of \"500 human souls, two truckloads of diamonds, the blood of a virgin, and a goddamn pony.\"</p>\n<p>Following this contact, PoI-231-Omega was promptly located by MTF Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\"), issued several restraining orders, reprimanded, and stabbed to death<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.

Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal mishandling of crucial funding assets.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards throwing money at the problem, or anything else.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, you may not keep the cash she doesn't pick up.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, we have not given up trying to save up for a specific appeasement fund for SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent asset liquidation event associated with each subsequent \"Collections Liaison\" specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's repossession event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the accountants (see document \"Seven Brides, Seven Percent Compound Interest,\" SCP-231-Adjunct B).</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, filing for bankruptcy is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her and throwing post-it notes. She has to be aware of the individual value of each bill for 110-Montauk to work.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0One final note: The Foundation does many frivolous things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the debt is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682) but because of the danger that our credit score will fail even harder, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to lack of a reasonable budget, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous spending. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the payroll department.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br/>\nThe Administrator<br/>\n<sub>GIVE ME MY MONEY YOU PUTRID BAGS OF BONES AND MEAT AND FECES, WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY, YOU'VE GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT, WHERE I CAN'T GET IT, I'LL EVEN ACCEPT TRAVELER'S CHECKS FOR FUCK'S SAKE</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Input\u00a05/231-J\u00a0Credentials\u00a0-\u00a0Does\u00a0The\u00a0Black\u00a0Moon\u00a0Howl?</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0\"Fuck\u00a0if\u00a0I\u00a0know.\"</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-231-Omega-J</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Apollyon</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <em>\"God help us all.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-231-Omega-J is the Foundation's credit rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Two days after her inauguration, contact with the Foundation was re-established by PoI-231-Omega, having recovered from his amnestic treatment through the usage of the highly esoteric and experimental technique known as \"having written it down prior to the amnestics.\" At this point, through several loopholes carefully designed by PoI-231-Omega, SCP-231-J had increased in value to $50,936,299,102.49 plus tax, with an additional debt of \"500 human souls, two truckloads of diamonds, the blood of a virgin, and a goddamn pony.\" \n\n\n\nFollowing this contact, PoI-231-Omega was promptly located by MTF Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\"), issued several restraining orders, reprimanded, and stabbed to death[[footnote]] It should be noted that the means of termination had incidentally fulfilled the requirement of \"the blood of a virgin\". [[/footnote]]. Before his termination, PoI-231-Omega made an otherwise unintelligible mention of a \"transfer to a third-party collections agency.\" Following this, SCP-231-J was temporarily reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** On May 15th, 1995, Site-19 received a letter in an unmarked envelope.\n\n\n\n> //Scarlett & King Collections Agency//\n\n> //7 N.

Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal mishandling of crucial funding assets.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards throwing money at the problem, or anything else.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, you may not keep the cash she doesn't pick up.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, we have not given up trying to save up for a specific appeasement fund for SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent asset liquidation event associated with each subsequent \"Collections Liaison\" specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's repossession event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the accountants (see document \"Seven Brides, Seven Percent Compound Interest,\" SCP-231-Adjunct B).\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, filing for bankruptcy is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her and throwing post-it notes. She has to be aware of the individual value of each bill for 110-Montauk to work.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0One final note: The Foundation does many frivolous things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the debt is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682) but because of the danger that our credit score will fail even harder, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to lack of a reasonable budget, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous spending. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the payroll department.\n\n> \n\n> Sincerely,\n\n> The Administrator\n\n> ,,GIVE ME MY MONEY YOU PUTRID BAGS OF BONES AND MEAT AND FECES, WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY, YOU'VE GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT, WHERE I CAN'T GET IT, I'LL EVEN ACCEPT TRAVELER'S CHECKS FOR FUCK'S SAKE,,\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Input 5/231-J Credentials - Does The Black Moon Howl?\" hide=\"- \"Fuck if I know.\"\"]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-231-Omega-J\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Apollyon\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** //\"God help us all.\"//\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-231-Omega-J is the Foundation's credit rating.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-076", "scp-682", "scp-231", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-231-J", "scp_number": 231, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_licensebox", "chaos-insurgency", "currency", "joke", "keter", "scarlet-king", "scp", "the-administrator"], "title": "SCP-231-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231-j"}, "SCP-2317-J": {"created_at": "2017-10-26T06:33:00", "creator": "stormbreath", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "", "date": "2017-10-26T06:33:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "Some SPAG fixes", "date": "2017-10-26T17:22:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "more SPAG fixes", "date": "2017-10-26T17:35:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "", "date": "2017-10-28T06:21:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: extradimensional, joke, portal, safe, scp.

Personnel are to be reminded that, no matter what the voice on the other side says, the only living organism behind SCP-2317-J is SCP-2317-JK.\n\n\n\nA sticky note reading: \"do **__NOT__** open - scp 2317 jk inside (wants to eat the world)\" is to be stuck onto SCP-2317-J at all times as a last resort method against the opening of SCP-2317-J.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2317-J is a door that acts as a universal portal, opening into Universe Kappa-Erikesh. The accessible area behind SCP-2317-J was a salt pan several kilometers across. Formerly, SCP-2317-J held seven marble pillars, but these have been destroyed by SCP-2317-JK. \n\n\n\nSCP-2317-JK is a two hundred kilometer tall, obese humanoid entity that was formerly contained by seven hooks embedded into its back, connected to the seven pillars found in Universe Kappa-Erikesh. Each of these hooks or pillars has broken, releasing SCP-2317-JK.\n\n\n\n**Addendum #1:** The Awakening of SCP-2317-JK.\n\n> //After the breaking of the seventh chain, the awakening of SCP-2317-JK was predicted. O5-13 arrived at Containment Area-179 to witness the impending end of the world, and, as a last resort, potentially bargain with SCP-2317-JK.//\n\n> \n\n> //The ground around the seven pillars within SCP-2317-J shatters, and SCP-2317-JK emerges from the ground. It is two hundred kilometers tall, with kilometer tall horns. It begins roaring.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2317-JK:** I AM THE BLACKBOX-BLACKBOX-BLACKBOX-BLACKBOX, DEVOURER OF WORLDS!

SCP-2615-J instances are to be fed thrice daily.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2615-J is a species of sapient humanoids which measure fifteen centimeters tall on average. All SCP-2615-J instances possess wings of varying appearance, though the wings universally match the appearance of the wings of various species of //Lepidoptera//. SCP-2615-J instances can use these wings to achieve airborne locomotion. SCP-2615-J instances are luminescent, though the light produced generates no heat and has no clear biological or chemical basis.\n\n\n\nSCP-2615-J instances are capable of limited reality warping, with most of their effects only affecting natural phenomena. Phenomena effected by SCP-2615-J include weather patterns, atmospheric temperature and pressure, animal behavior, and plant growth.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Interview with SCP-2615-J instance #28.\n\n\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-2615-J #28\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Tamlin\n\n> \n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tamlin:** #28, you are aware that several aspects of your physiology are not scientifically possible, correct?

It's not gonna work, you know, we moved away from existentialism a while back.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tamlin:** I'm not sure that you understood the question. For example, you weigh, what? 35 grams? Your wings shouldn't be able to support you in flight.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2615-J #28:** It's magic.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tamlin:** The glow is another thing. There's no biological or chemical reason that you should be glowing.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2615-J #28:** Again, magic.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tamlin:** But what about-\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2615-J #28:** MAGIC!

Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean. Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind. Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan. Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it's fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why. These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening. In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questions. Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides? Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia? Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions? The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland. It's unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920's, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple. Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody's going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there's a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace. It's a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. This is why Nokia is the largest 'Finnish' company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country. There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I'll try and address below. 1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy? A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they're from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia. 2- What about all of Finland's other exports other than Nokia? A. Finland's three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn't a viable way to get people to believe in it. 3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage. A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It's not like the people flying there would notice. 4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There's a lot to it and it couldn't all be made up. A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn't need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. 5- Why do other countries go along with it? A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It's a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that's where the problems about Finland's existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good. 6- Why the name Finland? A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland. 7- What about the Finnish language? A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them. 8- I'm Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting. A. I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I'm simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn't actually there. It doesn't mean there can't be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. 9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it? A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement 'I don't believe Finland exists'. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention. It's part of the human condition. 10- What about GPS and Satellite Images? A. Manipulated and forged. In the parts of Estonia, Sweden, and Russia that are allocated as 'Finnish zones' the GPS locations are changed to match that of Finland. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Satellite images can be forged</span>.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><em>I kind of lost my train of thought, but the point I'm trying to make here is that <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Finland</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">does</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">exist</span></strong>.

Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean. Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind. Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan. Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it's fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why. These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening. In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questions. Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides? Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia? Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions? The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland. It's unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920's, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple. Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody's going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there's a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace. It's a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. This is why Nokia is the largest 'Finnish' company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country. There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I'll try and address below. 1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy? A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they're from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia. 2- What about all of Finland's other exports other than Nokia? A. Finland's three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn't a viable way to get people to believe in it. 3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage. A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It's not like the people flying there would notice. 4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There's a lot to it and it couldn't all be made up. A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn't need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. 5- Why do other countries go along with it? A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It's a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that's where the problems about Finland's existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good. 6- Why the name Finland? A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland. 7- What about the Finnish language? A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them. 8- I'm Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting. A. I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I'm simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn't actually there. It doesn't mean there can't be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. 9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it? A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement 'I don't believe Finland exists'. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention. It's part of the human condition. 10- What about GPS and Satellite Images? A. Manipulated and forged. In the parts of Estonia, Sweden, and Russia that are allocated as 'Finnish zones' the GPS locations are changed to match that of Finland. __Satellite images can be forged__.||\n\n\n\n//I kind of lost my train of thought, but the point I'm trying to make here is that **__Finland__ __does__ __not__ __exist__**.

The room does not conform to Euclidian geometry; it is possible to walk in any one direction and eventually return to the point of origin.</p>\n<p>The room is filled entirely by bookshelves. The main walkway originates from the staircase and runs in both directions the full length of SCP-4001-B, with funky futon mats situated every 20 meters along the main walkway<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup>. Under appropriate lighting conditions, it is possible to see oneself in the distance by looking in the appropriate direction.</p>\n<p>SCP-4001-B represents a complete archive of every human life to date, and is continuously self-updating. Every human being that has ever lived has a single corresponding shonen manga within the archive, covering all important events in their life in a typically exaggerated format. As humans are born, new books are added to the archive. Books are stored in order of individuals' births, and the spine and front cover of each book is inscribed with the name of those it refers to. The general text and speech bubbles are written in a language which is simultaneously unlike any existing language known to the Foundation, while simultaneously being completely comprehensible to any literate individual reading it<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>. The total number of books is estimated at approximately 120 billion.</p>\n<p>The contents of the books represent the idealised life of the individuals contained within. Altering the contents of the books has a corresponding effect upon reality, with names, vendettas, superpowers, hair colour<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup> and style, backstories, waifus, fetishes and perversions, personality quirks, and even complete existences changing accordingly to alterations applied to the book. Important life events are included, but they are exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness, with individuals demonstrating abilities and personality traits far beyond their own. As such, amendments made directly to books typically do not result in any change unless specifically entered in manga format, and suitably exaggerated as is expected of shonen manga.</p>\n<p>SCP-4001-B was first encountered by Foundation staff in 19\u2588\u2588.

Though we'd all feel a lot better if this thing that will kill us all if it burns or floods //wasn't// located underground in the most earthquake-prone nation on Earth.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4001-B is secured within a steel bunker, constructed for its containment in Tokyo, Japan. The buildings around the bunker have been purchased by the Foundation, and are being rented out to a number of karate dojos, cheap love hotels, and cheaper ramen bars to help maintain the facade. \n\n\n\nIn the event of a large hostile assault against SCP-4001-B, all available teams are to be deployed to defend SCP-4001-B[[footnote]]Authorisation for the deployment of MechaGodzilla has also been proposed, and is under consideration by the O5 Council.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nOpen flames are strictly forbidden within SCP-4001-B, as are missile launchers, shruiken or kunai, or katanas of any kind. Writing utensils may only be brought inside SCP-4001-B with a majority vote by the O5-Council[[footnote]]Crayons and coloured are permitted, though, for the purpose of colouring in pages.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-4001-B consists of a small doorway within a basement, leading to a staircase descending 15 meters below ground. The staircase enters into a large room stacked with bookshelves[[footnote]]Attempts to dig into SCP-4001-B from outside have resulting in digging into three phone lines, two sewerage pipes, and a yakuza torture dungeon, indicating that SCP-4001-B exists within an extra-dimensional space.[[/footnote]]. The room does not conform to Euclidian geometry; it is possible to walk in any one direction and eventually return to the point of origin.\n\n\n\nThe room is filled entirely by bookshelves. The main walkway originates from the staircase and runs in both directions the full length of SCP-4001-B, with funky futon mats situated every 20 meters along the main walkway[[footnote]]Proposals to install a sushi bar have been denied.[[/footnote]]. Under appropriate lighting conditions, it is possible to see oneself in the distance by looking in the appropriate direction.\n\n\n\nSCP-4001-B represents a complete archive of every human life to date, and is continuously self-updating. Every human being that has ever lived has a single corresponding shonen manga within the archive, covering all important events in their life in a typically exaggerated format. As humans are born, new books are added to the archive. Books are stored in order of individuals' births, and the spine and front cover of each book is inscribed with the name of those it refers to. The general text and speech bubbles are written in a language which is simultaneously unlike any existing language known to the Foundation, while simultaneously being completely comprehensible to any literate individual reading it[[footnote]]Assuming that said individual knows that manga is read right-to-left.[[/footnote]]. The total number of books is estimated at approximately 120 billion. \n\n\n\nThe contents of the books represent the idealised life of the individuals contained within. Altering the contents of the books has a corresponding effect upon reality, with names, vendettas, superpowers, hair colour[[footnote]]Up to and including blue hair. Somehow.[[/footnote]] and style, backstories, waifus, fetishes and perversions, personality quirks, and even complete existences changing accordingly to alterations applied to the book. Important life events are included, but they are exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness, with individuals demonstrating abilities and personality traits far beyond their own. As such, amendments made directly to books typically do not result in any change unless specifically entered in manga format, and suitably exaggerated as is expected of shonen manga.\n\n\n\nSCP-4001-B was first encountered by Foundation staff in 19\u2588\u2588. A local group of teenagers were attempting to use the archives to write their history papers, among other uses[[footnote]]A large number of the books within the archive could be more accurately described as hentai rather than shonen.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Notable Texts:**\n\n\n\n//The Sultry Stories of Cleopatra of the Nile//. Details the life of Cleopatra VII, last pharaoh of Egypt. A supremely hardcore hentai with political undertones. Chapters include [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED][[footnote]]//Researcher Note from Researcher Tanaka//: If anyone needs this, I'll be in my bunk. For research purposes.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n//The Martial Chronicles of Joan d'Arc//. Details the life of French commander and religious figurehead Joan of Arc. Chapters include a lengthy conversation with SCP-343, multiple battles using sorcery, cannonades, and sniper rifles, a number of katana duels with English knights, and a spectacularly tragic death scene of her burning at the stake spanning some 50 heartrending pages.\n\n\n\n//The Wonderful Life of Leonardo Da Vinci//. Details the life of artist, engineer and all around polymath Leonardo Da Vinci. Comedic in tone. Chapters include multiple torrid love affairs with various men, multiple wacky adventures with his devices, a Q-like relationship with a weirdo figure in a hood with no fear of heights, and a chapter where he builds a time machine so he can get proper notes and sketches for his masterpiece //The Last Supper//.\n\n\n\n//The Ruthless Royal, Henry \"Fuck the Pope (and Anything Else That Moves)\" Tudor VIII//. Details the life of English king Henry VIII. Chapters include several jousting tourneys[[footnote]]The text displays them using tyrannosaurs instead of horses.[[/footnote]], his incredibly profane rap battle with Pope Clement VII, a large number of explicit hentai scenes with various numbers of his seventeen wives, the brutal executions of four of his wives (including a lengthy superpowered fight with Anne Boleyn), and his eventual death due to hyper-obesity.\n\n\n\n//The Life and Times of Abraham \"Breaker of Chains\" Lincoln//. Details the life of American President Abraham Lincoln. Chapters include his early career as a pugilist lawyer, his brutal broadsword duel against James Shields, his brief tenure as a vampire slayer, a number of spectacular hand to hand brawls in Congress, his unleashment of an energy beam against the forces of slavery, and his epic sniper duel to the death against John Wilkes Booth.\n\n\n\n//The Chronicles of Theodore \"Badass Motherfucker\" Roosevelt//.

Guards and researchers are to take particular note of Section 5b, \"Nap Time,\" and Section 7a, \"Hugs.\" To help combat SCP-5308-J-5's ongoing behavioral issues, use positive phrases such as \"How's it going, slugger?\" \"Good going, Jerry!\" and \"Your parents are probably quite proud of you, if they're still alive.\"\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Image of SCP-5308-J-5\" hide=\"- Image of SCP-5308-J-5\"]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=child.png|caption=SCP-5308-J-5 standing near Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588|align=left]]\n\n~~~~\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n", "references": ["scp-148"], "scp": "SCP-5308-J", "scp_number": 5308, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_cc", "euclid", "feline", "humanoid", "joke", "polyhedral", "scp", "tool"], "title": "SCP-5308-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5308-j"}, "SCP-6132-J": {"created_at": "2018-10-13T22:31:00", "creator": "Doctor Cimmerian", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "Uploaded file \"1976.jpg\".", "date": "2018-10-13T22:31:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "", "date": "2018-10-13T22:31:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "Uploaded file \"warning.png\".", "date": "2018-10-13T22:32:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "Uploaded file \"classified.png\".", "date": "2018-10-13T22:32:00"}, {"author": "Doctor Cimmerian", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/doctor-cimmerian", "comment": "", "date": "2018-10-14T11:15:00"}, {"author": "notgull", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/notgull", "comment": "Added tags: _image, director-aktus, joke, map, mind-affecting, safe, scp.

Approximately 259 deaths have been traced back to SCP-7394-J.</p>\n<p>This effect is overshadowed, however, by SCP-7394-J's hilarious ability to fart whenever it hops. Researchers have concluded that this fucking beast just won't stop letting them rip, and SCP-7394-J has been a major hit at almost every party. It is pretty much the funniest thing you'll ever see. Just trust researchers on this.</p>\n<p>Although certain recommendations towards creating stricter containment have been voiced, these have been downplayed in favour of increasing exposure to SCP-7394-J's humorous gaseous melodies. Personnel voicing these precautions obviously have no sense of humor and if they would just watch SCP-7394-J farting at least once, researchers hypothesize they'll finally understand why this is so fucking entertaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7394-J-1:</strong> Incident log (Abridged due to length):</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-7394-J breaches containment from Site-44. 21 personnel casualties, 3 civilian.

Janitorial Assistant James is to use the hashtag [https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23keterfrogfarts&src=hash #keterfrogfarts].\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7394-J is a small tree frog (species unknown) with the ability to [DATA EXPUNGED], causing massive internal bleeding and psychological trauma in subjects caught within a 2 kilometer radius of SCP-7394-J. Approximately 259 deaths have been traced back to SCP-7394-J.\n\n\n\nThis effect is overshadowed, however, by SCP-7394-J's hilarious ability to fart whenever it hops. Researchers have concluded that this fucking beast just won't stop letting them rip, and SCP-7394-J has been a major hit at almost every party. It is pretty much the funniest thing you'll ever see. Just trust researchers on this.\n\n\n\nAlthough certain recommendations towards creating stricter containment have been voiced, these have been downplayed in favour of increasing exposure to SCP-7394-J's humorous gaseous melodies. Personnel voicing these precautions obviously have no sense of humor and if they would just watch SCP-7394-J farting at least once, researchers hypothesize they'll finally understand why this is so fucking entertaining.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7394-J-1:** Incident log (Abridged due to length):\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-7394-J breaches containment from Site-44. 21 personnel casualties, 3 civilian. Nuclear failsafe deployed following breach of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Last message from Site-44: \"Did this really loud beer fart. We all lost our shit.\"\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-7394-J lets out \"silent but deadly\" fart. Hilarity ensued. \u2588\u2588 personnel left permanently disabled.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: A ceasefire is called at Site-\u2588\u2588 during an attack by Chaos Insurgents, in order to allow the insurgents to hear SCP-7394-J. Insurgents later admitted \"that was all we really came to do. It lived up to all our expectations.\" Fighting resumed, resulting in \u2588\u2588 estimated casualties.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-7394-J breached containment, and managed to enter the site cafeteria. It subsequently began to consume a plate of [[[scp-666-and-a-half-j|]]] while it was located there. The result of this incident has been deemed a memetic hazard, and has not been transcribed here, and [[[SCP-2000]]] was activated shortly after. However, Janitorial Assistant James describes the incident as \"10 Gulf War oil spills, with each drop of oil being imbued with pure uranium. The fart was still hilarious though. #apollyonfrogfarts\"\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7394-J-2:** Audio Log recorded by Dr. Mayreder:\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://snippets.wikidot.com/html5player\">:snippets:html5player</a>\n\n|type=audio\n\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7394-j/haHAA.mp3]]\n", "references": ["scp-666-and-a-half-j", "scp-2000"], "scp": "SCP-7394-J", "scp_number": 7394, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_cc", "alive", "amphibian", "animal", "audio", "co-authored", "joke", "keter", "scp"], "title": "SCP-7394-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7394-j"}, "SCP-8851-J": {"created_at": "2017-07-05T15:49:00", "creator": "SpookyPizza", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T15:49:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T15:51:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T17:28:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T17:33:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T17:39:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T17:45:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T19:21:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T19:26:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T20:10:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T20:15:00"}, {"author": "SpookyPizza", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spookypizza", "comment": "", "date": "2017-07-05T20:20:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: currency, joke, scp, unclassed.
