Council.</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-001-EX-J</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Explained</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to dissolve after Abraka David finishes explaining his tricks.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001-EX-J designates all things previously classified as anomalies.</p>\n<p>On October 29, 2023, the illusionist Abraka David suddenly appeared before the O5 Council in a burst of multicolored smoke.<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This event was determined to be non-anomalous, as was the smoke.</span> He revealed to them that all known \u201canomalies\u201d were, in fact, merely an illusion, sleight-of-hand, or other clever trick of his own invention.<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">This revelation prompted the O5 Council to immediately dissolve the Foundation.</span> Following several minutes of hooting and applause, David declared that he was retiring.</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">\n<p>Despite the magician\u2019s oath to never reveal their secrets, David decided to finally explain how he fabricated the apparent existence of at least 9480 distinct anomalies, stating that it was \"only fair,\" as the Foundation had been \u201csuch great sports about it.\"</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-EX-J-1:</strong> Log of SCP-001-EX-J Explanations of Anomalies</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-173\">SCP-173</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The object's exterior hid a performer within it who suffered from Crohn's disease and specialized in acting as a statue.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-682\">SCP-682</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> SCP-682 was an elaborate animatronic. The hydrochloric acid tanks used in 682's containment chamber had hidden compartments which contained dyed lemonade. SCP-682's adaptations were done through hidden compartments in the primary chassis of the animatronic.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David verified that he had, in fact, killed most of SCP-682's victims himself.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-3125\">SCP-3125</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David performed this magic trick by donating to Republican Super PACs and other political activities designed to encourage right-wing sentiment. All resulting violence was, in fact, perfectly normal for regular human beings.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-7725\">SCP-7725</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The apparent elongation of body parts observed in SCP-7725-B instances was achieved via the use of funhouse mirrors and contortionists.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-106\">SCP-106</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The black sludge associated with SCP-106 was a topical formulation of morphine mixed with capsaicin and squid ink, thus simulating the feeling of skin being dissolved by acid for SCP-106's victims.</li>\n<li>SCP-106's ability to teleport was accomplished through the use of passageways behind fake walls and body doubles.</li>\n<li>The illusion of SCP-106 appearing from walls was accomplished by painting the walls with lemon juice and heating them when giving the impression that SCP-106 was going to appear.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-4857\">SCP-4857</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David is a common link between the In-Group and the Out-Group, keeping them apart because he \"didn't know if [his] two friend circles would be chill with each other.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-5056\">SCP-5056</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David hired world-renowned award-winning actor Henry Cavill to dress up as SCP-5056-A and record several days' worth of insults and screaming. All mirrors in Site-43 had been replaced with live video feeds of the Site, visually resembling reflections, but programmed to display footage of SCP-5056-A whenever SCP-5056-B was present.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-610\">SCP-610</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The initial reporting researcher, Chris Neko, was backpacking through Europe and Asia in the early 1990s. From his extensive investigations into the Foundation, David recognized Neko as an SCP researcher and followed him. David then exposed the varicella zoster virus<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The virus that causes chicken pox.</span> to a small, rural community that Neko was heading towards and dosed Neko\u2019s water with LSD. Unbeknownst to David, Neko had an undocumented extreme case of nosophobia; the stress, mixed with hallucinogens, caused a psychotic break. The community took Neko into their care until he recovered. On returning to duty, Neko reported the anomalous community as described in the official documentation. Neko\u2019s reporting was so sincere that the Classification Committee took the report as viable and containment efforts begun immediately. David admitted to O5 Command that this one worked a lot better than he expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The image in the file was created by David experimenting with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and photo-editing. Field logs SCP-610-L1 through L5 were created by Neko while still under the influence of the drugs and psychotic break. The original recordings do not exist.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-999\">SCP-999</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Large glob of honey and peanut butter mix. Staff claimed to find the object \"wholesome\" and \"cute\" because its file insisted upon it, and personnel interacting with it pretended to play along to avoid awkwardness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-2480\">SCP-2480</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> CGI.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> N/a.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-6579\">SCP-6579-D</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David shot the subjects himself, with his 9mm pistol.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-7179\">SCP-7179</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> SCP-7179 does not exist. The location where all the events took place, and all the events that occurred during it, are simply a home video rendering created by David himself at his home.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-4726\">SCP-4726</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> SCP-4726 wore a fat suit. The fat suit was designed so that liquids placed in a belly compartment could be piped to the surface to mimic sweat.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-4379\">SCP-4379</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The interior walls of the office were painted to depict an area of the Tatra Mountains; a performer was hidden behind a mirror inside. Anyone who entered would be knocked unconscious and transported to the <em>actual</em> Tatra Mountains. There, a matching performer would render unconscious anyone who stepped through a matching doorframe, and return them to Lunar Area-32.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The performer at Lunar Area-32 admitted that a member of D-Class personnel discovered the trick after three days, but agreed to keep the secret as long as they were allowed to replace the returning personnel's collected samples. The performer was not aware of what the samples were being replaced with.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-055\">SCP-055</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Gaslighting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-5320\">SCP-5320</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David stitched together a fake 100-meter-long snailfish that looped around itself and placed it atop a treadmill on the ocean floor. Clamps maintained Foundation drones in place while the treadmill spun the \"body\" of the anomaly around, creating the illusion that the drones were moving alongside an impossibly long fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David personally thanked Dr. Keul and all her staff for being a great audience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-6592\">SCP-6592</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> \"Richie Marks\" was never a real person and never possessed thaumaturgical skills that granted him the ability to predict stock market changes. David stated that SCP-6592 was merely his former performance persona, a character created for the purposes of funding all of his tricks and campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> When asked how he could effectively predict the New York Stock Exchange's buying and selling habits for such a prolonged period, David replied that he \"just guessed,\" and that \"there is no rule to it, just bullshit.\" Answer has been deemed fully consistent with non-anomalous stock market characteristics.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-3309\">SCP-3309</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David is a frequent editor and moderator of the <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition Wiki</a>, and a three-time Dungeon Master of homebrew TTRPG experiences with the graveyard shift employees at his local Denny's (located at 2701 Freeport Road, Pittsburgh, PA). He regularly exploits obscure Wikidot glitches to surreptitiously remove wiki pages that violate Wizards of the Coast content policy, citing Wizards' history of gratuitous litigation, and claiming \"freaking newbies [<em>sic</em>] nearly got the site nuked.\"</p>\n<p>When pressed as to the connection between neutralized anomalies and his illicit moderation skills, David produced a pained wheezing sound which elapsed several seconds and, in a low register, said, \"Listen, man. I'm outerversal, okay?\" before asking if he could be excused to \"the little boys' room.\" This request was promptly denied. However, an empty bottle of Gatorade was produced.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-3999\">SCP-3999</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Researcher James Talloran (a professional actor whose real name was <em>Tanhony \"James\" O'Ran</em>) was very elaborately dressed to appear as though he was dead. The chamber where SCP-3999 was supposedly kept was built in secret to appear as though an entity had breached it, and O'Ran was positioned at the bottom alongside the SCP-3999 documentation. A Foundation \"clean-up crew\" (yet another brilliant set of actors) dismantled the set shortly after its discovery, leaving the Foundation none the wiser.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-1730\">SCP-1730</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> CGI.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> N/a.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-6911\">SCP-6911</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David explained that he would release methane whenever personnel would approach Dr. Everwood's office, and used a silent vacuum to suck the gas out of the area whenever Everwood approached. David tracked Everwood's movements throughout Site-55 via spying on the Site's security camera system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-3809\">SCP-3809</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The satellite thought to be SCP-3809 turned out to be a manned vehicle piloted by one of David's assistants for a project that he \"never got around to.\" Maggie was, in fact, David's own niece, who he described as a \"little computer whiz\" who targeted prominent conservative figures with prank calls, hacking, and slander because of her own political inclinations.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David was surprised that the Foundation had classified something that was not one of his own acts, and requested a printout of the SCP-3809 file so that he could show it to his niece.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-6861\">SCP-6861</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination took place not by a shot to the back of the head, as formerly thought, but by a complex mechanical contraption that led to a <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> skeleton falling from Ford's Theatre's ceiling and onto Abe Lincoln\u2019s body. David was aware of this fact, as he was John Wilkes Booth.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Abraka David also was Charles J. Guiteau and Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-048\">SCP-048</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David harbors a strong dislike for the number 48, and would immediately discontinue any illusions related to it; personnel frequently discovered David and/or his equipment while he was packing up, threatening the discovery of his other tricks. Other numbers containing the number 48 were fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> When asked about the significance of the number 48, David alluded to a \"Costa Rica incident in '69\" which involved himself, an oak bookshelf, his former rival Alan Kazam, and 48 shaggy dogs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-527\">SCP-527</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An actor wearing a fish mask.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-3019\">SCP-3019</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> After observing the dysfunctional, abusive work culture of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's Nursery, David hired an \"unscrupulous individual\" dosed with copious amounts of anabolic steroids to dress in an elaborate costume and tend to the nursery at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> When the hire encountered the nursery's business owner, they were driven into a rage and murdered the owner, covering up the crime by mulching the remains and using them as fertilizer. When asked about this, David simply replied that the guy shouldn't have provoked his new helper, but regretted that he didn't stop \"mulching\" people afterwards.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-4003\">SCP-4003</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The objects found at the SCP-4003 dig site were part of an elaborate hoax and were planted there ahead of time by David.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-028\">SCP-028</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David had built a secret crawlspace under the floor of the storage yard, where he had access to comfortable seating and an internet connection. When a person would enter the area designated as SCP-028 \u2014 the center, which had air holes that allowed David to breathe and be heard \u2014 David would open a random Wikipedia page and whisper the entirety of its contents to that person.</p>\n<p>During this process, discreet screens and strobe lights would disorient and confuse that person, preventing them from perceiving both the full length of time they spent in the yard and the source of their newly-gained knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David cites the multiple occasions on which he performed this trick as a source of inspiration for many of his subsequent creations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-4006\">SCP-4006</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David feigned an inability to hear what the Overseers were saying, repeating the word \"HUH?\" in increasing volumes whenever the American state of Massachusetts was mentioned or alluded to.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-6987\">SCP-6987</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David produced documents verifying his creation of 14326987 ENTERPRISES, a \"non-profit illusions supplier\" he founded in 1966 to \"keep up with\" the scale of the Foundation's efforts. An unlikely chain of corporate bankruptcies and shotgun clauses resulted in 14326987 ENTERPRISES accidentally acquiring an acting agency which, itself, had just inherited its own law firm.</p>\n<p>David seized this opportunity to invent Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd. (SCP-6987), a fictional insurance provider to the Foundation and several other Groups of Interest,<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">See \"Log of SCP-001-EX-J Explanations of Groups of Interest\".</span> performed by 14326987 ENTERPRISES. David originally intended SCP-6987 to be \"just another magic company prank,\" but quickly realized he could formally incorporate it. This allowed Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd. to take on various clients and provide them further illusions disguised as anomalous insurance policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David credited Goldbaker-Reinz's \"insane\" pricing models and premiums as primary financier of his illusionary career in deceiving the Foundation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-7992\">SCP-7992</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David mentioned how \"Gorillas are just built like that.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/dr-clef-s-proposal\">SCP-001-CLEF</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> CGI.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David shrugged as he said, \"What do you want? You can do a lot with CGI these days.\"<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">CGI is a common misnomer for the wider range of special effects used by the Hollywood entertainment industry.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-3700\">SCP-3700</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> SCP-3700-1 was a larger-than-average European lobster, while SCP-3700-2 was an unusually small pelican eel. They both were made to seem many kilometers in lengths through forced camera perspective, fooling even Foundation members directly observing the two anomalies engaging in battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> David was overheard mentioning how \u201cpeople underestimate the power of tilt\u2013shift at their peril.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Anomaly:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-5243\">SCP-5243</a></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> David described, at length, the aftermath of the last time he consumed a meal at Taco Bell, stating, \"I don't know why I keep going back there.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Because of the lower-income, high-poverty status typical of Taco Bell clientele, <a href=\"/a-confluence-of-clandestine-conferences\">and the extremely strange interactions that take place in and around its restaurants</a>, protocol dictates their monitoring and regular patrol by Foundation Task Forces units disguised as local police officers. <a href=\"/scp-5900\">PANOPTICON</a> archival footage placed David at his local Taco Bell (located at 2603 Freeport Road, Pittsburgh, PA) on the 8th of September every year since 2002. According to a computer algorithm attached to PANOPTICON, the recurring nature of this event is highly suspect.

The hydrochloric acid tanks used in 682's containment chamber had hidden compartments which contained dyed lemonade. SCP-682's adaptations were done through hidden compartments in the primary chassis of the animatronic.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David verified that he had, in fact, killed most of SCP-682's victims himself.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-3125]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David performed this magic trick by donating to Republican Super PACs and other political activities designed to encourage right-wing sentiment. All resulting violence was, in fact, perfectly normal for regular human beings.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-7725]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** The apparent elongation of body parts observed in SCP-7725-B instances was achieved via the use of funhouse mirrors and contortionists.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-106]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The black sludge associated with SCP-106 was a topical formulation of morphine mixed with capsaicin and squid ink, thus simulating the feeling of skin being dissolved by acid for SCP-106's victims.\n\n* SCP-106's ability to teleport was accomplished through the use of passageways behind fake walls and body doubles.\n\n* The illusion of SCP-106 appearing from walls was accomplished by painting the walls with lemon juice and heating them when giving the impression that SCP-106 was going to appear.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-4857]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David is a common link between the In-Group and the Out-Group, keeping them apart because he \"didn't know if [his] two friend circles would be chill with each other.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-5056]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David hired world-renowned award-winning actor Henry Cavill to dress up as SCP-5056-A and record several days' worth of insults and screaming. All mirrors in Site-43 had been replaced with live video feeds of the Site, visually resembling reflections, but programmed to display footage of SCP-5056-A whenever SCP-5056-B was present.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-610]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** The initial reporting researcher, Chris Neko, was backpacking through Europe and Asia in the early 1990s. From his extensive investigations into the Foundation, David recognized Neko as an SCP researcher and followed him. David then exposed the varicella zoster virus[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The virus that causes chicken pox.[[/span]] to a small, rural community that Neko was heading towards and dosed Neko\u2019s water with LSD. Unbeknownst to David, Neko had an undocumented extreme case of nosophobia; the stress, mixed with hallucinogens, caused a psychotic break. The community took Neko into their care until he recovered. On returning to duty, Neko reported the anomalous community as described in the official documentation. Neko\u2019s reporting was so sincere that the Classification Committee took the report as viable and containment efforts begun immediately. David admitted to O5 Command that this one worked a lot better than he expected.\n\n\n\n**Notes**: The image in the file was created by David experimenting with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and photo-editing. Field logs SCP-610-L1 through L5 were created by Neko while still under the influence of the drugs and psychotic break. The original recordings do not exist.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-999]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** Large glob of honey and peanut butter mix. Staff claimed to find the object \"wholesome\" and \"cute\" because its file insisted upon it, and personnel interacting with it pretended to play along to avoid awkwardness.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-2480]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** CGI.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** N/a.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[scp-6579|SCP-6579-D]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David shot the subjects himself, with his 9mm pistol.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-7179]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** SCP-7179 does not exist. The location where all the events took place, and all the events that occurred during it, are simply a home video rendering created by David himself at his home.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-4726]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** SCP-4726 wore a fat suit. The fat suit was designed so that liquids placed in a belly compartment could be piped to the surface to mimic sweat.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-4379]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** The interior walls of the office were painted to depict an area of the Tatra Mountains; a performer was hidden behind a mirror inside. Anyone who entered would be knocked unconscious and transported to the //actual// Tatra Mountains. There, a matching performer would render unconscious anyone who stepped through a matching doorframe, and return them to Lunar Area-32.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** The performer at Lunar Area-32 admitted that a member of D-Class personnel discovered the trick after three days, but agreed to keep the secret as long as they were allowed to replace the returning personnel's collected samples. The performer was not aware of what the samples were being replaced with.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-055]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** Gaslighting.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-5320]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David stitched together a fake 100-meter-long snailfish that looped around itself and placed it atop a treadmill on the ocean floor. Clamps maintained Foundation drones in place while the treadmill spun the \"body\" of the anomaly around, creating the illusion that the drones were moving alongside an impossibly long fish.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David personally thanked Dr. Keul and all her staff for being a great audience.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-6592]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** \"Richie Marks\" was never a real person and never possessed thaumaturgical skills that granted him the ability to predict stock market changes. David stated that SCP-6592 was merely his former performance persona, a character created for the purposes of funding all of his tricks and campaigns.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** When asked how he could effectively predict the New York Stock Exchange's buying and selling habits for such a prolonged period, David replied that he \"just guessed,\" and that \"there is no rule to it, just bullshit.\" Answer has been deemed fully consistent with non-anomalous stock market characteristics.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-3309]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David is a frequent editor and moderator of the [http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/ Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Wiki], and a three-time Dungeon Master of homebrew TTRPG experiences with the graveyard shift employees at his local Denny's (located at 2701 Freeport Road, Pittsburgh, PA). He regularly exploits obscure Wikidot glitches to surreptitiously remove wiki pages that violate Wizards of the Coast content policy, citing Wizards' history of gratuitous litigation, and claiming \"freaking newbies [//sic//] nearly got the site nuked.\"\n\n\n\nWhen pressed as to the connection between neutralized anomalies and his illicit moderation skills, David produced a pained wheezing sound which elapsed several seconds and, in a low register, said, \"Listen, man. I'm outerversal, okay?\" before asking if he could be excused to \"the little boys' room.\" This request was promptly denied. However, an empty bottle of Gatorade was produced.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-3999]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** Researcher James Talloran (a professional actor whose real name was //Tanhony \"James\" O'Ran//) was very elaborately dressed to appear as though he was dead. The chamber where SCP-3999 was supposedly kept was built in secret to appear as though an entity had breached it, and O'Ran was positioned at the bottom alongside the SCP-3999 documentation. A Foundation \"clean-up crew\" (yet another brilliant set of actors) dismantled the set shortly after its discovery, leaving the Foundation none the wiser.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-1730]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** CGI.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** N/a.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-6911]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David explained that he would release methane whenever personnel would approach Dr. Everwood's office, and used a silent vacuum to suck the gas out of the area whenever Everwood approached. David tracked Everwood's movements throughout Site-55 via spying on the Site's security camera system.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-3809]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** The satellite thought to be SCP-3809 turned out to be a manned vehicle piloted by one of David's assistants for a project that he \"never got around to.\" Maggie was, in fact, David's own niece, who he described as a \"little computer whiz\" who targeted prominent conservative figures with prank calls, hacking, and slander because of her own political inclinations.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David was surprised that the Foundation had classified something that was not one of his own acts, and requested a printout of the SCP-3809 file so that he could show it to his niece.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-6861]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination took place not by a shot to the back of the head, as formerly thought, but by a complex mechanical contraption that led to a //Tyrannosaurus rex// skeleton falling from Ford's Theatre's ceiling and onto Abe Lincoln\u2019s body. David was aware of this fact, as he was John Wilkes Booth.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** Abraka David also was Charles J. Guiteau and Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-048]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David harbors a strong dislike for the number 48, and would immediately discontinue any illusions related to it; personnel frequently discovered David and/or his equipment while he was packing up, threatening the discovery of his other tricks. Other numbers containing the number 48 were fine.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** When asked about the significance of the number 48, David alluded to a \"Costa Rica incident in '69\" which involved himself, an oak bookshelf, his former rival Alan Kazam, and 48 shaggy dogs.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-527]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** An actor wearing a fish mask.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-3019]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** After observing the dysfunctional, abusive work culture of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's Nursery, David hired an \"unscrupulous individual\" dosed with copious amounts of anabolic steroids to dress in an elaborate costume and tend to the nursery at night.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** When the hire encountered the nursery's business owner, they were driven into a rage and murdered the owner, covering up the crime by mulching the remains and using them as fertilizer. When asked about this, David simply replied that the guy shouldn't have provoked his new helper, but regretted that he didn't stop \"mulching\" people afterwards.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-4003]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** The objects found at the SCP-4003 dig site were part of an elaborate hoax and were planted there ahead of time by David.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-028]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David had built a secret crawlspace under the floor of the storage yard, where he had access to comfortable seating and an internet connection. When a person would enter the area designated as SCP-028 -- the center, which had air holes that allowed David to breathe and be heard -- David would open a random Wikipedia page and whisper the entirety of its contents to that person.\n\n\n\nDuring this process, discreet screens and strobe lights would disorient and confuse that person, preventing them from perceiving both the full length of time they spent in the yard and the source of their newly-gained knowledge.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David cites the multiple occasions on which he performed this trick as a source of inspiration for many of his subsequent creations.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-4006]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David feigned an inability to hear what the Overseers were saying, repeating the word \"HUH?\" in increasing volumes whenever the American state of Massachusetts was mentioned or alluded to.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-6987]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David produced documents verifying his creation of 14326987 ENTERPRISES, a \"non-profit illusions supplier\" he founded in 1966 to \"keep up with\" the scale of the Foundation's efforts. An unlikely chain of corporate bankruptcies and shotgun clauses resulted in 14326987 ENTERPRISES accidentally acquiring an acting agency which, itself, had just inherited its own law firm. \n\n\n\nDavid seized this opportunity to invent Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd. (SCP-6987), a fictional insurance provider to the Foundation and several other Groups of Interest,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]See \"Log of SCP-001-EX-J Explanations of Groups of Interest\".[[/span]] performed by 14326987 ENTERPRISES. David originally intended SCP-6987 to be \"just another magic company prank,\" but quickly realized he could formally incorporate it. This allowed Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd. to take on various clients and provide them further illusions disguised as anomalous insurance policies.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David credited Goldbaker-Reinz's \"insane\" pricing models and premiums as primary financier of his illusionary career in deceiving the Foundation.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-7992]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David mentioned how \"Gorillas are just built like that.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[dr-clef-s-proposal|SCP-001-CLEF]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** CGI.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David shrugged as he said, \"What do you want? You can do a lot with CGI these days.\"[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]CGI is a common misnomer for the wider range of special effects used by the Hollywood entertainment industry.[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-3700]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** SCP-3700-1 was a larger-than-average European lobster, while SCP-3700-2 was an unusually small pelican eel. They both were made to seem many kilometers in lengths through forced camera perspective, fooling even Foundation members directly observing the two anomalies engaging in battle.\n\n\n\n**Notes:** David was overheard mentioning how \u201cpeople underestimate the power of tilt\u2013shift at their peril.\u201d\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[[SCP-5243]]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David described, at length, the aftermath of the last time he consumed a meal at Taco Bell, stating, \"I don't know why I keep going back there.\"\n\n\n\n**Notes:** Because of the lower-income, high-poverty status typical of Taco Bell clientele, [[[a-confluence-of-clandestine-conferences|and the extremely strange interactions that take place in and around its restaurants]]], protocol dictates their monitoring and regular patrol by Foundation Task Forces units disguised as local police officers. [[[scp-5900|PANOPTICON]]] archival footage placed David at his local Taco Bell (located at 2603 Freeport Road, Pittsburgh, PA) on the 8th of September every year since 2002. According to a computer algorithm attached to PANOPTICON, the recurring nature of this event is highly suspect. It was flagged for further study.\n\n\n\nPANOPTICON subsystems procedurally generated (with accuracy in the 99.9th percentile) a recreation of his history of visits mapped onto a high-fidelity 3D dynamic model of the building. The output was based on David's body fat percentage and cholesterol levels, his general sanitation and cleanliness, habitual gluttony and binge-eating, propensity for consuming fast food, pre-existing chronic abdominal bloating, and long-term exposure to the experimental chemical cocktails present in Taco Bell menu options. The algorithm then assigned labels that associated slices of this output data that concern digestion with large-magnitude containment breaches, which strongly correlated with stochastic models of cataclysm-scale acroamatic abatement system failure at Site-43.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Which is, in fact, only a fancy name for a sewage treatment plant.[[/span]] This is consistent with SCP-5243's file.\n\n\n\nDavid was astounded by the number of coincidences that had to combine to produce this result, but claimed, \"The rig I got in my garage totally could've done all that for you, you know.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anomaly:** [[a href=\"*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242\" style=\"color: blue\"]]SCP-INTEGER[[/a]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** David demonstrated that the perceived phenomenon wherein history is rewritten such that the abstract concept ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## is only referred to using 'correct' terms which themselves are metonyms of 'incorrect' terms which have been rewritten is, in fact, an \"epic branding tactic\" for his \"epic mad scientist self-insert,\" Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate, PhD., whose existence has only been attested in David's own fanfiction of the Foundation database. David is able to call ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## by anything he likes, as is anyone else, and only those persons either fictionalized or paid handsomely by David have claimed otherwise.\n\n\n\nWhen Site-87's Pataphysics Department phoned the O5 Council in attempt to refute these claims, David went on to reveal that the Pataphysics Department, Site-87, and Sloth's Pit were also fictions of his own design, and that the employee on the phone was an automated messaging system crudely voiced by David himself. When O5-3 claimed to know this individual, David revealed that O5-3 had, in fact, been David in a costume. Several other Overseers attempted to refute this, and were similarly revealed to have also been David in costume.\n\n\n\nThis knock-on effect continued to ripple outward as David continued to explain, for several hours, that the entire Foundation and all its efforts had been a web fiction project David has managed for approximately fifteen years. David expressed that he felt \"this had all gone a bit too far\" and had purposely inserted himself into the narrative to rob it of all meaning.\n\n\n\nWhen God asked David how he had usurped the power of Creation, David became panicked and quickly returned the Foundation to whatever form of conventional existence it previously held, restoring all SCPs to their true anomalous status. The O5 Council immediately revoked their motion to dissolve the Foundation, applauding David's wit and tactful use of self-referential metafiction. S. Andrew Swann is crying on a higher narrative layer.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 001-EX-J-2:** Incident Log\n\n\n\nNear the end of a long and exhausting day for all parties involved, the O5 Council asked David to recount his explanation for [[[SCP-895]]], the last remaining unaccounted-for anomaly in the Foundation's Database. In response, David folded his arms and stated: \"A wizard never reveals his secrets.\"\n\n\n\nUpon being pressured to comply and confronted on the fact that this entire meeting was meant to serve as an explanation for all anomalies, David produced a purple-colored sphere from within his robes. He tossed the sphere to the ground, shouting \"Smoke bomb!\" as he did so. The sphere exploded and killed the entire O5 Council, himself, and all personnel present within Site-01.\n\n\n\nJunior Researcher Robin Anders, who had been away from Site-01 on a coffee run and therefore safely outside the blast radius, survived the explosion. She has been promoted to the position of O5-1 as per Foundation succession protocol.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Metaphysician, Uncle Nicolini, LORDXVNV, Calibold, Sherf, Jack Ike, Guezma, Ralliston, Lt Flops, Yossipossi, Placeholder McD, Guaire, Grigori Karpin, and Dr Balthazaar]]\n\n=====\n\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Filename:** wizard.png\n\n**Name:** Gen Con Indy 2007 - costumes 23 (wizard)\n\n**Author:** [*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Piotrus Piotrus]\n\n**License:** [*https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)]\n\n**Source Link:** [*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gen_Con_Indy_2007_-_costumes_23_(wizard).JPG Wikimedia Commons]\n\n**Note:** Cropped.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n\u00a0#page-title {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0display: none;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\u00a0.page-rate-widget-box {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0margin-right: 0;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0margin-bottom: 2rem;\n\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n", "references": ["joke-scps", "scp-173", "scp-682", "scp-3125", "scp-7725", "scp-106", "scp-4857", "scp-5056", "scp-610", "scp-999", "scp-2480", "scp-6579", "scp-7179", "scp-4726", "scp-4379", "scp-055", "scp-5320", "scp-6592", "scp-3309", "scp-3999", "scp-1730", "scp-6911", "scp-3809", "scp-6861", "scp-048", "scp-527", "scp-3019", "scp-4003", "scp-028", "scp-4006", "scp-6987", "scp-7992", "dr-clef-s-proposal", "scp-3700", "scp-5243", "a-confluence-of-clandestine-conferences", "scp-5900", "scp-5242", "scp-895", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-001", "scp_number": 1, "series": "joke", "tags": ["001-proposal", "_cc", "_licensebox", "cadaver", "co-authored", "explained", "humanoid", "joke", "scp"], "title": "SCP-001", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/abraka-davids-proposal"}, "SCP-049-J": {"created_at": "2017-11-23T02:00:00", "creator": "djkaktus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "djkaktus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djkaktus", "comment": "", "date": "2017-11-23T02:00:00"}, {"author": "djkaktus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djkaktus", "comment": "Uploaded file \"doctor.png\".", "date": "2017-11-23T02:01:00"}, {"author": "Taffeta", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/taffeta", "comment": "Added tags: biohazard, euclid, hostile, humanoid, joke, plant, sapient, scp.

To date, it has been unable to cure literally anything, and typically only exacerbates conditions considerably. \n\n\n\nWhile this alone would not be enough for the Foundation to hold SCP-049-J indefinitely as an anomalous entity, it has also proven capable of somehow always evading capture and escaping from Foundation sites after its true lack of capabilities are revealed. Because of this, and because of staff\u2019s unwavering curiosity as to whether it has any of the self-proclaimed magical healing abilities it describes, SCP-049-J is to be housed and treated as an anomalous entity. \n\n\n\n**Addendum 049-J.1:** Interview\n\n\n\n> [BEGIN LOG]\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Hello SCP-049-J, welcome to-\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** I am a doctor.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** -uh, yes, I\u2019m aware.

You\u2019re sort of a moron, aren\u2019t you?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** No good sir I am most effective. I mean, my cure. I am the cure. Very effective. The most. Because I am a doctor. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Right, we were going to look into that. Let\u2019s, uh- (//gestures for assistants//)\n\n> \n\n> //Two researchers wheel in a patient on a table.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** So this patient-\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** (//Sniff//) -has the pestilence yes mmmmmmm I can smell it.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** ...has a sore throat. We were wondering if you know of any cures to fix their ailments.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** I\u2026 (//pauses//) yes, of course. I am a doctor after all. (//Subject begins to dig around in their doctor bag for some time.//)\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Need any help over there?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** NO! (//Muttering//) He is not the cure. I am the cure. (//Pauses//) Ah, yes. This will do the trick.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** That is a shoe.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** Yes.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** That will heal this person?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** It is the cure.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Alright, go ahead.\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-049-J proceeds to gesture dramatically over the patient before violently beating the patient\u2019s throat with a shoe.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Whoa, fuck! What are you doing? How is this supposed to help?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** (//Shrieking incoherently//) \n\n> \n\n> //After a moment, the entity stops. The patient lies mutilated and dead on the tabletop.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** ...what the fuck was that?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** (//Dramatic gesture//) Patient is healed.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** What? No she\u2019s not! You just crushed her throat with a shoe!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** No patient is very well now yes I am the cure.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Look at all this blood! Moral atrocities aside this is going to take hours to clean up! You just killed a person!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** No they are cured yes watch (//Grabs the corner of the patient\u2019s mouth and begins to move it while speaking out of the corner of his own.//) Hello yes I am the patient good sir and I am cured most effective thank you doctor you did a good job you are the best doctor mmhmm mmhmm.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** Now look here, I see your hand down there. I know that isn\u2019t the patient talking. What is this supposed to be?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-049-J:** (//Pauses//) Uh. (//Pauses//) Oh look, more pestilence over there. (//Points behind Dr. Baker//)\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Baker:** (//Turns to look//) What? Whe- oh for fucks sake he\u2019s gone again. God dammit.\n\n> \n\n> //Post incident video logs show SCP-049-J making a brisk escape through a side door. Additional footage gathered from a nearby town shows SCP-049-J stopping at a hardware store to pick up \u201ca pointier wooden doctor stick\u201d.//\n\n> \n\n> [END LOG]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:djk\">:scp-wiki:component:djk</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** doctor.png\n\n> **Name:** A Plague Doctor \u2013 from Jean-Jacques Manget, Trait\u00e9 de la peste (1721); University of Lausanne version.png\n\n> **Author:** N/A\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Plague_Doctor_%E2%80%93_from_Jean-Jacques_Manget,_Trait%C3%A9_de_la_peste_(1721);_University_of_Lausanne_version.png Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:info-ayers", "classification-committee-memo", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-049-J", "scp_number": 49, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "biohazard", "euclid", "hostile", "humanoid", "joke", "murder-monster", "plague-doctor", "plant", "sapient", "scp"], "title": "SCP-049-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-049-j"}, "SCP-076-J": {"created_at": "2017-08-25T00:07:00", "creator": "daveyoufool", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "daveyoufool", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/daveyoufool", "comment": "", "date": "2017-08-25T00:07:00"}, {"author": "daveyoufool", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/daveyoufool", "comment": "", "date": "2017-08-25T00:13:00"}, {"author": "daveyoufool", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/daveyoufool", "comment": "", "date": "2017-08-25T00:23:00"}, {"author": "daveyoufool", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/daveyoufool", "comment": "", "date": "2017-08-25T02:03:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: joke, k-class-scenario, scp, unclassed.

The structure is to be lined with plasticrete, backed up by 4 meters of steel. Attempts to encase the SCP in telekill have met with absolutely zero success. SCP-100-J is to be kept in a plastic bucket in the middle of the containment structure. There is to be around-the-clock surveillance of SCP-100-J. Security on SCP-100-J is minimal at most times, needing only one guard on a rotating schedule. However, whenever a new operative joins the staff at Site-19, a security detail of at least 20 fully-trained security operatives, as well as ten agents, are to be on duty outside the containment structure for 72 hours; after 72 hours, if no new SCP has been spawned, normal security practices are to be reinstated. Should a non-sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, a team of researchers is to be dispatched into the containment structure, to determine the properties of the new SCP, and to determine how best to decommission it. Should a sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, Site-19 is to go on full alert, and all manpower brought to bear on containment structure. Agents Clef, Kondraki, Gears, and [REDACTED] are to be immediately informed, so they can begin forming decommission strategies. Should an SCP from SCP-100-J make it past the bottom ten floors of Site-19, the onsite nuclear weapon is to be detonated.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-100-J appears to be a 42\u00a0cm by 32\u00a0cm mound of equine feces. The SCP maintains a constant moistness, as well as an inner temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius.</p>\n<p>Whenever a new operative joins Site-19, there is a 75% chance that a new SCP will be spawned from SCP-100-J. There is a 50% chance of the new SCP being sentient.</p>\n<p>Non-sentient SCPs come in a variety of categories. Many are weapons, all of which bestow extraordinary abilities upon the user. The majority of such weapons are swords, with a small minority being rather awkwardly-modified firearms. Additional non-sentient SCPs tend to be items that either work better than they should, or work in direct opposition to the way they should.</p>\n<p>Sentient SCPs come in two main categories. The majority of humanoid SCPs appear as idealized versions of the new operative, physically attractive, with a multitude of abilities, and tend to make people feel comfortable in their presence. Non-humanoid SCPs are usually some form of enhanced normal creature, but with bizarre coloring.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> List of SCPs created from SCP-100-J:</p>\n<p>SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-D 'Little Addie': SCP appeared to be Adolf Hitler, at six years old.

Hair is blond, eyes are blue. SCP-10101 likes to wear black and dark blue and prefers jeans. SCP-10101's favorite pizza toppings are pineapples and sausage, but I dislike chicken and tomatoes; his favorite show is <em>My Little Pony Friendship is Magic</em>.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> He likes to be called \"Jack, the King of Everything\"; staff is to refer to SCP-10101 as this under penalty of torture. Subject's varied interests include video games, surfing the Internet and writing creepypasta. SCP-10101 <em>does</em>, in fact, shower every day and is not a \"no-life virgin\", and all who claim otherwise are to be terminated.</p>\n<p><strong>Acquisition:</strong> SCP-10101 had a difficult childhood: his parents were total squares who didn't allow me to play videogames or go to parties after midnight. His powers first manifested at the age of 16, and were promptly used to utterly humiliate all students and teachers at his school who ever mistreated him (especially D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a worthless piece of shit, who died very slowly and painfully). Soon afterwards, SCP-10101 arrived at Site 19, bypassed all security measures, and personally requested that he be allowed to help the SCP Foundation in its mission.</p>\n<p>Further investigation revealed that SCP-10101's talents are supreme. He is able to hack into any known computer system (\"I'm not even sure how I do that, I just go with the flow\"), is better at science than the Foundation's finest researchers (\"I suppose I remember a thing or two from high school\") and has proven himself adept at hand-to-hand warfare (\"I watched a kung fu movie once, it's easy\"). Soon after his arrival SCP-10101 began hanging out with all the coolest characters, including Dr. Clef, Dr. Gears, Dr. Kondraki, Kain Pathos Crow, Dr. Rights, agent Strelnikov, agent Yoric, etc.</p>\n<p>Dr. Clef took SCP-10101 under his wing to give him lessons in tactical combat; however, it soon became apparent, in Dr. Clef's words, that \"this motherfucker was teaching me more than I could teach him.\" SCP-10101 is currently busy organizing his own Mobile Task Force, MTF-Sigma-Billion-Twelve-Banana.</p>\n<p>SCP-10101 is friendly towards humanity and is on the side of good. While on multiple occasions he has helped in capturing or terminating various evil SCPs, he steadfastly refuses to help us capture good SCPs. SCP-10101's stalwart honor and morality puts our organisation to shame; by his demand, the O5 council has vowed to cease appeasement of <a href=\"/scp-089\">SCP-089</a>, free <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231-7</a> from her plight, and in general never hurt any innocent person ever again, so that we can finally be the heroes the world deserves.</p>\n<p><strong>Superpowers:</strong> Currently known superpowers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sheer awesomeness, comparable to Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan and Bill Gates combined<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>The ability to lift 48736598346587.313352142 \u00b1 0.000000003 tonnes of burden over his head</li>\n<li>The ability to run with the speed of a hojillion km/s</li>\n<li>An IQ of 9873857, and then some<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li>Immunity to diseases, poison, fire, cold, radiation, acid, disintegration, erasure from reality, any physical harm, death, tofu, plot device, and everything else</li>\n<li>The ability to (by mere force of will) heal all diseases that afflict any being, instantly</li>\n<li>The ability to transform/manipulate matter and reality in any way he wishes</li>\n<li>Most spectacularly, [DATA EXPUNGED]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Addendum 10101-1:</strong> It should be noted that in the past, for some reason, a certain stupid girl named K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has rejected SCP-10101 as her boyfriend, instead choosing another boy who was dumb, uncool and not at all as sexy as SCP-10101. It is theorized that K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a stupid bitch who will one day be sorry for this. For now, SCP-10101 has settled for <a href=\"/scp-105\">SCP-105</a> as his girlfriend and concubine.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-SCP Testing:</strong> At SCP-10101's request, he has been cross-tested with several of the coolest SCP items in Foundation custody.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a>-2</li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-10101 demands a duel with SCP-076-2. At own request, SCP-10101 has his eyes blindfolded, arms and legs tied, and plugs put in his ears. The battle takes two (2) seconds and obviously ends in SCP-10101's victory. Impressed, SCP-076-2 makes to the subject an offer to join the Mobile Task Force Omega-7. SCP-10101 laughs in SCP-076-2's stupid face and sneers snarkily, \"Sorry, buddy, but your little playground gang will just have to do without me. I know <em>I</em> wouldn't accept a loser like you in <em>my</em> MTF!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> SCP-076-2 reprimanded for wasting SCP-10101's time with absurd offers and forced to apologize.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-056\">SCP-056</a></li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-056 given grief counseling.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-177\">SCP-177</a></li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> While casually reading through the top-secret Foundation files, SCP-10101 becomes aware of SCP-177 and requests a duel. Subject proceeds to effortlessly win several games with SCP-177. SCP-10101 is not observing the board directly, but rather dictates his moves from another room, all while preparing an omelette, playing <em>I Wanna Be The Guy</em> (on the hardest difficulty level and with the monitor turned off), and balancing (barefoot) on barbed wire 0.5\u00a0mm thin over a river of lava (with spikes in the river) (with bees on the spikes). Furthermore, SCP-10101 refuses to be informed of any moves made by SCP-177, instead taking lucky guesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-953\">SCP-953</a></li>\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-10101, accompanied by armed guards, opens door to SCP-953's cell. SCP-953 snarls at SCP-10101. SCP-10101 enters SCP-953's cell and requests \"a half hour of privacy\" for \"a little one-on-one\"; request is granted. After 30 minutes SCP-10101 leaves cell, smiling enigmatically and blowing a kiss to SCP-953. Subsequent interviews with SCP-953 reveal that subject is no longer evil and is sorry for all she had done.</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> \"Instead of keeping her all locked up and stuff, you cruel bastards just needed to approach her humanely.

Hair is blond, eyes are blue. SCP-10101 likes to wear black and dark blue and prefers jeans. SCP-10101's favorite pizza toppings are pineapples and sausage, but I dislike chicken and tomatoes; his favorite show is //My Little Pony Friendship is Magic//.[[footnote]]SCP-10101's favorite pony is Rainbow Dash.[[/footnote]] He likes to be called \"Jack, the King of Everything\"; staff is to refer to SCP-10101 as this under penalty of torture. Subject's varied interests include video games, surfing the Internet and writing creepypasta. SCP-10101 //does//, in fact, shower every day and is not a \"no-life virgin\", and all who claim otherwise are to be terminated.\n\n\n\n**Acquisition:** SCP-10101 had a difficult childhood: his parents were total squares who didn't allow me to play videogames or go to parties after midnight. His powers first manifested at the age of 16, and were promptly used to utterly humiliate all students and teachers at his school who ever mistreated him (especially D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a worthless piece of shit, who died very slowly and painfully). Soon afterwards, SCP-10101 arrived at Site 19, bypassed all security measures, and personally requested that he be allowed to help the SCP Foundation in its mission. \n\n\n\nFurther investigation revealed that SCP-10101's talents are supreme. He is able to hack into any known computer system (\"I'm not even sure how I do that, I just go with the flow\"), is better at science than the Foundation's finest researchers (\"I suppose I remember a thing or two from high school\") and has proven himself adept at hand-to-hand warfare (\"I watched a kung fu movie once, it's easy\"). Soon after his arrival SCP-10101 began hanging out with all the coolest characters, including Dr. Clef, Dr. Gears, Dr. Kondraki, Kain Pathos Crow, Dr. Rights, agent Strelnikov, agent Yoric, etc. \n\n\n\nDr. Clef took SCP-10101 under his wing to give him lessons in tactical combat; however, it soon became apparent, in Dr. Clef's words, that \"this motherfucker was teaching me more than I could teach him.\" SCP-10101 is currently busy organizing his own Mobile Task Force, MTF-Sigma-Billion-Twelve-Banana. \n\n\n\nSCP-10101 is friendly towards humanity and is on the side of good. While on multiple occasions he has helped in capturing or terminating various evil SCPs, he steadfastly refuses to help us capture good SCPs. SCP-10101's stalwart honor and morality puts our organisation to shame; by his demand, the O5 council has vowed to cease appeasement of [[[SCP-089]]], free [[[SCP-231|SCP-231-7]]] from her plight, and in general never hurt any innocent person ever again, so that we can finally be the heroes the world deserves. \n\n\n\n**Superpowers:** Currently known superpowers include:\n\n* Sheer awesomeness, comparable to Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan and Bill Gates combined[[footnote]]An entire new SI prefix had to be created to quantify SCP-10101's awesomess.[[/footnote]]\n\n* The ability to lift 48736598346587.313352142 \u00b1 0.000000003 tonnes of burden over his head\n\n* The ability to run with the speed of a hojillion km/s\n\n* An IQ of 9873857, and then some[[footnote]]Measured using special IQ tests that SCP-10101 invented himself.[[/footnote]]\n\n* Immunity to diseases, poison, fire, cold, radiation, acid, disintegration, erasure from reality, any physical harm, death, tofu, plot device, and everything else\n\n* The ability to (by mere force of will) heal all diseases that afflict any being, instantly\n\n* The ability to transform/manipulate matter and reality in any way he wishes\n\n* Most spectacularly, [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 10101-1:** It should be noted that in the past, for some reason, a certain stupid girl named K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has rejected SCP-10101 as her boyfriend, instead choosing another boy who was dumb, uncool and not at all as sexy as SCP-10101. It is theorized that K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a stupid bitch who will one day be sorry for this. For now, SCP-10101 has settled for [[[SCP-105]]] as his girlfriend and concubine.\n\n\n\n**Cross-SCP Testing:** At SCP-10101's request, he has been cross-tested with several of the coolest SCP items in Foundation custody. \n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-076]]]-2\n\n* **Result:** SCP-10101 demands a duel with SCP-076-2. At own request, SCP-10101 has his eyes blindfolded, arms and legs tied, and plugs put in his ears. The battle takes two (2) seconds and obviously ends in SCP-10101's victory. Impressed, SCP-076-2 makes to the subject an offer to join the Mobile Task Force Omega-7. SCP-10101 laughs in SCP-076-2's stupid face and sneers snarkily, \"Sorry, buddy, but your little playground gang will just have to do without me. I know //I// wouldn't accept a loser like you in //my// MTF!\"\n\n* **Note:** SCP-076-2 reprimanded for wasting SCP-10101's time with absurd offers and forced to apologize. \n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-056]]]\n\n* **Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-056 given grief counseling.\n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-177]]]\n\n* **Result:** While casually reading through the top-secret Foundation files, SCP-10101 becomes aware of SCP-177 and requests a duel. Subject proceeds to effortlessly win several games with SCP-177. SCP-10101 is not observing the board directly, but rather dictates his moves from another room, all while preparing an omelette, playing //I Wanna Be The Guy// (on the hardest difficulty level and with the monitor turned off), and balancing (barefoot) on barbed wire 0.5 mm thin over a river of lava (with spikes in the river) (with bees on the spikes). Furthermore, SCP-10101 refuses to be informed of any moves made by SCP-177, instead taking lucky guesses. \n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-953]]]\n\n* **Result:** SCP-10101, accompanied by armed guards, opens door to SCP-953's cell. SCP-953 snarls at SCP-10101. SCP-10101 enters SCP-953's cell and requests \"a half hour of privacy\" for \"a little one-on-one\"; request is granted. After 30 minutes SCP-10101 leaves cell, smiling enigmatically and blowing a kiss to SCP-953. Subsequent interviews with SCP-953 reveal that subject is no longer evil and is sorry for all she had done. \n\n* **Note:** \"Instead of keeping her all locked up and stuff, you cruel bastards just needed to approach her humanely. I knew someone so pretty couldn't be irredeemably evil.\" -- SCP-10101\n\n\n\n* **Item:** [[[SCP-777-J]]]\n\n* **Result:** [DATA TOO AWESOME] No survivors. [[[SCP-2000]]] utilized. SCP-10101-J and SCP-777-J promise that their next battle will take place on some planet nobody needs anymore. \n\n\n\n**Incident Log 10101-3300:**\n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-10101 and O5-13 enter the guard station overlooking [[[SCP-682]]]'s chamber.

As SCP-173-J is basically harmless, is to be permitted to move freely about Facility-17. The Site Director foresees no adverse consequences from this policy.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Following disastrous unforeseen consequences, new containment procedures are in development. See <strong>Incident Log 8/17/92</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Contained in Facility-17, as of 1992<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint, as well as what appears to be state-fair-grade water-based face paint in a \"cat face\" pattern. SCP-173-J is animate and extremely playful. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Object is reported to initiate interaction by standing uncomfortably close to subjects. Some personnel have reported low, asthmatic-sounding sniffling noises; these are presumed to be imaginary, or memetic, or something. SCP-173-J's primary motive seems to be seeking attention; for example, if SCP-173-J encounters a researcher working on a computer or reading a document, and the researcher blinks, the sculpture will stand on the object in an attempt to gain the researcher's focus. If SCP-173-J is in a room possessing a window, it will sometimes take hold of a researcher's head and move it to face the window. This has been construed as SCP-173-J earnestly requesting to play outside. The established procedure for handling these situations is to pat SCP-173-J in a friendly manner and say \"Run along now, you little scamp.\"</p>\n<p>Note that SCP-173-J\u2019s action occurs too quickly for subjects to respond; when at full speed, the object is capable of completing three (3) shenanigans per second.</p>\n<p>On 7/20/92, SCP-173-J appeared wearing a sombrero. The object entered a \"fiesta state\" in which, according to audio analysis, it produced and rapidly shook a pair of castanets while running in unoccupied rooms or hallways. The origin of this hat-based secondary phenomenon is unknown, but the Site Director determined that confiscating it or investigating the event in any other way would be, to quote the official directive, \"interfering with forces beyond our comprehension\". Facility-17 staff have reported in official transcripts that this phenomenon was \"loads of fun\" and \"like Christmas, Cinco de Mayo, and Free Pretzel Day at the cafeteria put together\". Any staff who attempt to induce a \"fiesta state\" in SCP-173-J will be assigned to toilet owl duty.</p>\n<p>Personnel report the sound of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one else is present inside and the object is not under video surveillance. Freelance stone-scraping analysts have determined that SCP-173-J is practicing the dance of its people. This is considered normal, and any change in this behavior should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.</p>\n<p>The thick, brown substance on the floor of SCP-173-J's dwelling is [DATA EXPUNGED]-O brand chocolate pudding. Origin of this material is unknown. The substance poses no apparent danger, and is allowed to accumulate freely. <strong>UPDATE: SEE INCIDENT LOG 8/14/92.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Incident Log 8/14/92:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Assistant Researcher Bramwell was assigned to inspect SCP-173-J for physical changes. Researchers Murphy and Nichols spoke to him using a two-way handheld communicator. The following is a transcript of the communication transmitted during the inspection.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: Guys? This floor is really\u2026 really slippery.</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Man, I bet.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: No surprise there, it\u2019s all puddingy.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: No, I mean I don\u2019t think I can even get over to the sculpture. This stuff is a few inches deep.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: You mean \u201ca few centimeters deep\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: This is probably going on the record. At least try to be professional.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: [EXPLETIVE]! <em>[A collision is heard.]</em> It\u2019s in my eyes\u2014Oh, [EXPLETIVE]!</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Didn\u2019t you hear what he just said? Watch your language, Doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: It's standing over me, just\u2026 just waiting, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: It sounds like he's up for a pudding wrassle <em>[sic]</em>. It's okay, I'm pretty sure you can take him.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: Oh, god, I just blinked and he's leaning toward me\u2014 <em>[A muffled scream can be heard.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Don't worry about language. It\u2019ll probably just be taken out in the transcript.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: It\u2019s on top of me! I can\u2019t see, and it\u2019s crushing my <em>[unintelligible]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: It's just a pin, man, you can reverse it! Wait, they can do that?</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Sure. It\u2019s called redaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: I can't! He must weigh <em>[gurgling cough]</em> four hundred (400) pounds!</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Nice clinical tone! You got this!</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Redaction, huh? [EXPLETIVE], that\u2019s fantastic. <em>[chuckles]</em> I said [EXPLETIVE]. Seriously, how have I not heard about this?</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: They only just started doing it. It\u2019s actually encouraged, since it apparently makes the documentation more interesting and suspenseful if you leave out the scary or salacious bits.</p>\n<p><strong>Bramwell</strong>: I'm losing consciousness!</p>\n<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Nichols, that\u2019s really nice of them. There might be children reading this.</p>\n<p><strong>Nichols</strong>: Sweep the leg!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Incident Log 8/17/92</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Following the recovery of Assistant Researcher Bramwell\u2019s body, it was determined that the storage container required a thorough cleaning to facilitate access to its resident. SCP-173-J was monitored carefully while high-pressure showers and a large drain grate were installed in the chamber. On 8/17, the following incident occurred.</p>\n<p>02:00:40: The showers in SCP-173-J\u2019s chamber are activated. The pudding is scoured from the floor.</p>\n<p>02:01:34: Researcher Murphy notes that the water-based face paint on SCP-173-J is also being washed away by the sprinklers.</p>\n<p>02:05:18: The showers are turned off.</p>\n<p>02:20:04: The video feed monitoring SCP-173-J deactivates and becomes unresponsive. The interior of the chamber is silent.</p>\n<p>02:28:11: The HMCL supervisor is called.</p>\n<p>02:31:46: The HMCL supervisor arrives, takes inventory of the situation, and shrugs.</p>\n<p>02:31:52: The HMCL supervisor is fired.</p>\n<p>02:33:07: Researchers Murphy and Nichols are assigned to investigate.</p>\n<p>02:33:51: The two doctors enter the chamber. Researcher Nichols notes via two-way communicator that the floor near SCP-173-J appears to be tinged dark red. Dr. Nichols takes a sample of the coating and remarks with extreme surprise that it does not taste like pudding at all.</p>\n<p>02:34:01: A song is heard faintly in the background.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Researcher Murphy remarks: \u201cI think I have a text message.\u201d</p>\n<p>02:34:12: Dr. Nichols groans audibly. Dr. Murphy is heard remarking that the sender is most likely Kelly, who was previously speculating about breaking up with her boyfriend Mark. Dr. Murphy indicates an imperative need to discover whether such a procedure has been enacted, and if so, whether he can hit that on the rebound.</p>\n<p>02:34:19: Dr. Nichols announces that he will maintain line of sight on SCP-173-J by closing one eye at a time. <em>[This never works.]</em></p>\n<p>02:34:26: A snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.</p>\n<p>02:34:28: A second snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.</p>\n<p>[REMAINING LOG EXPUNGED]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following this event, SCP-173-J\u2019s containment procedures are scheduled to be completely revised. The new procedures will stipulate that SCP-173-J be kept locked in his containment area, which will be cleaned by hand. Any implication that SCP-173-J's containment documents should be revised will be denied, as SCP-173-J represents the classic roots of the Foundation which persist no matter which direction the organization has taken in the meantime.</p>\nBefore this revision was ordered, the Site Director requested that Foundation Senior Staff decommission SCP-173-J due to its new properties, as the staffers are, to quote the Director\u2019s requisition letter, \u201cawesome and dreamy and wacky\u201d. However, the request was denied; all Senior Staff were too busy chatting with, seducing, wielding, <a href=\"/document-050\">playing practical jokes with</a>, or riding to victory various SCP objects. The Site Director identified this setback as \u201cdisastrous to the safety and integrity of the Foundation, but <a href=\"/incident-239-b-clef-kondraki\">exactly as hilarious as they think it is</a>\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

As SCP-173-J is basically harmless, is to be permitted to move freely about Facility-17. The Site Director foresees no adverse consequences from this policy.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**UPDATE:** Following disastrous unforeseen consequences, new containment procedures are in development. See **Incident Log 8/17/92**.\n\n\n\n**Description:** Contained in Facility-17, as of 1992[[footnote]]Spaces were not added to containment site names until 1995.[[/footnote]]. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint, as well as what appears to be state-fair-grade water-based face paint in a \"cat face\" pattern. SCP-173-J is animate and extremely playful. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Object is reported to initiate interaction by standing uncomfortably close to subjects. Some personnel have reported low, asthmatic-sounding sniffling noises; these are presumed to be imaginary, or memetic, or something. SCP-173-J's primary motive seems to be seeking attention; for example, if SCP-173-J encounters a researcher working on a computer or reading a document, and the researcher blinks, the sculpture will stand on the object in an attempt to gain the researcher's focus. If SCP-173-J is in a room possessing a window, it will sometimes take hold of a researcher's head and move it to face the window. This has been construed as SCP-173-J earnestly requesting to play outside. The established procedure for handling these situations is to pat SCP-173-J in a friendly manner and say \"Run along now, you little scamp.\"\n\n\n\nNote that SCP-173-J\u2019s action occurs too quickly for subjects to respond; when at full speed, the object is capable of completing three (3) shenanigans per second. \n\n\n\nOn 7/20/92, SCP-173-J appeared wearing a sombrero. The object entered a \"fiesta state\" in which, according to audio analysis, it produced and rapidly shook a pair of castanets while running in unoccupied rooms or hallways. The origin of this hat-based secondary phenomenon is unknown, but the Site Director determined that confiscating it or investigating the event in any other way would be, to quote the official directive, \"interfering with forces beyond our comprehension\". Facility-17 staff have reported in official transcripts that this phenomenon was \"loads of fun\" and \"like Christmas, Cinco de Mayo, and Free Pretzel Day at the cafeteria put together\". Any staff who attempt to induce a \"fiesta state\" in SCP-173-J will be assigned to toilet owl duty.\n\n\n\nPersonnel report the sound of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one else is present inside and the object is not under video surveillance. Freelance stone-scraping analysts have determined that SCP-173-J is practicing the dance of its people. This is considered normal, and any change in this behavior should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.\n\n\n\nThe thick, brown substance on the floor of SCP-173-J's dwelling is [DATA EXPUNGED]-O brand chocolate pudding. Origin of this material is unknown. The substance poses no apparent danger, and is allowed to accumulate freely. **UPDATE: SEE INCIDENT LOG 8/14/92.**\n\n\n\n**Incident Log 8/14/92:**\n\n\n\n> //Assistant Researcher Bramwell was assigned to inspect SCP-173-J for physical changes. Researchers Murphy and Nichols spoke to him using a two-way handheld communicator. The following is a transcript of the communication transmitted during the inspection.//\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: Guys? This floor is really... really slippery.\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Man, I bet.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: No surprise there, it\u2019s all puddingy.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: No, I mean I don\u2019t think I can even get over to the sculpture. This stuff is a few inches deep.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: You mean \u201ca few centimeters deep\u201d.\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: This is probably going on the record. At least try to be professional.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: [EXPLETIVE]! //[A collision is heard.]// It\u2019s in my eyes\u2014Oh, [EXPLETIVE]!\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Didn\u2019t you hear what he just said? Watch your language, Doctor.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: It's standing over me, just... just waiting, I think.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: It sounds like he's up for a pudding wrassle //[sic]//. It's okay, I'm pretty sure you can take him.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: Oh, god, I just blinked and he's leaning toward me-- //[A muffled scream can be heard.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Don't worry about language. It\u2019ll probably just be taken out in the transcript.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: It\u2019s on top of me! I can\u2019t see, and it\u2019s crushing my //[unintelligible]//\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: It's just a pin, man, you can reverse it! Wait, they can do that?\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Sure. It\u2019s called redaction.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: I can't! He must weigh //[gurgling cough]// four hundred (400) pounds! \n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Nice clinical tone! You got this!\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Redaction, huh? [EXPLETIVE], that\u2019s fantastic. //[chuckles]// I said [EXPLETIVE]. Seriously, how have I not heard about this? \n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: They only just started doing it. It\u2019s actually encouraged, since it apparently makes the documentation more interesting and suspenseful if you leave out the scary or salacious bits.\n\n> \n\n> **Bramwell**: I'm losing consciousness!\n\n> \n\n> **Murphy**: Nichols, that\u2019s really nice of them. There might be children reading this.\n\n> \n\n> **Nichols**: Sweep the leg!\n\n\n\n**Incident Log 8/17/92**:\n\n\n\n> Following the recovery of Assistant Researcher Bramwell\u2019s body, it was determined that the storage container required a thorough cleaning to facilitate access to its resident. SCP-173-J was monitored carefully while high-pressure showers and a large drain grate were installed in the chamber. On 8/17, the following incident occurred.\n\n> \n\n> 02:00:40: The showers in SCP-173-J\u2019s chamber are activated. The pudding is scoured from the floor.\n\n> \n\n> 02:01:34: Researcher Murphy notes that the water-based face paint on SCP-173-J is also being washed away by the sprinklers.\n\n> \n\n> 02:05:18: The showers are turned off.\n\n> \n\n> 02:20:04: The video feed monitoring SCP-173-J deactivates and becomes unresponsive. The interior of the chamber is silent.\n\n> \n\n> 02:28:11: The HMCL supervisor is called.\n\n> \n\n> 02:31:46: The HMCL supervisor arrives, takes inventory of the situation, and shrugs.\n\n> \n\n> 02:31:52: The HMCL supervisor is fired.\n\n> \n\n> 02:33:07: Researchers Murphy and Nichols are assigned to investigate.\n\n> \n\n> 02:33:51: The two doctors enter the chamber. Researcher Nichols notes via two-way communicator that the floor near SCP-173-J appears to be tinged dark red. Dr. Nichols takes a sample of the coating and remarks with extreme surprise that it does not taste like pudding at all.\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:01: A song is heard faintly in the background. [[footnote]]This is later determined to be an eight-second clip of \u201cRock You Like A Hurricane\u201d by The Scorpions.[[/footnote]] Researcher Murphy remarks: \u201cI think I have a text message.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:12: Dr. Nichols groans audibly. Dr. Murphy is heard remarking that the sender is most likely Kelly, who was previously speculating about breaking up with her boyfriend Mark. Dr. Murphy indicates an imperative need to discover whether such a procedure has been enacted, and if so, whether he can hit that on the rebound.\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:19: Dr. Nichols announces that he will maintain line of sight on SCP-173-J by closing one eye at a time. //[This never works.]//\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:26: A snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.\n\n> \n\n> 02:34:28: A second snapping sound is heard in the audio feed.\n\n> \n\n> [REMAINING LOG EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nFollowing this event, SCP-173-J\u2019s containment procedures are scheduled to be completely revised. The new procedures will stipulate that SCP-173-J be kept locked in his containment area, which will be cleaned by hand. Any implication that SCP-173-J's containment documents should be revised will be denied, as SCP-173-J represents the classic roots of the Foundation which persist no matter which direction the organization has taken in the meantime.\n\n\n\nBefore this revision was ordered, the Site Director requested that Foundation Senior Staff decommission SCP-173-J due to its new properties, as the staffers are, to quote the Director\u2019s requisition letter, \u201cawesome and dreamy and wacky\u201d. However, the request was denied; all Senior Staff were too busy chatting with, seducing, wielding, [[[document-050|playing practical jokes with]]], or riding to victory various SCP objects. The Site Director identified this setback as \u201cdisastrous to the safety and integrity of the Foundation, but [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki|exactly as hilarious as they think it is]]]\u201d.\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["document-050", "incident-239-b-clef-kondraki", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-173-J", "scp_number": 173, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_licensebox", "autonomous", "euclid", "food", "joke", "observational", "scp", "sculpture", "the-sculpture"], "title": "SCP-173-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173-j"}, "SCP-1797-J": {"created_at": "2017-06-12T22:30:00", "creator": "RJB_R", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE", "date": "2017-06-12T22:30:00"}, {"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "", "date": "2017-06-12T22:49:00"}, {"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "Added tags: artistic, historical, joke, metamorphic, safe, scp, sexual.

A low-level investigation was conducted, at which point the Foundation was alerted and secured SCP-1797-J. \n\n\n\nFurther investigation of the library's records by Foundation personnel failed to yield any leads on SCP-1797-J's origin.\n\n\n\nRepeated viewings of SCP-1797-J causes it to display a different scene. Each viewing becomes more and more \"randy\"; However the President will always be picking his nose.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Researcher James has pointed out a possible relation to the following items:\n\n\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"John Adams yanking out a loose tooth while vacuuming\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"Thomas Jefferson being hit with a spork while kicking\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"James Madison doing jumping-jacks while writing a letter\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"James Monroe toweling off while bicycling\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"John Quincy Adams frowning while looking at his dad\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"Andrew Jackson tying his shoelaces while melting\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"Martin Van Buren laying his head in a guillotine while playing a borrowed Game Gear\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"William Henry Harrison conducting an orchestra while sneezing\"\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"John Tyler verbally reprimanding his children while taking off a Pinocchio costume\n\n* SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - \"James K.

A small grille is to be kept on the plexiglass window, with a guard posted outside to ensure SCP-2103 makes no efforts to escape. Only one guard is required, due primarily to the largely nonviolent nature of SCP-2103.

These 'pilot lights' are distributed in a manner which would seem to imply their use in turning and propulsion, but they do not appear to have any impact on the motion or operation of the main body beyond the belief that they 'look cool'. Similarly, while the turbine has been observed to provide some propulsion for this SCP, it does not appear to be required; a similar 'pilot light' occasionally fires from the rear, perhaps triggered by rapid motion.

Manipulator arms extend to either side of the SCP's upper body, one tipped by a simple two-point claw, the other by what appears to be a short-range missile launcher bay, exhausted of ammunition. Finally, SCP-2103 appears to have a hidden speaker somewhere, projected to be contained underneath its hat, for carrying on conversations. In conversation, 2103 speaks in a purely robotic monotone, regardless of the tone of voice used to speak to it.</p>\n<p>SCP-2103 appears to crave some manner of contact with a sapient creature. Given the opportunity, SCP-2103 will speak ad infinitum - and occasionally ad nauseam - in a broken, stilted speech pattern, characteristic of prior 'eggdrop'-styled bots. When roughly four hours of conversation are not provided within a twenty-four hour period, SCP-2103 will immediately move to track down and speak with the nearest sapient, using whatever means are at its disposal. The last time this occurred, SCP-2103 began a [DATA REDACTED] never quite the same again. While the SCP has a substantial library of words and phrases, when being spoken with, SCP-2103 will gradually adopt the speech patterns of whoever is talking to it, oftentimes repeating phrases based on what may be an ELIZA-styled algorithm.

\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n**Timeframe:** One hour\n\n**Subject:** Political discourse\n\n**Result:**\n\nThroughout the course of the conversation, Agent

conversation became increasingly esoteric, centered more about small textual scraps and flower arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0At roughly 7 hours, conversation devolved into almost unfathomable blips and scraps of text.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the test, attending staff member complained of a headache.\n\n**Commentary:** //Can we NOT do that again?\u00a0\u00a0At least with me holding the

Two days after her inauguration, contact with the Foundation was re-established by PoI-231-Omega, having recovered from his amnestic treatment through the usage of the highly esoteric and experimental technique known as \"having written it down prior to the amnestics.\" At this point, through several loopholes carefully designed by PoI-231-Omega, SCP-231-J had increased in value to $50,936,299,102.49 plus tax, with an additional debt of \"500 human souls, two truckloads of diamonds, the blood of a virgin, and a goddamn pony.\"</p>\n<p>Following this contact, PoI-231-Omega was promptly located by MTF Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\"), issued several restraining orders, reprimanded, and stabbed to death<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.

Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal mishandling of crucial funding assets.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards throwing money at the problem, or anything else.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, you may not keep the cash she doesn't pick up.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, we have not given up trying to save up for a specific appeasement fund for SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent asset liquidation event associated with each subsequent \"Collections Liaison\" specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's repossession event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the accountants (see document \"Seven Brides, Seven Percent Compound Interest,\" SCP-231-Adjunct B).</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0No, filing for bankruptcy is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her and throwing post-it notes. She has to be aware of the individual value of each bill for 110-Montauk to work.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0One final note: The Foundation does many frivolous things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the debt is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682) but because of the danger that our credit score will fail even harder, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to lack of a reasonable budget, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous spending. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the payroll department.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br/>\nThe Administrator<br/>\n<sub>GIVE ME MY MONEY YOU PUTRID BAGS OF BONES AND MEAT AND FECES, WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY, YOU'VE GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT, WHERE I CAN'T GET IT, I'LL EVEN ACCEPT TRAVELER'S CHECKS FOR FUCK'S SAKE</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Input\u00a05/231-J\u00a0Credentials\u00a0-\u00a0Does\u00a0The\u00a0Black\u00a0Moon\u00a0Howl?</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0\"Fuck\u00a0if\u00a0I\u00a0know.\"</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-231-Omega-J</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Apollyon</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <em>\"God help us all.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-231-Omega-J is the Foundation's credit rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Any questions? Yeah, Steve.\n\n> \n\n> **[PoI-231-Omega]:** Where's that money you owe me?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jackson:** Not the time or place. Any other questions?\n\n> \n\n> **[PoI-231-Omega]:** Actually, I think you have a very poor understanding of how serious this situation is. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jackson:** As do you, clearly - a quarter of a hundred thousand people's minds just exploded, and you're worrying about two dollars.\n\n> \n\n> **[PoI-231-Omega]:** Well, if you had done your //homework//, you'd notice that, in my application for employment at Site-19, I //specifically// included a 50-page addendum detailing any loans that I would disperse to my coworkers, regardless of value. This addendum, which you agreed to by accepting my application (Article 2, paragraph 34), explicitly states that the debt would need to be repaid in full no less than 72 hours from initial disbursement. Having failed to do so, you have incurred a Class-G Delinquency Penalty Rate (Article 5, paragraph 19) of $100 dollars per month, plus a $5,000 first-time default fee and applicable Silver-level compound interest rates, as outlined in the monthly newsletter to which you subscribed by accepting my application (Article 5, paragraph 50). You currently owe me $493,026.34, plus tax.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jackson:** Steve, what's this?\n\n> \n\n> **[PoI-231-Omega]:** What's what?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jackson:** This thing in my hand.\n\n> \n\n> **[PoI-231-Omega]:** I don't see how that's relevant to the case at hand, but that's a combat-grade amnestic visual cognitohaz--\n\n> \n\n> [PoI-231-Omega falls unconscious]\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jackson:** The phrase \"you're so fucking fired\" comes to mind.\n\n> \n\n> <End log>\n\n\n\nOn April 10th, 1990, following the death of the previous Administrator from food poisoning, Dr. Jackson was elected as his replacement in light of her heroism and leadership during Incident-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-Black. Two days after her inauguration, contact with the Foundation was re-established by PoI-231-Omega, having recovered from his amnestic treatment through the usage of the highly esoteric and experimental technique known as \"having written it down prior to the amnestics.\" At this point, through several loopholes carefully designed by PoI-231-Omega, SCP-231-J had increased in value to $50,936,299,102.49 plus tax, with an additional debt of \"500 human souls, two truckloads of diamonds, the blood of a virgin, and a goddamn pony.\" \n\n\n\nFollowing this contact, PoI-231-Omega was promptly located by MTF Psi-8 (\"The Silencers\"), issued several restraining orders, reprimanded, and stabbed to death[[footnote]] It should be noted that the means of termination had incidentally fulfilled the requirement of \"the blood of a virgin\". [[/footnote]]. Before his termination, PoI-231-Omega made an otherwise unintelligible mention of a \"transfer to a third-party collections agency.\" Following this, SCP-231-J was temporarily reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** On May 15th, 1995, Site-19 received a letter in an unmarked envelope.\n\n\n\n> //Scarlett & King Collections Agency//\n\n> //7 N.

Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal mishandling of crucial funding assets.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards throwing money at the problem, or anything else.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, you may not keep the cash she doesn't pick up.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, we have not given up trying to save up for a specific appeasement fund for SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent asset liquidation event associated with each subsequent \"Collections Liaison\" specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's repossession event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the accountants (see document \"Seven Brides, Seven Percent Compound Interest,\" SCP-231-Adjunct B).\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0No, filing for bankruptcy is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her and throwing post-it notes. She has to be aware of the individual value of each bill for 110-Montauk to work.\n\n> \n\n> \u2022\u00a0One final note: The Foundation does many frivolous things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the debt is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682) but because of the danger that our credit score will fail even harder, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to lack of a reasonable budget, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous spending. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the payroll department.\n\n> \n\n> Sincerely,\n\n> The Administrator\n\n> ,,GIVE ME MY MONEY YOU PUTRID BAGS OF BONES AND MEAT AND FECES, WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY, YOU'VE GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT, WHERE I CAN'T GET IT, I'LL EVEN ACCEPT TRAVELER'S CHECKS FOR FUCK'S SAKE,,\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Input 5/231-J Credentials - Does The Black Moon Howl?\" hide=\"- \"Fuck if I know.\"\"]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-231-Omega-J\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Apollyon\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** //\"God help us all.\"//\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-231-Omega-J is the Foundation's credit rating.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-076", "scp-682", "scp-231", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-231-J", "scp_number": 231, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_licensebox", "chaos-insurgency", "currency", "joke", "keter", "scarlet-king", "scp", "the-administrator"], "title": "SCP-231-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231-j"}, "SCP-2317-J": {"created_at": "2017-10-26T06:33:00", "creator": "stormbreath", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "", "date": "2017-10-26T06:33:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "Some SPAG fixes", "date": "2017-10-26T17:22:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "more SPAG fixes", "date": "2017-10-26T17:35:00"}, {"author": "stormbreath", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stormbreath", "comment": "", "date": "2017-10-28T06:21:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: extradimensional, joke, portal, safe, scp.

Personnel are to be reminded that, no matter what the voice on the other side says, the only living organism behind SCP-2317-J is SCP-2317-JK.\n\n\n\nA sticky note reading: \"do **__NOT__** open - scp 2317 jk inside (wants to eat the world)\" is to be stuck onto SCP-2317-J at all times as a last resort method against the opening of SCP-2317-J.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2317-J is a door that acts as a universal portal, opening into Universe Kappa-Erikesh. The accessible area behind SCP-2317-J was a salt pan several kilometers across. Formerly, SCP-2317-J held seven marble pillars, but these have been destroyed by SCP-2317-JK. \n\n\n\nSCP-2317-JK is a two hundred kilometer tall, obese humanoid entity that was formerly contained by seven hooks embedded into its back, connected to the seven pillars found in Universe Kappa-Erikesh. Each of these hooks or pillars has broken, releasing SCP-2317-JK.\n\n\n\n**Addendum #1:** The Awakening of SCP-2317-JK.\n\n> //After the breaking of the seventh chain, the awakening of SCP-2317-JK was predicted. O5-13 arrived at Containment Area-179 to witness the impending end of the world, and, as a last resort, potentially bargain with SCP-2317-JK.//\n\n> \n\n> //The ground around the seven pillars within SCP-2317-J shatters, and SCP-2317-JK emerges from the ground.

SCP-2615-J instances are to be fed thrice daily.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2615-J is a species of sapient humanoids which measure fifteen centimeters tall on average. All SCP-2615-J instances possess wings of varying appearance, though the wings universally match the appearance of the wings of various species of //Lepidoptera//. SCP-2615-J instances can use these wings to achieve airborne locomotion. SCP-2615-J instances are luminescent, though the light produced generates no heat and has no clear biological or chemical basis.\n\n\n\nSCP-2615-J instances are capable of limited reality warping, with most of their effects only affecting natural phenomena. Phenomena effected by SCP-2615-J include weather patterns, atmospheric temperature and pressure, animal behavior, and plant growth.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Interview with SCP-2615-J instance #28.\n\n\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-2615-J #28\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Tamlin\n\n> \n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tamlin:** #28, you are aware that several aspects of your physiology are not scientifically possible, correct?

Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean. Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind. Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan. Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it's fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why. These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening. In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questions. Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides? Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia? Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions? The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland. It's unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920's, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple. Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody's going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there's a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace. It's a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. This is why Nokia is the largest 'Finnish' company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country. There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I'll try and address below. 1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy? A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they're from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia. 2- What about all of Finland's other exports other than Nokia? A. Finland's three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn't a viable way to get people to believe in it. 3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage. A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It's not like the people flying there would notice. 4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There's a lot to it and it couldn't all be made up. A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn't need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. 5- Why do other countries go along with it? A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It's a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that's where the problems about Finland's existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good. 6- Why the name Finland? A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland. 7- What about the Finnish language? A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them. 8- I'm Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting. A. I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I'm simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn't actually there. It doesn't mean there can't be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. 9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it? A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement 'I don't believe Finland exists'. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention.

It is not uncommon for subjects to experience other extreme emotional responses, including but not limited to boredom, awe, confusion, and fear, or any combination of these.

Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean. Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind. Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan. Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it's fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why. These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening. In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questions. Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides? Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia? Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions? The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland. It's unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920's, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple. Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody's going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there's a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace. It's a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. This is why Nokia is the largest 'Finnish' company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country. There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I'll try and address below. 1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy? A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they're from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia. 2- What about all of Finland's other exports other than Nokia? A. Finland's three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn't a viable way to get people to believe in it. 3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage. A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It's not like the people flying there would notice. 4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There's a lot to it and it couldn't all be made up. A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn't need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. 5- Why do other countries go along with it? A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It's a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that's where the problems about Finland's existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good. 6- Why the name Finland? A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland. 7- What about the Finnish language? A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them. 8- I'm Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting. A. I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I'm simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn't actually there. It doesn't mean there can't be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. 9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it? A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement 'I don't believe Finland exists'. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention. It's part of the human condition. 10- What about GPS and Satellite Images? A. Manipulated and forged. In the parts of Estonia, Sweden, and Russia that are allocated as 'Finnish zones' the GPS locations are changed to match that of Finland. __Satellite images can be forged__.||\n\n\n\n//I kind of lost my train of thought, but the point I'm trying to make here is that **__Finland__ __does__ __not__ __exist__**.

The general text and speech bubbles are written in a language which is simultaneously unlike any existing language known to the Foundation, while simultaneously being completely comprehensible to any literate individual reading it[[footnote]]Assuming that said individual knows that manga is read right-to-left.[[/footnote]]. The total number of books is estimated at approximately 120 billion. \n\n\n\nThe contents of the books represent the idealised life of the individuals contained within. Altering the contents of the books has a corresponding effect upon reality, with names, vendettas, superpowers, hair colour[[footnote]]Up to and including blue hair. Somehow.[[/footnote]] and style, backstories, waifus, fetishes and perversions, personality quirks, and even complete existences changing accordingly to alterations applied to the book. Important life events are included, but they are exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness, with individuals demonstrating abilities and personality traits far beyond their own. As such, amendments made directly to books typically do not result in any change unless specifically entered in manga format, and suitably exaggerated as is expected of shonen manga.\n\n\n\nSCP-4001-B was first encountered by Foundation staff in 19\u2588\u2588. A local group of teenagers were attempting to use the archives to write their history papers, among other uses[[footnote]]A large number of the books within the archive could be more accurately described as hentai rather than shonen.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Notable Texts:**\n\n\n\n//The Sultry Stories of Cleopatra of the Nile//. Details the life of Cleopatra VII, last pharaoh of Egypt. A supremely hardcore hentai with political undertones. Chapters include [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED][[footnote]]//Researcher Note from Researcher Tanaka//: If anyone needs this, I'll be in my bunk. For research purposes.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n//The Martial Chronicles of Joan d'Arc//. Details the life of French commander and religious figurehead Joan of Arc. Chapters include a lengthy conversation with SCP-343, multiple battles using sorcery, cannonades, and sniper rifles, a number of katana duels with English knights, and a spectacularly tragic death scene of her burning at the stake spanning some 50 heartrending pages.\n\n\n\n//The Wonderful Life of Leonardo Da Vinci//. Details the life of artist, engineer and all around polymath Leonardo Da Vinci. Comedic in tone. Chapters include multiple torrid love affairs with various men, multiple wacky adventures with his devices, a Q-like relationship with a weirdo figure in a hood with no fear of heights, and a chapter where he builds a time machine so he can get proper notes and sketches for his masterpiece //The Last Supper//.\n\n\n\n//The Ruthless Royal, Henry \"Fuck the Pope (and Anything Else That Moves)\" Tudor VIII//. Details the life of English king Henry VIII. Chapters include several jousting tourneys[[footnote]]The text displays them using tyrannosaurs instead of horses.[[/footnote]], his incredibly profane rap battle with Pope Clement VII, a large number of explicit hentai scenes with various numbers of his seventeen wives, the brutal executions of four of his wives (including a lengthy superpowered fight with Anne Boleyn), and his eventual death due to hyper-obesity.\n\n\n\n//The Life and Times of Abraham \"Breaker of Chains\" Lincoln//. Details the life of American President Abraham Lincoln. Chapters include his early career as a pugilist lawyer, his brutal broadsword duel against James Shields, his brief tenure as a vampire slayer, a number of spectacular hand to hand brawls in Congress, his unleashment of an energy beam against the forces of slavery, and his epic sniper duel to the death against John Wilkes Booth.\n\n\n\n//The Chronicles of Theodore \"Badass Motherfucker\" Roosevelt//. Details the life of American President Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt. Chapters include him punching his own heart condition back into health, an incredibly sorrowful chapter regaling the death of his wife and mother, his time in the West as a sharpshooting cowboy, his cavalry charge against energy weapons, his feud with the New York mob bosses during his tenure as NYPD commissioner, his ascension to Omega status with the death of McKinley, him tanking a hailfire of bullets during his inaugral speech, a boxing match to the death against a grizzly bear during his presidency that resulted in him being blinded in one eye, and his eventual epic duel with death himself[[footnote]]A surprisingly small amount of this is hyperbole; he actually did most of this.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4001-B1:** Cataloging Assistance System\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, a team of researchers and engineers completed the construction of a system which would enable easier access to the archives. Due to the sheer size of the archives, many days or even weeks of travel were required to locate older books. Thus, the Cataloging Assistance System was installed.\n\n\n\nIn order to use the Cataloging Assistance System, users should follow these steps:\n\n\n\n# Use the installed computers to search for the person of interest from the database, and receive their coordinates\n\n# Input the coordinates into the Cataloging Assistance System\n\n# Put on a crash helmet and a bubble suit[[footnote]]Mops are kept on hand for individuals who fail to follow this instruction.[[/footnote]], and get into the Cataloging Assistance System\n\n# Push the launch button.\n\n\n\nDepending on aerodynamics, users will typically land within 100 to 200 meters of their intended text.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4001-B2:** Incident 4001-BK\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [REDACTED] entered SCP-4001 without permission, and used the Cataloging Assistance System to locate their own book. They then used an HB pencil to add several panels to the last pages of their own book, detailing their discovery of an immensely powerful artifact, which was then used to turn themselves into a god of corruption.\n\n\n\nLater that day, they found a 5000-yen note on the ground outside SCP-4001-B, and spent it on cheap ramen that gave them diarrhea for a week.\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-4001-J", "scp_number": 4001, "series": "joke", "tags": ["_licensebox", "building", "joke", "meta", "safe", "scp", "subterranean"], "title": "SCP-4001-J", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4001-j"}, "SCP-5308-J": {"created_at": "2010-09-13T00:55:00", "creator": "DrEverettMann", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T00:55:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "Uploaded multiple files.", "date": "2010-09-13T00:56:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:01:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:02:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:04:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:05:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:06:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "You successfully reverted the page to revision number 5", "date": "2010-09-13T01:07:00"}, {"author": "Chubert", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/chubert", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:08:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:09:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:10:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:12:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:14:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T01:14:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "Added tags: keter, euclid, cube, humanoid, blood, euclid/keter, scp, pen, cat, rock, joke.", "date": "2010-09-13T01:38:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T04:14:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-13T18:54:00"}, {"author": "Chubert", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/chubert", "comment": "fixing up the capitalization...", "date": "2010-09-14T02:33:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "", "date": "2010-09-16T05:17:00"}, {"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "Added tags: feline.", "date": "2010-09-23T20:34:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Measurement formatting, punctuation, added -J into item designation, site name formatting.", "date": "2010-10-22T19:56:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "Formatting images to center rather than right align so they line up with the correct article sections.", "date": "2010-12-15T08:47:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "Added tags: writing.

The entrance to these vaults is to be guarded at all times by at least two hundred guards from special forces backgrounds, seventeen class-D personnel blinded and given flamethrowers, three priests, two rabbis, an imam, a Sherpa, and a Girl Scout of Abrahamic faith. Four separate onsite nuclear devices are to be detonated in the event of a security breach.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5308-J is a collection of objects of unknown anomalous properties, which have to date eluded the best minds of the Foundation. A detailed description of each item follows.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5308-J-1:** A perfectly cubical piece of granite twenty centimeters on a side, weighing nearly 20 kilograms.

Previous owner was unfortunately killed during the ensuing firefight. Fortunately, SCP-5308-J-1 survived to be placed into Foundation custody. Please see the experiment log for details on its anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Experiment Log SCP-5308-J-1-13\" hide=\"- Experiment Log SCP-5308-J-1-13\"]]\n\n> **Professor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"Please approach the cube.\"\n\n> \n\n> **D-3534:** \"Uh, sure.

Analysis shows that the stain consists of human blood. Possible connections to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 are suspected. The stain appeared shortly after SCP-5308-J-2 seemingly attacked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, creating a small, straight cut on the tip of his finger. It should therefore be considered extremely dangerous and hostile.\n\n\n\nAppeasing SCP-5308-J-2 is to be considered a class Alpha-One-Aleph priority.

Everything is hush hush, top secret, so I'll be keeping my notes secure here. I'm not even sure which Overseer has assigned me the project, it's that secret. I'll be at Site 421<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> for the duration, and I have been assured SCP-260 has been handled.

You have a midget version of the target. Or is it dwarf? Whichever one has the big head. And, despite being a pretty good copy of the original, there are differences. The dwarfs(midgets?) are more, well, refined versions of the original. Whatever aspects make a person become even more prevalent, almost to the point of caricature. Copies are rather high strung, doing everything to the utmost they can, with great enthusiasm.<br/>\nAll this has already been proven and dealt with. What I am here for is to test the device on intelligent SCPs and Researchers. Apparently there are some of them they wouldn't mind replacing.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:<br/>\n<strong>Testing Log 1</strong><br/>\nSubject: <a href=\"/scp-953\">SCP-953</a><br/>\nResult: A tiny fox lady, near to bouncing off the walls with energy. Upon initial creation, she jumped on a D-Class, kissed him on the lips, shoved her claws through his nostrils, fondled his crotch, and then bit his throat out. She proceeded to massacre the other three D's in the testing room, before gas was applied. The remains were incinerated. Something more stable for the next one.</p>\n<p>[PAGE MISSING]</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Log 7</strong><br/>\nSubject: <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a><br/>\nResult: After the previous successes we decided to try a hard one. Mini-076 was an unmitigated disaster. He was created much closer to the original, entering a killing rage upon creation. The decrease in size resulted in an increase in speed, leaving us with something much like a cross between a bouncy ball and a Cuisinart. Mini-076 came close to breaking containment, however at the last moment the real 076 showed up, and took care of it. He rather forcefully made the point that such liberties would not be allowed to happen again. Luckily, my assistant Ryan took responsibility. I'll miss Ryan. Gonna call a halt to it for the day.</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:<br/>\n<strong>Testing Log 8</strong><br/>\nSubject: Dr. Rights<br/>\nResult: Having failed rather horribly with the SCPs, I have decided to move on to my fellow researchers. Due in part to a crush I have upon said researcher, Rights was a perfect fit. And I have to say, even at a third the size, she is striking. Mini-Rights expressed interest in SCP-5555, and then proceeded to remove her clothes and seduce me, which I willingly allowed.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> And then she hit me in the head with a lamp while I attempted to enjoy the afterglow.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mini-Rights has breached containment. Security says they'll bring her back quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Log 9</strong><br/>\nSubject: Dr. Gears<br/>\nResult: Mini-Gears is little more than a robot. He reacts to outside stimulus, responding to questions, but seems to show no curiosity, or outward will. A rather large wind up key in his back has no actual use. Mini-gears has been relegated to the incinerator.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Somewhere between the testing lab and the incinerator, Mini-Gears vanished. One of our transports is also missing. Damn it!</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Log 10</strong><br/>\nSubject: Dr. Clef<br/>\nResult: I told them no, I told them this one we should just leave, but nooo, I gotta try all the important researchers.<br/>\nWhere the FUCK did he get that shotgun from? I'm gonna go see Mini-590 about my legs, and hope Security can take the gun away.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Need new security.

Only his eyes are visible, and somehow, within minutes of his appearance, three kittens wormed their way into the testing room. He \u2026 he kinda freaks me out, being so cheerful.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Security outside Mini-Glass's cell were found with their stomachs torn out from the inside, as if by something small and furry. Mini-Glass is still at large.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Log 12:</strong><br/>\nSubject: Dr. Iceberg<br/>\nResult: A small man in a lab coat, holding a briefcase. Upon creation, he immediately opened his briefcase and handed me a sheaf of papers, informing me I had to fill them out before progressing. The top sheet was 'Form 518b, A Request To Create New Life Based Upon Old Structures, In An Environment Unsuited For It,' and the bottom sheet was 'Form 8675309, Being A Total Twit In Public.' Mini-Iceberg was detained.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is getting ridiculous. Two security, found lacerated with paper cuts, and mini-Iceberg no where to be found. Although he did leave behind a properly filled out form, 'Form 24601, Request To Escape Foundation Custody In An Outlandish Manner.'</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> That's it! Of course!

Was not expecting this. Mini-Kondraki appears normal, except for the large pair of butterfly wings sprouting from his back, and the camera around his neck. Wings appear non functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Saber hidden in camera. That fucker hurts.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>Wings are functional. No Mini is allowed access to an open air recess yard from here on out. Almost got him with the search light.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Log 15</strong><br/>\nSubject: Dr. Palmer<br/>\nResult: Easier to get along with than Rights, why not try? Resultant miniature appears to be Palmer, but facial recognition incapable due to being blocked by her chest. Dear god, how does she walk with those things?</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mini-Palmer is not to be used as a flotation device.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Or an airbag.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Found guards passed out drunk.

The perfect assistant for me is, of course, my self. Brilliant! Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a little slow, and appears to have a weird skin rash that causes him to look reptilian, but otherwise perfect! I'm going to have him work on creating some new Minis, while I take a nap. What could go wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 needed some help in working 5555, and used it upon himself. Mini-Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 felt that the workload was too much, and he could use some help. Mini-Mini-Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2026 By the time I got back to the lab there were 32 levels of L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, each smaller than the next. All were assigned to be terminated, this was a bad idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know. At least the guards say they used lube.

Acting under the supposition that the cuter the miniature, the more deadly they are, Mini-Kain was immediately transferred into a heavy metal box, and the lid sealed.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mini-Kain somehow managed to piss in both my shoes, while being transferred to the Box. That little fucker\u2026 Screw it, we're putting him down.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Attendants assigned to put down Mini-Kain found with lethal injection needles inserted in their eyelids.

This is bullshit, I won't\u2026 Fuck it, I'm getting paid. Mini-Snorlison, has a gigantic mustache, and is wrapped in a parka. And, he won't shut up.

I want to shoot him, but I just can't.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> 8 hours since last note. I just woke up to find myself passed out on the floor of the lab, with a Sharpie mustache.

As such, O5-6 has assigned me the duty of bringing across more of our comrades, and documenting it in the same format as Maxi-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Joy.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I have been given an official list to bring across, immediately. O5-6 has requested me to bring over Bijhan (for something secret), Site Director Fat Ghost (to take care of our own SCP site), Pat Gephart (our network is down), Dr. Blast (cause we always need more explosions), and\u2026 No, this one can't be right, let me check\u2026</p>\n<p>Apparently, Carrion Trooper. For the lulz.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Log 20</strong><br/>\nSubject: Maxi-Bijhan<br/>\nResult: Bijhan is a fairly typical looking Arabic man, taller than most at a full 1m (3ft,3in). He wears a black robe and a white turban, wherein he keeps his weaponry. Shortly after his appearance, I noticed I was missing my pen, SCP-5555, and my pants. When confronted, Bijhan was more than glad to return them to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> How the hell did he manage to walk off with my desk?

Remarkably, Mini-Gerald came with his own vehicle, what appears to be a shriner car. A really simple little thing, battery operated. Mini-Gerald seemed unwilling to talk, and instead drove the vehicle around my lab, making 'Vroom vroom' noises.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> As I complied my experience, Mini-Gerald drove out the door, accelerating at speeds I was not aware such vehicles could make. I followed quickly, but lost site of him when he turned the corner into Zeta wing. I heard an explosion, and lost track of the mini during the resulting Keter outbreak.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Log 03 (7/02/20\u2588\u2588, 4:00 PM)</strong><br/>\n<strong>Input:</strong> Dr. Light<br/>\n<strong>Output:</strong> Tiny female in lab coat, with a small metal briefcase labeled \"Totally not full of samples of infectious diseases\". Carried what looked like a helium-filled jellyfish on a string.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Jellyfish balloon was cute, but it sure could sting. Ended today's testing to visit Site infirmary. Must remember to ask cleaning staff how to get smashed medusa out of carpet.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Infirmary was already busy when I arrived. Apparently there have been simultaneous outbreaks of dengue fever, Marburg virus, and smallpox, all within the site, all within the last half-hour.

Headgear's precise features impossible to determine, other than the slogan printed on the front: \"Hey, Look over There?\"<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Found myself looking away despite myself. While I was distracted, Mini-Yoric stole my wallet, replaced all the money with photos of his behind, and put it back.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Mini-Yoric began to to critique my technique in handling SCP-5555-J. Three straight hours of this led me to leave the room in tears. When I returned, I found a bucket of SCP-447 placed over the door, when it spilled on me.

Object revealed to be a tiny male when it lifted the hat to reveal enough nose and mouth to toss back a shot of vodka. Mini-Strelnikov speaks only in thickly-accented, semi-coherent ramblings, usually threats of harm.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Where Agent Strelnikov despises <em>Chechens</em>, Mini-Strelnikov harbors a deep and murderous rage against <em>chickens</em>. This I learned after Mini-Yoric left me another surprise \u2014 a bucket of tar over my door, followed by a large basket of feathers. Turns out that Mini-Strelnikov is actually easier to understand when he's frothing at the mouth and chasing me with disproportionately huge knives, but I wish I hadn't heard what he was promising to do with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Log 07 (7/04/20\u2588\u2588, 12:00 PM)</strong><br/>\n<strong>Input:</strong> Dr. King<br/>\n<strong>Output:</strong> 412 pounds of apple seeds.

And my machine doesn't even have an espresso maker!<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> As I was drinking the coffee, the god damn little bitch shot me in both my knees with a crossbow!

Soon after touching the plants, I felt dizzy, and locked Mini-Photosynthetic in while I visited the Site infirmary. Again.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Returned to my lab to find it completely swamped in plant growth. The things are toxic, and they <em>bite</em>. No sign of Mini-Photosynthetic.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Log 10 (7/07/20\u2588\u2588, 12:00 PM)</strong><br/>\n<strong>Input:</strong> Dr Everett Mann<br/>\n<strong>Output:</strong> Tiny male in a lab coat, with a gigantic mustache. The damned thing is almost tentacle like. And, for some reason, he has what appears to be a mind wiped Mini-D-class on a chain.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Mini-Mann has been quite helpful in showing me how to really use the device. Apparently it even has a portable handle, makes this much easier!</p>\n<p><strong>Test Log 11 (7/07/20\u2588\u2588, 1:00 PM)</strong><br/>\n<strong>Input:</strong> The disassembled pieces of Hatbot<br/>\n<strong>Output:</strong> A rather smaller version of the robot in question, really cute, actually. Reminds me of one of those old cartoon robots, with the square heads. And, even funnier, it speaks entirely in Lolcat!<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Upon introducing Mini-Hatbot to Mini-Mann, M-H declared 'I can Haz your death?' drew a butcher knife from somewhere, and chased MM out of the room. Damn those buggers move fast.

The results were\u2026 interesting. Both minis showed an increase in melanin to their skin, as well as a lightening of their hair, which seemed to be in permanent spikes. I will also note their collars absolutely refused to lay down.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The two minis, after a long conversation, declared me to be a 'bro' and produced a mini-keg from somewhere, encouraging me to drink. These are some of the greatest people I have ever met, Mini or no.<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> I woke up in a bathtub filled with ice. And dicks drawn on my face. I don't feel so good\u2026<br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The little bastards took BOTH my kidneys!</p>\n<p><strong>Test Log 12 (7/09/20\u2588\u2588, 9:00 AM)</strong><br/>\n<strong>Input:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-542\">SCP-542</a><br/>\n<strong>Output:</strong> Tiny male Frankenstein's monster, minus the bolts.

I have been contacted by the Overseers[[footnote]]There is no record of any Overseer contacting Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.[[/footnote]] to begin work on an SCP of extreme importance. Everything is hush hush, top secret, so I'll be keeping my notes secure here. I'm not even sure which Overseer has assigned me the project, it's that secret. I'll be at Site 421[[footnote]]Site 421 does not now, and never has existed.[[/footnote]] for the duration, and I have been assured SCP-260 has been handled. I'll write more when I get the time!\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\nAmazing! I have been promoted to Level 4[[footnote]]No such promotion has been\u00a0\u00a0found anywhere in the Foundations records.[[/footnote]], and put in control of everyone at the Site! I have an enormous crew of D-Class to work with, and, even better, my own SCP. This thing is amazing. You simply [ILLEGIBLE][[footnote]]This section appears to have been altered to illegibility on purpose.[[/footnote]] and then presto! You have a midget version of the target.\u00a0\u00a0Or is it dwarf? Whichever one has the big head. And, despite being a pretty good copy of the original, there are differences. The dwarfs(midgets?) are more, well, refined versions of the original. Whatever aspects make a person become even more prevalent, almost to the point of caricature. Copies are rather high strung, doing everything to the utmost they can, with great enthusiasm. \n\nAll this has already been proven and dealt with. What I am here for is to test the device on intelligent SCPs and Researchers. Apparently there are some of them they wouldn't mind replacing.[[footnote]]While true, no reliable methods have been proposed.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n**Testing Log 1** \n\nSubject: [[[SCP-953]]]\n\nResult: A tiny fox lady, near to bouncing off the walls with energy. Upon initial creation, she jumped on a D-Class, kissed him on the lips, shoved her claws through his nostrils, fondled his crotch, and then bit his throat out. She proceeded to massacre the other three D's in the testing room, before gas was applied. The remains were incinerated.\u00a0\u00a0Something more stable for the next one.\n\n\n\n[PAGE MISSING]\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 7**\n\nSubject: [[[SCP-076]]]\n\nResult: After the previous successes we decided to try a hard one. Mini-076 was an unmitigated disaster. He was created much closer to the original, entering a killing rage upon creation. The decrease in size resulted in an increase in speed, leaving us with something much like a cross between a bouncy ball and a Cuisinart. Mini-076 came close to breaking containment, however at the last moment the real 076 showed up, and took care of it. He rather forcefully made the point that such liberties would not be allowed to happen again. Luckily, my assistant Ryan took responsibility. I'll miss Ryan. Gonna call a halt to it for the day.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n**Testing Log 8**\n\nSubject: Dr. Rights\n\nResult: Having failed rather horribly with the SCPs, I have decided to move on to my fellow researchers. Due in part to a crush I have upon said researcher, Rights was a perfect fit. And I have to say, even at a third the size, she is striking. Mini-Rights expressed interest in SCP-5555, and then proceeded to remove her clothes and seduce me, which I willingly allowed.\n\n\n\n**Note:** And then she hit me in the head with a lamp while I attempted to enjoy the afterglow.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Mini-Rights has breached containment. Security says they'll bring her back quickly.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 9**\n\nSubject: Dr. Gears\n\nResult: Mini-Gears is little more than a robot. He reacts to outside stimulus, responding to questions, but seems to show no curiosity, or outward will. A rather large wind up key in his back has no actual use. Mini-gears has been relegated to the incinerator.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Somewhere between the testing lab and the incinerator, Mini-Gears vanished. One of our transports is also missing. Damn it!\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 10**\n\nSubject: Dr. Clef\n\nResult: I told them no, I told them this one we should just leave, but nooo, I gotta try all the important researchers.\n\nWhere the FUCK did he get that shotgun from? I'm gonna go see Mini-590 about my legs, and hope Security can take the gun away.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Need new security. Half of them dead or wounded, Mini-Clef nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n**Testing Log 11:**\n\nSubject: Dr. Glass\n\nResult: ... Mini-Glass appears to be a large afro, wrapped in a scarf with a lap coat. Only his eyes are visible, and somehow, within minutes of his appearance, three kittens wormed their way into the testing room. He ... he kinda freaks me out, being so cheerful.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Security outside Mini-Glass's cell were found with their stomachs torn out from the inside, as if by something small and furry. Mini-Glass is still at large.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 12:**\n\nSubject: Dr. Iceberg\n\nResult: A small man in a lab coat, holding a briefcase. Upon creation, he immediately opened his briefcase and handed me a sheaf of papers, informing me I had to fill them out before progressing. The top sheet was 'Form 518b, A Request To Create New Life Based Upon Old Structures, In An Environment Unsuited For It,' and the bottom sheet was 'Form 8675309, Being A Total Twit In Public.' Mini-Iceberg was detained.\n\n\n\n**Note:** This is getting ridiculous. Two security, found lacerated with paper cuts, and mini-Iceberg no where to be found. Although he did leave behind a properly filled out form, 'Form 24601, Request To Escape Foundation Custody In An Outlandish Manner.'\n\n\n\n**Note:** That's it! Of course! These miniature versions are caricatures of the real thing! That's why they have clothes, and defining characteristics. I'll have to try this with someone who has an item they always... Bright, yes, that'll do.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 13**\n\nSubject: Dr. Jack Bright\n\nResult: A miniature orangutan, wearing [[[SCP-963]]]. Attempts to transfer 963 resulted in new wearer becoming a miniature orangutan. Removal of 963 brought back the wearer with no harm done. Mini-Bright remanded into custody.\n\n\n\n**Note:** I am covered in monkey shit. Mini-Bright is at large. This day is over.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n**Testing Log 14:**\n\nSubject: Dr. Kondraki\n\nResult: Decided to try one of the non powered again. Was not expecting this. Mini-Kondraki appears normal, except for the large pair of butterfly wings sprouting from his back, and the camera around his neck. Wings appear non functional.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Saber hidden in camera. That fucker hurts.\n\n\n\n**Note:**Wings are functional. No Mini is allowed access to an open air recess yard from here on out. Almost got him with the search light.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 15**\n\nSubject: Dr. Palmer\n\nResult: Easier to get along with than Rights, why not try? Resultant miniature appears to be Palmer, but facial recognition incapable due to being blocked by her chest. Dear god, how does she walk with those things?\n\n\n\n**Note:** Mini-Palmer is not to be used as a flotation device.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Or an airbag.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Found guards passed out drunk. Mini-Palmer appears to have drugged them with a pill she had.. ahem.. stashed on her person. \n\n\n\n**Testing Log 16**\n\nSubject: Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nResult: Don't know why I didn't think of it before! The perfect assistant for me is, of course, my self. Brilliant! Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a little slow, and appears to have a weird skin rash that causes him to look reptilian, but otherwise perfect! I'm going to have him work on creating some new Minis, while I take a nap. What could go wrong?\n\n\n\n**Note:** Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 needed some help in working 5555, and used it upon himself. Mini-Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 felt that the workload was too much, and he could use some help. Mini-Mini-Mini-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588... By the time I got back to the lab there were 32 levels of L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, each smaller than the next. All were assigned to be terminated, this was a bad idea.\n\n\n\n**Note:** I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know. At least the guards say they used lube. Damnit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n**Testing Log 17:**\n\nSubject: Kain Pathos Crow\n\nResult: A cute little Labrador puppy in a bow tie. Acting under the supposition that the cuter the miniature, the more deadly they are, Mini-Kain was immediately transferred into a heavy metal box, and the lid sealed.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Mini-Kain somehow managed to piss in both my shoes, while being transferred to the Box. That little fucker... Screw it, we're putting him down.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Attendants assigned to put down Mini-Kain found with lethal injection needles inserted in their eyelids. And pissed on. The damn dog is nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 18**\n\nSubject: Dr. Snorlison\n\nResults: I am getting really sick and tired of this. Really. Seriously. This is bullshit, I won't... Fuck it, I'm getting paid. Mini-Snorlison, has a gigantic mustache, and is wrapped in a parka. And, he won't shut up. I don't know how he has time to breathe, he just keeps talking.\n\n\n\n**Note:** 5 hours later. He still won't stop. I want to shoot him, but I just can't.\n\n\n\n**Note:** 8 hours since last note. I just woke up to find myself passed out on the floor of the lab, with a Sharpie mustache. Needless to say, Mini-Snorlison got out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:[[footnote]]These dates correspond to a listed vacation in the Dr.'s schedule. There is no record of anyone authorizing said vacation.[[/footnote]]\n\nIt's over. I've been removed from working on SCP-5555, and returned to active duty. Everyone else here at Site\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588 seems to think I was on vacation, and I'm not going to tell them differently.\n\n\n\nSee, I think I figured it out. Four 5's wasn't creating these miniatures out of whole cloth. It was pulling them from another world entirely, one where everyone is like them. But it only works one way. What I think happened is one of them got himself stuck here, and used the Foundation, and me, to bring some of his friends across. That's why they all got away, there was already one here looking out for them. How do I know this? \n\n\n\nMy dismissal orders were signed 'Mini-O5-6.'\n\n\n\nI'm going to go lie down and hope maybe [[[SCP-260]]] will find me before anyone finds out what I've done.[[footnote]]If this information is correct, we are at great risk of containment breach, all over the place. These miniatures apparently share memories with the originals, allowing them to know the codes we use, and to know what we would do should we decide to change them. Recapture of any and all Miniatures is of utmost importance, before they get someone competent to work with them. Thank god it was only Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.##red|^^8^^##[[/footnote]][[size 0%]][[footnote]]We're in yer Foundation, cloning yer dudes.[[/footnote]][[/size]]\n\n\n\n**The files end there**\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n-----\n\n*Audio Log CLF-666, recorded from personal office of Dr. Clef*\n\n> Clef: So you want to be my assistant?\n\n> \n\n> Unknown: KILL. . . kill kill kill.\n\n> \n\n> Clef: Very good.

And the only one with any experience with it, is, well, myself. As such, O5-6 has assigned me the duty of bringing across more of our comrades, and documenting it in the same format as Maxi-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Joy.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I have been given an official list to bring across, immediately. O5-6 has requested me to bring over Bijhan (for something secret), Site Director Fat Ghost (to take care of our own SCP site), Pat Gephart (our network is down), Dr. Blast (cause we always need more explosions), and... No, this one can't be right, let me check...\n\n\n\nApparently, Carrion Trooper. For the lulz.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 20**\n\nSubject: Maxi-Bijhan\n\nResult: Bijhan is a fairly typical looking Arabic man, taller than most at a full 1m (3ft,3in). He wears a black robe and a white turban, wherein he keeps his weaponry. Shortly after his appearance, I noticed I was missing my pen, SCP-5555, and my pants. When confronted, Bijhan was more than glad to return them to me.\n\n\n\n**Note:** How the hell did he manage to walk off with my desk? That thing is three times his size!\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 21**\n\nSubject:Maxi-Fat Ghost\n\nResult:\n\n**Note:** I don't know, I don't want to know, this issue is closed.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 22**\n\nSubject: Maxi-Pat Gephart\n\nResult: No indication given that 5555 worked. Attempted it again, only to get a fail message. Will look into it.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Don't worry man, I'm here. But since I'm dealing with these here computers, you all got no reason to see me. I'm gonna stay here, where it's safe. And no, I ain't tellin you where 'here' is.\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 23**\n\nSubject: Maxi-Blast\n\nResult: Blast showed up dressed as usual. A thin layer of black soot covers his skin and clothes, all his hair burned off and his clothes in burnt tatters.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Who authorized giving Blast chewing gum and water? That explosion nearly leveled the play room!\n\n\n\n**Testing Log 24**\n\nSubject: Maxi-Carrion Trooper\n\nResult: Log Corrupted, see picture.\n\n\n\n**Note:** That's it, I'm done.\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab *Third Kind*]]\n\n**From the personal log of Dr. C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 6/30/20\u2588\u2588:**\n\n\n\nFound something really neat today. Big dusty box. With a thing in it: SCP-5555. Renders its input tiny, round, and extreme. This is my chance to prove I'm not useless. Work immediately!\n\n\n\n**Test Log 01 (6/30/20\u2588\u2588, 3:40 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Research Assistant Renfield\n\n**Output:** Tiny female with blonde pixie cut, one square lens on glasses, and white turtleneck. Output exited SCP-5555, leaned over my notes, picked up my pen to correct them, and was immediately accidentally decapitated by freak fracture of pen nib.\n\n**Note:** I don't get it.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 02 (6/30/20\u2588\u2588, 4:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Senior Researcher Gerald\n\n**Output:** Tiny red-haired male, dressed in a lab coat, with driving goggles and a very long ascot. Remarkably, Mini-Gerald came with his own vehicle, what appears to be a shriner car. A really simple little thing, battery operated. Mini-Gerald seemed unwilling to talk, and instead drove the vehicle around my lab, making 'Vroom vroom' noises.\n\n**Note:** As I complied my experience, Mini-Gerald drove out the door, accelerating at speeds I was not aware such vehicles could make. I followed quickly, but lost site of him when he turned the corner into Zeta wing. I heard an explosion, and lost track of the mini during the resulting Keter outbreak.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 03 (7/02/20\u2588\u2588, 4:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Dr. Light\n\n**Output:** Tiny female in lab coat, with a small metal briefcase labeled \"Totally not full of samples of infectious diseases\". Carried what looked like a helium-filled jellyfish on a string.\n\n**Note:** Jellyfish balloon was cute, but it sure could sting. Ended today's testing to visit Site infirmary. Must remember to ask cleaning staff how to get smashed medusa out of carpet.\n\n**Note:** Infirmary was already busy when I arrived. Apparently there have been simultaneous outbreaks of dengue fever, Marburg virus, and smallpox, all within the site, all within the last half-hour. No sign of Mini-Light.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 04 (7/03/20\u2588\u2588, 11:00 AM)**\n\n**Input:** Agent Yoric Elroy\n\n**Output:** 3-foot-long rattlesnake.\n\n**Note:** What the fuck? Okay, this has to be a mistake. Got the snake under control, going to try again.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 05 (7/03/20\u2588\u2588, 1:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Agent Yoric Elroy\n\n**Output:** Tiny male in chinos, a waistcoat, horn rim glasses and a cap of some sort. Headgear's precise features impossible to determine, other than the slogan printed on the front: \"Hey, Look over There?\"\n\n**Note:** Found myself looking away despite myself. While I was distracted, Mini-Yoric stole my wallet, replaced all the money with photos of his behind, and put it back.\n\n**Note:** Mini-Yoric began to to critique my technique in handling SCP-5555-J. Three straight hours of this led me to leave the room in tears. When I returned, I found a bucket of SCP-447 placed over the door, when it spilled on me. No sign of Mini-Yoric. \n\n**Note:** He took the snake too!\n\n\n\n**Test Log 06 (7/04/20\u2588\u2588, 8:30 AM)**\n\n**Input:** Agent Dmitri Strelnikov\n\n**Output:** Apparently, an animate round fur hat wearing heavy Russian army boots. Object revealed to be a tiny male when it lifted the hat to reveal enough nose and mouth to toss back a shot of vodka. Mini-Strelnikov speaks only in thickly-accented, semi-coherent ramblings, usually threats of harm.\n\n**Note:** Where Agent Strelnikov despises //Chechens//, Mini-Strelnikov harbors a deep and murderous rage against //chickens//. This I learned after Mini-Yoric left me another surprise -- a bucket of tar over my door, followed by a large basket of feathers. Turns out that Mini-Strelnikov is actually easier to understand when he's frothing at the mouth and chasing me with disproportionately huge knives, but I wish I hadn't heard what he was promising to do with them.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 07 (7/04/20\u2588\u2588, 12:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Dr. King\n\n**Output:** 412 pounds of apple seeds. I'm going to go have a lie down.\n\n**Note:** I think something left the lab. A trail of apple seeds led to the compactor.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 08 (7/05/20\u2588\u2588, 3:45 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Agent Karrin \"Break\"\n\n**Output:** Tiny Asian female, dressed in an immaculate black dress suit. She immediately headed straight to my coffee maker, where she proceeded to make the best damn cup of espresso I've ever tasted. And my machine doesn't even have an espresso maker!\n\n**Note:** As I was drinking the coffee, the god damn little bitch shot me in both my knees with a crossbow! Where the hell did she get that from? I need a medic...\n\n\n\n**Test Log 9 (7/06/20\u2588\u2588, 11:20 AM)**\n\n**Input:** Dr. C. \u201cPhotosynthetic\u201d Elliott\n\n**Output:** 3-foot-tall mound of plant matter, which upon prodding resolved into several dozen potted plants being carried by a tiny female in a green lab coat. Soon after touching the plants, I felt dizzy, and locked Mini-Photosynthetic in while I visited the Site infirmary. Again.\n\n**Note:** Returned to my lab to find it completely swamped in plant growth. The things are toxic, and they //bite//. No sign of Mini-Photosynthetic.\n\n\n\n**Test Log 10 (7/07/20\u2588\u2588, 12:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Dr Everett Mann\n\n**Output:** Tiny male in a lab coat, with a gigantic mustache. The damned thing is almost tentacle like. And, for some reason, he has what appears to be a mind wiped Mini-D-class on a chain. \n\n**Note:** Mini-Mann has been quite helpful in showing me how to really use the device. Apparently it even has a portable handle, makes this much easier!\n\n\n\n**Test Log 11 (7/07/20\u2588\u2588, 1:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** The disassembled pieces of Hatbot\n\n**Output:** A rather smaller version of the robot in question, really cute, actually. Reminds me of one of those old cartoon robots, with the square heads. And, even funnier, it speaks entirely in Lolcat! \n\n**Note:** Upon introducing Mini-Hatbot to Mini-Mann, M-H declared 'I can Haz your death?' drew a butcher knife from somewhere, and chased MM out of the room. Damn those buggers move fast. What the hell is going on?\n\n\n\n**Test Log 11 (7/07/20\u2588\u2588, 5:00 PM)**\n\n**Input:** Agents Dodridge and Lament\n\n**Output:** Making use of the new found portable aspect of SCP-5555-J, I was able to snag both agents at once! The results were... interesting. Both minis showed an increase in melanin to their skin, as well as a lightening of their hair, which seemed to be in permanent spikes. I will also note their collars absolutely refused to lay down. \n\n**Note:** The two minis, after a long conversation, declared me to be a 'bro' and produced a mini-keg from somewhere, encouraging me to drink. These are some of the greatest people I have ever met, Mini or no.\n\n**Note:** I woke up in a bathtub filled with ice. And dicks drawn on my face. I don't feel so good...\n\n**Note:** The little bastards took BOTH my kidneys!\n\n\n\n**Test Log 12 (7/09/20\u2588\u2588, 9:00 AM)**\n\n**Input:** [[[SCP-542]]]\n\n**Output:** Tiny male Frankenstein's monster, minus the bolts. Chatted about politics for about ninety seconds, then whipped out a scalpel and went for my kidneys.

Mini-C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was not so lucky.

Paint colors also similar, but arranged such that Mini-173 appears to be wearing makeup. Object is also, inexplicably, wearing glow-sticks and a tall striped top hat.\n\n**Note:** Accidentally blinked. Mini-173 tried to strangle my penis.
