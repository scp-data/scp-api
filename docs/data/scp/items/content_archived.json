Subject has demonstrated the ability to speak, as well as enhanced physiology for both canines and homo sapiens. Subject claims his name is Joey, but refuses to offer any additional personal information when questioned in an interview. When Joey was allowed access to alcohol he appears to give information much more willingly, but this is not advised, as he becomes violent at the slightest provocation. In such situations, Joey has been observed to be able to move at speeds unrecorded for either dogs or humans, and have great enough jaw strength to bite clear through bone.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Those with Level 2 Security Clearance should see Document 534-A</p>\n<p><strong>Document 534-A:</strong> Effects of alcohol on subject SCP-048, better known as Joey the dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Enclosed:</strong> Security footage of a poker game involving Joey and several Class D Personnel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SCP-048:</strong> Gimme a beer will you Jack?</p>\n<p><strong>Class D Personnel 1:</strong> Joey, you know I'm not supposed to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-048:</strong> Oh come on Jack!</p>\n<p><strong>Class D Personnel 1:</strong> (Laughing) Fine, have the rest of mine.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-048:</strong> (Drinking the beer, and speaking with a noticeable slur) Thanks friend.</p>\n<p><strong>Class D Personnel 2:</strong> (Joking) So, Joey, your mom must have been a real bitch, huh?</p>\n<p>(SCP-048 disappears from footage)</p>\n<p><strong>Class D Personnel 2:</strong> AGH!

Now lets get back to the game, eh boys?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Subject SCP-048 is no longer allowed to fraternize alone with Class D personnel behind closed doors. Alcohol is no longer permitted on site. Suggest that subject not be allowed to wander without armed attendant.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Following multiple incidents in which SCP-048 became violent, the difficulty of maintaining containment, and given the lack of useful research data from this test subject, SCP neutralization was approved on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (reason: inappropriate expenditure of resources). Subject was drugged using a dosage of tranquilizer in his usual evening meal. Upon being rendered unconscious, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 administered a lethal dose of barbituates intravenously.

He is also granted access to any literature, movies, or television released after 2005, with permission from Dr. Klein. He is allowed any food or drink he requires, except for alcoholic beverages, and chocolate. Any personnel found to have given SCP-048 the aforementioned items are to be suitably reprimanded.--\n\n\n\n--SCP-048 is to be allowed access to all areas of the compound, except for other SCP containment areas, and areas with, or near to, exits from the compound. SCP-048 has shown to be friendly, unless provoked by afore mentioned items, or given alcoholic beverages, but will try to escape if given the opportunity. Low level tranquilizer darts are to be used in the event of an escape attempt, and he is to be returned to his cell without the privileges of free roaming, human food, literature, television, or movies for two weeks. In the event of a successful escape, tranquilizer darts are to be used to sedate him, and if necessary, all forms of non-lethal force are temporarily allowed. Upon capture, he is to be returned to his cell without the privileges of free roaming, human food, literature, television, or movies for a full month.--\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-048 is a mid sized dog of unknown breed, with distinctive human features, intelligence, and personality. Subject has demonstrated the ability to speak, as well as enhanced physiology for both canines and homo sapiens. Subject claims his name is Joey, but refuses to offer any additional personal information when questioned in an interview. When Joey was allowed access to alcohol he appears to give information much more willingly, but this is not advised, as he becomes violent at the slightest provocation. In such situations, Joey has been observed to be able to move at speeds unrecorded for either dogs or humans, and have great enough jaw strength to bite clear through bone. \n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Those with Level 2 Security Clearance should see Document 534-A\n\n\n\n**Document 534-A:** Effects of alcohol on subject SCP-048, better known as Joey the dog. \n\n\n\n**Enclosed:** Security footage of a poker game involving Joey and several Class D Personnel.\n\n\n\n> **SCP-048:** Gimme a beer will you Jack?\n\n> \n\n> **Class D Personnel 1:** Joey, you know I'm not supposed to do that.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-048:** Oh come on Jack!\n\n> \n\n> **Class D Personnel 1:** (Laughing) Fine, have the rest of mine.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-048:** (Drinking the beer, and speaking with a noticeable slur) Thanks friend.\n\n> \n\n> **Class D Personnel 2:** (Joking) So, Joey, your mom must have been a real bitch, huh?\n\n> \n\n> (SCP-048 disappears from footage)\n\n> \n\n> **Class D Personnel 2:** AGH! (Screaming in pain) God, man, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-048:** (SCP-048 returns to his seat) It's ok, I forgive you. (Laughs) You're an idiot. Now lets get back to the game, eh boys?\n\n\n\nSubject SCP-048 is no longer allowed to fraternize alone with Class D personnel behind closed doors. Alcohol is no longer permitted on site. Suggest that subject not be allowed to wander without armed attendant.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Following multiple incidents in which SCP-048 became violent, the difficulty of maintaining containment, and given the lack of useful research data from this test subject, SCP neutralization was approved on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (reason: inappropriate expenditure of resources). Subject was drugged using a dosage of tranquilizer in his usual evening meal. Upon being rendered unconscious, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 administered a lethal dose of barbituates intravenously. Subject's remains have were remanded to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for dissection and analysis, following which they were preserved and placed in High Value Item Storage. Any personnel wishing to perform research on the taxidermied remains should contact an L4 supervisor for permission.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-048-ARC", "scp_number": 48, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "alive", "animal", "archived", "canine", "euclid", "neutralized", "sapient", "scp"], "title": "SCP-048-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-048-arc"}, "SCP-049-ARC": {"created_at": "2018-05-19T01:55:00", "creator": "Gabriel Jade", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Gabriel Jade", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gabriel-jade", "comment": "", "date": "2018-05-19T01:55:00"}, {"author": "Gabriel Jade", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gabriel-jade", "comment": "", "date": "2018-05-19T03:22:00"}, {"author": "Decibelles", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/decibelles", "comment": "Added tags: _image, biological, chemical, contagion, euclid, humanoid, reanimation, sapient, scp, sentient, tactile.

SCP-049 is not to be removed from its cell unless approved by a Level Two or higher personnel, before which SCP-049 must be heavily sedated. Even so, at such times SCP-049 is to be accompanied by two (2) armed guards and guided by an iron collar, secured to two (2) iron poles 2\u00a0m in length, and held firmly by two (2) Level One or higher personnel while in transit. Any experiments performed on SCP-049 are to be conducted inside of specifically prepared rooms (see document 042-D-3-18).</p>\n<p>SCP-049\u2019s cell should be monitored at all times via a security camera. Should any abnormal behavior occur, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is to be alerted at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-049 is humanoid in appearance, standing at 1.9\u00a0m tall and weighing 95.3\u00a0kg; however, the Foundation is currently incapable of studying its face and body more fully, as it is covered in what appears to be the garb of the traditional \u201cPlague Doctor\u201d from 15-16th century Europe. This material is actually a part of SCP-049\u2019s body, as microscopic and genetic testing show it to be similar in structure to muscle, although it feels much like rough leather, and the mask much like ceramic. It was originally discovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, England, by local police. Mobile task force [REDACTED] responded to a suspected outbreak of [DATA EXPUNGED]. All civilians within a .5km radius were given class A amnestics as part of the initial containment procedure.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">SCP-049 does not speak</span> (See addendum A-1), although it seems to understand English perfectly well, and is completely docile until it tries to perform surgery. SCP-049\u2019s touch is invariably lethal to humans. After contact with SCP-049\u2019s hand(s), the victim (hereafter referred to as SCP-049-2) suffers [DATA EXPUNGED] and dies within moments. SCP-049 will then attempt to kill all humans it can see in a similar manner, supposedly to avoid interruption, before returning to SCP-049-2. It produces a bag made of [DATA EXPUNGED] containing scalpels, needle, thread, and several vials of an as-yet-unidentified substance, from somewhere within its body (research has been unable to locate these tools when inside of SCP-049 through X-ray and similar techniques) and begins dissecting SCP-049-2, as well as inserting various chemicals into the body. After approximately 20 minutes, SCP-049 will sew SCP-049-2 back up and become docile once more.</p>\n<p>After a period of a few minutes, SCP-049-2 will resume vital signs and appears to reanimate. However, SCP-049-2 seems completely without higher brain functions, and will wander aimlessly until it encounters another living human. At that point, SCP-049-2's adrenaline and endorphin levels increase to approximately three-hundred (300) percent as it attempts to kill and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 any human beings it can find, before returning to its mindless state and wandering until it comes across more humans. At this stage, termination with extreme prejudice is allowed. Failure to enforce this protocol outside of testing scenarios (see addendum T-049-12) is punishable by termination.</p>\n<p>Detailed autopsies of SCP-049-2 have found several unusual substances (along with usual substances in large amounts) within the bodies, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. However, several have yet to be identified (researchers with level 3 or higher authorization, refer to Addendum C-1).</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum A-1:</strong> SCP-049 spoke for the first time today, 12-6-20\u2588\u2588, addressing Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. A full account of the conversation is attached.</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-049<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-049 randomly began speaking with no obvious provocation en route to a testing facility. Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was recording notes at the time on a handheld microphone. Irrelevant data has been omitted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SCP-049: \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d<br/>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u201cWhat? It\u2019s a labo\u2026\u201d [There is a loud crash here, from Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 dropping the recording device in shock.]<br/>\nSCP-049: \u201cA laboratory? It is quite marvelous.

I\u2019m somewhat startled you, um, can.\u201d<br/>\nSCP-049: \u201cOh, my, yes, good sir. I simply prefer not to. Most victims of the disease are quite melancholy and do not react at all well to conversation. I have seen you several times now, and have not detected the disease in you, therefore I assume you are also a doctor?\u201d<br/>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u201cYes, actually. Call me [REDACTED]\u2026 but, what \u2018disease\u2019 are you talking about?\u201d<br/>\nSCP-049: \u201cWhy, good doctor, the Great Pestilence. What else?\u201d<br/>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u201cGreat pesti\u2026 Oh, the Plague. Should have seen that coming. But, no one here is infected, I can assure you.\u201d<br/>\nSCP-049: \u201cOh, good doctor, <em>I</em> can assure <em>you</em>, the Pestilence is here, and I can sense it. It is my duty in life to rid the world of it. My cure is most effective.\u201d<br/>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u201cYour cure? Your cure has cost us hundreds of lives!

So far, research has shown us no correlation between any of the D-class personnel it has performed surgery on. We\u2019re still working on it.\"<br/>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum C-1:</strong> <strong>Level 3 authorization required:</strong> On 4-26-20\u2588\u2588 SCP-049 managed to break containment. During the roughly 5 minute period in which it was unsupervised, it came into contact with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Upon being detained, SCP-049 was very calm and amiable. Since this time, however, SCP-049 has been shown to be much more talkative leading up to and performing surgery.</p>\n<p><em>I don't know what oh-four-nine and that damned mask talked about, but he seems much happier overall. He no longer seems to simply sit and mope around in his cell, and several staff have claimed to hear him humming old church hymns. In addition, in the moments leading up to performing surgery, he has started talking, apparently trying to\u2026 comfort his victim. Claiming that he is the 'cure', among other things.

Shit, we can't let Kondraki near this thing! - Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588//\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** Since SCP-051 has been taken to Site-\u2588\u2588, UFO sightings from the surrounding areas have increased by 500%. --The matter is currently under investigation.--\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:** As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, security measures around SCP-051 have been increased and access has been restricted to Level 4 personnel only.\n\n\n\n//For the last time, SCP-051 is not to be used for recreational purposes! If I catch anybody else joyriding on it, it's Keter duty for the whole Site! - O5-\u2588\u2588.//\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3:** Recent declassification of Nazi documents reveal a psychiatric evaluation of the remnants of an SS battalion who claimed that they had fallen under attack by several dozen \"flying jeeps\". The implications that there may be multiple copies of SCP-051 in existence must now be taken seriously.\n\n\n\n//You mean there can be more of these things out there? If we find them, what's going to stop the Site staff from racing them? - O5-\u2588\u2588//\n\n\n\n//Please stop giving the Site staff ideas. Their respect for authority is already tenuous at best. - O5-\u2588\u2588//\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-051-ARC", "scp_number": 51, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "airborne", "archived", "mechanical", "safe", "scp", "vehicle"], "title": "SCP-051-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-051-arc"}, "SCP-091-ARC": {"created_at": "2008-07-26T17:44:00", "creator": "far2", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "far2", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/far2", "comment": "", "date": "2008-07-26T17:44:00"}, {"author": "far2", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/far2", "comment": "Uploaded file \"SCP-091.jpg\".", "date": "2008-07-26T17:45:00"}, {"author": "far2", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/far2", "comment": "Turned the image thumbnail into a link to the full-size image", "date": "2008-07-27T09:04:00"}, {"author": "FritzWillie", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/fritzwillie", "comment": "", "date": "2008-07-30T04:27:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Title standardisation.", "date": "2009-02-13T10:25:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Added tags: humanoid.", "date": "2009-04-07T23:49:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Minor cleanup", "date": "2009-08-09T03:34:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Caption formatting.", "date": "2010-12-10T02:09:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "You successfully renamed the page: \"scp-091\" to \"scp-091-arc\".", "date": "2012-04-11T23:29:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: archived.

Personnel assigned to study SCP-157 must be unarmed, wearing Class IV biohazard suits. In the event of a suit breach, the compromised personnel will be subject to a cavity search and X-ray. If SCP-157 is not on the offender\u2019s person, they will be subject to a full-body MRI before being released.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-157 is a firearm cartridge of inconstant make and caliber, which shifts form to match the make of any gun brought within 30 meters. Previously, SCP-157 has been recorded changing size to become as large as an artillery shell (see Documents). SCP-157 exerts an unconscious pull on persons within 30 meters. Class D personnel exposed to the cartridge outside of its lead case report feelings of euphoria and delusions of grandeur. They also report a strong desire to load SCP-157 into a weapon, and will become violent when they are restrained from doing so. When a gun is loaded with SCP-157, it will not fire unless pointed at a living target.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 157-1:</strong> SCP-157\u2019s first recorded use was in April of 1775 during the battle at Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts. SCP-157 was seen again in 1914 on June 28th, where it was used to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand. SCP-157 showed up a third time in Russia during the October revolution as an artillery shell fired from the cruiser <em>Aurora</em>. (As the shell fired was a blank, SCP-157 seems to have the capability to change its composition.) The most notable appearance of SCP-157 was when it was a 6.5 x 52\u00a0mm round fired from the Italian Carcano rifle that killed John F. Kennedy. SCP-157 was last found in a Titan missile silo in 1989, where it was sealed and transported to its current location.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 157-2:</strong> When brought near <a href=\"/scp-127\">SCP-127</a>, SCP-157 changed shape to a large bone slug, approximately 7.6\u00a0cm (3 in) in length and 2.5\u00a0cm (1 in) in diameter. The slug was irregularly shaped and appeared to be boiling as if from the inside. At the same time, an orifice in SCP-127 appeared to allow the slug to be inserted.</p>\n<p>Testing with Class-D personnel has been scheduled to discern the effects of this slug.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 157-3</strong> SCP-157 was brought near [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-157 changed shape into a round of unknown caliber with a pointed tip, apparently glass. Further examination revealed what appeared to be an antimatter reservoir inside the glass tip, suspended by unknown means. Firing not recommended, as the range of the smallest possible explosion would be far greater than the range of the bullet.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-157-arc\">SCP-157-ARC</a>\" by far2, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Personnel assigned to study SCP-157 must be unarmed, wearing Class IV biohazard suits. In the event of a suit breach, the compromised personnel will be subject to a cavity search and X-ray. If SCP-157 is not on the offender\u2019s person, they will be subject to a full-body MRI before being released.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-157 is a firearm cartridge of inconstant make and caliber, which shifts form to match the make of any gun brought within 30 meters. Previously, SCP-157 has been recorded changing size to become as large as an artillery shell (see Documents). SCP-157 exerts an unconscious pull on persons within 30 meters. Class D personnel exposed to the cartridge outside of its lead case report feelings of euphoria and delusions of grandeur. They also report a strong desire to load SCP-157 into a weapon, and will become violent when they are restrained from doing so. When a gun is loaded with SCP-157, it will not fire unless pointed at a living target.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 157-1:** SCP-157\u2019s first recorded use was in April of 1775 during the battle at Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts. SCP-157 was seen again in 1914 on June 28th, where it was used to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand. SCP-157 showed up a third time in Russia during the October revolution as an artillery shell fired from the cruiser //Aurora//. (As the shell fired was a blank, SCP-157 seems to have the capability to change its composition.) The most notable appearance of SCP-157 was when it was a 6.5 x 52 mm round fired from the Italian Carcano rifle that killed John F. Kennedy. SCP-157 was last found in a Titan missile silo in 1989, where it was sealed and transported to its current location.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 157-2:** When brought near [[[SCP-127]]], SCP-157 changed shape to a large bone slug, approximately 7.6 cm (3 in) in length and 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. The slug was irregularly shaped and appeared to be boiling as if from the inside. At the same time, an orifice in SCP-127 appeared to allow the slug to be inserted.\n\n\n\nTesting with Class-D personnel has been scheduled to discern the effects of this slug.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 157-3** SCP-157 was brought near [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-157 changed shape into a round of unknown caliber with a pointed tip, apparently glass. Further examination revealed what appeared to be an antimatter reservoir inside the glass tip, suspended by unknown means. Firing not recommended, as the range of the smallest possible explosion would be far greater than the range of the bullet.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-516-testing-log", "archived-scps", "scp-127", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-157-ARC", "scp_number": 157, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "archived", "compulsion", "euclid", "historical", "metamorphic", "scp", "weapon"], "title": "SCP-157-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-157-arc"}, "SCP-186-ARC": {"created_at": "2008-08-08T22:54:00", "creator": "Midir", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Midir", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/midir", "comment": "", "date": "2008-08-08T22:54:00"}, {"author": "Kain Pathos Crow", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kain-pathos-crow", "comment": "", "date": "2008-08-09T00:26:00"}, {"author": "far2", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/far2", "comment": "added rating module", "date": "2008-08-31T11:38:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Metric conversion", "date": "2009-02-07T21:24:00"}, {"author": "Anonymous (72.197.198.x)", "author_href": "javascript:;", "comment": "missing close quotes", "date": "2009-03-23T14:32:00"}, {"author": "Gnostalgia", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gnostalgia", "comment": "", "date": "2009-05-08T05:48:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Slight reformat and clean-up", "date": "2009-06-25T03:36:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "", "date": "2011-06-17T19:56:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Minor post-rewrite formatting fix.", "date": "2011-06-17T20:12:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Changed Data Expunged to Redacted.", "date": "2011-06-17T20:20:00"}, {"author": "Drewbear", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drewbear", "comment": "slight grammar fix", "date": "2011-06-18T02:06:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: engraved, light.

SCP-257-ARC has been sealed inside a 2 foot wide solid plastic cube and placed in secure storage awaiting disposal via <a href=\"/scp-101\">SCP-101</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>[UPDATE]: SCP-257-ARC appears to be a several year old human sized skull, with the addition of a pair of horns and writing on the more flat surfaces. The horns are in the middle of the parietal, off to either side of the skull. They are almost perfectly smooth, and despite the actual shape of the horns being simple crescent moon shape, all people viewing SCP-257-ARC in person or via picture ascribe them as looking humorous, while the exact same shape in any other material or picture draws no reaction.</p>\n<p>The writing on the skull, covering most of the frontal, parietal, occipital, sphenoid, maxilla, and mandible sections, is clearly legible, etched into the skull with near laser precision.

The horns are in the middle of the parietal, off to either side of the skull.

The messages written all seem to be curses and wishes of dark intent towards the reader of the words, though the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax are juvenile at best.

In order to continue proper research, the following should be performed weekly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check and replace Geiger counters. If unusual damage or circumstances are present, notify acting HMCL supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Check and replace video cameras and connected wires. Test with color cards found in SCP-338 control. If unusual damage or circumstances are present, notify acting HMCL supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Check and replace laser measures. Verify that lasers are in the correct directions. If at any point the laser emitted from unit 02 or 04 seems to disappear or become distorted when passing through the gap in SCP-338, notify acting HMCL supervisor immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Check and replace RADAR equipment.

They are arranged like the ends of a cylinder. They cannot be shifted with respect to each other - this has been tested via hydraulic rams up to 30 tons.</p>\n<p>There is no solid material detectable within the gap.</p>\n<p>Objects placed in the space between the discs for more than a few seconds are seen to \"fade\".<br/>\nIf the object is not removed from the gap, this \"fading\" is complete in approximately ten minutes, after which the objects are not detected by either instruments or the eye.</p>\n<p>In 73% of such cases of fading, after a period of not less than 72 and not more than 300 minutes, an artifact is seen to \"fade in\" within the gap.</p>\n<p>These artifacts are varied in composition. Some appear to have machine qualities. Others appear partially self-aware for a short time. Most are less easy to classify.</p>\n<p>These artifacts invariably crumble to 'dust' within about 30 minutes, but what limited examination has been possible has shown them to have molecular structure which is highly unstable, and indeed seems impossible to form given the physical laws of our universe.</p>\n<p>Further study is advised. It is highly recommend that agents not place any part of their body within the gap.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Current list of objects sent through and received.

In order to continue proper research, the following should be performed weekly:\n\n\n\n* Check and replace Geiger counters. If unusual damage or circumstances are present, notify acting HMCL supervisor. \n\n\n\n* Check and replace video cameras and connected wires. Test with color cards found in SCP-338 control. If unusual damage or circumstances are present, notify acting HMCL supervisor.\n\n\n\n* Check and replace laser measures.\u00a0\u00a0Verify that lasers are in the correct directions. If at any point the laser emitted from unit 02 or 04 seems to disappear or become distorted when passing through the gap in SCP-338, notify acting HMCL supervisor immediately.\n\n\n\n* Check and replace RADAR equipment. If unusual damage or circumstances are present, notify acting HMCL supervisor. \n\n\n\n* After completion of weekly checks, notify acting HMCL supervisor.\n\n\n\n**Description:** Item SCP-338 consists of two parallel circular copper discs, 30.48cm (12in) in diameter, separated by a 38.1cm (15in) gap. They are arranged like the ends of a cylinder. They cannot be shifted with respect to each other - this has been tested via hydraulic rams up to 30 tons.\n\n\n\nThere is no solid material detectable within the gap.\n\n\n\nObjects placed in the space between the discs for more than a few seconds are seen to \"fade\".\n\nIf the object is not removed from the gap, this \"fading\" is complete in approximately ten minutes, after which the objects are not detected by either instruments or the eye.\n\n\n\nIn 73% of such cases of fading, after a period of not less than 72 and not more than 300 minutes, an artifact is seen to \"fade in\" within the gap.\n\n\n\nThese artifacts are varied in composition. Some appear to have machine qualities. Others appear partially self-aware for a short time. Most are less easy to classify.\n\n\n\nThese artifacts invariably crumble to 'dust' within about 30 minutes, but what limited examination has been possible has shown them to have molecular structure which is highly unstable, and indeed seems impossible to form given the physical laws of our universe.\n\n\n\nFurther study is advised. It is highly recommend that agents not place any part of their body within the gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Current list of objects sent through and received.

Should subjects [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-356-ARC is a statue of a nude woman, 1.1m tall, lying on a flat slab. The material appears to be marble, though attempts to obtain samples have thus far been unsuccessful. While usually still, the humanoid portion of the carving will periodically \"sink\" into the slab. Subjects coming in close proximity of the SCP at that stage will experience a strong desire to first touch the slab's top surface, then climb on to it. Group effects [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p>Subjects who climb onto the slab will then \u201cfall\u201d into it, passing through the solid stone with no detectable distortion or damage to the slab. Only the human body will pass through the slab, with all clothes and other personal items remaining behind on the slab. Clothing will be torn, and personal items will show damage consistent with impact on the stone.</p>\n<p>After a period of time (to date, the longest access event has been 46 minutes and 3 seconds), the subject will be ejected out of the SCP uninjured, and the humanoid portion will re-emerge in its normal position. All subjects thus far have adamantly refused to discuss what happened inside SCP-356 even under threat of death, and those who emerged with unidentified objects on their persons have likewise been tight-lipped about their acquisitions. Physical examination of subjects reveals no abnormalities in 99% of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/09, personnel D-42966 was near SCP-356 when it activated. He returned from the SCP shivering, though he exhibited no other signs of exposure to cold temperature. Agents were able to convince him to speak of his experience, but he was only able to say, \"It was a\u2014\" before abruptly dying. Autopsy revealed that his heart had suddenly experienced a massive collapse, consistent with sudden, enormous pressure or impact.</p>\n<p>After being granted permission to use <a href=\"/scp-484\">SCP-484</a> in an experiment with one target of SCP-356-ARC, Agent Green administered one dose to a Class D personnel, ordering him to look into the eyes of the \"target\".

They are to observe any activations of the SCP-356-ARC, report events, and detain subjects. Any and all subjects are to be immediately taken to Site \u2588\u2588 for evaluation and debriefing.\u00a0\u00a0Should subjects [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-356-ARC is a statue of a nude woman, 1.1m tall, lying on a flat slab. The material appears to be marble, though attempts to obtain samples have thus far been unsuccessful. While usually still, the humanoid portion of the carving will periodically \"sink\" into the slab. Subjects coming in close proximity of the SCP at that stage will experience a strong desire to first touch the slab's top surface, then climb on to it.\u00a0\u00a0Group effects [DATA EXPUNGED]. \n\n\n\nSubjects who climb onto the slab will then \u201cfall\u201d into it, passing through the solid stone with no detectable distortion or damage to the slab.\u00a0\u00a0Only the human body will pass through the slab, with all clothes and other personal items remaining behind on the slab.\u00a0\u00a0Clothing will be torn, and personal items will show damage consistent with impact on the stone.\n\n\n\nAfter a period of time (to date, the longest access event has been 46 minutes and 3 seconds), the subject will be ejected out of the SCP uninjured, and the humanoid portion will re-emerge in its normal position. All subjects thus far have adamantly refused to discuss what happened inside SCP-356 even under threat of death, and those who emerged with unidentified objects on their persons have likewise been tight-lipped about their acquisitions.\u00a0\u00a0Physical examination of subjects reveals no abnormalities in 99% of cases.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/09, personnel D-42966 was near SCP-356 when it activated. He returned from the SCP shivering, though he exhibited no other signs of exposure to cold temperature. Agents were able to convince him to speak of his experience, but he was only able to say, \"It was a--\" before abruptly dying. Autopsy revealed that his heart had suddenly experienced a massive collapse, consistent with sudden, enormous pressure or impact.\n\n\n\nAfter being granted permission to use [[[SCP-484]]] in an experiment with one target of SCP-356-ARC, Agent Green administered one dose to a Class D personnel, ordering him to look into the eyes of the \"target\".\u00a0\u00a0Transcription of video is as follows:\n\n\n\n> **Green**: Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, please state what occurred during the event.\n\n> **Class D**: Fuck you! Fuck all y'all, man! Y'all are outta yo' //minds//, man!\n\n> **Green**: Calm down, please.\n\n> **Class D**: Calm down, shit! How about I put you through all that bullshit and then me tell you calm down, how about that?\n\n> **Green**: If you refuse to calm yourself, you will be sedated immediately by security.\n\n> **Class D**: Sedate this, motherfucker! *flips off Green*\n\n> \n\n> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (security staff) grips the subject\u2019s finger and rapidly bends it back against the joint.\u00a0\u00a0Subject\u2019s finger breaks in two places, and additional staff restrain and sedate subject\n\n> Two minutes pass while the sedative takes effect.\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0\u00a0issued reprimand by supervising Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0Subject rapidly relaxes while first aid is applied.\u00a0\u00a0Agent Green appears to be taking notes, before resuming debriefing.\n\n> \n\n> **Green**: Are you ready to cooperate with this interview now?\n\n> **Class D**: Y...yeah... sure...\n\n> **Green**: Good. Now if you could describe what you remember of the interior for me.\n\n> **Class D**: A... hallway... kinda two on top of each other but kinda not...\n\n> **Green**: Was there just the hallway, or were there more things?\n\n> **Class D**: Uh... some kinda gray curtain thing... but it's like water. I remember... reachin' out to touch it, and...\n\n> **Green**: And... what?\n\n> **Class D**: And there was... a flash of\u2026dark. Does that make sense?\n\n> **Green**: Somewhat, yes. What then?\n\n> **Class D**: I couldn't move... an' then this //thing// reached out to me and then... then I woke up on the grass naked, and my necklace was gone. Wait, I don't have a necklace.\n\n> **Green**: Forget about the necklace, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Can you describe this //thing// for me?\n\n> **Class D**: I\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2026looked like\u2026crying.\u00a0\u00a0Like hurt and\u2026I don\u2019t know.\n\n> **Green**:\u00a0\u00a0Crying?\n\n> **Class\u00a0\u00a0D**: Listen, man, I don\u2019t even know.\u00a0\u00a0When I was little, my mom died in front of me.\u00a0\u00a0Cancer.\u00a0\u00a0She smoked like a fuckin\u2019 chimney.\u00a0\u00a0It looked how I felt when I watched her die.\n\n> **Green**: \u2026\n\n> **Class D**: Listen, I don\u2019t know what you want me to fucking say, ok?\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s what I remember.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Subject lapsed into a coma several hours after interview, and expired after three days under the coma.\u00a0\u00a0No cause of death was determined.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-484", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-356-ARC", "scp_number": 356, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "archived", "euclid", "humanoid", "intangible", "scp", "sculpture"], "title": "SCP-356-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-356-arc"}, "SCP-400-ARC": {"created_at": "2008-07-30T20:28:00", "creator": "DrTVague", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrTVague", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drtvague", "comment": "Added this, it's my first.

SCP-494 must be stored in a 0.1\u00a0m x 0.1\u00a0m x 0.1\u00a0m glass container with a removable top, and a piece of specially inscribed paper of 10\u00a0cm x 25\u00a0cm is to be placed atop the container as a means of containing the object's effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-494 is an oblong torus 7.6 centimetres long which appears to be suspended in some sort of unknown blue-green liquid or gel (designated SCP-494-A). The viscosity of the liquid can and will change drastically without notice. SCP-494 itself appears to be made of limestone, and is dyed with ochre to form crude line patterns. SCP-494 appears to float in mid-air, in defiance of the laws of gravity. The ochre dye glows at random intervals; the cause of this effect is unknown. During a period of glowing, the liquid will begin to gel, and the surface will form into complex patterns based on ripples.</p>\n<p>Some Foundation employees believe SCP-494 to be a device to communicate with another plane of reality, but the hypothesis cannot be proved in any way currently practical, or, indeed, known. It has, to date, caused a number of anomalies to occur, even while completely contained. For more info on these anomalies, see Addendum 494-A below.</p>\n<p>SCP-494 was recovered by Foundation agents in Samoa, following up a report of an anomalous cavern structure; the investigation was somewhat hampered by the unexpected removal of the investigating Foundation archaeological team. However, SCP-494 was eventually sighted by the sole remaining team member, Agent [REDACTED], and immediately contained by Foundation personnel.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 494-A:</strong> Anomalies</p>\n<p>494's anomalous behaviour includes, but may not be limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>- On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the ochre dye was observed emitting a blue light, rather than its usual red. During the blue period, the walls of the containment vessel began to emit SCP-494-A, and continued until the containment vessel was entirely full. Rippling patterns resumed as usual.</p>\n<p>- On a number of occasions since SCP-494's containment, at an average interval of a month (there is no defined pattern other than this), a hologram or similar projection has manifested inside the containment cell. The hologram has, on all occasions, been very blurred and in the shape of a humanoid-looking figure, wearing bangles, beads, frills, and what may be shells of some description, and has never emitted any sound. It usually dissipates after fifteen minutes of roaming near the object, during which time it appears to assume a 'guard' stance.</p>\n<p>- On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, two hovering lights - one blue, one red - appeared while three Level-1 personnel were transporting SCP-494 to a suitable laboratory at Site-[REDACTED] for analysis (for analysis result consults Addendum 494-B). One employee reported hearing 'the sound of ocean waves' and assumed a kneeling position, another exhibited xenoglossy with overtones of distress, while the third wept; the tears of the third member of staff were later found to be SCP-494-A (significantly, the third employee was the only one continually in contact with the object during the period of impairment). The period of impairment ended after approximately fifteen minutes, with the disappearance of the anomalous lights and the return of the employees in question to a near-nominal mental state. All three were immediately examined by medical staff; however, given the lack of conclusions drawn from the examination, and the priority of SCP-494's analysis, the three staff members were allowed to continue transporting SCP-494 to its destination.</p>\n<p>- Objects in the immediate vicinity of SCP-494's containment vessel have been disturbed such that their absolute mass increases for roughly fifteen minutes with no apparent cause. In some cases, indentations have also been observed on the top surfaces of the objects, leading scientists to remark that something would appear to have been sitting on them. No tangible object, however, has been named as the agent of SCP-494's \"sitting on objects\" effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 494-B:</strong> See Experiment Log 494-A.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-494-arc\">SCP-494-ARC</a>\" by A Fat Ghost, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

SCP-494 must be stored in a 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m glass container with a removable top, and a piece of specially inscribed paper of 10 cm x 25 cm is to be placed atop the container as a means of containing the object's effects.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-494 is an oblong torus 7.6 centimetres long which appears to be suspended in some sort of unknown blue-green liquid or gel (designated SCP-494-A). The viscosity of the liquid can and will change drastically without notice. SCP-494 itself appears to be made of limestone, and is dyed with ochre to form crude line patterns. SCP-494 appears to float in mid-air, in defiance of the laws of gravity. The ochre dye glows at random intervals; the cause of this effect is unknown. During a period of glowing, the liquid will begin to gel, and the surface will form into complex patterns based on ripples.\n\n\n\nSome Foundation employees believe SCP-494 to be a device to communicate with another plane of reality, but the hypothesis cannot be proved in any way currently practical, or, indeed, known. It has, to date, caused a number of anomalies to occur, even while completely contained. For more info on these anomalies, see Addendum 494-A below.\n\n\n\nSCP-494 was recovered by Foundation agents in Samoa, following up a report of an anomalous cavern structure; the investigation was somewhat hampered by the unexpected removal of the investigating Foundation archaeological team. However, SCP-494 was eventually sighted by the sole remaining team member, Agent [REDACTED], and immediately contained by Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 494-A:** Anomalies \n\n\n\n494's anomalous behaviour includes, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n- On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the ochre dye was observed emitting a blue light, rather than its usual red. During the blue period, the walls of the containment vessel began to emit SCP-494-A, and continued until the containment vessel was entirely full. Rippling patterns resumed as usual.\n\n\n\n- On a number of occasions since SCP-494's containment, at an average interval of a month (there is no defined pattern other than this), a hologram or similar projection has manifested inside the containment cell. The hologram has, on all occasions, been very blurred and in the shape of a humanoid-looking figure, wearing bangles, beads, frills, and what may be shells of some description, and has never emitted any sound. It usually dissipates after fifteen minutes of roaming near the object, during which time it appears to assume a 'guard' stance.\n\n\n\n- On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, two hovering lights - one blue, one red - appeared while three Level-1 personnel were transporting SCP-494 to a suitable laboratory at Site-[REDACTED] for analysis (for analysis result consults Addendum 494-B). One employee reported hearing 'the sound of ocean waves' and assumed a kneeling position, another exhibited xenoglossy with overtones of distress, while the third wept; the tears of the third member of staff were later found to be SCP-494-A (significantly, the third employee was the only one continually in contact with the object during the period of impairment). The period of impairment ended after approximately fifteen minutes, with the disappearance of the anomalous lights and the return of the employees in question to a near-nominal mental state. All three were immediately examined by medical staff; however, given the lack of conclusions drawn from the examination, and the priority of SCP-494's analysis, the three staff members were allowed to continue transporting SCP-494 to its destination.\n\n\n\n- Objects in the immediate vicinity of SCP-494's containment vessel have been disturbed such that their absolute mass increases for roughly fifteen minutes with no apparent cause. In some cases, indentations have also been observed on the top surfaces of the objects, leading scientists to remark that something would appear to have been sitting on them. No tangible object, however, has been named as the agent of SCP-494's \"sitting on objects\" effect.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 494-B:** See Experiment Log 494-A.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["island-story", "archived-scps", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-494-ARC", "scp_number": 494, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "airborne", "archived", "autonomous", "ectoentropic", "euclid", "light", "liquid", "safe", "scp"], "title": "SCP-494-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-494-arc"}, "SCP-515-ARC": {"created_at": "2008-11-05T15:32:00", "creator": "Dr Kondraki", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T15:32:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T16:39:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T16:45:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "Uploaded file \"636px-Nikon_d3_1.jpg\".", "date": "2008-11-05T17:19:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T17:21:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T17:27:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T18:31:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-05T19:03:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "Grammar", "date": "2008-11-05T19:04:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kondraki", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kondraki", "comment": "", "date": "2008-11-21T16:30:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Title standardisation.", "date": "2009-02-13T07:50:00"}, {"author": "AdminBright", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adminbright", "comment": "You successfully renamed the page: \"scp-515\" to \"scp-515-arc\".", "date": "2009-11-09T13:23:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Added tags: archived.", "date": "2010-03-28T01:34:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Added -ARC to page title.", "date": "2010-03-28T01:35:00"}, {"author": "Rukor", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rukor", "comment": "", "date": "2010-04-27T06:22:00"}, {"author": "Bland", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bland", "comment": "Image not showing up - fixed.", "date": "2011-07-06T23:24:00"}, {"author": "Drewbear", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drewbear", "comment": "", "date": "2013-02-08T21:33:00"}, {"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "Added tags: tool.

Its appearance is a hybrid of several mammalian species. The creature has four long, apelike arms, one pair behind the other. All digits have retractable claws some 8cm in length. The legs appear mostly ursine. The creature has a long muscular tail, which is generally used for balance while walking. The head is vaguely feline, with powerful jaws and large, forward-set eyes, although it also sports two gazelle-like horns. The creature's entire body is covered in sleek black fur, which has exhibited significant flame-retardant properties.</p>\n<p>SCP-517 is extremely dangerous due to its great speed, strength, plethora of natural weapons and extraordinary resistance to injury. It will attack every living organism in sight in a seemingly mindless rage. This berserk state, however, is not without strategy; the creature can instantly incorporate any available weapon into its tactics, suggesting either high intelligence or an instinctual understanding of the dynamics of combat and prompting serious questions about its origins.

The final shot was the only one observed to have any real effect, impacting the base of the skull and putting the creature into a shallow coma.

Any time Foundation personnel or guests are in the inner chamber, it is to be lit completely. The lamps used for this are to be replaced regularly, and stored outside the containment area when not in use. With the exception of these lamps, all electronics are forbidden in the inner chamber.

Metal walkways may be placed over this channel, but they must be kept clean of dust and other deposits twice a week.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-578 appears as three distinct entities, labeled as SCP-578-1, SCP-578-2, and SCP-578-3. Each form of SCP-578 possesses a field effect that can induce damage in electrical devices, as well as inducing premature senescence in personnel. The damage to electrical devices can be permanent and cumulative, dictating a rigorous replacement schedule. The induced senescence appears to be temporary for the most part, though it has proven to be fatal with great exposure. While most damage heals with time, some effects are occasionally permanent, such as skin damage in the form of wrinkles or melanin spots. Damage to the telomeres of affected subjects have not been observed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-578-1 codename \"Child\" appears as a female child, approximately aged 5 to 7. No transparency or lack of color is displayed by SCP-578-1. She is dressed in clothing characteristic of a modern Lolita style or modern reproductions of Baroque or Rococo style clothing. The field effect of SCP-578-1 takes the form of substantial electrical disruption with minimal induced senescence. While SCP-578-1 is active, there has been substantial interference with radio transmissions observed. It seems that these disruptions manifest as additional sounds or voices on the channel used by the Foundation radios, whatever encryption protocol for said channel is used. These disruptions are childlike screams of delight, murmurs and laughs, Baroque or Rococo style music, or a clicking sound described as the \"ticks of a thousand clocks\". It is advised during manifestations of SCP-578-1 that radio use is kept to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Though SCP-578-1 easily passes through physical obstruction, impedes the function of the Arc Torus system, and does not appear to be affected by the labyrinth design nor the salt spread, SCP-578-1 does not appear to actively threaten escape. SCP-578-1 rarely leaves the outer chamber of the containment area, often dancing in front of the mirrors. SCP-578-1 does not endanger any of the research personnel as long as suitable distance is kept from SCP-578-1. Any physical contact with SCP-578-1 by personnel directly or indirectly as with a CED induces a significant change in behavior in SCP-578-1. Whichever person had physical contact with SCP-578-1 experiences rapid development of substantial senescence. The senescence induced during at this time often proves fatal. Security personnel are advised to avoid all contact with SCP-578-1.</p>\n<p>Though SCP-578-1 displays no physical trauma in its initial state, violent physical contact with Foundation personnel has been shown to induce physical wounds on its form. Further, upon any physical contact SCP-578-1 ceases all movement, and starts to manifest slicing wounds that appear consistent to those caused by a knife. These wounds manifest over a period of twenty three (23) minutes, and eventually ends with what appears to be the death of SCP-578-1. Upon this \"death\", one of three forms of SCP-578 (including SCP-578-1, once again whole) will replace the corpse.</p>\n<p>The radio disruptions change, as well, and have proven to be somewhat psychologically damaging. The content of the disruptions are loud screams and [DATA EXPUNGED]. It is advised that if SCP-578-1 starts to manifest wounds, radios will be shut off for the duration of the manifestation.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-578-2 codename \"Wretch\" appears as an emaciated female in her late twenties (20s). SCP-578-2 appears without color, manifesting in black and white. It shows substantial skin scarification, trismus, bruxism and advanced tooth decay. These symptoms are consistent with methamphetamine abuse. SCP-578-2 initially manifested without clothes, however recently the SCP manifests with a t-shirt and brief style underwear. The reason for the change is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-2 shows an active desire to escape, coupled with physical strength and speed inconsistent with its unhealthy appearance (though still within human limits). Use of the CEDs will cause SCP-578-2 obvious physical pain, and may temporarily incapacitate it for a period of no longer then twenty (20) seconds. It must be stressed to the security team that even if SCP-578-2 appears to be neutralized, it will get back up. Unlike SCP-578-1 or SCP-578-3, SCP-578-2 does not manifest wounds resulting from physical confrontation with Foundation personnel. Personnel are to be advised of the deleterious effect of extended close contact with SCP-578-2. At no time has SCP-578-2 displayed an unconscious or sleep state. Use of the CED devices is to be focused on keeping SCP-578-2 at arms length, as well as discouraging further uncooperative behavior from SCP-578-2. Attempts to use firearms to manage 578-2 have led to manifestation of wounds, but no evidence of any sort of structural damage.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-2 displays both disruption of electronic systems brought near her as well as a senescence effect on anyone within arms length. This senescence effect is cumulative if adequate healing is not allowed to take place in between exposures. As such, to limit exposure time, it is advised that personnel cycle their time actively engaging SCP-578-2 until a portable Arc Torus system can be used to immobilize SCP-578-2. Unlike SCP-578-1, and like SCP578-3, SCP-578-2 is effectively contained by the Arc Torus system.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-2 manifests with a twelve point seven centimeter (12.7\u00a0cm or 5'') steak knife in its lower back on its right side. This steak knife is called Phenomenon 578-2a in Foundation documents. Faced with significant resistance, SCP-578-2 will remove this from its side and use it as a weapon. Disarming SCP-578-2 is not advised. Holding Phenomenon 578-2a has resulted in fatal spontaneous senescence in every subject to date.</p>\n<p>At night, SCP-578-3 will always manifest following the appearance of SCP-578-2. It is unknown if SCP-578-2 actively intends for this to happen. In any case, it appears that SCP-578-2 will attempt to compensate for SCP-578-3's shortcomings by making its way out of the containment area to the warehouse enclosure beyond the channel and waiting for SCP-578-3 to manifest. The labyrinth-design and salt spreading has shown great utility in confusing or otherwise waylaying SCP-578-2. SCP-578-2 has been observed to spend at most eighteen (18) minutes actively attempting to trace the labyrinth or counting salt grains. SCP-578-2 appears to be aware of this limitation, and will actively attempt to avoid observing the floor of the warehouse area.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-2 shows no aversion to running water. Due to SCP-578-2's relationship to SCP-578-3, it is imperative that security staff do not let 578-2 cross the 4m water channel.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-578-3 codename \"Feral\" appears as a naked human female with very tan skin and dirty auburn-to-blonde hair. SCP-578-3 possesses the least powerful field effect of the three forms, showing minimal (though detectable and occasionally problematic) electronic effect. The senescence effect only appears on those subject to physical violence from the second state of SCP-578-3, and can substantially complicate recovery.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-3 manifests initially emaciated, apparently on the edge of starvation. It can further be observed suffering from ataxia, myoclonus, and shaking of the limbs. Upon manifestation, SCP-578-3 will wander aimlessly until spotting someone. It will slowly make its way to the person, and attempts to communicate nonverbally, bringing its fists to its lower abdomen and tapping them against its stomach. SCP-578-3 does not engage in this behavior for an extended period, opting after a few minutes to bite anyone nearby. This biting behavior appears to have consumption of the victim as the goal, however, due to the exceptional weakness of the initial state of SCP-578-3, these attempts to consume personnel are easily dealt with.</p>\n<p>Unlike SCP-578-1 or SCP-578-2 the initial state of SCP-578-3 has been known to vocalize, though only when alone. The sounds are not English. Additionally, they seem highly confused with many repeated sections and sudden pauses. All attempts to translate or analyze these vocalizations for grammar has failed. The Arc Torus system proves effective against the initial form of SCP-578-3. SCP-578-3 will be exceptionally entranced by mirrors during this period. This initial state of SCP-578-3 will manifest wounds dealt to it by Foundation personnel, which can hasten the emergence of the second state of the SCP.</p>\n<p>Taking note of its emaciated state, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 suggested that 578-3 be provided with a meal. 578-3 quickly consumes this meal, seeming to favor raw fruits and vegetables. However, it seems placing the food triggers regions of darkness around SCP-578-3 to manifest animals within a few minutes, including groups of wild dogs. In Foundation documents, these animals are called Phenomena 578-3a. Though upon emergence 578-3a will move to attack 578-3, instances of 578-3a can be interacted with. It should be cautioned that these interactions have often ended with personnel attacked. If the attack by 578-3a on SCP-578-3 is allowed to be successful, 578-3 will be left with substantial evident wounds. Sufficient lighting delays the appearance of 578-3a, allowing 578-3 to finish the provided food. Upon completion, however, it seems 578-3 will unwillingly regurgitate which triggers the appearance of 578-3a.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-3 will collapse quickly after first manifesting, from evident starvation or external attack by Foundation personnel or Phenomena 578-3a. All signs of life will quickly cease. After this seeming death, SCP-578-3 will resume movement. SCP-578-3 will move on all four limbs in a fashion similar to feral humans. Though one hesitates to describe the psychology of such an entity as 578-3, it appears frustration is a key motivator for this SCP. Occurrence of vocalizations and behaviors consistent with frustration often occur with changes to the musculature of 578-3. These alterations allow for faster and more agile movement of 578-3. Further physical feats have been associated with SCP-578-3, including an ability to adhere itself to the outer wall of the containment area and crawl along it.</p>\n<p>Though SCP-578-3 has been observed to pass through physical obstruction, SCP-578-3 shows an extreme reluctance to do so. Indeed, physical obstruction of considerable strength is an effective way to contain the SCP. SCP-578-3 shows an extreme aversion to running water as well. With significant impulse, however, SCP-578-3 has been observed to vault running water. Currently, SCP-578-3 has not been observed to jump far enough to exceed the 4m channel used in containment of the SCP.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-3 will not manifest during the day at Site 14. Though SCP-578-3 will emerge at random at other times during the night, SCP-578-3 has been shown to always emerge the night before the full moon, during the full moon, the night after it, and lately it has begun manifesting on nights of the new moon. The time of manifestation appears to be centered on the point when the full moon will reach its highest altitude in the night sky. The time of manifestation is variable, with longer times related to higher moonrises.</p>\n<p>At low levels of frustration the strewn salt and labyrinth pattern often prove to inhibit the SCP. SCP-578-3 will even count salt grains and trace labyrinth lines in a calm fashion dissimilar to its otherwise bestial behavior. The longest SCP-578-3 has been observed to engage in this behavior is five (5) minutes. If not at high levels of frustration, the Arc Torus will also contain SCP-578-3. SCP-578-3 displays a tremendous aversion to mirrors of all sorts at all levels of frustration while in the second state. 578-3 is attracted to and will consume portions of raw meat. It has recently been discovered, due to experiments suggested by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, that personnel who have recently eaten also attract the attention of 578-3.</p>\n<p>SCP-578-3 will display wounds dealt it by Foundation personnel or by any spectral manifestations in its initial state. However, many of these wounds are absorbed or ameliorated by the increased musculature displayed during the physical transformation of SCP-578-3. Unlike SCP-578-2, SCP-578-3 can be incapacitated for relatively long periods of time, though periods longer then five (5) minutes are rarely observed. Security personnel must work quickly to incapacitate SCP-578-3 before frustration levels peak. While SCP-578-3 is incapacitated the Arc Torus system can be set up to lead SCP-578-3 back to the containment area.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> The Arc Torus system was originally designed by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The system proved effective in field testing, and was used during an encounter with [DATA EXPUNGED]. This encounter first outlined the potential liability with using the Arc Torus system.</p>\n<p>Later use at containing SCP-578 had some effectiveness. However, prolonged encounters with the ectoplasmic entity had a severe deleterious effect on any electronic system, and especially the Arc Torus system. After an incident involving SCP-578 where nearly twenty (20) Arc Torus systems failed in quick succession, allowing SCP-578-2 to escape into the general area of Site \u2588\u2588, it was determined new containment procedures would need to be enacted.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 opted for a \"folkloric\" strategy. Though initially there was much resistance to such a system among researchers, certain aspects of it proved effective. Experimental results helped to isolate which factors and strategies proved most useful in containing SCP-578, and those strategies are reflected in the current special containment procedures.</p>\n<p>The Arc Torus system consists of wire of at least two point five four centimeters (2.54\u00a0cm or 1'') in diameter, with larger diameters proving more effective at containing SCP-578. Such larger wire also presents greater difficulty in movement, larger chance of tearing, as well as expense. The wire must be made of a strongly conductive metal, with silver alloys currently being favored. The wire is one of many used to completely surround an area with a large degree of electrical current. This current also generates a strong magnetic field. It appears that some combination of the two impedes the movement of ectoplasm.</p>\n<p>The liability of such a system lies in the electromagnetic field effect displayed by many ectoplasmic entities. The Arc Torus, like any other system based on the movement of electrons, is subject to failure in the presence of entities with such a field effect. Use of Faraday cages can ameliorate this ectoplasmic field effect somewhat.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-578-arc\">SCP-578-ARC</a>\" by snorlison, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

This biting behavior appears to have consumption of the victim as the goal, however, due to the exceptional weakness of the initial state of SCP-578-3, these attempts to consume personnel are easily dealt with.\n\n\n\nUnlike SCP-578-1 or SCP-578-2 the initial state of SCP-578-3 has been known to vocalize, though only when alone. The sounds are not English. Additionally, they seem highly confused with many repeated sections and sudden pauses. All attempts to translate or analyze these vocalizations for grammar has failed. The Arc Torus system proves effective against the initial form of SCP-578-3. SCP-578-3 will be exceptionally entranced by mirrors during this period. This initial state of SCP-578-3 will manifest wounds dealt to it by Foundation personnel, which can hasten the emergence of the second state of the SCP. \n\n\n\nTaking note of its emaciated state, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 suggested that 578-3 be provided with a meal. 578-3 quickly consumes this meal, seeming to favor raw fruits and vegetables. However, it seems placing the food triggers regions of darkness around SCP-578-3 to manifest animals within a few minutes, including groups of wild dogs. In Foundation documents, these animals are called Phenomena 578-3a. Though upon emergence 578-3a will move to attack 578-3, instances of 578-3a can be interacted with. It should be cautioned that these interactions have often ended with personnel attacked. If the attack by 578-3a on SCP-578-3 is allowed to be successful, 578-3 will be left with substantial evident wounds. Sufficient lighting delays the appearance of 578-3a, allowing 578-3 to finish the provided food. Upon completion, however, it seems 578-3 will unwillingly regurgitate which triggers the appearance of 578-3a.\n\n\n\nSCP-578-3 will collapse quickly after first manifesting, from evident starvation or external attack by Foundation personnel or Phenomena 578-3a. All signs of life will quickly cease. After this seeming death, SCP-578-3 will resume movement. SCP-578-3 will move on all four limbs in a fashion similar to feral humans. Though one hesitates to describe the psychology of such an entity as 578-3, it appears frustration is a key motivator for this SCP. Occurrence of vocalizations and behaviors consistent with frustration often occur with changes to the musculature of 578-3. These alterations allow for faster and more agile movement of 578-3. Further physical feats have been associated with SCP-578-3, including an ability to adhere itself to the outer wall of the containment area and crawl along it. \n\n\n\nThough SCP-578-3 has been observed to pass through physical obstruction, SCP-578-3 shows an extreme reluctance to do so. Indeed, physical obstruction of considerable strength is an effective way to contain the SCP. SCP-578-3 shows an extreme aversion to running water as well. With significant impulse, however, SCP-578-3 has been observed to vault running water. Currently, SCP-578-3 has not been observed to jump far enough to exceed the 4m channel used in containment of the SCP. \n\n\n\nSCP-578-3 will not manifest during the day at Site 14. Though SCP-578-3 will emerge at random at other times during the night, SCP-578-3 has been shown to always emerge the night before the full moon, during the full moon, the night after it, and lately it has begun manifesting on nights of the new moon. The time of manifestation appears to be centered on the point when the full moon will reach its highest altitude in the night sky. The time of manifestation is variable, with longer times related to higher moonrises. \n\n\n\nAt low levels of frustration the strewn salt and labyrinth pattern often prove to inhibit the SCP. SCP-578-3 will even count salt grains and trace labyrinth lines in a calm fashion dissimilar to its otherwise bestial behavior. The longest SCP-578-3 has been observed to engage in this behavior is five (5) minutes. If not at high levels of frustration, the Arc Torus will also contain SCP-578-3. SCP-578-3 displays a tremendous aversion to mirrors of all sorts at all levels of frustration while in the second state. 578-3 is attracted to and will consume portions of raw meat. It has recently been discovered, due to experiments suggested by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, that personnel who have recently eaten also attract the attention of 578-3. \n\n\n\nSCP-578-3 will display wounds dealt it by Foundation personnel or by any spectral manifestations in its initial state. However, many of these wounds are absorbed or ameliorated by the increased musculature displayed during the physical transformation of SCP-578-3. Unlike SCP-578-2, SCP-578-3 can be incapacitated for relatively long periods of time, though periods longer then five (5) minutes are rarely observed. Security personnel must work quickly to incapacitate SCP-578-3 before frustration levels peak. While SCP-578-3 is incapacitated the Arc Torus system can be set up to lead SCP-578-3 back to the containment area.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Reference:** The Arc Torus system was originally designed by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The system proved effective in field testing, and was used during an encounter with [DATA EXPUNGED]. This encounter first outlined the potential liability with using the Arc Torus system.\n\n\n\nLater use at containing SCP-578 had some effectiveness. However, prolonged encounters with the ectoplasmic entity had a severe deleterious effect on any electronic system, and especially the Arc Torus system. After an incident involving SCP-578 where nearly twenty (20) Arc Torus systems failed in quick succession, allowing SCP-578-2 to escape into the general area of Site \u2588\u2588, it was determined new containment procedures would need to be enacted.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 opted for a \"folkloric\" strategy. Though initially there was much resistance to such a system among researchers, certain aspects of it proved effective. Experimental results helped to isolate which factors and strategies proved most useful in containing SCP-578, and those strategies are reflected in the current special containment procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Arc Torus system consists of wire of at least two point five four centimeters (2.54 cm or 1'') in diameter, with larger diameters proving more effective at containing SCP-578. Such larger wire also presents greater difficulty in movement, larger chance of tearing, as well as expense. The wire must be made of a strongly conductive metal, with silver alloys currently being favored. The wire is one of many used to completely surround an area with a large degree of electrical current. This current also generates a strong magnetic field. It appears that some combination of the two impedes the movement of ectoplasm. \n\n\n\nThe liability of such a system lies in the electromagnetic field effect displayed by many ectoplasmic entities. The Arc Torus, like any other system based on the movement of electrons, is subject to failure in the presence of entities with such a field effect. Use of Faraday cages can ameliorate this ectoplasmic field effect somewhat.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-578-ARC", "scp_number": 578, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "archived", "electromagnetic", "euclid", "hostile", "humanoid", "scp"], "title": "SCP-578-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-578-arc"}, "SCP-728-ARC": {"created_at": "2011-04-05T16:45:00", "creator": "A Fat Ghost", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "makin' copies", "date": "2011-04-05T16:45:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "File \"deer4.jpg\" renamed to \"scp728.jpg\".", "date": "2011-04-05T16:46:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Uploaded file \"deer4.jpg\".", "date": "2011-04-05T16:46:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "picture", "date": "2011-04-05T16:48:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "thank you, russians.", "date": "2011-04-05T17:13:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: archived, cervine, safe, scp.

In the event that power is cut to the electromagnets, standard Keter-level facility destruction procedures are to be initiated. The location of the containment facility must be at least two hundred (200) kilometers from any nearby city or industrial installation, as SCP-744's strength and robustness increased exponentially with its consumption of metal objects.

The entity managed to offset its constant state of decay by ingesting any nearby metal objects, after which the mass of the absorbed object was integrated into its physical makeup. Absorption of metal objects seemed to augment SCP-744's strength and resistance to physical harm. SCP-744 displayed remarkable physical strength: when confronted with an M1 Abrams deployed in an effort towards containment, it struck the tank with sufficient force to flip it over entirely, at which point it was consumed by SCP-744.

In the event that power is cut to the electromagnets, standard Keter-level facility destruction procedures are to be initiated. The location of the containment facility must be at least two hundred (200) kilometers from any nearby city or industrial installation, as SCP-744's strength and robustness increased exponentially with its consumption of metal objects. SCP-744's remains have shown no signs of activity since neutralization; \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 [01-5281] speculates that further irradiation of the remains may prevent any possible regeneration by the remains of SCP-744.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Description**: SCP-744 was a vaguely-humanoid amalgam of decaying scrap metal and oxidized iron measuring approximately 33 meters in height and calculated to weigh at least 325,000 kg. The entity managed to offset its constant state of decay by ingesting any nearby metal objects, after which the mass of the absorbed object was integrated into its physical makeup. Absorption of metal objects seemed to augment SCP-744's strength and resistance to physical harm. SCP-744 displayed remarkable physical strength: when confronted with an M1 Abrams deployed in an effort towards containment, it struck the tank with sufficient force to flip it over entirely, at which point it was consumed by SCP-744. Bullets and artillery rounds of varying caliber were absorbed directly.

Researchers are required to wear heat and electrical protected HAZMAT suits when handling 776. D-class personal have been denied access to similar protective wear.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-776 is a six-sided die with a dark grey metallic surface, with several symbols etched into the surface in place of numbers or the same symbols to signify numbers.</p>\n<p>The symbols are respectively:</p>\n<p>- One lightning bolt in a bright white colour.<br/>\n- Two snowflakes in light blue.<br/>\n- Three tear drops in dark blue.<br/>\n- Four brown ragged circles, possibly symbolising stones.<br/>\n- Five red ragged tear drops, possibly symbolising fire.<br/>\n- Six waving lines that are side by side, possibly symbolising wind.</p>\n<p>Rolling a one causes an electrical charge to burst out of the die, covering a six foot area. Those not wearing protective gear are exposed to a charge with high voltage, but low amperage; causing little more than an uncomfortable contraction of muscles for those caught.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that the die retains a charge after a one has been rolled, causing the next person to pick it up to be hit with the same sort of charge.</p>\n<p>Rolling a two causes water surrounding the die to immediately freeze. The die becomes cold to the touch.</p>\n<p>Rolling a three causes a large amount of water to pour from the die, measured at 5 litres per second for 5 minutes. The die seems to treat water as a solid surface and can be rolled on it as if the water were a table or similar. However, after a three has been rolled, the die is prohibited from being rolled after incident 1A.</p>\n<p>Rolling a four causes a minute scale earthquake to occur, usually affecting a 6 foot area. Measurements on the Richter scale have ranged from 3.2 to 7.8. Stronger quakes are theorized.</p>\n<p>Rolling a five causes five large fireballs to be launched from the face-up sides of the die, in the directions that they are facing. The die becomes incredibly hot after a five has been rolled (measured at 200 degrees centigrade ten minutes after the die has been rolled).</p>\n<p>Rolling a six causes a large tornado to emanate from the die. Wind speeds have been clocked at 400 kilometres per hour, and are incredibly destructive.

D-class personal have been denied access to similar protective wear.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-776 is a six-sided die with a dark grey metallic surface, with several symbols etched into the surface in place of numbers or the same symbols to signify numbers.\n\n\n\nThe symbols are respectively:\n\n\n\n- One lightning bolt in a bright white colour.\n\n- Two snowflakes in light blue.\n\n- Three tear drops in dark blue.\n\n- Four brown ragged circles, possibly symbolising stones.\n\n- Five red ragged tear drops, possibly symbolising fire.\n\n- Six waving lines that are side by side, possibly symbolising wind.\n\n\n\nRolling a one causes an electrical charge to burst out of the die, covering a six foot area. Those not wearing protective gear are exposed to a charge with high voltage, but low amperage; causing little more than an uncomfortable contraction of muscles for those caught.\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that the die retains a charge after a one has been rolled, causing the next person to pick it up to be hit with the same sort of charge.\n\n\n\nRolling a two causes water surrounding the die to immediately freeze. The die becomes cold to the touch.\n\n\n\nRolling a three causes a large amount of water to pour from the die, measured at 5 litres per second for 5 minutes. The die seems to treat water as a solid surface and can be rolled on it as if the water were a table or similar. However, after a three has been rolled, the die is prohibited from being rolled after incident 1A.\n\n\n\nRolling a four causes a minute scale earthquake to occur, usually affecting a 6 foot area. Measurements on the Richter scale have ranged from 3.2 to 7.8. Stronger quakes are theorized.\n\n\n\nRolling a five causes five large fireballs to be launched from the face-up sides of the die, in the directions that they are facing. The die becomes incredibly hot after a five has been rolled (measured at 200 degrees centigrade ten minutes after the die has been rolled).\n\n\n\nRolling a six causes a large tornado to emanate from the die. Wind speeds have been clocked at 400 kilometres per hour, and are incredibly destructive. After the first rolling, 776 was moved to an air-tight, protected room.\n\n\n\n**Incident 1A:**\n\n\n\nAfter rolling a three, D-class personnel then rolled a two. Three D-class personnel had to be dug from the ice and have treatment for minor frostbite to their toes and feet. One D-class subject died instantly whilst having his head underwater looking for personal effects dropped.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["incident-239-b-clef-kondraki", "archived-scps", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-776-ARC", "scp_number": 776, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "archived", "artifact", "euclid", "game", "polyhedral", "probability", "scp"], "title": "SCP-776-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-776-arc"}, "SCP-784-ARC": {"created_at": "2008-12-30T22:22:00", "creator": "DrClef", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2008-12-30T22:22:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-01-02T17:41:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-01-02T20:51:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Title standardisation.", "date": "2009-02-13T08:37:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-02-18T18:26:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Added tags: humanoid.", "date": "2009-04-08T02:57:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2009-04-21T16:25:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-03T21:19:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-04T04:14:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2010-06-04T04:15:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Removed tags: keter.", "date": "2010-12-23T00:41:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: biological, microscopic, swarm.

In that incident, SCP-784 attacked and entangled a Class-D personnel inspecting its containment cell, and proceeded to liquify a portion of its flesh, converting it into a nutrient solution which it then administered to its biological component.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["log-of-agent-aa", "olympia-project", "experiment-log-784-beta", "784incident1", "archived-scps", "scp-212", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-784-ARC", "scp_number": 784, "series": "archived", "tags": ["_licensebox", "archived", "biological", "euclid", "humanoid", "microscopic", "prometheus", "scp", "swarm"], "title": "SCP-784-ARC", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-784-arc"}, "SCP-837-ARC": {"created_at": "2009-03-25T07:17:00", "creator": "Dr English", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr English", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-english", "comment": "Created page!", "date": "2009-03-25T07:17:00"}, {"author": "Dr English", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-english", "comment": "Uploaded file \"scp837\".", "date": "2009-03-25T07:26:00"}, {"author": "Dr English", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-english", "comment": "added image, changed XXX to SCP number.", "date": "2009-03-25T07:28:00"}, {"author": "Ekzentric Lohner", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ekzentric-lohner", "comment": "Added tags: euclid, neutralized, scp.", "date": "2009-03-25T17:51:00"}, {"author": "Dr English", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-english", "comment": "removed redundancy in containment procedures.", "date": "2009-03-25T20:26:00"}, {"author": "Dr English", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-english", "comment": "", "date": "2009-03-25T21:05:00"}, {"author": "A Fat Ghost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/a-fat-ghost", "comment": "Formatting.", "date": "2010-02-05T15:27:00"}, {"author": "karajade", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/karajade", "comment": "minor edit for formatting of species name and apostraphes", "date": "2010-02-15T08:28:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "Added tags: invertebrate.", "date": "2011-01-20T20:52:00"}, {"author": "Sonata Green", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sonata-green", "comment": "removed internal spaces from date/time", "date": "2011-12-08T00:09:00"}, {"author": "Riobren", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/riobren", "comment": "Some grammar fixes.", "date": "2012-08-31T17:21:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: alive, insect, meteorological, self-repairing, thermal.
