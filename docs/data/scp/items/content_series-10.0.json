Subjects in contact with SCP-9002 will undergo a dramatic behavioral and cognitive shift, with a focus on increased racial prejudice. This change will occur over a matter of days, with a marked increase while riding SCP-9002. This effect is magnified during a VEHEMENCE CYCLE event, triggered by approaching with hostile intent.</p>\n<p><strong>STAGE 1</strong>: Subjects describe a sharp increase in intrusive thoughts. If a subject is aware of racial biases, resistance is possible.</p>\n<p><strong>STAGE 2</strong>: Biases become normalized to the subject. Statements regarding ethnic groups become absurd and divorced from reality.

Any personnel who exceed this limit are required to attend sensitivity training, with a focus on racial sensitivity twice weekly until symptoms subside. Under no circumstances are any personnel to approach SCP-9002 with hostile intent, at the risk of triggering a VEHEMENCE CYCLE. \n\n\n\nTire inflation and lubrication are to be checked weekly, and before any experiments involving riding SCP-9002. Standard Foundation-Issue bike lock is to be attached at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest subjects are not to exceed Stage 3 of exposure (50 miles/7 days stationary). Should any test subjects advance beyond Stage 3 or trigger a VEHEMENCE CYCLE, Subject is to be sequestered in the Site-56 Maximum Security Exclusion Shelter.\n\n\n\n**UPDATED PROCEDURES AS OF 9/24/26**\n\n\n\nFoundation SKYEYE assets are to monitor broadcasts from the Triangulum Galaxy. In the event of a completed VEHEMENCE CYCLE, sealed contingency plans have been filed with the relevant departments.\n\n\n\nNo personnel with a Psychic Coherence Rating over 4 Gellars[[footnote]] The Gellar is the standard unit of measurement for psionic sensitivity. The average baseline human broadcasts thoughts at a unit of 1 Gellar. [[/footnote]] are to be assigned to SCP-9002.

It has no observable differences from similar models. \n\n\n\nSCP-9002 is capable of independent locomotion, and able to act in self-defense via emission of \u03a8-A radiation[[footnote]] \u03a8-A is the emitted energy from psionic individuals. \u03a8-A is measured in Gellars. [[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nThe primary effect of SCP-9002 manifests during extended contact with the bicycle. Subjects in contact with SCP-9002 will undergo a dramatic behavioral and cognitive shift, with a focus on increased racial prejudice. This change will occur over a matter of days, with a marked increase while riding SCP-9002. This effect is magnified during a VEHEMENCE CYCLE event, triggered by approaching with hostile intent.\n\n\n\n\n\n**STAGE 1**: Subjects describe a sharp increase in intrusive thoughts. If a subject is aware of racial biases, resistance is possible.\n\n\n\n**STAGE 2**: Biases become normalized to the subject. Statements regarding ethnic groups become absurd and divorced from reality. The following statements were observed in POI-9002's[[footnote]] JoeyHamburgers, a Twitch streamer with a very small audience. [[/footnote]] broadcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Danish people cannot sleep on mattresses \n\n* Han Chinese don't understand what a river is\n\n* Irish-Catholics are incapable of following traffic laws\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n**STAGE 3**: Biases will extend to ethnic and cultural groups the subject is not aware of. The initial subject became aware of the N\u00e4lkan culture, as well as an unknown species residing in the Triangulum Galaxy.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"THE FOLLOWING IS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 5/9002\" hide=\"- CLEARANCE ACCEPTED\"]]\n\n\n\n**STAGE 4**: Subjects who reach stage 4 undergo rapid physical changes to the physical structure of the brain. Surgical intervention has been shown to be possible, but maximally invasive. Termination recommended. \n\n\n\n**STAGE 5**: ABSOLUTE VEHEMENCE, CK CLASS TOTAL FRAGMENTATION SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThis stage has yet to be reached in our current epoch. If reached, it is hypothesized that total societal collapse is a possibility. Current understanding of a VEHEMENCE CYCLE is limited to psychic communion with SCP-9002, as detailed in attached test logs. Further communication is strictly limited to avoid further propagation. See Document: VIGILANT LAMB for further details.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++ Discovery\n\n\n\nThe Foundation became aware of SCP-9002 as a result of automated keyword flagging on the streaming platform Twitch. A user by the name of JoeyHamburgers triggered POGGERS.aic with the use of Veiled keywords relating to anomalous ethnography. \n\n\n\nStream archive incomplete due Foundation AIC interception. Keyword triggers for N\u00e4lka related subjects triggered standard purge and ban protocols.

Although outwardly humanoid, the internal physiology of SCP-9009 differs wildly from the mammalian baseline. Instances display nonstandard circulatory, nervous, and lymphatic systems. Deviations are often insectoid in morphology, with the notable presence of a hard-shelled exoskeleton mimicking the appearance of various styles of formal wear, double-lidded compound pupils,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> and a circulatory and nervous system closely resembling that of the <em>Lasius niger</em>, or common garden ant.</p>\n<p>The neuroanatomy of SCP-9009 instances is currently poorly understood. The brain lacks any cerebral folds, possibly due to the low surface area and smooth texture of the frontal and temporal lobes. Natural lesions are typically found covering the brain which periodically leech an unknown blue liquid, currently theorized to act as a retardant against neural plasticity.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecology:</strong> SCP-9009's current ecological niche is that of a symbiotic or commensal partner to <em>Homo sapiens</em>.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> When in its adult form, an SCP-9009 instance will covertly enter an organization controlled by humans; if it succeeds, it will assume a leadership position, relying on its charisma to maintain its status. In circles where SCP-9009 are able to successfully integrate, they have been known to accrue vast quantities of wealth, which, according to leading theories, \"percolates\" down to <em>H. sapiens</em>, enriching them in the long run. In return, the humans working under a particular instance provide it with food, shelter, income, and valuable psychospheric input data for its elaborate mating displays.</p>\n<p>To avoid detection by <em>H. sapiens</em> and prevent input data pollution, the vast majority of SCP-9009 instances occupy positions that minimize close contact with other humans or SCP-9009 instances, which is facilitated by their characteristic wealth. However, in contrast to their otherwise solitary nature, four times per year, a gathering of multiple SCP-9009 instances will congregate in a particular location, often alongside baseline <em>H. sapiens</em>. Observed gatherings have ranged in size from three to 535 individuals, and usually take the form of a formal meeting, such as a corporate boardroom meeting, a legal trial, a church sermon, or a legislative session. SCP-9009 instances will participate as normal, attempting to mask their idiosyncratic behaviors, stalling the meeting until all <em>H. sapiens</em> leave.</p>\n<p>Once this occurs, the SCP-9009 instances will have sex.</p>\n<p>SCP-9009 mating rituals were once believed to last a short amount of time, as individuals in SCP-9009 gatherings were observed to finish mating with their chosen partner(s) within fifteen minutes of all <em>H. sapiens</em> leaving. However, while actual insemination of SCP-9009 instances occurs very quickly, the SCP-9009 mating ritual spans hours or potentially days.</p>\n<p>Current leading theories posit that quarterly SCP-9009 congregations are a form of <em>lekking</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> to facilitate sexual selection. SCP-9009 instances are highly selective in their mates, and prefer to mate with individuals who are particularly skilled in human mimicry. This is why instances congregate in uncharacteristically public meetings, as this gives them an opportunity to prove to others that they can convincingly present as a human, indicating that the individual has high reproductive fitness.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:75%;\"><img alt=\"trump-handshake.webp\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/trump-handshake.webp\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Two SCP-9009 instances engaging in the mating ritual.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Leading Foundation sexologists hypothesize that SCP-9009 instances are hermaphroditic. No evidence of gonchoric sexual dimorphism has been observed in captive instances. Thorough observation of the SCP-9009 mating process evidences that SCP-9009 mating pairs engage in a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_fencing\">penis-fencing</a> almost identical to the behavior of <em>Pseudobiceros hancockanus</em>, usually misidentified by civilian observers as frotting, or other alternative forms of sexual contact. Insemination subsequently occurs through traumatic insertion into the epidermis. It is notable that inseminated instances of SCP-9009 will continue to attempt penis-fencing until the conclusion of the mating event, ergo, mating events are likely to result in high degree of genetic exchange and fertility regardless of an instance's sexual fitness.</p>\n<p>SCP-9009 instances will seek out suitable nesting locations within two weeks of insemination.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup> Once a nesting location has been chosen, instances will secrete a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 substance \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>[SUBSEQUENT DATA REDACTED BY ORDER OF CRaCR COMMAND.

This is accompanied by a passive perceptual masking effect (likely memetic in nature) that causes others to perceive instances as human, and to overlook or disregard instances' abnormal behaviors and mannerisms. Easily identifiable characteristics include:\n\n* Typically resembling a middle-aged or older male.[[footnote]]Though some regional populations take on a younger appearance.[[/footnote]]\n\n* Occupations in sedentary, corporate, and/or \"white-collar\" jobs.\n\n* Preference for common bland foods (baked potatoes, green bean casserole, etc.).\n\n* Mostly coherent yet atypical speech patterns, often marked by excessive verbosity, incongruous statements and inappropriate word choice.\n\n* Unusual (but not entirely inexplicable) behaviors in public situations.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Excerpt from SCP-9009 Assessment Interview** \n\n\n\n**Dr. Matherson:** How many of you are out there?

See **Ecology** for further information.\n\n\n\nThough the existence of SCP-9009 has been known to the Foundation since its inception, due to the species' dramatic population explosion from 1975 to 2023, control of the global SCP-9009 population has been designated an Ekhi-Class priority. As a result, the Caucasian Regulation and Conservation Registry (CRaCR) has been commissioned to manage SCP-9009 and direct them in serving the Foundation's interests.\n\n\n\nThe following contextual documentation has been assembled by CRaCR.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[span class=\"divider\"]] History [[/span]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> \n\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/anatomical-drawing.webp\n\n| caption=1699 anatomical study of a SCP-9009 instance.\n\n| width=40%\n\n| align=right\n\n]]\n\n\n\n**Early Documentation:** Records of SCP-9009 have been recovered from numerous archaeological sites across Europe and the Middle East, ranging from the neolithic period to late antiquity. Early Linear B testimonies refer to SCP-9009 originating from the island of Patmos, Greece. \n\n\n\nIn the 18th century, botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published //Systema Naturae//, one of the earliest modern biological and cryptobiological classification works. In the fourth edition of the text, Linnaeus described the following five human species:\n\n* //Homo sapiens// -- baseline humans.\n\n* //Homo monstrosus// -- \"monstrous\" or abnormal humans, possibly referring to [[[SCP-1000]]].\n\n* //Homo troglodytes// -- likely referencing anomalous humanoid entities.\n\n* //Homo fata// -- referring to [[[scp-4000|native entities]]] of **##green|the woodland with a thousand names##**.\n\n* //Homo cryoformus// -- SCP-9009.\n\n\n\n**Initial Foundation Reports:** Early documents from the Admin Court[[footnote]]The administrative body of the early Foundation, predating the chartering of the O5 Council.[[/footnote]] indicate that knowledge of SCP-9009 was prevalent among the higher echelons of the early Foundation, with the species designated as a potential threat to normalcy. However, due to limited resources and manpower, little was done in the way of pursuing research or containment at the time.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"estrella-paper weathered\" style=\"mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 90%, transparent 100%);\"]]\n\n\n\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:ysa-fork/josie.svg style=\"width: 45px; margin: 10px; float: right; vertical-align: top;\"]]\n\n**Administrator F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 1908 -- Treatise on the Glaciopithecus**\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"admin\"]]\n\n\n\nThe Tundranoid species is a fascinating one.

Their gaze is void but unwavering. Their suits grow from their skin, yet are always pressed. And when confronted with disobedience, they emit a kind of guttural groan that commands deference. This effect cannot be explained by pheromones alone. It is something deeper. Perhaps a sort of psychosocial camouflage.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n= **[DATA REDACTED]**\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nFurther details are classified to CRaCR personnel\u00a0\u00a0with clearance for **Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE**.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[span class=\"divider\"]] Biology [[/span]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> \n\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/yakubrain.webp\n\n| caption=Preserved SCP-9009 brain.\n\n| width=40%\n\n| align=left\n\n]]\n\n\n\n**Anatomy and Physiology:** Extensive research has been done on SCP-9009 instances' anatomy, as their bodies are typically well-preserved upon death. Although outwardly humanoid, the internal physiology of SCP-9009 differs wildly from the mammalian baseline. Instances display nonstandard circulatory, nervous, and lymphatic systems. Deviations are often insectoid in morphology, with the notable presence of a hard-shelled exoskeleton mimicking the appearance of various styles of formal wear, double-lidded compound pupils,[[footnote]]Resulting in unusual, \"sideways\" blinking.[[/footnote]] and a circulatory and nervous system closely resembling that of the //Lasius niger//, or common garden ant. \n\n\n\nThe neuroanatomy of SCP-9009 instances is currently poorly understood. The brain lacks any cerebral folds, possibly due to the low surface area and smooth texture of the frontal and temporal lobes. Natural lesions are typically found covering the brain which periodically leech an unknown blue liquid, currently theorized to act as a retardant against neural plasticity.\n\n\n\n**Ecology:** SCP-9009's current ecological niche is that of a symbiotic or commensal partner to //Homo sapiens//.[[footnote]]Personnel are not to refer to SCP-9009 as a \"parasite.\"[[/footnote]] When in its adult form, an SCP-9009 instance will covertly enter an organization controlled by humans; if it succeeds, it will assume a leadership position, relying on its charisma to maintain its status. In circles where SCP-9009 are able to successfully integrate, they have been known to accrue vast quantities of wealth, which, according to leading theories, \"percolates\" down to //H. sapiens//, enriching them in the long run. In return, the humans working under a particular instance provide it with food, shelter, income, and valuable psychospheric input data for its elaborate mating displays. \n\n\n\nTo avoid detection by //H. sapiens// and prevent input data pollution, the vast majority of SCP-9009 instances occupy positions that minimize close contact with other humans or SCP-9009 instances, which is facilitated by their characteristic wealth. However, in contrast to their otherwise solitary nature, four times per year, a gathering of multiple SCP-9009 instances will congregate in a particular location, often alongside baseline //H. sapiens//. Observed gatherings have ranged in size from three to 535 individuals, and usually take the form of a formal meeting, such as a corporate boardroom meeting, a legal trial, a church sermon, or a legislative session. SCP-9009 instances will participate as normal, attempting to mask their idiosyncratic behaviors, stalling the meeting until all //H. sapiens// leave.\n\n\n\nOnce this occurs, the SCP-9009 instances will have sex.\n\n\n\nSCP-9009 mating rituals were once believed to last a short amount of time, as individuals in SCP-9009 gatherings were observed to finish mating with their chosen partner(s) within fifteen minutes of all //H. sapiens// leaving. However, while actual insemination of SCP-9009 instances occurs very quickly, the SCP-9009 mating ritual spans hours or potentially days.\n\n\n\nCurrent leading theories posit that quarterly SCP-9009 congregations are a form of //lekking//[[footnote]]A biological phenomenon where multiple animals form a group in which they compete for mating rights.[[/footnote]] to facilitate sexual selection. SCP-9009 instances are highly selective in their mates, and prefer to mate with individuals who are particularly skilled in human mimicry. This is why instances congregate in uncharacteristically public meetings, as this gives them an opportunity to prove to others that they can convincingly present as a human, indicating that the individual has high reproductive fitness.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a>\n\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/trump-handshake.webp\n\n|caption=Two SCP-9009 instances engaging in the mating ritual.\n\n|width=75%\n\n|align=center\n\n]]\n\n\n\n**Life Cycle:** Leading Foundation sexologists hypothesize that SCP-9009 instances are hermaphroditic. No evidence of gonchoric sexual dimorphism has been observed in captive instances. Thorough observation of the SCP-9009 mating process evidences that SCP-9009 mating pairs engage in a form of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_fencing penis-fencing] almost identical to the behavior of //Pseudobiceros hancockanus//, usually misidentified by civilian observers as frotting, or other alternative forms of sexual contact. Insemination subsequently occurs through traumatic insertion into the epidermis. It is notable that inseminated instances of SCP-9009 will continue to attempt penis-fencing until the conclusion of the mating event, ergo, mating events are likely to result in high degree of genetic exchange and fertility regardless of an instance's sexual fitness.\n\n\n\nSCP-9009 instances will seek out suitable nesting locations within two weeks of insemination.

This allowed for the strengthening of ties between the US government and the Foundation, and the procurement of extensive funds and previously unattainable political capital. \n\n\n\nIn 2001, the [[[SCP-8963|September 11 attacks]]] by agents of Al-Qaeda[[footnote]]Suspected militant Islamist front for the Chaos Insurgency.[[/footnote]] and the subsequent Manhattan Dimensional Collapse sparked nationwide panic about security and homeland defense.

Recent pushes for diversity in government, coupled with certain long-running demographic trends, have, unfortunately, resulted in more and more non-caucasians taking positions of leadership in government and industry. This, of course, runs contrary to the interests of the Foundation on several levels -- which is why Dr. Peterson is here with us today.\n\n\n\n**[SI] Dr. Peterson:** The Sociology Institute is already in the process of drafting several long-term initiatives to secure, contain, and ultimately neutralize the liberal agenda.

It's not a big exposure risk, cause they usually do it out of sight and eat the leftovers, but that means we'd basically have to reapply the spray every single month.\n\n\n\n**[FIA] Mr. Korringer:** That'd be a goddamned fiasco to spin. A president getting a spray-tan //in office//? Total media circus.\n\n\n\n**[SI] Dr. Peterson:** I agree. Too risky, from an exposure perspective.\n\n\n\n//[Sounds of shuffling paper.]//\n\n\n\n**[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:** Hold on. I'm re-reading the bio report right now, paragraph four under life cycle.

This is the purpose of the Refinement Center, in which SCP-9009 instances are surgically altered to emulate the appearance of select public figures, and trained to replicate their behavior.\n\n\n\nDue to the limited capacity of the Refinement Center, local universities' business fraternities may be used as overflow. Concerns to veil integrity in this case are minimal, due to the similarities between behavior of business fraternity members and that of insufficiently-trained SCP-9009 instances.\n\n\n\nSCP-9009 instances that enter the Refinement Center are largely taken from the Training Center; see below. As such, while most of them are suitable for conversion into public figures, the occasional defective units (approx. 50%) are sent to the Remediation Facility.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-training vanillos-section\"]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"vanillos-image\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-transition\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-quote\"]]\n\n**TRAINING CENTER**\n\nThe Training Center is the second-largest facility in VANILLOS, and serves the purpose of acclimating SCP-9009 instances to leadership in human society before they are assigned to specific roles in the Refinement Center. The vast majority of the tasks given to instances in the Training Center are under the supervision of the Foundation's Coconut.aic, drastically decreasing the need for human technicians, which would require both large salaries and extensive security clearance.\n\n\n\nTasks given to SCP-9009 instances test the human skills developed in the Spatio-Navigational Center. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Mock meetings given to instances; typically as either recorded videos to mimic video conferences, or as virtual-reality or hologram projections of humans. Meetings are largely designed to test instances' patience, and are engineered to last for several hours without pause.\n\n* Tactful Messaging Tests, in which instances are trained to send emails based on textual prompts.\n\n* The Final Test, in which an SCP-9009 instance is to, by its own accord, claim and convincingly prove to Coconut.aic that it is the leader (CEO, President, etc.) of the simulated workplace in which it has been placed. Upon completing this test, the SCP-9009 instance is automatically promoted to the Refinement Center.\n\n\n\nUltimately, approximately 10% of instances are able to reach and complete the Final Test to the satisfaction of Coconut.aic, and are subsequently sent to the Refinement Center. The remainder are dispatched to the Remediation Facility.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-spatio vanillos-section\"]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"vanillos-image\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-transition\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-quote\"]]\n\n**SPATIO-NAVIGATIONAL CENTER**\n\nThe Spatio-Navigational Center is the largest facility in VANILLOS, and is the initial testing area for newly-created SCP-9009 instances, intended to acclimatize them to human-made environments. All areas of the Spatio-Navigational Center are constantly monitored by HR.aic for SCP-9009 instances possessing confident posture, charismatic facial expressions, palatable facial structure, and high skin albedo. Instances matching these characteristics are automatically promoted to the Training Center.\n\n\n\nTo accommodate the large number of SCP-9009 instances within it, the Spatio-Navigational Center has been artificially inflated in size via introduction to [[[SCP-184]]]. Three-dimensional maps of the complex suggest that its internal volume is ten times larger than what one would expect from measuring its exterior. This has the pragmatic side effect of augmenting the facility's geometry to resemble a colossal, three-dimensional labyrinth composed of offices, cubicle spaces, break rooms, lounge areas, and other corporate environments. \n\n\n\nFeeding is accomplished with Nordomorph Nutrient Paste, a proprietary, protein-rich blend of macro- and micronutrients optimized for SCP-9009 health. This substance is deposited in troughs at unpredictable times throughout the day and is accompanied with email notification noises to condition instances to associate the sound of an email notification with food.\n\n\n\nDuring the time spent in the Spatio-Navigation Facility, instances also learn human skills, including bipedal locomotion; interacting with doors, cabinets, and elevators; tool use and fine motor skills; and eating solid food. More importantly than flawless execution of these skills is the outward appearance of competency while performing -- an instance that confidently exhibits incorrect demonstration is more favorably assessed by HR.aic than one that diffidently displays the same behavior correctly.\n\n\n\nIn the end, approximately 5% of SCP-9009 instances are of sufficient quality to be promoted to the Training Center. The remaining 95% are sent to the Remediation Facility.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-breeder vanillos-section\"]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"vanillos-image\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-transition\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-quote\"]]\n\n**CULTIVATION FACILITY**\n\nSCP-9009 instances are incubated in modified Blank-Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHRs) salvaged from [[[SCP-2000]]], enabling the facility to produce several thousand viable instances per day.[[footnote]]Note that due to the salvage of numerous critical components from the SCP-2000, including several hundred SRA and XACTS devices, the original facility is no longer functional. See Addendum 2000-1 for an official cover story.[[/footnote]] Each BZHR is capable of assembling a fully-grown SCP-9009 instance in six hours.\n\n\n\nHowever, due to the inability of BZHRs to replicate SCP-9009 biology from scratch, they first require a premature SCP-9009 egg to \"jump-start\" the process with viable DNA. As such, SCP-9009 eggs must be procured using augmented SCP-9009 natural breeding procedures. To facilitate this, several particularly successful SCP-9009 instances have been designated as breeding stock. These instances' hormones have been altered to enable them to produce large quantities of premature eggs. To maintain genetic diversity, new instances are regularly captured and introduced to inseminate VANILLOS breeding stock.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the SCP-9009 instance with the highest fecundity is SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON 'Elon Musk'. At any given moment, SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON contains between 500 and 1000 eggs in various stages of development. While its head, legs, and exoskeleton have remained the same size as they were prior to its tenure as VANILLOS breeding stock, SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON's egg load has stretched out its body cavity to nearly twenty meters in length and four meters in diameter. As such, it is to be continuously washed with moisturizing cream by VANILLOS employees to keep its skin pliable, so it does not rip or tear. Personnel are encouraged to converse with the entity about technology, economics, and politics whilst doing this, as this is known to relax its cloacal sphincter, increasing the rate of egg deposition.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-macerator vanillos-section\"]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"vanillos-image\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-transition\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-quote\"]]\n\n**REMEDIATION FACILITY**\n\nDue to the fact that the vast majority (~99.91%) of created SCP-9009 instances are not of sufficient quality for use as public figures or breeding stock, they must somehow be safely and efficiently removed, a job performed by the on-site Remediation Facility. Due to information security concerns, instances are not to be released outside of YAKUB; due to space and sanitary concerns, they cannot be hosted within VANILLOS for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\nAs such, all surplus instances are to be fed into the facility's 1000-ton industrial macerator.\n\n\n\nOnce an SCP-9009 instance passes through the macerator, the resulting slurry is then fed into a pressurized pipe, which then pumps it to an automated processing facility. From here, the raw SCP-9009 slurry is pasteurized, filtered, and fortified with nutrients to form Nordomorph Nutrient Paste, that other instances consume.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-core vanillos-section\"]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/collab:vanillos-animation\">:scp-sandbox-3:collab:vanillos-animation</a>]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"vanillos-image\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-transition\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"vanillos-quote\"]]\n\n**THERMO-IONIC CORE**\n\n\n\nThe entire VANILLOS Engine is powered by the Thermo-Ionic Core located at the base of the facility.

The primary suspension globule is enclosed in eighteen concentric, rotating rings that stabilize SCP-037's intense radiation output.\n\n\n\nWhile safety concerns have been raised about using such a potent energy source, VANILLOS engineers have confirmed that not only is the Thermo-Ionic Core completely renewable, but has a far lower casualty rate than mundane sources of power; the only deaths so far have been from handling mishaps. With the enormous power output of the Thermo-Ionic Core, constant power can be supplied to the energy-intensive facilities of the VANILLOS engine, including the numerous BZHR units, hundreds of kilometers of cutting-edge plumbing, and the 1 kiloton macerator.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"normalwidth\"]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[span class=\"divider\"]] SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV [[/span]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOn 2014-03-12, following 816 days and 1,255 successive generations of continuous selective breeding, the VANILLOS Engine produced seven operational instances of SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV.

Sustained aerial campaigns and strategic deployment of counter-terrorist forces enabled the Foundation to destroy Insurgency forces in Yemen, Syria, and Libya, with pro-Insurgency dictators toppled to cripple the terrorist group's paramilitary network. By 2016, the Insurgency's operational capacity in the Middle East reduced by 47%.\n\n\n\nThe remaining six instances of SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV were recycled back into the VANILLOS Engine, allowing the creation of SCP-9009 instances of variable coloration and racial phenotypes.

To ensure that such a candidate would succeed in the election against an opponent with less favorable views but greater popularity, Mr. Yarvin drafted a joint plan with the Memetics Department, Public Information Bureau, and Intelligence Agency to systematically alter the result of the 2016 US presidential election. This plan was ratified by the heads and directorate boards of all three departments, and by the YAKUB Directorate, with steps preemptively taken to initiate it.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a 12-1 vote, the O5 Council decided against any and all tampering with 2016 US presidential electoral votes.

However, Mr. Yarvin maintains that these losses are not only minor in comparison to the gains precipitated by .HAPPY-ACCIDENT, but have several understated benefits of their own.\n\n\n\nWith the 2020 presidential election approaching in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, CRaCR Command's executive cabinet suffered an unprecedented schism with regards to continued operation of .HAPPY-ACCIDENT. The pro-.HAPPY-ACCIDENT faction, headed by Chairman C. Yarvin, pointed to the manifold benefits the Foundation had accrued during the administration of .HAPPY-ACCIDENT, advocating for a Foundation-sponsored second term, whereas the anti-.HAPPY-ACCIDENT faction, headed by Dr. N. Taylor, dissented, citing the mismanagement of COVID pandemic response and general uptick in social unrest as growing threats to the primary missions of the Foundation.\n\n\n\nThe decision was ultimately deferred upward to O5 Command, who issued the following statement:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote doc\"]]\n\n\n\n= [[image https://i.imgur.com/Q2TCZnd_d.webp width=\"100px\"]]\n\n\n\nIn light of recent considerations, it would be prudent to recalibrate this approach toward one that is both more measurable and grounded in practical realities.

Biden,\" former deputy of .OREO-UCAV, was chosen as YAKUB's premier presidential nominee, as a more moderate alternative to the incautious aggression of the .HAPPY-ACCIDENT presidency. .WET-CARDBOARD was inserted into the presidential race as the Democratic nominee, running against .HAPPY-ACCIDENT. Once again, the executive decision was made to avoid interfering with election results, in order to facilitate the democratic process.\n\n\n\nInconveniently, .WET-CARDBOARD had been retired since 2017, due to accrued cognitive decay. Specialized teams were dispatched to the Site-98 storage morgue to restore the instance using [[[SCP-427]]]. However, due to unforseen interactions between SCP-427 and SCP-9009 biology, .WET-CARDBOARD retained significantly decreased cognitive faculties following revival.[[footnote]]Research into what cognitive faculties (if any) existed prior is ongoing.[[/footnote]] Despite this impairment, .WET-CARDBOARD secured the presidency in 2020 November, defeating .HAPPY-ACCIDENT. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/biden-sunglasses.webp\n\n| caption=SCP-9009.WET-CARDBOARD's stylish, marketable aviator sunglasses hide its hexagonal compound eyes.\n\n| width=75%\n\n| align=center\n\n]]\n\n\n\n.WET-CARDBOARD's platform was characteristic of SCP-9009 instances: middling, noncommittal, and ultimately futile; providing a refreshing return to the balance of normalcy. The instance was responsible for enacting numerous relief programs for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 1,400 USD stimulus checks to citizens, 300 USD weekly relief for the unemployed, and a 17 billion USD thank-you donation to SynCore Pharmaceuticals Inc. .WET-CARDBOARD additionally oversaw the successful restoration of the nation's GDP, with the aggregate statistics successfully distracting public opinion from increasing income disparity. Pandemic quarantine restrictions were ultimately lifted by the end of the year due to waning popular interest and a measured absence of consequences on the stock market.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an initiative began to create a forked model of SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON \"Elon Musk,\" due to the instance's high fecundity and superior genetics (See **Cultivation Facility**). After the design was finalized and a cover story engineered, SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON.v1 was released to the public with 150 billion USD in assets and funds,[[footnote]]Primarily financed by the Ethereum mining software built into SCiPNet.[[/footnote]] catapulting the instance to the rank of richest hominid alive. However, it quickly became evident that further development was necessary, after .ROCKET-SURGEON.v1 expired in a tragic and unforseen accident.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/roadster.webp\n\n| caption=SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON.v1 forgets to exit its 2008 Tesla Roadster prior to being launched into orbit.\n\n| width=85%\n\n| align=center\n\n]]\n\n\n\nIn August of 2021, evidence surfaced that the SCP Foundation's doctrine of worldwide containment was, in part, contributing to [[[SCP-6500]]] -- a Finis-class event resulting in the mass extinction of anomalous phenomena worldwide. Several internal publishers independently found that the event was being severely exacerbated by the mass proliferation of SCP-9009, due to the species' passive release of dethaumahexane from instances' anuses, as well as their ecological niche as invasive opportunivores.\n\n\n\nHowever, officials from the Sociology Institute stressed the importance of caution in response, citing the lack of scientific consensus supporting Foundation containment as a primary cause of SCP-6500. Ultimately, in November, O5 Command voted to preserve the tradition of containment, with goals set to reduce the anomalous extinction rate by 2030. By Q1 of 2022, the baseline anomalous extinction rate was three times that of pre-industrial levels. Inspectors from YAKUB determined that this was within acceptable margins.\n\n\n\nDue to this careful vigilance being percieved as criminal institutional negligence, the Global Occult Coalition's Council of 108 convened on Feburary 17th, 2022 to discuss the escalation of global hostilities with the SCP Foundation. In response, the O5 Council authorized the YAKUB Directorate to proceed with Operation FALLING DAGGER.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"--accentColor: rgb(0, 85, 189);\"]]\n\n= [[size 120%]] **Operation FALLING DAGGER** [[/size]]\n\n= **YAKUB Sub-Project #1937**\n\n\n\nDue to the impending aggressive action by the GOC towards the Foundation, one of YAKUB's primary agendas was to strategically integrate SCP-9009 instances into the GOC's core leadership organs:\n\n* The **Council of 108,** consisting of secret organizations around the world, comprises the legislative body of the GOC and has parliamentary oversight over the agency's functions. However, only five member organizations of the Council of 108 possess absolute veto power: The Illuminati, Knights Templar, ICSUT, Church of Satan, and Silicon Nornir. SCP-9009 instances were covertly inserted successfully into the diplomatic and leadership bodies of these organizations; as such, these organizations' representation in the GOC Assembly was handled entirely by SCP-9009. This allowed for all resolutions to be halted unless compliant with the directive of YAKUB.\n\n* The Undersecretariat, more commonly known as **High Command,** possesses executive power over the entire agency, yet is ultimately dependent on a small number of key administrators. The Council of 108 impeached the existing bureaucrats in these positions, before appointing SCP-9009 instances to all of them. \n\n* The **International Court for the Paranormal** determines and interprets what is lawful according to its International Paralaw Codex. A Foundation-sponsored external review determined that the Codex was flawed in numerous facets; as such, it was revised by the Council of 108 to align more closely with the GOC's missions of Survival, Concealment, and Protection. YAKUB confirmed new, forward-thinking justices, following the previous ICP justices' deaths, retirements, or imprisonments.\n\n\n\nAt the 2023 Assembly of the GOC, the Council of 108 resolved to pursue more progressive immigration policies into European free ports. Over the next quarter, over 730,000 SCP-9009 instances were naturalized into European states, accounting for 92% of immigration quotas across the continent.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n| name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:ysa-biden/eurtec.webp\n\n| caption=The city of Eurtec, home to 1.8 million residents; of which 17.2% are SCP-9009 instances.\n\n| width=90%\n\n| align=center\n\n]]\n\n\n\nThe Global Occult Coalition has been consequently reclassified as an asset of the SCP Foundation.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote news-log fancy-log\"]]\n\nIn the wake of the Titan Submersible disaster, replacement OceanGate CEO SCP-9009-75628 constructs a new, identical submersible in a gambit to enter the euthanasia business.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote news-log fancy-log\"]]\n\nIn a bid to 'get back at the pedo guy', SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON.v7 unintentionally self-terminates 1.1km below sea level via failure of the Titan v2 Submersible's Styrofoam hull.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nOn July 12th, 2023, Foundation counter-terrorism MTF Nu-7 executed a raid on the Chaos Insurgency's Y-Firebase, a subterranean compound recently discovered underneath Site-19. [[footnote]] Initial forensic evidence demonstrated that the structure had been inhabited for at least seventy-five years prior to the raid.[[/footnote]]The compound held the terrorist organization's remaining forces. After a brief firefight, the 'Engineer'[[footnote]]The code name used by the chief military and intelligence officer of the Chaos Insurgency.[[/footnote]] was discovered by Xi-13 agents in the Delta Command war room. [[footnote]] The individual was reportedly identified as such due to his oversized swivel chair and general body odor.[[/footnote]] The Engineer was then shot and killed, and Y-Firebase seized; marking the end of the Foundation's campaign against paraterror. Development of a replacement SCP-9009 instance is underway -- see [# Project Honeypot] for more details.\n\n\n\nHowever, forensic pathologists at Site-11 determined that on the Engineer's person were at least 26 dead-man's switches, each rigged to launch a cyberattack on critical Foundation data backups running on easily exploited legacy software. Before RAISA cybersecurity specialists could respond to the breach, at least 1.5 TB of data was leaked, including confidential information on the YAKUB Project and associated SCP-9009 documentation. Despite the best efforts of the Public Information Bureau implementing Cover Story 173a (\"speculative creative fiction\"), the leaks were able to spread widely enough among conspiracy theorist circles that mass amnesticization was considered infeasible.\n\n\n\nImmediately following the initial notifications of attack, a Foundation-wide emergency was instated, warning all personnel of a potential LV-1 'Partial Lifted Veil' scenario, and an emergency session of O5 Command was convened to discuss the possible activation of the Ganymede Protocol, as well as activating Foundation first-strike nuclear submarines.\n\n\n\nBelow is a representative example of the popular discourse surrounding the data breach.\n\n\n\n[[module css]]\n\n\n\n/* https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6599 */\n\n/* REDDIT */\n\n.reddit-post{\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0margin: .43em;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0padding: 0 .85em;\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0background-color: #fcfcfb;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0color: black;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0border: 1px solid #b5b3ac;\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0font-family: verdana,arial,sans-serif;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0overflow: hidden;\n\n}\n\n\n\n.reddit-container {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0color: black;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0background-color: white;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0padding: 20px;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0border: 1px solid black;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0margin: 0 20px;\n\n}\n\n\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"reddit-container\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"reddit-post\" style=\"margin-left: 3em;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"color: #551a8b; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 1px;\"]]What's this \"SCP Foundation\" thing everyone's talking about?[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"]] ##888|submitted 5 months ago by## ##369|pedigreepeeler34##[[/span]]\n\nI swear I've been seeing memes about this \"SCP Foundation\" and \"SCP-9009\" and all this crap all over the internet but no lamestream news outlet seems to be covering it.
