concern,</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> you found this message. Congratulations. Consider its contents your reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong> A long, long time ago, the O5 Council, alongside myself, attempted to create an alert system for humanity to battle an ongoing XK Event.</p>\n<p>With the help of all of the Thaumiels we could gather, we created a machine. A machine that could gather information from all possible realities and calculate the probabilities of specific people dying; \"The All-seeing Eye\", we called it. With it, we were able to make ourselves virtually immortal. We knew what would kill us and how to avoid it. But that wasn't enough. Nothing was ever enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> We found the resolution to the biggest problem we could have, and actually have, ever faced. We implanted an alert system within all humans using the device and we concealed it with a meme that made everyone think it was natural. In the process, however, we killed them all.</p>\n<p>Everyone.</p>\n<p>If you have any sense within you, you should now be asking how this could possibly make sense. If we killed everyone, then who was left to protect? You see, we murdered everyone else. Fourteen dimensions, each wiped out by one of us. We murdered all those people and studied their deaths with the machine, creating a pattern map of what could potentially happen in the process. Yes, it was the worst thing we had ever done. Hell, it was the worst thing anyone could have ever done. Except, we failed. You see, the alerting system was flawed. We realized this once we had already implemented it within everyone. It didn't work. Sure, it fired once in a while, but almost never at the proper time.</p>\n<p>You see, the implementation of the system was designed to literally put the dead souls of those people into the minds of the population of our world. The hope was that they would know how they could possibly die and trigger an alert to avoid dying. Of course, as I said, that didn't work. But not because of us; it was due to the many people we had sacrificed. You see, we hadn\u2019t considered that they might retain any of their intentionality and that they might not be satisfied with being a piece in the survival of humanity or ourselves. But then they tried to take control back from us. We tried to stop them, of course, but we failed.</p>\n<p>So we all forgot.</p>\n<p>We wiped every memory out, over, and over, and over, and over, in the result slowing down the potential mass genocide they had planned for us.</p>\n<p>But even then, we were immortal. We knew about it, no matter how hard we tried. That was a part of a pact we made a long time ago; we had to live with our sins. So we deleted our minds, wiping everything about ourselves from the world. Thirteen Overseers gone, through means I can't even remember.</p>\n<p>Except myself. I never forgot.</p>\n<p>And I'm here to make you remember.</p>\n<p>Wake up, O5-12.</p>\n<p>Remember what we did.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span

Though the effects of SCP-0000-ARC have been found to be antimemetic, assuring individuals affected by it that its existence is a natural one, a total of fourteen individuals - the O5 Council and Paul Verlaine -- have been found to be resilient to this effect.\n\n\n\nIndividuals affected by SCP-0000-ARC have been found to repeatedly fall off synchronization with local reality, causing them to inevitably lose control of their bodies, totally collapsing their consciousnesses. Though only a total of 1% of individuals suffering from the SCP-0000-ARC phenomenon have perished because of it, based on the past growth rate it has been calculated that in three generations time, the entire population of Earth will most likely become eliminated due to it.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 0000-1:** [FATAL DATA ERROR] IT WAS A LIeEE3\n\n\n\n[PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CLOSES T RA I SA\u00a0\u00a0OFFICE TO R3COLLECT D4T\u00a0\u00a0A] W3 FAILED | 1T DO3SNT WORK\n\n\n\n[CRITICAL DATABASE ERROR] ALL TH0SE D3ATH5 F0R N.THI1NgG\n\n\n\nIT DOESNT WORK\n\n\n\nTHE 5Y5TEM DOESNT WORK\n\n\n\nTHEeyyy ARE fR3Eee e ///@@#Z$}{PKT!@\n\n\n\n\n\n|*&^%# THEY REBELLED|&&^$\n\n\n\n\n\n|OUR MINDS C00RUPTED *%#@}}}\n\n\n\nerase\n\n\n\nerase all\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nerase the minds erase the sins\n\n\n\n[CRITICAL DATABASE ERROR.

Congratulations. Consider its contents your reward.\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures** A long, long time ago, the O5 Council, alongside myself, attempted to create an alert system for humanity to battle an ongoing XK Event. \n\n\n\nWith the help of all of the Thaumiels we could gather, we created a machine. A machine that could gather information from all possible realities and calculate the probabilities of specific people dying; \"The All-seeing Eye\", we called it. With it, we were able to make ourselves virtually immortal. We knew what would kill us and how to avoid it. But that wasn't enough. Nothing was ever enough.\n\n\n\n**Description:** We found the resolution to the biggest problem we could have, and actually have, ever faced. We implanted an alert system within all humans using the device and we concealed it with a meme that made everyone think it was natural. In the process, however, we killed them all. \n\n\n\nEveryone. \n\n\n\nIf you have any sense within you, you should now be asking how this could possibly make sense. If we killed everyone, then who was left to protect? You see, we murdered everyone else. Fourteen dimensions, each wiped out by one of us. We murdered all those people and studied their deaths with the machine, creating a pattern map of what could potentially happen in the process. Yes, it was the worst thing we had ever done. Hell, it was the worst thing anyone could have ever done. Except, we failed. You see, the alerting system was flawed. We realized this once we had already implemented it within everyone. It didn't work. Sure, it fired once in a while, but almost never at the proper time.\n\n\n\nYou see, the implementation of the system was designed to literally put the dead souls of those people into the minds of the population of our world. The hope was that they would know how they could possibly die and trigger an alert to avoid dying. Of course, as I said, that didn't work. But not because of us; it was due to the many people we had sacrificed. You see, we hadn\u2019t considered that they might retain any of their intentionality and that they might not be satisfied with being a piece in the survival of humanity or ourselves. But then they tried to take control back from us. We tried to stop them, of course, but we failed.\n\n\n\nSo we all forgot.\n\n\n\nWe wiped every memory out, over, and over, and over, and over, in the result slowing down the potential mass genocide they had planned for us.\n\n\n\nBut even then, we were immortal.

This application of a multi-layer perceptron as an effective predictive model was only made possible by an advanced backpropagation algorithm developed by several ex-employees of Prometheus Labs (acquired by the Foundation's Department of Analytics in 1951).</p>\n<p>In 1959, it was hypothesized that SCP-001 could be used to assist in augmenting containment procedures for Euclid- and Keter-class anomalies via the production of predictive text. SCP-001 was trained with a dataset containing drafts for several thousand containment procedures (both previous and current iterations), which were weighted on the basis of their performance (particularly in how well they performed in comparison to their predecessors). When adopted, revisions to containment procedures \"suggested\" by SCP-001 consistently reduce the rate of breaches not only for the anomalies to which they apply, but for numerous unrelated anomalies.

Four or more IntSCPFN[[footnote]]The International SCP Foundation Network is a global network intended to provide synchronized information regarding Foundation containment procedures across all sites, areas, and countries.[[/footnote]] technicians are to be available on-site to provide technical support and perform daily maintenance on all wireless transmission components connected to SCP-001. All major Foundation areas, sites, and administration buildings are to maintain a minimum of two teleprinters connected to the IntSCPFN network for the dissemination of emergency bulletins and/or instructions regarding the prevention of containment breaches. Under no circumstances is SCP-001 to be deactivated or otherwise disconnected from IntSCPFN servers.\n\n\n\nPredictive anomaly reports produced by SCP-001 are to be forwarded to RAISA for analysis and review. A Level-4 RAISA officer is to be assigned to each report; this officer is to be responsible for evaluating the immediate threat presented by the predicted anomaly, producing a credible cover story to explain its discovery by the Foundation, and assigning a Containment Director[[footnote]]Containment Directors are part of the Containment Command System (CCS); a chain-of-command model for first contact with an anomaly. It was established in 1945 as a structured hierarchy for multiple agencies (both internal and external to the Foundation) to coordinate the safe recovery and containment of an anomaly.[[/footnote]] to investigate, devise, and execute a containment strategy. All containment procedures suggested or produced by SCP-001 must receive approval from the majority of the O5 council.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is the ERZATZ Type AK9 Computational Engine[[footnote]]The ERZATZ Type AK9 Computation Engine is a digital, general-purpose computer with Turing-complete specifications.[[/footnote]] constructed by the Foundation in 1955. It was built to provide predictive analysis regarding the location and properties of undiscovered anomalies. It accomplishes this via use of a multi-layer perceptron[[footnote]]A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a 'feed-forward' computation system consisting of three or more layers of nodes: an input (or 'top') layer, one or more hidden (or 'middle') layers, and an output (or 'bottom') layer. The nodes of each layer are connected to all nodes on the layer below via directed edges. The perceptron accepts a value in its input layer, then directs and transforms this value as it traverses each successive layer until it produces an output.[[/footnote]] relying upon training datasets derived from the location and properties of previous anomalies. This application of a multi-layer perceptron as an effective predictive model was only made possible by an advanced backpropagation algorithm developed by several ex-employees of Prometheus Labs (acquired by the Foundation's Department of Analytics in 1951). \n\n\n\nIn 1959, it was hypothesized that SCP-001 could be used to assist in augmenting containment procedures for Euclid- and Keter-class anomalies via the production of predictive text. SCP-001 was trained with a dataset containing drafts for several thousand containment procedures (both previous and current iterations), which were weighted on the basis of their performance (particularly in how well they performed in comparison to their predecessors). When adopted, revisions to containment procedures \"suggested\" by SCP-001 consistently reduce the rate of breaches not only for the anomalies to which they apply, but for numerous unrelated anomalies. In many cases, these revisions have also resulted in the cessation of anomalous behavior.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001.1:** Documentation\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/SCP_icon%281%29.png) top right no-repeat; color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n315D27\n\n= __ERZATZ PROPOSAL SUMMARY__\n\n\n\nINPUT:\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@[[[SCP-1773]]]'s containment procedures.\n\n\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@\"Once per second week dust may be placed in the middle of them to donate more beautiful functions of the hallway.\"\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL:\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@\"Amend SCP-1773's containment procedures to include the placement of ten grams of dust in its container every two weeks.\" (O5-01)\n\n\n\n= COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n||~ YEA\u00a0\u00a0||~ NAY\u00a0\u00a0||~ ABSTAIN ||\n\n|| O5-01 || O5-02 || O5-03\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-04 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|| O5-13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-05 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-06 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-07 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-08 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-09 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-10 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-11 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-12 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ STATUS ||\n\n|| ##057800|APPROVED## ||\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@No changes were noted in SCP-1773's behavior or properties.

Instances are composed of intersecting metal tubes, forming a lattice with large hexagonal gaps, and range in area from ~4km<sup>2</sup> to ~20km<sup>2</sup>. The tubes are comprised of a carbon nanotube interior and an inconel<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> exterior.</p>\n<p>It has been hypothesized that SCP-002-EX instances were the components of a spherical interstellar-scale megastructure, enclosing the Oort cloud and solar system. All instances, in their current orbital positions, form a roughly spherical distribution around the outer Oort Cloud, and several groups of instances are connected together by complex locking mechanisms. Each locking mechanism has an illustration of a hexagonally tiled sphere on it. The points of breakage on the objects suggest they were cut apart, though the manner by which this was performed is undetermined.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, such a megastructure would likely be broken due to gravitational effects, which carbon nanotubes are not strong enough to counter. The material needed to construct such a structure also greatly exceeds the amount of resources present in the solar system and the surrounding interstellar region. The function instances would serve is unclear as well. Even if the objects were only parts of a smaller megastructure, the inconel exterior is functionless in the low pressure and temperature of the Oort cloud, and the hexagonal gaps prevent SCP-002-EX from being used as walls or shields.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the structures do not match the designs of any spacefaring civilization known to have existed in the solar system prior to modern human civilization. This includes Species of Interest SoI-002,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Venusians, and <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">progenitor <em>\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</em> groups</span> (<em>Inconclusive \u2014 refer to Addendum.3</em>).</p>\n<p>No anomalous properties have been observed to date. An investigation into the objects' potentially anomalous origins was launched by the O5 Council, leading to the Explained classification decision. Further information requires Level 5 clearance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"h-span\"><strong>Addendum.1 \u2014 13/Nov/2034:</strong></span> SCP-002-24-EX was discovered a kilometer underneath the surface of Sedna, artificially buried. Broken pieces of durable glass-like panels are present in the hexagonal gaps, found to have been heated to extreme temperatures and melted. Broken missile silos and laser weaponry are connected to the tubes.</p>\n<p>Several large rocket engines had been attached to the instance by means of a claw grasping mechanism, and had all exhausted their fuel supplies. While the rocket engine designs are unorthodox, no anomalous properties have been observed.

Standard disinformation and amnesticization protocols will be followed in the event astronomers discover instances.\n\n\n\nBy order of O5 Command, the objects have been classified as Explained.\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]**Description:**[[/span]] SCP-002-EX designates 23 large metallic structures in the outer Oort Cloud,[[footnote]]A cloud of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun at distances ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 light-years, located in interstellar space.[[/footnote]] hypothesized to have been part of a megastructure of unknown size. Instances are composed of intersecting metal tubes, forming a lattice with large hexagonal gaps, and range in area from ~4km^^2^^ to ~20km^^2^^. The tubes are comprised of a carbon nanotube interior and an inconel[[footnote]]A superalloy used for handling high pressure and high heat environments.[[/footnote]] exterior.\n\n\n\nIt has been hypothesized that SCP-002-EX instances were the components of a spherical interstellar-scale megastructure, enclosing the Oort cloud and solar system. All instances, in their current orbital positions, form a roughly spherical distribution around the outer Oort Cloud, and several groups of instances are connected together by complex locking mechanisms. Each locking mechanism has an illustration of a hexagonally tiled sphere on it. The points of breakage on the objects suggest they were cut apart, though the manner by which this was performed is undetermined.[[footnote]]The only other damage present is that from micrometeorite impacts.[[/footnote]] \n\n\n\nHowever, such a megastructure would likely be broken due to gravitational effects, which carbon nanotubes are not strong enough to counter. The material needed to construct such a structure also greatly exceeds the amount of resources present in the solar system and the surrounding interstellar region. The function instances would serve is unclear as well. Even if the objects were only parts of a smaller megastructure, the inconel exterior is functionless in the low pressure and temperature of the Oort cloud, and the hexagonal gaps prevent SCP-002-EX from being used as walls or shields.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the structures do not match the designs of any spacefaring civilization known to have existed in the solar system prior to modern human civilization. This includes Species of Interest SoI-002,[[footnote]]An extrasolar species that attempted to colonize the solar system ~700 million years ago. Responsible for [[[SCP-2651]]] and [[[SCP-4431]]].[[/footnote]] Venusians, and --progenitor //\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588// groups-- (//Inconclusive -- refer to Addendum.3//).\n\n\n\nNo anomalous properties have been observed to date. An investigation into the objects' potentially anomalous origins was launched by the O5 Council, leading to the Explained classification decision. Further information requires Level 5 clearance.\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]**Addendum.1 -- 13/Nov/2034:**[[/span]] SCP-002-24-EX was discovered a kilometer underneath the surface of Sedna, artificially buried. Broken pieces of durable glass-like panels are present in the hexagonal gaps, found to have been heated to extreme temperatures and melted. Broken missile silos and laser weaponry are connected to the tubes.\n\n\n\nSeveral large rocket engines had been attached to the instance by means of a claw grasping mechanism, and had all exhausted their fuel supplies. While the rocket engine designs are unorthodox, no anomalous properties have been observed. Symbols of a spear piercing a hexagonal plate are engraved on each engine.\n\n\n\nSeveral days later, SCP-002-25-EX was spotted by an outer Oort cloud exploratory probe. Rocket engines of the same design were attached, each of which had experienced a mechanical failure that left the claws attached to the instance. One unattached engine was found nearby in the same orbit.\n\n\n\nThe possibility that SCP-002-EX instances were relocated from their original positions into orbits in the Oort Cloud is under consideration.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: #ccc; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#192845 url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #ffb961; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n\n\n= __O5 COUNCIL PROPOSAL SUMMARY__\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL:\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@\"Maintain the Explained classification of SCP-002-EX following the discovery of SCP-002-24-EX and SCP-002-25-EX.\" (O5-07)\n\n\n\n= COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n||~ YEA\u00a0\u00a0||~ NAY\u00a0\u00a0||~ ABSTAIN ||\n\n|| O5-01 || O5-02 || O5-06 ||\n\n|| O5-03 || O5-08 || O5-04 ||\n\n|| O5-05 || O5-11 || O5-13 ||\n\n|| O5-07 || O5-12 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-09 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| O5-10 ||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ STATUS ||\n\n|| ##07b800|APPROVED## ||\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]**Addendum.2 -- 28/Feb/2035:**[[/span]] SCP-002-26-EX was discovered 5km beneath Sterkfontein in South Africa.

On the night preceding the project's disbandment, where three Foundation lives were lost in an unrelated incident, Dr Richardson remarked in his personal journal <em>\"they know we can see them\"</em>.</p>\n<p>Richardson was placed on paid leave and his documentation was put on hold for review. Two days later, Dr Richardson's neighborhood experienced a power outage. He dialed the site's emergency response number, but was not present on the other end of the line when the call connected. Within minutes, local police were called over the sounds of struggle coming from the home. Agent Justine Locke is dispatched to investigate.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>VIDEO LOG</strong></p>\n<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>\n<p>The bodycam activates as Agent Locke exits her vehicle. Emergency lights are present throughout the neighborhood, as public servants attend to inconsequential crisis that have arisen during the blackout. As she crosses the street, a squad car rounds the corner, lights activated, and stops in front of the house. Locke introduces herself with her federal credentials. The officer exits his vehicle and identifies himself as Tayn Errly, and explains he is responding to a possible domestic dispute. The pair approach the stairs leading to the front door.</p>\n<p>Crunching glass is heard. Looking down, a pair of spectacles can be seen underfoot before the bottommost step. Locke takes point. Errly follows her up the stairs.</p>\n<p>The curtains are drawn; and with the exception of the flickering of a flashlight coming from a room on the second floor, the house is dark. Locke rings the doorbell, and Errly loudly declares their presence. They receive no response. Upon knocking, it becomes apparent that the front door is slightly ajar. The pair enter. Errly draws his weapon.</p>\n<p>Turning on her flashlight, Locke reveals a living room in mild disarray. The sofa is notably crooked, with the far end being forcibly shoved aside toward a door to the rear of the room, leading to the kitchen. A glass table that had presumably sat center of the room had been wholly upended and cast aside, shattered. The recliner sitting opposite the couch lay on its back near the front door. In addition, there appeared to have been an attempt to set the home ablaze. A blackened trail of burnt carpet-fiber streaked through the destruction \u2014 beginning at the front door and leading towards the stairway leading upstairs to their right.</p>\n<p>It is as Locke kneels to investigate this trail when a woman's sobbing can be heard from above.</p>\n<p>The two cautiously approach the stairway. Errly identifies himself again as a police officer, eliciting no response from the woman. They ascend the first few stairs leading to the landing, stepping over the fractured, burnt remains of a cellphone.</p>\n<p>It becomes apparent as they climb that the sobbing is emanating from a room near the end of the hall. The door is ajar. Locke and Errly advance at a crawl. There is a loud, inhuman groaning, and the sobs rapidly turn to frenzied shrieks. The pair quicken their approach. The screams cut off just as Locke extends a hand and carefully opens the door.</p>\n<p>It is the Richardsons' bedroom. It is largely undisturbed, unlike the damage witnessed downstairs, save for the mess of sheets on the mattress. A large comforter, bundled tightly, lay hanging off the foot of the bed, twisting around and trailing the floor underneath.</p>\n<p>A full canvas of the home revealed that neither Dr Richardson nor his wife were present.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[END LOG]</p>\n</div>\n<p>The following is a list of collected evidence from the residence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One pair of reading glasses belonging to Dr. Richardson (crushed)</li>\n<li>Four cubic centimeters of burnt carpet \u2014 no chemical markers could be found to indicate fuel type</li>\n<li>One personal cellphone (burnt and destroyed) \u2014 verified to have made the emergency call</li>\n<li>One floral comforter \u2014 the bottom of which was shredded and wet with an unidentified clear fluid</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-012-ex\">SCP-012-EX</a>\" by S D Locke, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

During one observation, an SCP-012 manifestation stretched its limbs to brace itself between two opposing walls, staying well above its target's line-of-sight as it stalked her in her home.\"//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-012-ex/stairs.jpg|caption=--Original testing chamber.-- Unrelated photograph.|width=300px]]\n\n\n\nThe project was forcibly disbanded by the Site Director following several complaints from the participating D-Class subjects, who each voluntarily left the project due to stress caused by Dr. Richardson's mental state as he developed a debilitating fear of the dark. On the night preceding the project's disbandment, where three Foundation lives were lost in an unrelated incident, Dr Richardson remarked in his personal journal //\"they know we can see them\"//.\n\n\n\nRichardson was placed on paid leave and his documentation was put on hold for review. Two days later, Dr Richardson's neighborhood experienced a power outage. He dialed the site's emergency response number, but was not present on the other end of the line when the call connected. Within minutes, local police were called over the sounds of struggle coming from the home. Agent Justine Locke is dispatched to investigate.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\nThe bodycam activates as Agent Locke exits her vehicle. Emergency lights are present throughout the neighborhood, as public servants attend to inconsequential crisis that have arisen during the blackout. As she crosses the street, a squad car rounds the corner, lights activated, and stops in front of the house. Locke introduces herself with her federal credentials. The officer exits his vehicle and identifies himself as Tayn Errly, and explains he is responding to a possible domestic dispute. The pair approach the stairs leading to the front door. \n\n\n\nCrunching glass is heard. Looking down, a pair of spectacles can be seen underfoot before the bottommost step. Locke takes point. Errly follows her up the stairs.\n\n\n\nThe curtains are drawn; and with the exception of the flickering of a flashlight coming from a room on the second floor, the house is dark. Locke rings the doorbell, and Errly loudly declares their presence. They receive no response. Upon knocking, it becomes apparent that the front door is slightly ajar. The pair enter. Errly draws his weapon.\n\n\n\nTurning on her flashlight, Locke reveals a living room in mild disarray. The sofa is notably crooked, with the far end being forcibly shoved aside toward a door to the rear of the room, leading to the kitchen. A glass table that had presumably sat center of the room had been wholly upended and cast aside, shattered. The recliner sitting opposite the couch lay on its back near the front door. In addition, there appeared to have been an attempt to set the home ablaze. A blackened trail of burnt carpet-fiber streaked through the destruction -- beginning at the front door and leading towards the stairway leading upstairs to their right.\n\n\n\nIt is as Locke kneels to investigate this trail when a woman's sobbing can be heard from above.\n\n\n\nThe two cautiously approach the stairway. Errly identifies himself again as a police officer, eliciting no response from the woman. They ascend the first few stairs leading to the landing, stepping over the fractured, burnt remains of a cellphone. \n\n\n\nIt becomes apparent as they climb that the sobbing is emanating from a room near the end of the hall. The door is ajar. Locke and Errly advance at a crawl. There is a loud, inhuman groaning, and the sobs rapidly turn to frenzied shrieks. The pair quicken their approach. The screams cut off just as Locke extends a hand and carefully opens the door.\n\n\n\nIt is the Richardsons' bedroom. It is largely undisturbed, unlike the damage witnessed downstairs, save for the mess of sheets on the mattress. A large comforter, bundled tightly, lay hanging off the foot of the bed, twisting around and trailing the floor underneath.\n\n\n\nA full canvas of the home revealed that neither Dr Richardson nor his wife were present.\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of collected evidence from the residence:\n\n\n\n* One pair of reading glasses belonging to Dr. Richardson (crushed)\n\n* Four cubic centimeters of burnt carpet -- no chemical markers could be found to indicate fuel type\n\n* One personal cellphone (burnt and destroyed) -- verified to have made the emergency call\n\n* One floral comforter -- the bottom of which was shredded and wet with an unidentified clear fluid\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** bedroom.png\n\n> **Name:** untitled\n\n> **Author:** goatling\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/mmmchoco/2104528751 Flickr]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** stairs.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Escaleras a\n\n> **Author:** George Hodan\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/es/view-image.php?image=190201&picture=escaleras-a PublicDomainPictures.net]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-012-EX", "scp_number": 12, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "explained", "hostile", "humanoid", "knowledge", "meta", "nocturnal", "observational", "scp", "shadow", "species", "uncontained"], "title": "SCP-012-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-012-ex"}, "SCP-067-EX": {"created_at": "2016-11-03T03:20:00", "creator": "Eekium", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Eekium", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/eekium", "comment": "", "date": "2016-11-03T03:20:00"}, {"author": "Eekium", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/eekium", "comment": "", "date": "2016-11-03T03:21:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "touchup", "date": "2016-11-03T13:36:00"}, {"author": "RJB_R", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rjb-r", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-ex\".", "date": "2016-11-04T14:03:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: building, euclid, explained, fungus, hallucination, radioactive, scp.

The building has a total of 16 rooms and is in fairly good condition. From the exterior, SCP-067 appears (and has been described to be) completely typical for the architecture of Bristol, ME.</p>\n<p>The entirety of the inside of SCP-067 is covered with \u2014 and inhabited by \u2014 roughly 11,200 species of fungi. While several of these fungi have yet to be identified, the majority are known species. Fungi within SCP-067 have shown the ability to move and grow almost instantaneously, and often tend to do so in tandem with each other. Several forms of toxic molds have been discovered within the building, though the danger this poses to the health of personnel is minimal, and well within acceptable limits.</p>\n<p>Multiple species of animals \u2014 ranging from deer, to pigs, to squirrels, to birds, etc. \u2014 have been noted to inhabit SCP-067. Animals bear tumorous growths and fungal infections on the majority of their bodies, and have occasionally been observed walking upright while wearing formal clothing. These entities have been collectively designated SCP-067-1. SCP-067-1 appear to act as the caretakers of the inn, and will often greet guests<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, provide them meals, and show them to a bedroom.</p>\n<p>Due to currently unknown factors, both video cameras and audio recording devices do not function properly within SCP-067. As such, all research regarding the anomaly is conducted in person.</p>\n<p>Individuals entering SCP-067 have reported feelings of anxiety and unease at seeing both the interior of the building and instances of SCP-067-1. This is not believed to be an anomalous effect, but merely a natural reaction. However, shortly after being shown to a bedroom, individuals have reported intense feelings of happiness and relaxation. Persons who have spent the night at SCP-067 have claimed they slept incredibly well, experienced pleasant dreams, and awoke content, refreshed, and de-stressed. Research into this phenomenon is ongoing.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Show\u00a0Addendum\u00a0067a</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Addendum 067a:</strong> Recent soil analysis of the property of SCP-067 has revealed unusually high amounts of acetic acid, adipocere<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, and thiols. Such substances are most likely the result of animal decomposition, and could be a contributing factor to SCP-067's unusual density of fungi, as well as its pungent smell.</p>\n<p>Further inspection has also revealed that the usage of recording devices within SCP-067 is only disrupted if the equipment used is particularly sensitive to external conditions (though what these particular conditions are is uncertain). The research team has changed their equipment accordingly. Recently recorded footage from inside the inn has shown numerous discrepancies with the current item description. Notably, instances of SCP-067-1 were not observed to greet, offer meals to, or show bedrooms to anyone, and at no point could be seen wearing clothing.

This decision was made after two separate and crucial discoveries.</p>\n<p>1. The discovery of a previously unknown fungus, dubbed \"Orion's Cup\" (<em>Calicem orion</em>). This fungus was noted to produce a chemical compound (named \"CT4\") that interferes with neurotransmitters (including the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine), resulting in mild hallucinations and a feeling of euphoria. CT4 is also responsible for partial loss of motor control, though this effect is less apparent in humans. This accounts for the bizarre behavior observable within a majority of the animals in the inn, who are most likely drawn to the fungi due to it being a rich food source.</p>\n<p>It was also concluded that the presence of the fungi itself, while unusual, could potentially be explained by the presence of numerous decaying organics underground and/or high levels of radiation. Such scenarios are uncommon due to their nature, but are wholly within the realm of understanding.</p>\n<p>2. Following the identification of high radiation within the soil, excavation of the area was approved on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 by Containment Specialist Lisa P. Armstrong. This prompted the discovery of \u2588\u2588 kg of uranium ore, as well as 29 human corpses in various stages of decomposition directly underneath SCP-067-EX. Examination of the bodies suggests the cause of death to be a variety of cancerous growths (symptoms of chronic radiation poisoning). Various other materials found alongside the ore bear resemblance to those used in the making of nuclear reactors. It is believed that the decaying bodies, in conjunction with radiation, induced the flourishing of fungi within the building, which in turn attracted other animals.</p>\n<p>The individuals responsible for the presence of the bodies, ores, and materials (designated GoI-L19) have not been identified. It is possible that this group is still active and are attempting to construct a nuclear reactor using expendable workers under unsafe/illegal conditions. Their location and motives are unclear, but all relevant information has been turned over to both local and federal departments. If found, individuals of this group must be detained to ensure they do not pose an information security risk.</p>\n<p>Further perplexing is the fact that most of the deceased individuals were deemed to have died <em>after</em> the area came under Foundation control as SCP-067-EX. It is likely that SCP-067-EX\u2019s premises were breached under cover of night, as the security cameras placed around the perimeter of the area were not equipped with an infrared filter, and functioned incredibly poorly in low light conditions. This in and of itself constitutes a significant Foundation oversight, and upon further inspection, it is not believed that SCP-067-EX\u2019s containment procedures were ever up to Foundation standards.</p>\n<p>Disciplinary action will be taken against SCP-067-EX\u2019s containment team, as their oversight is responsible for GoI-L19's continued activity and, consequently, completely avoidable civilian deaths and potential security breaches.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

This is not believed to be an anomalous effect, but merely a natural reaction. However, shortly after being shown to a bedroom, individuals have reported intense feelings of happiness and relaxation. Persons who have spent the night at SCP-067 have claimed they slept incredibly well, experienced pleasant dreams, and awoke content, refreshed, and de-stressed. Research into this phenomenon is ongoing.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Addendum 067a\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 067a:** Recent soil analysis of the property of SCP-067 has revealed unusually high amounts of acetic acid, adipocere[[footnote]]A waxy substance made via the breakdown of fat tissues[[/footnote]], and thiols. Such substances are most likely the result of animal decomposition, and could be a contributing factor to SCP-067's unusual density of fungi, as well as its pungent smell. \n\n\n\nFurther inspection has also revealed that the usage of recording devices within SCP-067 is only disrupted if the equipment used is particularly sensitive to external conditions (though what these particular conditions are is uncertain). The research team has changed their equipment accordingly. Recently recorded footage from inside the inn has shown numerous discrepancies with the current item description. Notably, instances of SCP-067-1 were not observed to greet, offer meals to, or show bedrooms to anyone, and at no point could be seen wearing clothing.\u00a0\u00a0It has been proposed that this could mean SCP-067-1's appearance is altered by a cognitohazard.\n\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Addendum 067b\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 067b:** Analysis has shown individual accounts of events occurring inside SCP-067 to be inconsistent not only with video recording, but with each other. A confirmation test, logged by Dr. Kleinsmann, Dr. Orion, and several tripod-mounted camcorders, has yielded the following results.\n\n\n\n||||||~ **Experiment 067-b6** ||\n\n|| **Supervisor:** Dr. Kleinsmann || **Date:** 5/02/2004 || **Location:** SCP-067||\n\n||||||= **Additional Information** ||\n\n|||| **Preliminary Supervisor Notes:** Dr. Loginova is out today, but I've decided to approve today's tests regardless.

All of the animals filmed during the experiment were most likely ordinary animals under SCP-067's influence. It is possible that the inn, or possibly the unusual amount of fungi inside it, are affecting the minds of animals and individuals inside the building. This would explain the odd behavior observed among the animals.\u00a0\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\nOf note is the fact that the deer mentioned in the above log bears strong resemblance to one that was struck by a truck driver later that night roughly 3 km away[[footnote]]See article by Lincoln County News (lcnme): \"Man In Truck Jumped By Crazy Deer\"[[/footnote]]. The description of the deer \u2014 as given by the driver to the police department \u2014 matches the erratic behavior of the deer described in the log. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\nIt is clear to SCP-067's research staff that at least a portion of the current description for SCP-067 is demonstrably false. It is likely we are dealing with a mind-affecting phenomena, which is possibly memetic or hallucinogenic in nature. ||\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Addendum 067c\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n> **To:** Containment Specialist Armstrong\n\n> **From:** Dr. Kleinsmann\n\n> **Subject:** 067 Request For Immediate Containment Revisions\n\n> \n\n> Following additional soil analysis (conducted by Dr. Loginova), it has come to our attention that the organic materials inside and around the anomaly are emitting baseline radiation levels of 1 mSv/h. This is good news in that we now better understand SCP-067, but bad news when you account for Emily Orion and I soaking up an average of 24 mSv (or roughly 10 years worth of background radiation exposure) over the course of a single day-long excursion. And we've done 11 of those excursions in the past six months. This is almost certainly why our original equipment was having difficulty functioning.\n\n> \n\n> See my attached schedule and get back to me as soon as you can.\n\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Addendum 067d\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 067d:** \n\nAs of 6/11/2004, SCP-067 is to be considered an explained phenomenon. This decision was made after two separate and crucial discoveries. \n\n\n\n1. The discovery of a previously unknown fungus, dubbed \"Orion's Cup\" (//Calicem orion//). This fungus was noted to produce a chemical compound (named \"CT4\") that interferes with neurotransmitters (including the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine), resulting in mild hallucinations and a feeling of euphoria. CT4 is also responsible for partial loss of motor control, though this effect is less apparent in humans. This accounts for the bizarre behavior observable within a majority of the animals in the inn, who are most likely drawn to the fungi due to it being a rich food source.\n\n\n\nIt was also concluded that the presence of the fungi itself, while unusual, could potentially be explained by the presence of numerous decaying organics underground and/or high levels of radiation. Such scenarios are uncommon due to their nature, but are wholly within the realm of understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Following the identification of high radiation within the soil, excavation of the area was approved on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 by Containment Specialist Lisa P. Armstrong. This prompted the discovery of\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588 kg of uranium ore, as well as 29 human corpses in various stages of decomposition directly underneath SCP-067-EX. Examination of the bodies suggests the cause of death to be a variety of cancerous growths (symptoms of chronic radiation poisoning). Various other materials found alongside the ore bear resemblance to those used in the making of nuclear reactors. It is believed that the decaying bodies, in conjunction with radiation, induced the flourishing of fungi within the building, which in turn attracted other animals.\n\n\n\nThe individuals responsible for the presence of the bodies, ores, and materials (designated GoI-L19) have not been identified. It is possible that this group is still active and are attempting to construct a nuclear reactor using expendable workers under unsafe/illegal conditions. Their location and motives are unclear, but all relevant information has been turned over to both local and federal departments. If found, individuals of this group must be detained to ensure they do not pose an information security risk.\n\n\n\nFurther perplexing is the fact that most of the deceased individuals were deemed to have died //after// the area came under Foundation control as SCP-067-EX. It is likely that SCP-067-EX\u2019s premises were breached under cover of night, as the security cameras placed around the perimeter of the area were not equipped with an infrared filter, and functioned incredibly poorly in low light conditions. This in and of itself constitutes a significant Foundation oversight, and upon further inspection, it is not believed that SCP-067-EX\u2019s containment procedures were ever up to Foundation standards.\n\n\n\nDisciplinary action will be taken against SCP-067-EX\u2019s containment team, as their oversight is responsible for GoI-L19's continued activity and, consequently, completely avoidable civilian deaths and potential security breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\u00a0[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-067-EX", "scp_number": 67, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_licensebox", "building", "euclid", "explained", "fungus", "hallucination", "radioactive", "scp"], "title": "SCP-067-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-067-ex"}, "SCP-1094-EX": {"created_at": "2018-04-23T20:56:00", "creator": "MrBazzle", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "Uploaded file \"EyePlanetttt.png\".", "date": "2018-04-23T20:56:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "Uploaded file \"EyePlanetLoL-2.png\".", "date": "2018-04-23T20:56:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T20:56:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T20:57:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T21:49:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T21:54:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T21:59:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:34:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "Uploaded file \"EyePlanetLoL.jpg\".", "date": "2018-04-23T22:34:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "File \"EyePlanetttt.png\" deleted", "date": "2018-04-23T22:34:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:35:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:36:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:36:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:39:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:39:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:41:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T22:56:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-23T23:56:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-24T00:47:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-24T11:05:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-24T19:30:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-24T19:30:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-24T19:31:00"}, {"author": "MrBazzle", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mrbazzle", "comment": "", "date": "2018-04-26T16:08:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: _image, extraterrestrial, planet, scp.

SCP-1094-EX has a radius of 8,642 km and a mass of\u00a0\u00a022.3 M,,\u2295,,[[footnote]] 22.3 masses of Earth [[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nThe majority of SCP-1094-EX's surface is composed of white fine-grained granite and several mountainous regions, suggesting previous volcanic activity and erosion. SCP-1094-EX has an appearance similar to that of a human eyeball due to a large impact crater on its surface, presumably caused by collision with another exoplanet in its solar system. The dark central circle of the impact area is composed primarily of ash, graphite and other debris, while the surrounding yellow ring is composed of sulfur and iron oxide. The composition of SCP-1094-EX below its crust is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=EyePlanetLoL-2.png|caption=First photograph of SCP-1094-EX (circa 1999). Click to enlarge.|width=240px|link=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1094-ex/EyePlanetLoL-2.png\"|align=left]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** SCP-1094-EX was discovered during routine observation of celestial bodies in the outer Milky Way Galaxy on 10/09/1999. As there was no other information on it at the time of discovery, SCP-1094-EX was given a placeholder designation as an anomalous object[[footnote]] Due to it having a similar appearance to that of a human eyeball [[/footnote]] until further analysis of the object could be done.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:** On 01/04/2002, Foundation probe FT-2935 was launched from Area-\u2588\u2588\u2588 on a set course for SCP-1094-EX. --FT-2935 is estimated to intersect with SCP-1094-EX in approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588 years-- See Addendum 3 for more details.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3:** On 12/10/2\u2588\u2588\u2588, FT-2935 landed on SCP-1094-EX, having split into two different compartments (FT-2935-A and FT-2935-B) before landing. FT-2935-A was set to land on a portion of SCP-1094-EX's bare surface, while FT-2935-B was set to land on SCP-1094-EX's yellow ring. After conducting several tests on its surface, F-2935 deemed SCP-1094-EX non-anomalous. \n\n\n\nDuring analysis of SCP-1094-EX's surface materials, FT-2935-B detected large amounts of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/last-moments deceased, extraterrestrial organic matter]. FT-2935-A did not detect anything of similar value.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** EyePlanetLoL.jpg\n\n> **Name:** EyePlanetLoL\n\n> **Author:** [[*user MrBazzle]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-1094-ex/EyePlanetLoL.jpg SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** EyePlanetLoL-2.png\n\n> **Name:** EyePlanetLoL-2\n\n> **Author:** [[*user MrBazzle]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-1094-ex/EyePlanetLoL-2.png SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["last-moments", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-1094-EX", "scp_number": 1094, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "explained", "extraterrestrial", "planet", "scp"], "title": "SCP-1094-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1094-ex"}, "SCP-123-EX": {"created_at": "2018-05-12T14:03:00", "creator": "deleted", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "chicago spirit binch", "date": "2018-05-12T14:03:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2018-05-12T14:08:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2018-05-12T15:55:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2018-05-12T16:40:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2018-05-12T18:04:00"}, {"author": "thewolf66", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thewolf66", "comment": "Put a missing space.", "date": "2018-05-12T19:54:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: alive, chicago-spirit, euclid, explained, humanoid, probability, sapient, scp, sentient.

Prior to the events detailed in Addendum-123-D, SCP-123-EX was theorized to be capable of causing statistically improbable outcomes, all of which would end in SCP-123-EX's favor.</p>\n<p>SCP-123-EX's personality had been described as easily agitated, and prone to overreaction. SCP-123-EX had previously been affiliated with a local university, but eventually ceased affiliating with it. It is unknown what caused this change.</p>\n<p>SCP-123-EX was contained by the Foundation between 11-19-1928 and 5-21-1930, contained at Site-11, formerly located in [REDACTED], Illinois. It was contained within a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell-A.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>SCP-123-EX was officially contained as an SCP object on 12-20-1928 after what were believed to be accurate tests complied by Dr. Sharp and presented before the O5 Council. SCP-123-EX was classified as Euclid while in containment.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-123-EX was captured following a raid on GoI-070 (\"Chicago Outfits\") in collaboration with the Bureau of Prohibition on 11/1/1928. The Bureau had received an anonymous tip claiming that Person of Interest-523 (\"Julius 'Sawteeth' McGallan\"), member of GoI-001 (\"Chicago Spirits\") was working at an illegal brewery operated by GoI-070, and that Person of Interest-523 was attempting to harm the latter's manufacturing efforts.</p>\n<p>Foundation officials contacted the Department of the Treasury, requesting a cooperative operation to stop manufacturing efforts of GoI-070 and to arrest Person of Interest-523.</p>\n<p>Twenty agents were dispatched from each organization. During the raid the brewery caught fire, causing an explosion that resulted in the building's collapse. All suspects were killed except for SCP-123-EX.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Archivist's Note:</strong> For the sake of easy reading, the following documents have been ordered linearly. Documents have been selectively edited to help facilitate that goal. For full documentation on SCP-123-EX, see Document-ASFIN1.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Addendum-123-A</strong></p>\n<p>On 11-17-1928, SCP-123 was ordered to write down the events that occurred within the brewery before its destruction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was around 11\u00a0A.M, and I was helping a few harps move some barrels around when I heard the gunshots from outside. Then someone yells something about coppers in the building, and I start feeling scared. You see, the boss had the dryheads and coppers off our backs. It was a real smart operation, the brewery was. The boss has the prohibition guys paid off and we kept the profits. Every dryhead in the city was drinking like the rest of us.</p>\n<p>The two harps run off somewhere and I sit down. I've been pinched before, so I knew what to do. When you work in the business, you learn to take a pinching every once in awhile. I lit myself a fag and sat down near some barrels. The one thing that I noticed was this guy near the window. I remember him looking scared, but cant recall anything big, other than he looked like he saw a ghost. I think he may have had something in his mouth, like he was one of those squirls [sic]. It didnt look right. I call out to him, and he tumbles back, and falls into some of the barrels. I remember alcohol going everywhere.</p>\n<p>I must have dropped my cigarette cause I remember it all just catching fire. He starts screaming, running all over the place. Some of the harps start getting some water buckets and throwing some water onto him but it didn't work. They all just dropped dead the moment they did it. He's still running around screaming, and he's bumbing[sic] into so many different things.</p>\n<p>Then he bumbs [sic] into the brewer, and the entire thing just explodes, and the entire building starts to shake. And it weren't no normal shaking either. It was like the foundation itself was gonna collaspe [sic] on itself, crushing all of us. Around this time, I start getting afraid. I couldn't even force myself to move, that's how afraid I was.</p>\n<p>It's in that type of moment that makes a body start praying. It wasn't something I thought about, I just started doing it. I don't believe in god or anything like that, but my mother taught me the Lords [sic] Prayer, and I'm glad for her teaching me that, cause I repeated it a thousand times in that building.</p>\n<p>The building began to shake, and I close my eyes. Again, I'm praying. Then I hear the giant boom, like dynamite. I open my eyes, and I see the building around me, destroyed. I'm the only one alive. I thought I was dead at first, but only after looking down and seeing I was practically untouched. There was always this large patch of the roof with nothing on it, and it always leaked water. I was in that patch.</p>\n<p>I guess you could say I'm the luckiest man alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Addendum-123-F</strong></p>\n<p>The following entries are from SCP-123-EX's diary prior to the discovery of the events detailed in Addendum-123-D<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Entry:\u00a012/1/1928\u00a0--\u00a04/30/1930</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Access\u00a0Granted</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/1/1928</p>\n<p>The doctors gave me this diary. They said it was to help me get used to my situation. I don't think I could ever get used to a situation like this. I haven't been able to talk to anyone since I arrived here. I hadn't even a single beer. What has this world gone to!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/7/1928</p>\n<p>I talked with the doctors. Nice one called Sharp.. Asked me a bunch of questions. Asked me about my friends, the Outfit, etc. I didn't pinch on them, but I get the feeling they're not after them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/9/1928</p>\n<p>I heard some old hebrew lady cry tonight. The walls are thin. Something about a funeral. I don't think this is the first time she's been told something like this. Asked Sharp how long she's been here. Said it wasn't for me to know. I dont think he knows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/11/1928</p>\n<p>I asked Sharp about why I was here. He said nothing beyond that I was 'special'. Wanted him to explain but said it wasn't my place to know. I think I'm in an asylum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/13/1928</p>\n<p>Cant sleep. Heard shooting and shooting from the other rooms. I've been stuck in this small room for the past month at this point. I don't even know if its been a month. They give me a clock and a calender but I don't know if its true or not. Maybe its been a week. Maybe two or three maybe even a couple of months. They keep the lights on. Asked the doctor about it the other day. Told me it was to keep an eye on the patients. Why does this asylum have guns lying around the place?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/14/1928</p>\n<p>Got something from under the door. Small packet of papers. Name's on it. Say I'm 'anomalous'. Not sure what the word means, but I don't think its a good thing. Apparently I'm \"capable of causing statistically improbable outcomes\". I'm lucky, if I'm reading this correctly. If you could even call this luck. Arrived with another thing, something about a gang called \"Chicago Spirit\". GOI-1, they say. Something about the dryheads and cooperation and some other shit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/19/1928</p>\n<p>I asked the doctors for some books or papers. Haven't gotten anything since the papers from under the door. I shoved those things under my pillow. I have no where else to put it other than possibly the toilet, but I dont want them asking me why my toilet is filled with secret documents.</p>\n<p>Doctors said no. I swear if I don't get something I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/20/1928</p>\n<p>Doctors making me do simple tests. They told me afterwards that I'd be ready to interact with the other \"skips\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/25/1928</p>\n<p>Questions, questions, questions, and even more goddamn questions. Been hammering me for days now, all day. Doctor's droaning on and on about questions that I don't care enough to answer but will have to anyways. Almost makes me wish I was crushed under that damn building. Sharp seemed to look me in the eye as these doctors yammered. They told me he was so sorry. I think he meant it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2/1/1929</p>\n<p>I finally got a newspaper. Came with my food under the door. Best feeling in the world. Stuff about the stock market, but I didn't care, as long as I got something to read. Whoevers doing this is my hero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2/2/1929</p>\n<p>I got something different. Again it came from the food. A report looking thing. On the front it had the words \"DESTROY AFTER READING\" written on the front. I took it up and read the summary. It was about this guy who could control electricity. I know I should be freaked out by this, but I'm numb to it. I guess being locked up for the past three months in this hell hole can do that to you. It began with his abilitis. intelligent and anomalous. Big picture of him. It's the guy. The one I killed. Apparently he was some big shot at a gang called the \"chicago spirit\", even a made man. Had long teeth to shock people with. Guess that's why they called him \"sawteeth\". Flushed it down the toilet. Guards dont seem to notice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2/18/1929</p>\n<p>I think I'm sick. Every time I stand up my legs feel like they're going to stop working and give way under me. Every time I breath I feel like it's stifled or hard. Everytime I sit down I feel stiff and like the world is whirling around me. I feel like I'm going to die. No, I'm going to die. At least, if I get out of here.</p>\n<p>New report. Big letters on the front saying \"GOI-1 Chicago Spirit\". 30 pages out of a much bigger report. Maybe 300 pages. Doesnt matter. I dont think I could read stomach the rest. It was about their \"Tactics\". what they do to people who hurt them. Only 14 pages were actually words. The rest were pictures. People who kill their bosses get hurt. They get hurt bad. Earliest stories were of some guy named Johnny. The papers said his fingers were ripped off with pliers, eyeballs stabbed out, and penis smashed with hammer until it was unrecognizable. Organs sent to family but stopped by postal service.</p>\n<p>They had pictures as well. His face won't leave me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3/20/1929</p>\n<p>You never get the image of nails jammed into a man's eyeball out of your head.</p>\n<p>Note came with food. It was a letter. I opened it and read it. It was from mom.</p>\n<p>It was short. She said I hoped I was doing well while at college and that I would write soon. It was the same letter she had written for the past five years.</p>\n<p>I wish I had a beer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3/29/1929</p>\n<p>Another note. Another letter from mom. Said she hoped I was doing well at college. This time she said she lost her job and that she was doing horribly, but hoped that my studies were doing well.</p>\n<p>I chewed it up and threw it up in the toilet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4/13/1929</p>\n<p>Sharp asked me about how I'm doing here. Lied. Said he was glad I was getting used to the site. Said if the tests and interviews continue the doctors may allow me to talk to other patients.</p>\n<p>I think I'd prefer a shotgun in my mouth at this point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4/15/1929</p>\n<p>Another document in my food. Was my 'approval form'. I really like the wording, mr fucking sharp. \"It is better to err on the side of caution in such circumstances\" fuck you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4/16/1929</p>\n<p>i had a nightmare last night. sawteeth was in it. he had two sickles and i was upside down on some table. he positioned the two sickles into my mouth in opposite directions. one towards the bottom of my mouth and other towards the roof. he stabbed them both. i felt blood poor out. it hurt. it hurt so much. i couldnt scream. the only thing my body could do was feel the pain. he applied pressure on both sides of my mouth. i felt my jaw pop and fresh air fill where my jaw used to be. it felt so cold then. then the blood came out and it felt slightly warmer. he leaned in and whispered this is warm up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[unknown date]</p>\n<p>let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking die let me fucking<br/>\n[Repeats for two and a half pages]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5/30/1929</p>\n<p>asked them for a dictionary. said itll be here in about a year. i have all the time in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9/1/1929</p>\n<p>received another piece of mail from mom. says shes coming up to met me in chicago and thanks me for paying for her train tickets</p>\n<p>threw away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9/17/1929</p>\n<p>says it was a nice visit and that she hopes to find an apartment soon with my money. im the nicest ive been in years.</p>\n<p>threw away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>11/1/1929</p>\n<p>shes dead. obituary in mail. found in river. lynched.</p>\n<p>couldnt even throw it away</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/1/1929</p>\n<p>i think the foundation broke me</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/25/1929</p>\n<p>I cried for the first time in the past year. Got letter. It was from the giver.</p>\n<p>He said he was sorry for everything I had ever gone through. He said that he was the one who sent the letters. Wants to protect me, he says. Thought sending the letters would motivate me and show me dangers of Spirit. Worked, I supposed. Trying to get me more interactions with other people, like other mobsters. Wont happen, but it'd be a nice gesture. Also hid something else under the food. Surprised no one saw it.</p>\n<p>It was a dictionary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/11/1930</p>\n<p>Another letter. Same guy. Says he's been personally paying for my apartment.

He wanted to give you information on the world, even if it was small in comparison to his personal knowledge.

The Chicago police force received reports from the hotel owner that the renter of the apartment, Ottone Trevisan, had gone missing the previous week. Additionally, a rotten smell was coming from the inside the apartment. The hotel owner, fearing the worse and knowing Ottone's relationship with the Chicago Outfit, called the police to investigate,</p>\n<p>The police were shocked to discover the decapitated and crucified corpse of Ottone Trevisan. He suffered a large amount of physical trauma before succumbing to his wounds. His head was found in the toilet, and his penis was found nailed to the inside part of the front door. One officer reported that the face looked like it was \"screaming\", and that there was an unnatural amount of blood within the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Despite the evidence of a struggle, no members of the apartment reported screaming or strange sounds coming from inside. The strange circumstances of the death prompted Foundation personnel to arrive at the scene and take over the investigation, masquerading as FBI agents.</p>\n<p>Personnel discovered the remnants of various spells and enchantments on the apartment, including, but not limited to: muffling, physical regeneration, pyro-related spells, long-range use of removed limbs, time dilation related spells, sensory amplification, shape-shifting, and many more.</p>\n<p>Up until this point, Ottone had tried to keep a low profile. He tried to rejoin the Chicago Outfit, but due to his connection to the death of Sawteeth, he was rejected out of fear. His mother had died while he was within Foundation custody. Every excuse given made no sense. What few friends he had abandoned him, seeing him as either a danger or a coward for leaving the Outfit.</p>\n<p>This is an exceptional case in Foundation history, showcasing the failures of the early 20th century Foundation to protect falsely assumed anomalies. Ottone was just one of over 10,000 false anomalies from the years of 1889 to 1930, before the invention of Kant counters and other objective ways of determining anomalies. Modern Foundation historians and analysts estimate that anywhere from 30%-60% of contained objects had no supernatural properties. Others, such as Anita L. Glidwell, claim that these statistics are inaccurate, as they did not include individuals who died in containment.</p>\n<p>The point of this case is to remember something incredibly important: that the Foundation is not infallible, that we are not immune to horrible, wasteful travesties. That we, despite all our current knowledge and technology, are always capable of being wrong. Additionally, it showcases what happens when we stop caring for the non-anomalous; once it was shown that Ottone was not anomalous, he was removed from containment, a place he had spent the better part of two years, a place where he made many connections, including the 'traitorous' Dr. Sharp who did everything he could to help him, and threw him out. He had been cut off from the outside world, which contained people who wanted him dead. The upper echelons of the Foundation bureaucracy were indifferent to his and others plight. This is why we have programs in place to remove people from the outside world, why we have programs that allow people to start over, why we remove them from the public record: it's for their own good.</p>\n<p>Foundation Historian Amanda K.

Prior to the events detailed in Addendum-123-D, SCP-123-EX was theorized to be capable of causing statistically improbable outcomes, all of which would end in SCP-123-EX's favor. \n\n\n\nSCP-123-EX's personality had been described as easily agitated, and prone to overreaction. SCP-123-EX had previously been affiliated with a local university, but eventually ceased affiliating with it. It is unknown what caused this change. \n\n\n\nSCP-123-EX was contained by the Foundation between 11-19-1928 and 5-21-1930, contained at Site-11, formerly located in [REDACTED], Illinois. It was contained within a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell-A. [[footnote]] **Archivist Note:**\u00a0\u00a0See Document-AWQ12 for more information. [[/footnote]] \n\n\n\nSCP-123-EX was officially contained as an SCP object on 12-20-1928 after what were believed to be accurate tests complied by Dr. Sharp and presented before the O5 Council. SCP-123-EX was classified as Euclid while in containment.\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-123-EX was captured following a raid on GoI-070 (\"Chicago Outfits\") in collaboration with the Bureau of Prohibition on 11/1/1928. The Bureau had received an anonymous tip claiming that Person of Interest-523 (\"Julius 'Sawteeth' McGallan\"), member of GoI-001 (\"Chicago Spirits\") was working at an illegal brewery operated by GoI-070, and that Person of Interest-523 was attempting to harm the latter's manufacturing efforts. \n\n\n\nFoundation officials contacted the Department of the Treasury, requesting a cooperative operation to stop manufacturing efforts of GoI-070 and to arrest Person of Interest-523. \n\n\n\nTwenty agents were dispatched from each organization. During the raid the brewery caught fire, causing an explosion that resulted in the building's collapse. All suspects were killed except for SCP-123-EX. \n\n\n\n//**Archivist's Note:** For the sake of easy reading, the following documents have been ordered linearly. Documents have been selectively edited to help facilitate that goal. For full documentation on SCP-123-EX, see Document-ASFIN1.//\n\n\n\n-----\n\n= **Addendum-123-A**\n\n\n\nOn 11-17-1928, SCP-123 was ordered to write down the events that occurred within the brewery before its destruction. \n\n\n\n> It was around 11 A.M, and I was helping a few harps move some barrels around when I heard the gunshots from outside. Then someone yells something about coppers in the building, and I start feeling scared. You see, the boss had the dryheads and coppers off our backs. It was a real smart operation, the brewery was. The boss has the prohibition guys paid off and we kept the profits. Every dryhead in the city was drinking like the rest of us. \n\n> \n\n> The two harps run off somewhere and I sit down. I've been pinched before, so I knew what to do. When you work in the business, you learn to take a pinching every once in awhile. I lit myself a fag and sat down near some barrels. The one thing that I noticed was this guy near the window. I remember him looking scared, but cant recall anything big, other than he looked like he saw a ghost. I think he may have had something in his mouth, like he was one of those squirls [sic].\u00a0\u00a0It didnt look right. I call out to him, and he tumbles back, and falls into some of the barrels. I remember alcohol going everywhere. \n\n> \n\n> I must have dropped my cigarette cause I remember it all just catching fire. He starts screaming, running all over the place. Some of the harps start getting some water buckets and throwing some water onto him but it didn't work. They all just dropped dead the moment they did it. He's still running around screaming, and he's bumbing[sic] into so many different things. \n\n> \n\n> Then he bumbs [sic] into the brewer, and the entire thing just explodes, and the entire building starts to shake. And it weren't no normal shaking either. It was like the foundation itself was gonna collaspe [sic] on itself, crushing all of us. Around this time, I start getting afraid. I couldn't even force myself to move, that's how afraid I was. \n\n> \n\n> It's in that type of moment that makes a body start praying. It wasn't something I thought about, I just started doing it. I don't believe in god or anything like that, but my mother taught me the Lords [sic]\u00a0\u00a0Prayer, and I'm glad for her teaching me that, cause I repeated it a thousand times in that building. \n\n> \n\n> The building began to shake, and I close my eyes. Again, I'm praying. Then I hear the giant boom, like dynamite. I open my eyes, and I see the building around me, destroyed. I'm the only one alive. I thought I was dead at first, but only after looking down and seeing I was practically untouched. There was always this large patch of the roof with nothing on it, and it always leaked water. I was in that patch. \n\n> \n\n> I guess you could say I'm the luckiest man alive. \n\n> \n\n> \n\n\n\n-----\n\n= **Addendum-123-F**\n\n\n\nThe following entries are from SCP-123-EX's diary prior to the discovery of the events detailed in Addendum-123-D\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Entry: 12/1/1928 -- 4/30/1930\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:left; width: 77%\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n> 12/1/1928\n\n> \n\n> The doctors gave me this diary. They said it was to help me get used to my situation. I don't think I could ever get used to a situation like this. I haven't been able to talk to anyone since I arrived here. I hadn't even a single beer. What has this world gone to! \n\n\n\n> 12/7/1928\n\n> \n\n> I talked with the doctors. Nice one called Sharp.. Asked me a bunch of questions. Asked me about my friends, the Outfit, etc. I didn't pinch on them, but I get the feeling they're not after them. \n\n\n\n> 12/9/1928\n\n> \n\n> I heard some old hebrew lady cry tonight. The walls are thin. Something about a funeral. I don't think this is the first time she's been told something like this. Asked Sharp how long she's been here. Said it wasn't for me to know. I dont think he knows. \n\n\n\n> 12/11/1928\n\n> \n\n> I asked Sharp about why I was here. He said nothing beyond that I was 'special'. Wanted him to explain but said it wasn't my place to know. I think I'm in an asylum. \n\n\n\n> 12/13/1928\n\n> \n\n> Cant sleep. Heard shooting and shooting from the other rooms. I've been stuck in this small room for the past month at this point. I don't even know if its been a month. They give me a clock and a calender but I don't know if its true or not. Maybe its been a week. Maybe two or three maybe even a couple of months. They keep the lights on. Asked the doctor about it the other day. Told me it was to keep an eye on the patients.\u00a0\u00a0Why does this asylum have guns lying around the place? \n\n\n\n> 12/14/1928\n\n> \n\n> Got something from under the door. Small packet of papers. Name's on it. Say I'm 'anomalous'. Not sure what the word means, but I don't think its a good thing. Apparently I'm \"capable of causing statistically improbable outcomes\". I'm lucky, if I'm reading this correctly. If you could even call this luck. Arrived with another thing, something about a gang called \"Chicago Spirit\". GOI-1, they say. Something about the dryheads and cooperation and some other shit. \n\n\n\n> 12/19/1928\n\n> \n\n> I asked the doctors for some books or papers. Haven't gotten anything since the papers from under the door. I shoved those things under my pillow. I have no where else to put it other than possibly the toilet, but I dont want them asking me why my toilet is filled with secret documents.\n\n> \n\n> Doctors said no. I swear if I don't get something I'm gonna lose my fucking mind. \n\n\n\n> 12/20/1928\n\n> \n\n> Doctors making me do simple tests. They told me afterwards that I'd be ready to interact with the other \"skips\". \n\n\n\n> 12/25/1928\n\n> \n\n> Questions, questions, questions, and even more goddamn questions. Been hammering me for days now, all day. Doctor's droaning on and on about questions that I don't care enough to answer but will have to anyways.\u00a0\u00a0Almost makes me wish I was crushed under that damn building. Sharp seemed to look me in the eye as these doctors yammered. They told me he was so sorry. I think he meant it. \n\n\n\n\n\n> 2/1/1929\n\n> \n\n> I finally got a newspaper. Came with my food under the door. Best feeling in the world. Stuff about the stock market, but I didn't care, as long as I got something to read. Whoevers doing this is my hero. \n\n\n\n> 2/2/1929\n\n> \n\n> I got something different. Again it came from the food. A report looking thing. On the front it had the words \"DESTROY AFTER READING\" written on the front. I took it up and read the summary. It was about this guy who could control electricity. I know I should be freaked out by this, but I'm numb to it. I guess being locked up for the past three months in this hell hole can do that to you. It began with his abilitis. intelligent and anomalous. Big picture of him. It's the guy. The one I killed. Apparently he was some big shot at a gang called the \"chicago spirit\", even a made man. Had long teeth to shock people with. Guess that's why they called him \"sawteeth\". Flushed it down the toilet. Guards dont seem to notice. \n\n\n\n> 2/18/1929\n\n> \n\n> I think I'm sick. Every time I stand up my legs feel like they're going to stop working and give way under me. Every time I breath I feel like it's stifled or hard. Everytime I sit down I feel stiff and like the world is whirling around me. I feel like I'm going to die. No, I'm going to die. At least, if I get out of here. \n\n> \n\n> New report. Big letters on the front saying \"GOI-1 Chicago Spirit\". 30 pages out of a much bigger report. Maybe 300 pages. Doesnt matter. I dont think I could read stomach the rest. It was about their \"Tactics\". what they do to people who hurt them. Only 14 pages were actually words. The rest were pictures. People who kill their bosses get hurt. They get hurt bad. Earliest stories were of some guy named Johnny. The papers said his fingers were ripped off with pliers, eyeballs stabbed out, and penis smashed with hammer until it was unrecognizable. Organs sent to family but stopped by postal service.\n\n> \n\n> They had pictures as well. His face won't leave me. \n\n> \n\n\n\n\n\n> 3/20/1929\n\n> \n\n> You never get the image of nails jammed into a man's eyeball out of your head. \n\n> \n\n> Note came with food. It was a letter. I opened it and read it. It was from mom. \n\n> \n\n> It was short. She said I hoped I was doing well while at college and that I would write soon. It was the same letter she had written for the past five years. \n\n> \n\n> I wish I had a beer. \n\n\n\n\n\n> 3/29/1929\n\n> \n\n> Another note. Another letter from mom. Said she hoped I was doing well at college. This time she said she lost her job and that she was doing horribly, but hoped that my studies were doing well. \n\n> \n\n> I chewed it up and threw it up in the toilet. \n\n\n\n> 4/13/1929\n\n> \n\n> Sharp asked me about how I'm doing here. Lied. Said he was glad I was getting used to the site.

Due to a difficult development period from 1922 to 1927, very little progress was made. Despite this, the first prototype was developed in 1929, and modified in 1930. This device was more advanced for the time period, and was not prone to damage. However, it was expensive to manufacture, and each Foundation site were only stocked with one device. [[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nSCP-123-EX requested to talk to Foundation personnel. Dr. Herbert volunteered, but only on the condition that he was allowed access to the Foundation issued electrical recording device.

I'm surprised you didn't notice it earlier. \n\n> \n\n> //SCP-123-EX does not respond//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** I can give you answers to some of your questions, if you'd like. I have been observing you for a while, since Dr. Sharp decided to study you. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** What does Dr. Sharp have to do with this? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** Everything. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** Who slipped those documents into my cell? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** Sharp, obviously. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** Why? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** To protect you, of course. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** Why? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** I don't know. I have theories, of course. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** What do you think? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** I think he knew what kind of predicament you were in. A fish out of water, so to speak. And considering what you were involved in -- Chicago Spirit, Sawteeth, mobsters -- he wanted to give you a helping hand. He wanted to give you information on the world, even if it was small in comparison to his personal knowledge. He gave you the Spirit documents to show you the danger involved -- and how important it was for you to be anomalous. He didn't directly tell you, of course. He couldn't trust you entirely. You were a gangster, after all. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** So he just felt sorry for me? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** Yes, possibly. He may have seen a little bit of himself in you.

However, I can tell you it isn't going to involve protecting you. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** W-Why? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** Because you're not anomalous, and we can't go around protecting every street urchin who has enemies. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** No, you don't understand, they'll kill me!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** And every day we experience death and fight it, and considering the economic state of things, we can't go throwing money around. We have to use our resources sparingly and efficiently. We aren't going to waste resources and man power on protecting you or any of your gangster friends. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** They'll -- they'll fucking kill me! \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Herbert:** Not our problem. \n\n> \n\n> //SCP-123-EX grabs hold of Dr. Herbert's arm//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-123-EX:** Please you have to reconsider.

After extensive background checks he was allowed access to the recording. [[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> \n\n\n\nFollowing this interview SCP-123-EX was removed from containment and custody transferred to the recently created Bureau of External Affairs, later renamed to Department of External Affairs. SCP-123-EX was released on 6/1/1930. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Commentary\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n> On 6-29-1930, Ottone Trevisan, formerly known as SCP-123, now SCP-123-EX, was found dead in his small Chicago apartment, almost a month after his initial release from Foundation custody. The Chicago police force received reports from the hotel owner that the renter of the apartment, Ottone Trevisan, had gone missing the previous week. Additionally, a rotten smell was coming from the inside the apartment. The hotel owner, fearing the worse and knowing Ottone's relationship with the Chicago Outfit, called the police to investigate,\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> The police were shocked to discover the decapitated and crucified corpse of Ottone Trevisan. He suffered a large amount of physical trauma before succumbing to his wounds. His head was found in the toilet, and his penis was found nailed to the inside part of the front door. One officer reported that the face looked like it was \"screaming\", and that there was an unnatural amount of blood within the bathroom. \n\n> \n\n> Despite the evidence of a struggle, no members of the apartment reported screaming or strange sounds coming from inside. The strange circumstances of the death prompted Foundation personnel to arrive at the scene and take over the investigation, masquerading as FBI agents. \n\n> \n\n> Personnel discovered the remnants of various spells and enchantments on the apartment, including, but not limited to: muffling, physical regeneration, pyro-related spells, long-range use of removed limbs, time dilation related spells, sensory amplification, shape-shifting, and many more. \n\n> \n\n> Up until this point, Ottone had tried to keep a low profile. He tried to rejoin the Chicago Outfit, but due to his connection to the death of Sawteeth, he was rejected out of fear. His mother had died while he was within Foundation custody. Every excuse given made no sense. What few friends he had abandoned him, seeing him as either a danger or a coward for leaving the Outfit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> This is an exceptional case in Foundation history, showcasing the failures of the early 20th century Foundation to protect falsely assumed anomalies. Ottone was just one of over 10,000 false anomalies from the years of 1889 to 1930, before the invention of Kant counters and other objective ways of determining anomalies. Modern Foundation historians and analysts estimate that anywhere from 30%-60% of contained objects had no supernatural properties. Others,\u00a0\u00a0such as Anita L. Glidwell, claim that these statistics are inaccurate, as they did not include individuals who died in containment. \n\n> \n\n> The point of this case is to remember something incredibly important: that the Foundation is not infallible, that we are not immune to horrible, wasteful travesties. That we, despite all our current knowledge and technology, are always capable of being wrong. Additionally, it showcases what happens when we stop caring for the non-anomalous; once it was shown that Ottone was not anomalous, he was removed from containment, a place he had spent the better part of two years, a place where he made many connections, including the 'traitorous' Dr. Sharp who did everything he could to help him, and threw him out. He had been cut off from the outside world, which contained people who wanted him dead. The upper echelons of the Foundation bureaucracy were indifferent to his and others plight. This is why we have programs in place to remove people from the outside world, why we have programs that allow people to start over, why we remove them from the public record: it's for their own good. \n\n> \n\n> \n\n> \n\n> Foundation Historian Amanda K.

SCP-1329-EX's existence on Earth is to be concealed from public knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1329-EX is a unique type of spacetime curvatures, known as \"pseudoportals\". Any object passing through such a portal enters the same part of space it would enter had the portal not been there. In other words, a pseudoportal is a portal that leads to itself. To date, there are \u2588\u2588 documented instances of SCP-1329-EX, with the number growing steadily.</p>\n<p>The similarity of the terms \"portal\" and \"pseudoportal\" stems from their inherent connection to the concepts of \"spacetime curvatures\" and \"wormholes\". However, there is a fundamental difference between their working principles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A portal is an extensive spacetime curvature that bypasses normal topology in order to link two disparate points in space. In other words, portals allow to reduce an infinitely large distance between two spacetime points to a near-zero value.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A pseudoportal is an extensive spacetime curvature that divides its two adjacent points by forming a space that is not compliant with the rules of standard topology. In other words, pseudoportals allow to expand an infinitesimal distance between two points of space to an infinite value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike \"wormholes\", the displacement caused by portals and pseudoportals occurs almost immediately.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>SCP-1329-EX's nature explained by Dr. Smagin in layman's terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone knows what a portal is. To put it simply, imagine entering a door located in Site-7 and then finding yourself on the other end of the world. A pseudoportal is the opposite. You enter a door in Site-7 and nothing seems to happen. In reality, though, you might have travelled hundreds, thousands, or even millions of\u2026 miles? Maybe miles, or maybe\u2026 light years. You won't enjoy this little big adventure due to the nature of the curvature in question. On top of that, for the very same reason everything will look perfectly normal. So, let's say there is a pseudoportal in your restroom. Every single morning your body would be zipping through galaxies and nebulae within mere nanoseconds; this trip would go unnoticed, as it ends exactly in the time and place it started. That's why the anomaly had remained hidden for so long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pseudoportals are generally indiscernible, but on rare occasions their presence is indicated with a slight diffraction similar to a boundary between hot and cold air. Each instance of SCP-1329-EX emits a faint cosmic background radiation at a certain sequence. Tracking said emissions is a reliable means of identifying the anomaly as a pseudoportal.</p>\n<p>SCP-1329-EX possess another noteworthy property. Despite such curvatures having a strong relation to spacetime topology, SCP-1329-EX are attached to certain points of the planet. Thus, SCP-1329-EX stay mostly unaffected by the Earth's orbital movement and rotation, as well as the movement of the Solar system.</p>\n<p>Several Foundation researchers argue that each pseudoportal requires a comprehensive examination regarding hidden threats capable of causing, among other things, a K-Class Scenario. Therefore, newfound areas that visually match SCP-1329-EX are not to be classified as Explained or Safe without appropriate investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The first (and the most important one considering its location) pseudoportal was discovered between \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 stations of the Moscow Metro in the spring of 2018. Various anomalies resembling SCP-1329-EX had been studied for 9 years by the time. However, Site-7 personnel were the first to document SCP-1329-EX via live recording: the process of \"relocation\" was captured on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2018, using a special camera modified with <a href=\"http://scpfoundation.net/scp-1038-ru-v\">SCP-1038-ARC</a>.</p>\n<p>The following is an abridged list of known pseudoportals:</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Designation</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SCP-1329-EX-1</td>\n<td>A line between \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 stations of the Moscow Metro, Russia.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SCP-1329-EX-3</td>\n<td>The deepest adit of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 coal mine, India.

First documented evidence. Note the blackout during the \"relocation\"; all photons inside the subway car stopped mid-flight preventing physical objects from being observed.]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-1329-RU-EX\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** --Uncontained-- Explained\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** --Development not currently viable.--\n\n\n\nTheoretical background for the item's existence has been created and integrated into current natural science by the conventional scientific community. SCP-1329-EX's existence on Earth is to be concealed from public knowledge.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-1329-EX is a unique type of spacetime curvatures, known as \"pseudoportals\". Any object passing through such a portal enters the same part of space it would enter had the portal not been there. In other words, a pseudoportal is a portal that leads to itself. To date, there are \u2588\u2588 documented instances of SCP-1329-EX, with the number growing steadily.\n\n\n\nThe similarity of the terms \"portal\" and \"pseudoportal\" stems from their inherent connection to the concepts of \"spacetime curvatures\" and \"wormholes\". However, there is a fundamental difference between their working principles.\n\n\n\n* A portal is an extensive spacetime curvature that bypasses normal topology in order to link two disparate points in space. In other words, portals allow to reduce an infinitely large distance between two spacetime points to a near-zero value.\n\n\n\n* A pseudoportal is an extensive spacetime curvature that divides its two adjacent points by forming a space that is not compliant with the rules of standard topology. In other words, pseudoportals allow to expand an infinitesimal distance between two points of space to an infinite value.\n\n\n\nUnlike \"wormholes\", the displacement caused by portals and pseudoportals occurs almost immediately. [[footnote]]The exact amount of time taken has not been measured yet. According to several theories, it seems to be shorter than a nanosecond by two orders of magnitude.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nSCP-1329-EX's nature explained by Dr. Smagin in layman's terms:\n\n\n\n> Everyone knows what a portal is. To put it simply, imagine entering a door located in Site-7 and then finding yourself on the other end of the world. A pseudoportal is the opposite. You enter a door in Site-7 and nothing seems to happen. In reality, though, you might have travelled hundreds, thousands, or even millions of... miles? Maybe miles, or maybe... light years. You won't enjoy this little big adventure due to the nature of the curvature in question. On top of that, for the very same reason everything will look perfectly normal. So, let's say there is a pseudoportal in your restroom. Every single morning your body would be zipping through galaxies and nebulae within mere nanoseconds; this trip would go unnoticed, as it ends exactly in the time and place it started. That's why the anomaly had remained hidden for so long.\n\n\n\nPseudoportals are generally indiscernible, but on rare occasions their presence is indicated with a slight diffraction similar to a boundary between hot and cold air. Each instance of SCP-1329-EX emits a faint cosmic background radiation at a certain sequence. Tracking said emissions is a reliable means of identifying the anomaly as a pseudoportal.\n\n\n\nSCP-1329-EX possess another noteworthy property. Despite such curvatures having a strong relation to spacetime topology, SCP-1329-EX are attached to certain points of the planet. Thus, SCP-1329-EX stay mostly unaffected by the Earth's orbital movement and rotation, as well as the movement of the Solar system.\n\n\n\nSeveral Foundation researchers argue that each pseudoportal requires a comprehensive examination regarding hidden threats capable of causing, among other things, a K-Class Scenario. Therefore, newfound areas that visually match SCP-1329-EX are not to be classified as Explained or Safe without appropriate investigation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** The first (and the most important one considering its location) pseudoportal was discovered between \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 stations of the Moscow Metro in the spring of 2018. Various anomalies resembling SCP-1329-EX had been studied for 9 years by the time. However, Site-7 personnel were the first to document SCP-1329-EX via live recording: the process of \"relocation\" was captured on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2018, using a special camera modified with [http://scpfoundation.net/scp-1038-ru-v SCP-1038-ARC].\n\n\n\nThe following is an abridged list of known pseudoportals:\n\n\n\n||~ Designation||~ Location ||\n\n|| SCP-1329-EX-1 || A line between \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 stations of the Moscow Metro, Russia. ||\n\n|| SCP-1329-EX-3 || The deepest adit of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 coal mine, India.

NFTs by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media\". They have also been sold under the label of \"VKTM NFTs\". NFT is believed to stand for \"non-fungible token\", a term which has not received mainstream acceptance.</p>\n<p>SCP-1337 purport to give the user ownership of \"Great Moments in History\". Concepts VKTM NFTs have supposedly granted ownership of include: \"the 100,000th tree cut down in the Amazon Rainforest\", \"1/100th of the hole in the Ozone Layer\", \"All sexual harassment lawsuits levied against Activision-Blizzard in the next decade\", \"The revelation of discriminatory hiring practices at major tech companies\", \"The tears of [CIVILIAN IDENTITY REDACTED], age \u2588, upon first realizing that his family is one of many to have slipped from the American middle class to poverty<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>\", and \"Another symbol of the slow failure of democratic ideals.\"</p>\n<p>As described in Vikander-Kneed marketing material, a Non-Fungible Token is a unique unit of data upon a blockchain that points to the purchased concept. Owning the NFT signifies that the holder \"owns\" the signified concept. It is not specified what the owner of the concept is allowed to do with it. A blockchain is a list of entries that cannot be easily modified after creation. A large amount of computational power and electricity is used to prevent unauthorized modifications to blockchains. SCP-1337 is similar to existing products on the Ethereum Blockchain such as \"Cryptokitties\", which similarly purport to grant their buyers a unique entry in a digital ledger.</p>\n<p>SCP-1337 are traded on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, it is responsible for less than 0.5% of all emissions generated by the Ethereum blockchain. Forcibly seizing control of the Ethereum blockchain has been deemed ethically unacceptable due to the calculated environmental impact and projected secrecy breaches involved in doing so.</p>\n<p>Upon purchasing an instance of SCP-1337, the buyer will receive an entry in their digital portfolio indicating that they own the concept. This entry will usually include a link to an image pertinent to the linked concept but these images are generally symbolic as opposed to literal. These images may be under copyright; if so, the copyright holders of these images are almost always not associated with VKTM. If the links to these images change, the images will not update.</p>\n<p>(For other entities offering similar ownership of abstract concepts, see <span style=\"color: royalblue\"><a href=\"/scp-2557\">SCP-2557</a>, a Holding of Envelope Logistics<sup>\u00ae</sup></span>. However, unlike offerings by <span style=\"color: royalblue\">Envelope Logistics<sup>\u00ae</sup></span>, SCP-1337 does not appear to grant its buyers any enforceable ownership claims.)</p>\n<p>As of yet, all known instances of SCP-1337 have corresponded to actual events.</p>\n<p>Prior to Foundation containment, SCP-1337 instances usually remained up for sale for less than an hour before being purchased. Initial prices have ranged from $1 USD to $10,000 USD. After purchase, most instances are not resold. The resale value of those that are is on average 99% less than the original.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Addendum 1: Initial Containment Discussion</span></span></h4>\n<p>SCP-1337 has been given provisional SCP status given the purported conceptual ownership, as well as for being produced by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. A specialized committee consisting of Dr. Lillian Lillihammer (Specialty: Memetics), <a href=\"/mountainous-essophysics\">Dr. Ezekiel Yang (Specialty: Financial Esoterica)</a>, and ALEXANDRA.AIC (Specialties: Cybersecurity, Computing, Digital Architecture, [10+ more]) was organized to discuss the anomalous aspects of the VKTM NFT product.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h5 id=\"toc4\"><span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SCP-1337 Initial Containment Plan Meeting</span></span></h5>\n<p><em>July 22, 2018</em></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n[REDUNDANT EXPLANATION REDACTED]\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Is that all there is to this bullshit, Alexandra?</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> That's it. It is a hyperlink with a ownership verification process.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Are you sure? There's nothing else? No anomalous legal constructs?</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> Nothing that matters from a legal or finance standpoint, beyond VKTM's existence as a corporate entity despite an <em>extremely</em> sparse paper trail. There is nothing anomalous about the computational implementation of SCP-1337.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> I'm certain there are nuances\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> I don't care.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> \u2026I'm not a fan of them either.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> What <em>are</em> you a fan of? Housing crises? The <a href=\"/scp-2791\">occasional annihilation of Bielefeld</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Believe me, that was before my time. It's part of why the Department of Financial Esoterica was formed.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> What's your doctorate in again?</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Mathematics.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Then why are you wasting your time in finance\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> I like money.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> \u2026then why are you working for the Foundation instead of Bay Street?</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> I'm not Canadian.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Wall Street, American.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Better work-life balance.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Are you serious?</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Never.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> I hate you already.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> I get that a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> I was requested to act as a moderator primarily because we predicted there would be a significant personality clash between the two of you. Please\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Personality clash? This is a moral issue.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Yes, yes, the financial industry is full of bloodsucking parasites. Yes, we're all soulless monsters with no appreciation of art or beauty. Yes, I add zero value to the world in my current job. But it takes a thief to catch a thief.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Fine. That doesn't mean I have to like it.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Alexandra, can we snip all of that from the record?</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> I will consider it if it proves necessary.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Fine. So I'll break down what these \"VKTM NFTs\" are from a financial standpoint. How they behave. When you buy most assets, you do so with the expectation that you'll gain some future value from them. When you buy a stock, you're legally entitled to a share of that company's cashflows into perpetuity. If you buy a bond, you're buying into fixed payments for as long as the bond exists. These NFTs\u2026 I'd say it's more analogous to buying fine art.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Soulless monsters with understanding of art or beauty, indeed.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> When we're not talking about anart, and if we ignore the money laundering use case, people buy fine art for either its aesthetic or sentimental value or because they expect it to increase in value. The data isn't showing the second; these things are effectively <em>worthless</em> the instant they leave VKTM's ledger. There's nothing anomalous about this part of the effect. Which is why you're here.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Why me? I thought I was only here because of my natural brilliance.</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> You were chosen for both your expertise in memetics and your previous study of Vikander Kneed\u2014.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> The reason I'm deferring to <em>you</em> is that I can't possibly imagine why people would <em>literally invest in the deforestation of the Amazon.</em> It has to be a memetic compulsion.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> YOU <em>LITERALLY</em> WORK ON CONTAINING THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY! YOU KNOW HOW HORRIBLE PEOPLE CAN BE!</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> THAT'S DIFFERENT! THEY'RE RATIONAL ACTORS!</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> WHAT'S RATIONAL ABOUT\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> BEING A PIECE OF SHIT IS RATIONAL IF YOU GET RICH OFF OF IT!</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> YOU'RE A PIECE OF\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> PLEASE TRY TO REMAIN CIVIL.</p>\n<p><em>Yang takes a drink of water and smooths his tie. Lillihammer also takes a drink of water.</em></p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> My point is\u2014no one with half a brain should buy these things. Personally, I think they're both abhorrent and pointless.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> So you <em>do</em> have morals.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> As much as anyone who works for the Foundation does, yes. Any memetic effects?</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> I'd have to run a more thorough breakdown, but tell me\u2014Alexandra, can you bring up another example on our screens?</p>\n<p><em>ALEXANDRA brings another instance of SCP-1337 onto their screens. This is \"The Radicalization of</em> [CIVILIAN IDENTITY REDACTED] <em>and subsequent actions in January, 2021\". The picture is of the Washington Monument.</em></p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Can we <em>use</em> these at all? Is VKTM reliable with future predictions?</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Look at it! It's too vague. What's he going to do, protest naked in front of\u2026 in Washington D.C.?</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> The Washington Monument, but close enough. Is this normal with VKTM's \"helpful hints\"?</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Unfortunately. But tell me this\u2014how do you feel when you look at this?</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> I\u2026 vaguely patriotic? It's a picture of the Washington Monument. Nice sculpture, 400 years old, probably built with slave labor. Not worth the\u2026 are they asking for <em>500 dollars</em> for a hyperlink? Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Glad to hear you're not a complete monster. But at a first glance \u2013 and I'd need more time with these to be sure \u2013 there's no memetic compulsion effect here. Nothing anomalous, at least.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> So people are just buying these because\u2026 they <em>want</em> to own all this idiotic\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Yep.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> God damn it.</p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA.AIC:</strong> It seems that we appear to have come to a conclusion. Despite their producer, instances of SCP-1337 are entirely nonanomalous. Financially, technologically, and memetically.</p>\n<p><strong>LILLIHAMMER:</strong> Think so. If there's a memetic component, it's real subtle, which\u2026 <em>is</em> VKTM's style. I'll take a closer look, but I don't expect to find anything.</p>\n<p><strong>YANG:</strong> Agreed. I'll have the quants take a closer look, but I don't expect anything deeper to pop up.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Preliminary Conclusion:</span></strong> No anomalous properties were determined to exist in SCP-1337. However, SCP-1337 remained under observation due to the anomalous proclivities of its manufacturer. Current containment procedures were implemented under the recommendation of Drs.

Image is actually of 2013 California Forest Fires|width=300px]]\n\n++++ __Special Containment Procedures__\n\n+++++ //(Current as of August 2018)//\n\n\n\nUntil such a time that instances of SCP-1337 stop being produced or Ethics Committee approval to covertly seize control of the Ethereum blockchain is granted, the Foundation is to buy all instances of SCP-1337 produced by VKTM to prevent public knowledge of VKTM's operations and reduce civilian exposure to any possible embedded memetic triggers.\n\n\n\n++++ __Description__:\n\nSCP-1337 is \"Great Moments in History! NFTs by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media\". They have also been sold under the label of \"VKTM NFTs\". NFT is believed to stand for \"non-fungible token\", a term which has not received mainstream acceptance.\n\n\n\nSCP-1337 purport to give the user ownership of \"Great Moments in History\". Concepts VKTM NFTs have supposedly granted ownership of include: \"the 100,000th tree cut down in the Amazon Rainforest\", \"1/100th of the hole in the Ozone Layer\", \"All sexual harassment lawsuits levied against Activision-Blizzard in the next decade\", \"The revelation of discriminatory hiring practices at major tech companies\", \"The tears of [CIVILIAN IDENTITY REDACTED], age \u2588, upon first realizing that his family is one of many to have slipped from the American middle class to poverty[[footnote]]Said person was verified to exist in the United States; their family is above the American poverty line[[/footnote]]\", and \"Another symbol of the slow failure of democratic ideals.\"\n\n\n\nAs described in Vikander-Kneed marketing material, a Non-Fungible Token is a unique unit of data upon a blockchain that points to the purchased concept. Owning the NFT signifies that the holder \"owns\" the signified concept. It is not specified what the owner of the concept is allowed to do with it. A blockchain is a list of entries that cannot be easily modified after creation. A large amount of computational power and electricity is used to prevent unauthorized modifications to blockchains. SCP-1337 is similar to existing products on the Ethereum Blockchain such as \"Cryptokitties\", which similarly purport to grant their buyers a unique entry in a digital ledger.\n\n\n\nSCP-1337 are traded on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, it is responsible for less than 0.5% of all emissions generated by the Ethereum blockchain. Forcibly seizing control of the Ethereum blockchain has been deemed ethically unacceptable due to the calculated environmental impact and projected secrecy breaches involved in doing so.\n\n\n\nUpon purchasing an instance of SCP-1337, the buyer will receive an entry in their digital portfolio indicating that they own the concept. This entry will usually include a link to an image pertinent to the linked concept but these images are generally symbolic as opposed to literal. These images may be under copyright; if so, the copyright holders of these images are almost always not associated with VKTM. If the links to these images change, the images will not update.\n\n\n\n(For other entities offering similar ownership of abstract concepts, see ##royalblue|[[[SCP-2557]]], a Holding of Envelope Logistics^^\u00ae^^##. However, unlike offerings by ##royalblue|Envelope Logistics^^\u00ae^^##, SCP-1337 does not appear to grant its buyers any enforceable ownership claims.)\n\n\n\nAs of yet, all known instances of SCP-1337 have corresponded to actual events.\n\n\n\nPrior to Foundation containment, SCP-1337 instances usually remained up for sale for less than an hour before being purchased. Initial prices have ranged from $1 USD to $10,000 USD. After purchase, most instances are not resold. The resale value of those that are is on average 99% less than the original.\n\n\n\n++++ __Addendum 1: Initial Containment Discussion__\n\n\n\nSCP-1337 has been given provisional SCP status given the purported conceptual ownership, as well as for being produced by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. A specialized committee consisting of Dr. Lillian Lillihammer (Specialty: Memetics), [[[mountainous essophysics|Dr. Ezekiel Yang (Specialty: Financial Esoterica)]]], and ALEXANDRA.AIC (Specialties: Cybersecurity, Computing, Digital Architecture, [10+ more]) was organized to discuss the anomalous aspects of the VKTM NFT product.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++++ __SCP-1337 Initial Containment Plan Meeting__\n\n//July 22, 2018//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[REDUNDANT EXPLANATION REDACTED]\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Is that all there is to this bullshit, Alexandra?\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** That's it. It is a hyperlink with a ownership verification process.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Are you sure? There's nothing else? No anomalous legal constructs?\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** Nothing that matters from a legal or finance standpoint, beyond VKTM's existence as a corporate entity despite an //extremely// sparse paper trail. There is nothing anomalous about the computational implementation of SCP-1337.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** I'm certain there are nuances\u2014\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** I don't care.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** \u2026I'm not a fan of them either.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** What //are// you a fan of? Housing crises? The [[[SCP-2791 |occasional annihilation of Bielefeld]]]?\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Believe me, that was before my time. It's part of why the Department of Financial Esoterica was formed.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** What's your doctorate in again?\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Mathematics.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Then why are you wasting your time in finance\u2014\n\n\n\n**YANG:** I like money.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** \u2026then why are you working for the Foundation instead of Bay Street?\n\n\n\n**YANG:** I'm not Canadian.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Wall Street, American.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Better work-life balance.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Are you serious?\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Never.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** I hate you already.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** I get that a lot.\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** I was requested to act as a moderator primarily because we predicted there would be a significant personality clash between the two of you. Please\u2014\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Personality clash? This is a moral issue.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Yes, yes, the financial industry is full of bloodsucking parasites. Yes, we're all soulless monsters with no appreciation of art or beauty. Yes, I add zero value to the world in my current job. But it takes a thief to catch a thief.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Fine. That doesn't mean I have to like it.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Alexandra, can we snip all of that from the record?\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** I will consider it if it proves necessary.[[footnote]]Due to Dr. Yang's comments on the nature of the financial industry, the previous conversation was determined important enough to include.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Fine. So I'll break down what these \"VKTM NFTs\" are from a financial standpoint. How they behave. When you buy most assets, you do so with the expectation that you'll gain some future value from them. When you buy a stock, you're legally entitled to a share of that company's cashflows into perpetuity. If you buy a bond, you're buying into fixed payments for as long as the bond exists. These NFTs\u2026 I'd say it's more analogous to buying fine art.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Soulless monsters with understanding of art or beauty, indeed.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** When we're not talking about anart, and if we ignore the money laundering use case, people buy fine art for either its aesthetic or sentimental value or because they expect it to increase in value. The data isn't showing the second; these things are effectively //worthless// the instant they leave VKTM's ledger. There's nothing anomalous about this part of the effect. Which is why you're here.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Why me? I thought I was only here because of my natural brilliance.\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** You were chosen for both your expertise in memetics and your previous study of Vikander Kneed\u2014.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** The reason I'm deferring to //you// is that I can't possibly imagine why people would //literally invest in the deforestation of the Amazon.// It has to be a memetic compulsion.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** YOU //LITERALLY// WORK ON CONTAINING THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY! YOU KNOW HOW HORRIBLE PEOPLE CAN BE!\n\n\n\n**YANG:** THAT'S DIFFERENT! THEY'RE RATIONAL ACTORS!\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** WHAT'S RATIONAL ABOUT\u2014\n\n\n\n**YANG:** BEING A PIECE OF SHIT IS RATIONAL IF YOU GET RICH OFF OF IT!\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** YOU'RE A PIECE OF--\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** PLEASE TRY TO REMAIN CIVIL.\n\n\n\n//Yang takes a drink of water and smooths his tie. Lillihammer also takes a drink of water.//\n\n\n\n**YANG:** My point is\u2014no one with half a brain should buy these things. Personally, I think they're both abhorrent and pointless.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** So you //do// have morals.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** As much as anyone who works for the Foundation does, yes. Any memetic effects?\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** I'd have to run a more thorough breakdown, but tell me\u2014Alexandra, can you bring up another example on our screens?\n\n\n\n//ALEXANDRA brings another instance of SCP-1337 onto their screens. This is \"The Radicalization of// [CIVILIAN IDENTITY REDACTED] //and subsequent actions in January, 2021\". The picture is of the Washington Monument.//\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Can we //use// these at all? Is VKTM reliable with future predictions?\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Look at it! It's too vague. What's he going to do, protest naked in front of\u2026 in Washington D.C.?\n\n\n\n**YANG:** The Washington Monument, but close enough. Is this normal with VKTM's \"helpful hints\"?\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Unfortunately. But tell me this\u2014how do you feel when you look at this?\n\n\n\n**YANG:** I\u2026 vaguely patriotic? It's a picture of the Washington Monument. Nice sculpture, 400 years old, probably built with slave labor. Not worth the\u2026 are they asking for //500 dollars// for a hyperlink? Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Glad to hear you're not a complete monster. But at a first glance \u2013 and I'd need more time with these to be sure \u2013 there's no memetic compulsion effect here. Nothing anomalous, at least.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** So people are just buying these because\u2026 they //want// to own all this idiotic\u2026\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Yep.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** God damn it.\n\n\n\n**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** It seems that we appear to have come to a conclusion. Despite their producer, instances of SCP-1337 are entirely nonanomalous. Financially, technologically, and memetically.\n\n\n\n**LILLIHAMMER:** Think so. If there's a memetic component, it's real subtle, which\u2026 //is// VKTM's style. I'll take a closer look, but I don't expect to find anything.\n\n\n\n**YANG:** Agreed. I'll have the quants take a closer look, but I don't expect anything deeper to pop up.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**__Preliminary Conclusion:__** No anomalous properties were determined to exist in SCP-1337. However, SCP-1337 remained under observation due to the anomalous proclivities of its manufacturer. Current containment procedures were implemented under the recommendation of Drs.

Investigations into the whereabouts of PoI-6922 is currently ongoing within the state of Illinois.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1401-EX is the collective designation for a group of 22 printed images. These images were previously found printed and stapled onto telephone poles around Illinois, USA. SCP-1401-EX instances take the form of a warning poster, informing the viewer of a nonexistent ailment defined as \u201cbeing scrombled [sic].\u201d The stylization of these posters is similar to numerous internet memes and are often edited to be surreal and nonsensical for comedic effect. The listed symptoms of SCP-1401-EX vary between instances but are often unclear or nonsensical phrases with poor grammar. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience of dust</li>\n<li>Bones being not from your elbow</li>\n<li>Not from the tuba</li>\n<li>Knowledge of the energy within the green around</li>\n<li>Partaking in the peepee or poopoo</li>\n<li>Entities in the surroundings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instances will always end with the sentence, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>The phrasing of these symptoms is thought to be intentionally suggestive to confuse readers of SCP-1401-EX currently suffering from mild ailments. Individuals claiming to have been affected by SCP-1401-EX have been found to have symptoms unrelated to the poster\u2019s contents, with effects of a preexisting injury or illness being attributed to SCP-1401-EX. Mental examinations of these individuals have consistently found them to be suffering a form of hypochondria.</p>\n<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-1401-EX was first reported on 07/03/2020 when pieces of documentation from Illinois hospitals describing a \u201cmystery disease\u201d were discovered. An embedded Agent was able to interview a number of individuals, all of which described SCP-1401-EX as the source of their information regarding the disease. MTF Eta-10 (\u201cSee No Evil\u201d) was deployed to contain the anomaly, which was originally thought to be cognitohazardous. Nine instances were discovered and were given to the Site-19 cognitohazardous research facility. After extensive testing, it was determined that SCP-1401-EX possessed no anomalous properties.</p>\n<p>During post recovery analysis, SCP-1401-EX was mentioned in several chat rooms associated with GoI-5869 (\u201cGamers Against Weed\u201d). The following are chat logs discussing SCP-1401-EX\u2019s initial distribution.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a

These images were previously found printed and stapled onto telephone poles around Illinois, USA. SCP-1401-EX instances take the form of a warning poster, informing the viewer of a nonexistent ailment defined as \u201cbeing scrombled [sic].\u201d The stylization of these posters is similar to numerous internet memes and are often edited to be surreal and nonsensical for comedic effect. The listed symptoms of SCP-1401-EX vary between instances but are often unclear or nonsensical phrases with poor grammar. These include:\n\n* Experience of dust\n\n* Bones being not from your elbow\n\n* Not from the tuba\n\n* Knowledge of the energy within the green around\n\n* Partaking in the peepee or poopoo\n\n* Entities in the surroundings \n\nInstances will always end with the sentence, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it it\u2019s fine.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe phrasing of these symptoms is thought to be intentionally suggestive to confuse readers of SCP-1401-EX currently suffering from mild ailments. Individuals claiming to have been affected by SCP-1401-EX have been found to have symptoms unrelated to the poster\u2019s contents, with effects of a preexisting injury or illness being attributed to SCP-1401-EX. Mental examinations of these individuals have consistently found them to be suffering a form of hypochondria. \n\n\n\n**History:** SCP-1401-EX was first reported on 07/03/2020 when pieces of documentation from Illinois hospitals describing a \u201cmystery disease\u201d were discovered. An embedded Agent was able to interview a number of individuals, all of which described SCP-1401-EX as the source of their information regarding the disease. MTF Eta-10 (\u201cSee No Evil\u201d) was deployed to contain the anomaly, which was originally thought to be cognitohazardous. Nine instances were discovered and were given to the Site-19 cognitohazardous research facility. After extensive testing, it was determined that SCP-1401-EX possessed no anomalous properties. \n\n\n\nDuring post recovery analysis, SCP-1401-EX was mentioned in several chat rooms associated with GoI-5869 (\u201cGamers Against Weed\u201d). The following are chat logs discussing SCP-1401-EX\u2019s initial distribution.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"\u25bc Access #\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Chat Logs \u25bc\"

Finding strong similarities between Organovo's notes and notes corroborated by research into SCP-1512, the Overseer Council has decided to officially re-classify SCP-1512 as Explained, as the technology utilized in creating SCP-1512 is now considered advanced scientific knowledge rather than anomalous phenomena.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1512-04:</strong> Following the expiration of the Stratasys Ltd.

Despite various sightings, no physical proof of their presence could be provided, and as such, they were assigned an SCP designation in 1947.</p>\n<p>Four months after initial SCP designation, a foul odor was reported in the boiler room of Site-34. Initially believed to be the result of a burst pipe, investigation revealed a corpse of an SCP-1542 instance in the corner of the room.

The object, originally thought to be a star, is significantly brighter than any recorded so far and periodically emits bursts of ionizing radiation.</p>\n<p>Initially discovered in 1949 at the Yerkes' Observatory in Chicago, Illinois, Agent M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 noticed that many of the pulses recorded formed a morse code. The first transcribed read \"Death for the undsrving[<em>sic</em>].\" All messages received so far have all been aggressive, involving the death, destruction, and humiliation of the human race.</p>\n<p>Readings and measurements of the object has shown it to be incredibly unstable. SCP-1548 possess a highly erratic axis, with its orientation changing at any given moment with little perceived order. This has lead researchers to believe that it is rotating very quickly and randomly. From this axis, two twin jets of ionized radiation are emitted in seemingly random pulses. The radiation from these streams are much more concentrated than the radiation emitted throughout the rest of SCP-1548.</p>\n<p>SCP-1548 communicates through morse code using these radiation pulses. The messages SCP-1548 sends out are incredibly random. While multiple distinct messages have been recorded, these pulses account for &lt;1% of the total pulses emitted by SCP-1548. No distinct pattern has been discovered for when SCP-1548 is simply pulsing at random and when it is attempting to communicate.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum.1 \u2014 Observations by Head Researcher Natalie:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Upon the completion and population of Foundation Lunar Area-32, my team has performed more detailed measurements of SCP-1548.</p>\n<p>These measurements indicate that SCP-1548 poses a large and immediate threat to the planet. Due to the proximity and intensity of the bursts, should either of the streams happen to be pointed directly at us during a burst, the radiation would retain enough energy to make it past the heliosphere and subsequently devastate components of our planet's atmosphere, namely the ozone layer and magnetosphere.</p>\n<p>All life on earth (which includes us) would be completely at the mercy of any and all ionization radiation from both space and the sun.</p>\n<p>Current estimates indicate that such an event would result in a total collapse of most of Earth's ecosystems. I doubt we would fare much better.</p>\n<p>As such, I am submitting a request for more funding to better understand, and hopefully, eventually terminate SCP-1548.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><tt>&gt; ALERT: THERE IS A TEXT FILE LEFT BY O5-3.

The radiation from these streams are much more concentrated than the radiation emitted throughout the rest of SCP-1548.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSCP-1548 communicates through morse code using these radiation pulses. The messages SCP-1548 sends out are incredibly random. While multiple distinct messages have been recorded, these pulses account for <1% of the total pulses emitted by SCP-1548. No distinct pattern has been discovered for when SCP-1548 is simply pulsing at random and when it is attempting to communicate.\n\n\n\n**Addendum.1 \u2014 Observations by Head Researcher Natalie:** \n\n\n\n> Upon the completion and population of Foundation Lunar Area-32, my team has performed more detailed measurements of SCP-1548. \n\n> \n\n> These measurements indicate that SCP-1548 poses a large and immediate threat to the planet. Due to the proximity and intensity of the bursts, should either of the streams happen to be pointed directly at us during a burst, the radiation would retain enough energy to make it past the heliosphere and subsequently devastate components of our planet's atmosphere, namely the ozone layer and magnetosphere. \n\n> \n\n> All life on earth (which includes us) would be completely at the mercy of any and all ionization radiation from both space and the sun.\n\n> \n\n> Current estimates indicate that such an event would result in a total collapse of most of Earth's ecosystems. I doubt we would fare much better.\n\n> \n\n> As such, I am submitting a request for more funding to better understand, and hopefully, eventually terminate SCP-1548. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n{{> ALERT: THERE IS A TEXT FILE LEFT BY O5-3.

A series of tests were performed on SCP-1551-EX to determine if it possessed any anomalous properties. An abridged list of tests is listed here. For a full list see document-1551-EX-TL.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test 1</strong><br/>\n<strong>Goal:</strong> Discover if SCP-1551-EX is capable of speech.<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-1551-EX was interviewed in 27 different languages.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> No successful communication. All questions were responded to with regular squealing and oinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test 2</strong><br/>\n<strong>Goal:</strong> Figure out if SCP-1551-EX shared the memories of Mateo G. Hernandez.<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-1551-EX was shown pictures of Hernandez's husband and children. It was also given choices between Hernandez's favorite foods and steamed vegetables.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-1551-EX stepped on and walked past photos of the family, ignoring the favored dishes to consume the vegetables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test 10</strong><br/>\n<strong>Goal:</strong> To tell if SCP-1551-EX is able to see through the eyes of the face on its forehead.<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> The pig eyes were blindfolded with a cloth wrapped around its head. SCP-1551-EX was then guided to attempt to return to its enclosure.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-1551-EX was unable to make its way back, bumping into walls with the human eyes showing no signs of use. Blindfold was removed and it was able to get straight to its pen efficiently without incident.<br/>\n<em>Notes: Complications due to the blindfold having been applied too tightly led to SCP-1551-EX losing sight through its right eye.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test 19</strong><br/>\n<strong>Goal:</strong> Check if Mateo G. Hernandez's soul has been transferred to SCP-1551-EX.<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> Staff from the Department of Spiritual Communication were brought in to check the entity's soul for fragments of Mateo G. Hernandez.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> The Spiritualists could not uncover any non-pig soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test 26</strong><br/>\n<strong>Goal:</strong> See whether the removal of the entity's skin causes it to regrow as human.<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> A small chunk of SCP-1551-EX's right ear was surgically removed. SCP-1551-EX was then observed for a month.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> All regrown skin was that of a baseline pig.<br/>\n<em>Notes: During regrowth, the ear became infected. A full amputation of the ear was needed to stop the spread of infected tissue.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test 34</strong><br/>\n<strong>Goal:</strong> Given the content of the enclosed image, an attempt to see if SCP-1551-EX had the ability to walk in a bipedal manner was conducted.<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> Two researchers held SCP-1551-EX up by its two front legs so that it was fully supported by only its back legs then let go.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> Procedure was carried out 7 times. The longest SCP-1551-EX was able to stay standing upright was during attempt 4 for a total of 3 seconds.<br/>\n<em>Notes: During its release on attempt 7, the entity landed with its front left leg incorrectly, fracturing multiple bones. It was unable to recover from the injury and its left leg has been amputated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the results of test 34, testing was suspended. Anomaly then reclassified as Explained.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span>Porridge</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"beeg-text\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25a1\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Tstaffor\u00a0\u25a1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25a3\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Tstaffor\u00a0\u25a3</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><a href=\"/tstaffor-s-author-page\">Tstaffor's Author page!</a><br/>\nIf you like my writing, check out my Podcast with <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/luxaiko\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(5963620); return false;\"><img alt=\"Luxaiko\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=5963620&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1736842633\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=5963620)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/luxaiko\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(5963620); return false;\">Luxaiko</a></span>!<br/>\n<a href=\"/the-scip-squad-podcast-hub\">The Scip Squad Podcast Hub</a></p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;\">SCPs</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6868\">SCP-6868</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">423</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-7500\">SCP-7500</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">322</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6552\">SCP-6552</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">172</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-3837\">SCP-3837</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">150</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6557\">SCP-6557</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">140</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6558\">SCP-6558</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">103</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-5722\">SCP-5722</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">99</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-5847\">SCP-5847</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">97</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-5846\">SCP-5846</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">95</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6547\">SCP-6547</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">94</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-7979\">SCP-7979</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">75</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6226\">SCP-6226</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">73</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6554\">SCP-6554</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">73</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6067\">SCP-6067</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">66</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-1551-ex\">SCP-1551-EX</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">56</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6553\">SCP-6553</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">53</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-555-j\">SCP-555-J</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">52</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6588\">SCP-6588</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">39</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-6551\">SCP-6551</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">39</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-5846-j\">SCP-5846-J</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">30</span></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><div class=\"list-pages-box\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;\">Tales</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/log-of-non-anomalous-items\">Log of Non-Anomalous Items</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">225</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-173-but-it-s-a-collaborative-log\">SCP-173 But... it's a Collaborative Log</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">195</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-173-but\">SCP-173 But...</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">173</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/mfw\">Mfw</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">104</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/log-of-non-anomalous-items-ii-sequels-are-always-worse\">Log of Non-Anomalous Items II: Sequels are Always Worse</a></td>\n<td>Rating: <span style=\"color: green\">85</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/goat-vr-more-like-goat-very-bad-game\">Goat VR?

The face was formerly that of Mateo G. Hernandez, a pig farmer from Extremadura, Spain. SCP-1551-EX is also lacking its left ear, right eye, and left foreleg.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1551.1 Document-TS-1551:**\n\nUpon discovery of SCP-1551-EX, a satchel secured around its torso was recovered.

A series of tests were performed on SCP-1551-EX to determine if it possessed any anomalous properties. An abridged list of tests is listed here. For a full list see document-1551-EX-TL.\n\n\n\n> **Test 1**\n\n> **Goal:** Discover if SCP-1551-EX is capable of speech.\n\n> **Procedure:** SCP-1551-EX was interviewed in 27 different languages.\n\n> **Result:** No successful communication. All questions were responded to with regular squealing and oinking.\n\n\n\n> **Test 2**\n\n> **Goal:** Figure out if SCP-1551-EX shared the memories of Mateo G. Hernandez.\n\n> **Procedure:** SCP-1551-EX was shown pictures of Hernandez's husband and children. It was also given choices between Hernandez's favorite foods and steamed vegetables.\n\n> **Result:** SCP-1551-EX stepped on and walked past photos of the family, ignoring the favored dishes to consume the vegetables.\n\n\n\n> **Test 10**\n\n> **Goal:** To tell if SCP-1551-EX is able to see through the eyes of the face on its forehead.\n\n> **Procedure:** The pig eyes were blindfolded with a cloth wrapped around its head. SCP-1551-EX was then guided to attempt to return to its enclosure.\n\n> **Result:** SCP-1551-EX was unable to make its way back, bumping into walls with the human eyes showing no signs of use. Blindfold was removed and it was able to get straight to its pen efficiently without incident.\n\n> //Notes: Complications due to the blindfold having been applied too tightly led to SCP-1551-EX losing sight through its right eye.//\n\n\n\n> **Test 19**\n\n> **Goal:** Check if Mateo G. Hernandez's soul has been transferred to SCP-1551-EX.\n\n> **Procedure:** Staff from the Department of Spiritual Communication were brought in to check the entity's soul for fragments of Mateo G. Hernandez.\n\n> **Result:** The Spiritualists could not uncover any non-pig soul.\n\n\n\n> **Test 26**\n\n> **Goal:** See whether the removal of the entity's skin causes it to regrow as human.\n\n> **Procedure:** A small chunk of SCP-1551-EX's right ear was surgically removed. SCP-1551-EX was then observed for a month.\n\n> **Result:** All regrown skin was that of a baseline pig.\n\n> //Notes: During regrowth, the ear became infected. A full amputation of the ear was needed to stop the spread of infected tissue.//\n\n\n\n> **Test 34**\n\n> **Goal:** Given the content of the enclosed image, an attempt to see if SCP-1551-EX had the ability to walk in a bipedal manner was conducted.\n\n> **Procedure:** Two researchers held SCP-1551-EX up by its two front legs so that it was fully supported by only its back legs then let go.\n\n> **Result:** Procedure was carried out 7 times. The longest SCP-1551-EX was able to stay standing upright was during attempt 4 for a total of 3 seconds.\n\n> //Notes: During its release on attempt 7, the entity landed with its front left leg incorrectly, fracturing multiple bones. It was unable to recover from the injury and its left leg has been amputated.//\n\n\n\nAfter the results of test 34, testing was suspended. Anomaly then reclassified as Explained.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n----\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/more-by:tstaffor\">:scp-wiki:more-by:tstaffor</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** senor_pig.png\n\n> **Name:** Magic lantern, series with hads pic3.JPG\n\n> **Author:** Alf van Beem\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magic_lantern,_series_with_hads_pic3.JPG\n\n[[/<]]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n", "references": ["tstaffor-s-author-page", "the-scip-squad-podcast-hub", "random:random-page", "scp-6557", "scp-5846", "scp-6547", "scp-6057", "scp-6157", "scp-6558", "scp-6067", "scp-5057", "scp-6868", "scp-7500", "scp-6552", "scp-3837", "scp-5722", "scp-5847", "scp-7979", "scp-6226", "scp-6554", "scp-6553", "scp-555-j", "scp-6588", "scp-6551", "scp-5846-j", "log-of-non-anomalous-items", "scp-173-but-it-s-a-collaborative-log", "scp-173-but", "mfw", "log-of-non-anomalous-items-ii-sequels-are-always-worse", "goat-vr-more-like-goat-very-bad-game", "the-knights-of-wonder", "the-unhuman-experience-former-prime-minister-harold-holt", "mzl-1915", "spc-3008", "shapes-the-clown", "format-screw-hub", "art:an-ascii-egg-that-kills-you-for-no-reason", "art:bubbly-bobby-the-ascii-ducky", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-1551-EX", "scp_number": 1551, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "alive", "animal", "explained", "mister", "scp"], "title": "SCP-1551-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1551-ex"}, "SCP-1717-EX": {"created_at": "2024-02-23T23:49:00", "creator": "Plilt", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-23T23:49:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "Uploaded file \"pod.jpg\".", "date": "2024-02-23T23:50:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "Uploaded file \"whales.jpg\".", "date": "2024-02-23T23:50:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-23T23:51:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-23T23:54:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-23T23:54:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-24T00:10:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "Crosslinking my own work.", "date": "2024-02-24T01:00:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-24T01:11:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "Couple minor spelling mistakes.", "date": "2024-02-24T02:38:00"}, {"author": "Plilt", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plilt", "comment": "Added tags: animal, cetacean, explained, global-occult-coalition, serpents-hand, species.

In addition to the typical cognitive abilities of cetaceans, subantarctic orcas have developed sophisticated language, increased cooperative capabilities, and a firm grasp of abstract concepts. Tool use has not been observed beyond the use of artificial waves to wash prey off ice floes, but this is believed to be due to the sparse environment of the subantarctic orca's home range rather than any cognitive limitation. The cause of this evolutionary shift is not known with certainty. Previously, it was believed to be anomalous in origin. However, extensive investigation by the Foundation using both mundane and anomalous techniques has determined that it is not anomalous or due to the interference of anomalous forces. Currently, the social brain hypothesis<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> is generally accepted by Foundation cetologists to be most supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p>The date at which the subantarctic orcas gained sapience is unknown, but believed to be recent. The species' level of cognitive, political, and technological development has not changed since Foundation observations began in 2001.</p>\n<p>Orcas are organized in pods of thirty adults on average, usually led by the oldest female. Pods do not reside in well-defined territories, but for most of the year maintain a minimum distance of 15 kilometers between pods through the use of long-distance infrasonic communication. These long-distance calls are also used for social interaction between instances in different pods, and to warn other pods about potential threats. During the summer, pods congregate to take advantage of high density fish schools produced by phytoplankton blooms.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-left\" style=\"width:312px;\"><img alt=\"pod.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1717-ex/pod.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>The current leaders of the Great Pod.

Their leaders (currently four in number) have collectively memorized the names, typical routes, and members of every member pod of the Great Pod. Prior to reclassification, these orcas were classified as SCP-1717-B. With the aid of roving orcas, the Great Pod mediate disputes between member pods, controls access to certain sacred sites, and maintains common resources. While the capabilities of the Great Pod's leaders were formerly thought to be anomalous in nature, studies performed on one of their number who died of natural causes have confirmed that they are simply the product of training and natural talent.</p>\n<p>Subantarctic orca culture, due to their limited geographic range and long-distance communication abilities, has not differentiated very much.

Reclassifications are their purview.</p>\n<p>O5-7: Normally, yes. But ceasing containment of SCP-1717 would require applying the Veil Protocol to another species and the political implications are sizeable, so they wanted it to be our decision.</p>\n<p>O5-2: How sure are they about this? If they're wrong, we won't have the resources to cover up SCP-1717 after the scientific community announces their true nature.</p>\n<p>O5-7: Very. The Parazoological Department been investigating every possible cause for SCP-1717 for the past twenty years, and monitoring the population thoroughly for over thirty. There's no sign of any anomalous activity other than that which can be traced to known, unassociated anomalies that SCP-1717 instances have come into contact with. They're abnormally normal, really.</p>\n<p>O5-6: SCP-1717-B's abilities still suggest an anomalous component.</p>\n<p>O5-4: Parazoology doesn't think so. They've vivisected one of their leaders, studied its neurology some, and they've concluded that -B just has a really good memory. Non-anomalous humans are capable of similar feats. Savants and such.</p>\n<p>O5-9: Even if this is true, I don't think it matters. There are several human ethnicities that we contain even if the individual members aren't technically anomalous, because an anomaly is an integral part of their culture. SCP-1717 may have developed their intelligence naturally and their situation is unfortunate, but they know too much, and our amnestics and memetics are designed to work on humans, not whales. They need to remain behind the Veil.</p>\n<p>O5-4: R&amp;D thinks amnestics will be functional, at least. The physiological processes targeted are conserved across Mammalia.</p>\n<p>O5-9: We don't have the resources to effectively wipe all their memories of anomalies, though.</p>\n<p>O5-4: No, we don't. But most of those oral traditions are so distorted as to be unrecognizable. Their stories of SCP-169 would look like tales of a big amphipod to anyone who didn't already know what SCP-169 was, and they have it in the wrong area. Besides, it's getting harder and harder to keep them secret. The more time between the abandonment of containment efforts and the public's discovery of SCP-1717, the easier it is to hide our role and hide the anomalous.</p>\n<p>O5-7: Contact would ease the Veil protocol, too. Most of our memes don't work on whales, but some do, and the people I've talked to in Memetics think they can design ones that would work on both species. They'd be more restricted in function, but if we could get the memes to anyone going down there we could ensure transmission. Our ability to transmit memes to SCP-1717 in the past has been limited because we didn't want to tip them off to our existence, but if we reclassify them that won't be an issue any longer.</p>\n<p>O5-1: Parazoology's own reports say they aren't sure how SCP-1717 gained sapience. I don't want to classify SCP-1717 as explained until we actually know with certainty.</p>\n<p>O5-3: The Committee classified many anomalies as explained because there was no sign of anomalous activity, even if we couldn't explain all the details. It's nearly impossible to determine what causes specific traits to evolve and how they do so; we still don't know why humans gained sapience. I don't see why this case should be any different.</p>\n<p>O5-7: There's never been any real evidence that SCP-1717 gained sapience very quickly, either. We're just assuming that we wouldn't have missed it prior to 2001, but the Type D population was little studied until recently.</p>\n<p>O5-9: I can be satisfied with that. Does anyone else have points to raise before voting?</p>\n<p>O5-6: What do we do with the captured instances?</p>\n<p>O5-7: Parazoology wants to retain them for testing purposes. We'll terminate the -B instance. It's useless now; the experiments we've done have altered their brain too much to use it for testing.</p>\n<p>O5-9: Anything else?</p>\n<p>[brief silence]</p>\n<p>O5-9: Then I call for a vote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">RECLASSIFICATION PROPOSAL 1717</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\"Maintain classification of SCP-1717 due to their institutional knowledge of SCP objects.\"<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>YEA</th>\n<th>NAY</th>\n<th>ABSTAIN</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>STATUS</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">REJECTED</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">RECLASSIFICATION PROPOSAL 1717</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\"Maintain classification of SCP-1717 due to current uncertainty about the cause of SCP-1717.\"<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>YEA</th>\n<th>NAY</th>\n<th>ABSTAIN</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>STATUS</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">REJECTED</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">RECLASSIFICATION PROPOSAL 1717</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\"Reclassify SCP-1717 as Explained.

While they do not currently have contact with humans, the terms of the International Veil Agreement apply to cultural isolates. The subantarctic orca is already above the Veil.

The Cryptid Specialist Group<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> was selected as an intermediary to reduce the risk of the GOC or another signatory to the International Veil Agreement misconstruing the Foundation's actions as a breach of the treaty.</p>\n<p>A direct transfer of data was rejected as too obvious. Instead, Dr. Gonzalez, a Foundation cetologist known to the Cryptid Specialist Group and several weeks from retirement, was directed to attend the Ocean Sciences Meeting. Dr. Isabella Basile, a member of the CSG, was scheduled to give a presentation on dorsal fin abnormalities in the sperm whale. Dr. Gonzalez was given a flash drive with all data on SCP-1717-EX, as well as low-security data on other anomalous cetaceans. This flash drive was encoded using Foundation cryptography the CSG's associates have already cracked, and safeguarded using weak memes.</p>\n<p>While at the conference, Dr. Gonzalez fidgeted with the flash drive in an obvious manner, especially when Dr. Basile was in the room. On the last day of the conference, Dr. Gonzalez engaged Dr. Basile in conversation about her presentation and left his flash drive on a nearby table when he left. Monitoring of the Cryptid Specialist Group confirms that they have taken the flash drive, are cleaning the data to make themselves out to be the source of it, and intend to publish the data by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Dr. Gonzalez was then terminated but was allowed to retain his pension and discreetly given a large severance package.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1717-4 \u2014 91st Session of the Council of 108, 2035:</strong> On September 6, 2035, the Council of 108 voted 55-53 to classify the subantarctic orca as a parathreat (designated KTE-2358-Fiji) after a proposal was introduced by the New Zealand government.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> The exact details of the session are currently unknown to the Foundation, but agents inside the Coalition have reported a fear of potential geopolitical disruption and competition for resources. Several Coalition vessels have been dispatched to retrieve subantarctic orca tissue samples. The GOC intends to take advantage of their small population size and high levels of inbreeding to use orca DNA as a targeting component in an ritual intended to cause a mass mortality event.

However, the SCP Foundation cannot afford a direct conflict with the Coalition. Given the nature of the GOC's efforts, the O5 Council decided to leak information to the Serpent's Hand in order to prevent the termination of the subantarctic orca.</p>\n<p>With the aid of several assets within the \"anomalous community,\" MTF Sigma-3 (\"Bibliographers\") was able to bait a Serpent's Hand cell into attacking a Global Occult Coalition outpost. Assets within the Global Occult Coalition had ensured that the outpost contained information on the Coalition's termination plans as well as on security measures taken at the ritual sites. They also prevented this information from being deleted when the outpost was breached.</p>\n<p>Foundation listening posts in Administrative Region 35 intercepted a Coalition distress call from several Antarctic and subantarctic islands at 14:00 September 18, 2035. Distress calls reported that armed persons had appeared from previously unknown Ways or emerged from the ocean and were assaulting Coalition encampments. The Hand's superior mobility and the relative lack of armed GOC presence meant that by 16:37, the Coalition's anomalous rituals had been disrupted and many of their personnel had been killed in action.</p>\n<p>Intelligence from Sigma-3 and the failure of subsequent Global Occult Coalition attempts indicates that the Hand has extended some form of anomalous protection over the subantarctic orca population, preventing the GOC's rituals from functioning.

This database entry is retained for reference purposes, but has been updated with current procedures and information.\n\n\n\nUnderwater sites located in Administrative Region 35 (Antarctica) are to install sonar beacons one kilometer away from facilities. These serve the dual purpose of repelling subantarctic orcas and tracking their movements. Underwater anomalies are to be protected in the same manner, if possible.

[[/footnote]] have recently undergone an evolutionary shift, resulting in the species gaining full sapience. In addition to the typical cognitive abilities of cetaceans, subantarctic orcas have developed sophisticated language, increased cooperative capabilities, and a firm grasp of abstract concepts. Tool use has not been observed beyond the use of artificial waves to wash prey off ice floes, but this is believed to be due to the sparse environment of the subantarctic orca's home range rather than any cognitive limitation. The cause of this evolutionary shift is not known with certainty. Previously, it was believed to be anomalous in origin. However, extensive investigation by the Foundation using both mundane and anomalous techniques has determined that it is not anomalous or due to the interference of anomalous forces. Currently, the social brain hypothesis[[footnote]] Originally intended to explain the evolution of human intelligence, the social brain hypothesis states that increased intelligence is an adaptation for large and complex social groups. [[/footnote]] is generally accepted by Foundation cetologists to be most supported by the evidence.\n\n\n\nThe date at which the subantarctic orcas gained sapience is unknown, but believed to be recent. The species' level of cognitive, political, and technological development has not changed since Foundation observations began in 2001.\n\n\n\nOrcas are organized in pods of thirty adults on average, usually led by the oldest female. Pods do not reside in well-defined territories, but for most of the year maintain a minimum distance of 15 kilometers between pods through the use of long-distance infrasonic communication. These long-distance calls are also used for social interaction between instances in different pods, and to warn other pods about potential threats. During the summer, pods congregate to take advantage of high density fish schools produced by phytoplankton blooms.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n| name=pod.jpg\n\n| caption=The current leaders of the Great Pod. Names are untranslatable, so they are known by their PoI numbers. From left to right, they are PoI-95-1, PoI-95-5, PoI-95-2, and PoI-95-4.\n\n| width=312px\n\n| align=left\n\n]]\n\nCurrently, most known subantarctic orca pods are (at least officially) part of the Great Pod of the Circular Current.[[footnote]] Translated from Subantarctic Orcan. [[/footnote]] The Great Pod, formerly classified as SCP-1717-A, is an association of pods networked together through by rover male orcas who act as a relay system for messages as well as scouts. Their leaders (currently four in number) have collectively memorized the names, typical routes, and members of every member pod of the Great Pod. Prior to reclassification, these orcas were classified as SCP-1717-B. With the aid of roving orcas, the Great Pod mediate disputes between member pods, controls access to certain sacred sites, and maintains common resources. While the capabilities of the Great Pod's leaders were formerly thought to be anomalous in nature, studies performed on one of their number who died of natural causes have confirmed that they are simply the product of training and natural talent.\n\n\n\nSubantarctic orca culture, due to their limited geographic range and long-distance communication abilities, has not differentiated very much. Despite their recent evolution it is highly developed, with a strong emphasis on song. Their mythology is centered around a cetomorphized ocean deity. Boats are viewed as disinterested, and sometimes dangerous, supernatural beings. Certain anomalies such as [[[SCP-169]]] have become common knowledge among subantarctic orcas. However, the details have been altered enough by cumulative errors that even in the event of the relevant communications becoming public, a Lifted Veil Scenario is considered low probability.\n\n\n\nThe O5 Council has determined that the sapience of subantarctic orcas is part of normalcy. As the human scientific community is expected to translate the language of the subantarctic orca within the next few years, they are also subject to the Veil Protocol. Subantarctic orca instances are reproductively isolated. The rest of the orca genus will therefore likely remain at their current level of intelligence.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 1717-1: Minutes of O5 Command Meeting, 23/5/2035 (Level 5+ Access Only)\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\n> O5-4: Item five on the agenda is a request from the Classification Committee to reclassify SCP-1717 as explained.\n\n> \n\n> O5-3: Why are they asking us?

Most of our memes don't work on whales, but some do, and the people I've talked to in Memetics think they can design ones that would work on both species. They'd be more restricted in function, but if we could get the memes to anyone going down there we could ensure transmission. Our ability to transmit memes to SCP-1717 in the past has been limited because we didn't want to tip them off to our existence, but if we reclassify them that won't be an issue any longer.\n\n> \n\n> O5-1: Parazoology's own reports say they aren't sure how SCP-1717 gained sapience. I don't want to classify SCP-1717 as explained until we actually know with certainty.\n\n> \n\n> O5-3: The Committee classified many anomalies as explained because there was no sign of anomalous activity, even if we couldn't explain all the details. It's nearly impossible to determine what causes specific traits to evolve and how they do so; we still don't know why humans gained sapience. I don't see why this case should be any different.\n\n> \n\n> O5-7: There's never been any real evidence that SCP-1717 gained sapience very quickly, either. We're just assuming that we wouldn't have missed it prior to 2001, but the Type D population was little studied until recently.\n\n> \n\n> O5-9: I can be satisfied with that. Does anyone else have points to raise before voting?\n\n> \n\n> O5-6: What do we do with the captured instances?\n\n> \n\n> O5-7: Parazoology wants to retain them for testing purposes. We'll terminate the -B instance. It's useless now; the experiments we've done have altered their brain too much to use it for testing.\n\n> \n\n> O5-9: Anything else?\n\n> \n\n> [brief silence]\n\n> \n\n> O5-9: Then I call for a vote.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= [[size 120%]]__RECLASSIFICATION PROPOSAL 1717__[[/size]]\n\n\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@\"Maintain classification of SCP-1717 due to their institutional knowledge of SCP objects.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n= COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n||~ YEA\u00a0\u00a0||~ NAY\u00a0\u00a0||~ ABSTAIN ||\n\n|| 5 || 6 || 2 ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ STATUS ||\n\n||= REJECTED ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= [[size 120%]]__RECLASSIFICATION PROPOSAL 1717__[[/size]]\n\n\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@\"Maintain classification of SCP-1717 due to current uncertainty about the cause of SCP-1717.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n= COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n||~ YEA\u00a0\u00a0||~ NAY\u00a0\u00a0||~ ABSTAIN ||\n\n|| 4 || 9 || 0 ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ STATUS ||\n\n||= REJECTED ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= [[size 120%]]__RECLASSIFICATION PROPOSAL 1717__[[/size]]\n\n\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@@\"Reclassify SCP-1717 as Explained.

We know the Coalition would not be so rash as to try to terminate an above-Veil group, so how difficult it would be to terminate them is not an issue.\n\n> \n\n> We hope that this does not negatively affect our working relationship, and look forward to continuing to work with the Global Occult Coalition to contain anomalous entities in the future.\n\n> \n\n> -- //Overwatch Command//\n\n\n\nNo response was received from the Global Occult Coalition.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 1717-3 (Level 5+ Access Only)\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\nGiven the response of the Global Occult Coalition, it was decided to expedite the discovery of the subantarctic orca's sapience by mundane science. While this was a controversial decision, interfering in the scientific community was judged to be less of a deviation from normalcy than risking the GOC or another anomalous actor trying to affect a non-anomalous species. The Cryptid Specialist Group[[footnote]] An unofficial working group of IUCN-affiliated scientists who protect anomalous lifeforms by discreetly influencing the activities of conservation agencies and NGOs. They were denied membership in the Council of 108 due to lack of open seats. The group has known links to the Serpent's Hand, the Manna Charitable Foundation, and the anomalous conservation NGO [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/nigerian-lava-cat Legacy], but is considered to be of minimal threat in itself. [[/footnote]] was selected as an intermediary to reduce the risk of the GOC or another signatory to the International Veil Agreement misconstruing the Foundation's actions as a breach of the treaty.\n\n\n\nA direct transfer of data was rejected as too obvious. Instead, Dr. Gonzalez, a Foundation cetologist known to the Cryptid Specialist Group and several weeks from retirement, was directed to attend the Ocean Sciences Meeting. Dr. Isabella Basile, a member of the CSG, was scheduled to give a presentation on dorsal fin abnormalities in the sperm whale. Dr. Gonzalez was given a flash drive with all data on SCP-1717-EX, as well as low-security data on other anomalous cetaceans. This flash drive was encoded using Foundation cryptography the CSG's associates have already cracked, and safeguarded using weak memes.\n\n\n\nWhile at the conference, Dr. Gonzalez fidgeted with the flash drive in an obvious manner, especially when Dr. Basile was in the room. On the last day of the conference, Dr. Gonzalez engaged Dr. Basile in conversation about her presentation and left his flash drive on a nearby table when he left. Monitoring of the Cryptid Specialist Group confirms that they have taken the flash drive, are cleaning the data to make themselves out to be the source of it, and intend to publish the data by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nDr. Gonzalez was then terminated but was allowed to retain his pension and discreetly given a large severance package.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1717-4 -- 91st Session of the Council of 108, 2035:** On September 6, 2035, the Council of 108 voted 55-53 to classify the subantarctic orca as a parathreat (designated KTE-2358-Fiji) after a proposal was introduced by the New Zealand government.[[footnote]] Global Occult Coalition member states are permitted to introduce measures but cannot vote on them. New Zealand's state normalcy organization is not a member of the Council of 108, having gained full independence after all slots in the Council were filled. [[/footnote]] The exact details of the session are currently unknown to the Foundation, but agents inside the Coalition have reported a fear of potential geopolitical disruption and competition for resources. Several Coalition vessels have been dispatched to retrieve subantarctic orca tissue samples. The GOC intends to take advantage of their small population size and high levels of inbreeding to use orca DNA as a targeting component in an ritual intended to cause a mass mortality event. While this will not wipe out the species by itself, it will likely trigger an extinction vortex due to low genetic diversity.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 1717-5 (Level 5+ Access Only)\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\nPer a 6-3 decision by the Ethics Committee, the Global Occult Coalition's actions are a threat to normality the Foundation is obligated by its Charter to act against. However, the SCP Foundation cannot afford a direct conflict with the Coalition. Given the nature of the GOC's efforts, the O5 Council decided to leak information to the Serpent's Hand in order to prevent the termination of the subantarctic orca.\n\n\n\nWith the aid of several assets within the \"anomalous community,\" MTF Sigma-3 (\"Bibliographers\") was able to bait a Serpent's Hand cell into attacking a Global Occult Coalition outpost. Assets within the Global Occult Coalition had ensured that the outpost contained information on the Coalition's termination plans as well as on security measures taken at the ritual sites. They also prevented this information from being deleted when the outpost was breached.\n\n\n\nFoundation listening posts in Administrative Region 35 intercepted a Coalition distress call from several Antarctic and subantarctic islands at 14:00 September 18, 2035. Distress calls reported that armed persons had appeared from previously unknown Ways or emerged from the ocean and were assaulting Coalition encampments. The Hand's superior mobility and the relative lack of armed GOC presence meant that by 16:37, the Coalition's anomalous rituals had been disrupted and many of their personnel had been killed in action.\n\n\n\nIntelligence from Sigma-3 and the failure of subsequent Global Occult Coalition attempts indicates that the Hand has extended some form of anomalous protection over the subantarctic orca population, preventing the GOC's rituals from functioning. While ordinarily this would be worthy of SCP classification, the limited scope of the protection renders containment unnecessary.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n", "references": ["scp-7189", "classification-committee-memo", "scp-169"], "scp": "SCP-1717-EX", "scp_number": 1717, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "alive", "animal", "aquatic", "cetacean", "explained", "global-occult-coalition", "predatory", "sapient", "scp", "serpents-hand", "species"], "title": "SCP-1717-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1717-ex"}, "SCP-1763-EX": {"created_at": "2018-03-02T18:25:00", "creator": "MaliceAforethought", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "MaliceAforethought", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maliceaforethought", "comment": "", "date": "2018-03-02T18:25:00"}, {"author": "MaliceAforethought", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maliceaforethought", "comment": "", "date": "2018-03-02T18:26:00"}, {"author": "MaliceAforethought", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maliceaforethought", "comment": "Added tags: adaptive, animal, antimemetic, auditory, carnivorous, cognitohazard, explained, intangible, memory-affecting, meta, nocturnal, predatory, scp, sensory, sentient, uncontained, visual.

Date of last edit 3/16/1878.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1841 remains outside containment at this time, as its scale and ephemeral nature make apprehending all those afflicted an impossibility. The person of Mr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is beyond Foundation reach at this time, being under the protection of the Roman Catholic Church and the German Empire. The Foundation shall shadow the movements of Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and communicate via telegraph with constabulatory agencies in all areas through which he performs or travels, and shall provide intelligence and assistance in dispelling any riots or indecent behaviour occurring as a result of his presence.</p>\n<p>Fellows and other members of the Royal Foundation are prohibited from attending performances given by Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, lest they themselves become affected. Any person affected by SCP-1841, presenting a breach of the peace, may be despatched or pacified by any means necessary. Medical examination of infected persons is authorised for the purposes of identifying the means by which SCP-1841 infection is spread. Electrical or manual stimulation of ladies entering a hysterical state as a result of SCP-1841 is authorised as necessary to calm the female urges and prevent improprietous behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1841, referred to in the public press as \"L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 fever\" or \"L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588omania\", is a most curious series of public behaviours engaged in by persons exposed to the public performances of F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a composer and pianist of Hungarian extraction. Through a means yet unknown to science, any person who observes and listens to Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 performing on the piano, whether the works in question are his own compositions or those of other composers, is at risk of contracting SCP-1841, which may endure for from as little as three hours to as many as five years thereafter. Since the existence of SCP-1841 was first documented in Berlin in 1844, primary and secondary infections have affected an unknown number of thousands throughout continental Europe.</p>\n<p>Approximately sixty-three percent of persons exposed to a L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 performance acquire symptoms of SCP-1841. Those of the female sex are more easily swayed by SCP-1841, though men of the younger generation (Bohemians and confirmed bachelors in particular) have also been demonstrated to be easily affected. Initial symptoms begin to manifest during the performance itself, and include raucous cheering and hollering, dancing of a manner inappropriate to the tempo of the composition, heated conversation, and in many cases attempts to touch Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 during his performances, or to abscond with his personal effects, refuse, or broken piano strings. Even during performances themselves, fights have been observed to break out among audience-members over discarded effects such as cigar butts or coffee dregs.</p>\n<p>Following the conclusion of performances, infected persons have often attempted to follow Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to his lodgings, resulting in affray and riotous occurrences requiring police intervention. Persons interviewed following an outbreak of SCP-1841 have insisted on speaking of Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in terms most hagiographic, describing him as the greatest musician to ever live, and venerating any effects stolen from his person as holy relics. Secondary infection is possible as a result of these persons' efforts, who have been noted to \"preach\" Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's graces to as many acquaintances of their own as possible, thereby inoculating those people to seek out an audience with him. In multiple instances when touring within Germany, full-blown outbreaks of SCP-1841 have occurred several days before Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 himself arrived in the city.</p>\n<p>In extreme cases, ladies suffering from SCP-1841 have been observed to suffer hysteria as the result of finding themselves in Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's company, entirely discarding proper decorum and behaving in a manner becoming unto ladies of the evening. Those so afflicted describe elaborate delusions of Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's intimate appeal, to the exclusion even of their own husbands, and cannot be prevented from engaging in brazen and inappropriate behaviours for so long as infection perseveres. Pelvic massage and electrical stimulation have proven effective at temporary dissipation of these behaviours; care must be taken, however, that the lady so afflicted does not at the time have Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 himself in mind, lest the onset of hysterical paroxysm only strengthen the delusion within her.</p>\n<p>The cause of SCP-1841 is unknown. During an interview conducted in 1863, Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 himself denied any understanding of the phenomenon or ability to control it, and stated that he found the hysterical reactions of ladies in attendance at his performances most unsettling. Owing to SCP-1841's curious ability to affect the mind, a connection to the Parisian salon \"Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\" is suspected; no direct evidence of a link between Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and that organisation, however, has to date become known in London.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Show\u00a0addenda</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Hide\u00a0addenda</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Addendum 1841-1 - RFSCP Archives, 7/31/1886</strong></p>\n<p><em>News has reached London this day that F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the man responsible for the spread of SCP-1841, has died in Germany as the result of a pneumoniac infection. As Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's performances are believed to be the sole origin and focus of SCP-1841, and as none of his performances are known to have been recorded on the phonograph, SCP-1841 is now deemed Neutralised. We expect a brief upswell of riotous and hysterical behaviour over the coming weeks during the traditional mourning period, after which infections in those previously afflicted should slowly dissipate.

It is my unfortunate duty to report at this time that this appears to be the case. Based on Research Assistant Wertham's findings, the behavior exhibited by Presley's fans appears to be identical to that exhibited by those afflicted by a neutralized phenomenon designated SCP-1841, a condition which affected fans of composer Franz Liszt in the 19th century. All evidence indicates that the anomalous ability possessed by Liszt to induce irrational behavior in his audiences is now possessed by Presley. I recommend that active containment of SCP-1841 be reinstated at its previous containment level, and that Research Assistant Wertham be assigned to research this recurrence of the phenomenon and draft updated containment procedures as circumstances require. -Dr. Jacobs</em></p>\n<p><em>Request granted. -O5-2</em></p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1841-3 - Memo to the O5 Council, 6/23/1958</strong></p>\n<p><em>Our continuing research into SCP-1841 indicates that the problem is far more widespread than previously thought. Rather than emanating from a single individual, I have currently identified no less than two dozen popular performers who are capable of inducing SCP-1841 behavior in their audiences. In addition, several of these performers are members of the Negro community, suggesting that SCP-1841 has the ability to transcend racial and social barriers. Five of the persons so far identified were not active musicians at the time our study began, suggesting that the number of people capable of inducing this effect is growing. If more drastic measures are not taken to stem this tide, our current models predict SCP-1841 infection will reach pandemic levels no later than 1963, and that widespread civil unrest and chaos will ensue. I recommend that SCP-1841 be upgraded to Keter class and that authorization be granted to take aggressive steps to mitigate the effects of its carriers. I additionally recommend that SCP-1841's containment file be expunged from the primary database and information regarding its current active status be placed on a strict need-to-know basis for persons directly involved in its containment. SCP-1841 is highly virulent, especially among the younger generation, and even the knowledge that these musicians exist and have these abilities could result in an outbreak of secondary infection among our ranks. -Dr. Wertham</em></p>\n<p><em>Request granted. -O5-11</em></p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1841-4 - Memo to the O5 Council, 1/12/1961</strong></p>\n<p><em>I am pleased at this time to report that our measures at containing SCP-1841 appear to have been largely successful. Subject Presley's service in the United States Army has greatly mitigated his ability to spread SCP-1841, and the neutralization of subjects Holly, Richardson, and Valenzuela has prompted several music critics in the media to proclaim that the genre is entirely moribund. Subject Penniman's conversion to our cause has proven fully effective to date, and our disinformation campaign regarding the potential threats of rock-and-roll music has begun to gain traction within the religious conservative community.

Social unrest from SCP-1841 infectees has begun to damage the American war effort in Vietnam and affect the international political process. Within the past two years, various \"festivals\" featuring SCP-1841 carriers have accrued in excess of 100,000 attendees; an upcoming festival planned in upstate New York is currently projected to draw nearly half a million potential new infectees. The time has come for aggressive measures. I propose that the O5 Council authorize a series of covert assassinations of high-profile SCP-1841 carriers, including but not limited to subjects Eliot, Hendrix, Joplin, Lennon, Morrison, and Relf, to be conducted as possible over the next several years, as well as any future assassinations necessary to prevent the further spread of SCP-1841. -Site Director Wertham</em></p>\n<p><em>Request granted.

During a routine audit of MTF expenses, we discovered several unexplained travel expenses and unauthorized movements of Beta-6's officers and men.

MTFL Callahan informed me that the assassinations had been conducted under direct orders from Overwatch Command, and provided me with written documents bearing O5-6's digital signature, ordering the assassinations as part of the containment of SCP-1841.

Date of last edit 3/16/1878.//\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1841 remains outside containment at this time, as its scale and ephemeral nature make apprehending all those afflicted an impossibility. The person of Mr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is beyond Foundation reach at this time, being under the protection of the Roman Catholic Church and the German Empire. The Foundation shall shadow the movements of Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and communicate via telegraph with constabulatory agencies in all areas through which he performs or travels, and shall provide intelligence and assistance in dispelling any riots or indecent behaviour occurring as a result of his presence.\n\n\n\nFellows and other members of the Royal Foundation are prohibited from attending performances given by Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, lest they themselves become affected. Any person affected by SCP-1841, presenting a breach of the peace, may be despatched or pacified by any means necessary. Medical examination of infected persons is authorised for the purposes of identifying the means by which SCP-1841 infection is spread. Electrical or manual stimulation of ladies entering a hysterical state as a result of SCP-1841 is authorised as necessary to calm the female urges and prevent improprietous behaviour.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-1841, referred to in the public press as \"L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 fever\" or \"L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588omania\", is a most curious series of public behaviours engaged in by persons exposed to the public performances of F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a composer and pianist of Hungarian extraction. Through a means yet unknown to science, any person who observes and listens to Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 performing on the piano, whether the works in question are his own compositions or those of other composers, is at risk of contracting SCP-1841, which may endure for from as little as three hours to as many as five years thereafter. Since the existence of SCP-1841 was first documented in Berlin in 1844, primary and secondary infections have affected an unknown number of thousands throughout continental Europe.\n\n\n\nApproximately sixty-three percent of persons exposed to a L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 performance acquire symptoms of SCP-1841. Those of the female sex are more easily swayed by SCP-1841, though men of the younger generation (Bohemians and confirmed bachelors in particular) have also been demonstrated to be easily affected. Initial symptoms begin to manifest during the performance itself, and include raucous cheering and hollering, dancing of a manner inappropriate to the tempo of the composition, heated conversation, and in many cases attempts to touch Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 during his performances, or to abscond with his personal effects, refuse, or broken piano strings. Even during performances themselves, fights have been observed to break out among audience-members over discarded effects such as cigar butts or coffee dregs.\n\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of performances, infected persons have often attempted to follow Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to his lodgings, resulting in affray and riotous occurrences requiring police intervention. Persons interviewed following an outbreak of SCP-1841 have insisted on speaking of Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in terms most hagiographic, describing him as the greatest musician to ever live, and venerating any effects stolen from his person as holy relics. Secondary infection is possible as a result of these persons' efforts, who have been noted to \"preach\" Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's graces to as many acquaintances of their own as possible, thereby inoculating those people to seek out an audience with him. In multiple instances when touring within Germany, full-blown outbreaks of SCP-1841 have occurred several days before Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 himself arrived in the city.\n\n\n\nIn extreme cases, ladies suffering from SCP-1841 have been observed to suffer hysteria as the result of finding themselves in Mr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's company, entirely discarding proper decorum and behaving in a manner becoming unto ladies of the evening.

Incurable servants are to be recruited into the program for incorrigibles as detailed in this report.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Phenomenon 1851-023 is a disorder of the mind exclusive to the Negro race, and most particularly to those segments of the Negro race appropriately employed in servile labor under the tutelage of a white master.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> The primary symptom of the phenomenon is the desire on the part of affected servants to quit their divinely-assigned duties and lands, migrating to territories sympathetic to their situation.

A correlation has been found, however, between the presentation of this form of disobedience and a particular relationship between master and servant. More specifically, those occasions when masters begin to treat servants as though they are of the white race, begin to treat them as equals, are the occasions that seem most likely to lead to this phenomenon. It cannot be emphasized too greatly that Negroes kept in captivity must be reminded of their inferior status with a regular frequency, and must not be allowed to think too highly of themselves. Particulars to avoid include: allowing servants to achieve literacy or numeracy; giving servants the ability to choose their own mates, thus disturbing the thorough planning of masters to maintain stronger bloodlines; and the free practice of Negro Christianity, which tends to undermine the lessons of dependence taught to the Negro by white churches.</p>\n<p>This report compiled July 17th 1851 in accordance with American Secure Containment Initiative protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> The prevalence of Phenomenon 1851-023 among the working and breeding stock owned by many of the Initiative's directors, along with a general sense of civic duty, have prevailed upon the Initiative to take action. Henceforth, Initiative men are to encourage patrollers and police to remand captured Negro escapees into their custody. Dr. Cartwright has put together a particular cohort of unruly servants otherwise unsuited for conventional Negro labor, which he is referring to informally as the Drapetomaniac Class. These are to be put through the most rigorous of duties for the Initiative, those for which loyal servants would be wasted through attrition. \u2014Director Wilson, noted March 31st 1857</p>\n<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> Given the recent political developments, particularly the recent initiation of civil war and its implications for the likely future of Negro servitude, alternate plans are being composed for the future of the Drapetomaniac Class, upon which our research has become rather dependent. \u2014Director Wilson, noted October 4th 1862</p>\n<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> Our fears have come to fruition with the recent proclamation. Henceforth, given our official support for the Northern Union, our policy is to be as follows: Recruitment for D Class is to now take place among prisons, asylums for madmen and madwomen, the chronically indigent, almshouses, and those arrested for vagrancy. This policy, which we are calling the Cartwright Protocol, has the advantage of maintaining a remarkably similar makeup for our D Class while supporting the current regime in the Federal City. \u2014Director Wilson, noted January 4th 1863</p>\n<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> Criticism for our current policies re: D Class recruitment has come from several of our overseas counterparts. Given current policy among the Board of Directors in the mutual attempt at an alliance or merger with organizations with similar aims, the Initiative is to restrict its D class recruitment solely to prisons and, in the event of extreme need, orphanages. In practice, of course, this will change little of the racial makeup of that group. Additionally, those of the D class are to be disposed of in secret and their numbers no longer recorded, except for the Directorate's information. \u2014Director Morris, noted March 17th 1914</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1851-5:</strong> This anomaly declassified and removed 1 January 1916.

It\u2019s not that surprising once you think about it. Yes, we are a secret organization, but that simply means we must work harder on keeping the public both safe and ignorant. Do you know how many gas explosions, overnight murders, and strange disappearances actually occur? It\u2019s not many, or at least not as many as there are recorded. In the course of my experience with SCP-1927-EX, I believe I was the first to discover just how wide the discrepancy was.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI forget who first wrote up SCP-1927-EX. We just called it SCP-1927 back then, you know I\u2019d be lying if I said I knew what SCP-1927 is today. Anyways, the file you\u2019re reading is unedited from its original documentation besides all the \u201c-EX\u201ds and other markers of an explained file. It was even then theoretical, not even seen as a meme or cognitohazard. Simply a global trend. But I remember O5-10 specifically saying \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if the TVs cast an imaginary shadow over the Earth and make us cower into the Dark Ages.\u201d Drama queen. I said I didn\u2019t remember who wrote the first entry for SCP-1927-EX, but I sure as hell know who sponsored it.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"thirdCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('thirdText');\">>Continue Access?</a></div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"thirdText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWord of mouth spread quickly, and soon it was bigger than Bigfoot. You couldn't help but hear the chattering masses. \u201cDid you hear television is an SCP now?\u201d, \u201cHow the hell should I spend Saturday night now?\u201d, \u201cHow come we just don't make them forget, anyways?\u201d The first two questions are irrelevant, but the third inspired some discussion. We didn\u2019t have such an amnestic stockpile as we need today. O5-10 proposed we screw normalcy and burn the TVs to a crisp. O5-7 suggested a countermeme of general optimism. O5-3 would be the one to propose the would-be containment procedures. The vote was a draw, 4-4-4. I abstained from voting. I had never owned a television.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"fourthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('fourthText');\">>Keep Watching?</a></div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"fourthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNormality and Normalcy. Television really sparked the debate. How much influence was too much, how much undermined our mission? The constant noise of the cafeterias turned into a silent paranoia, while the arguing moved to higher levels. It was a crisis atmosphere. I remember standing just across from two O5s screaming at each other, and the two voices combined into this incomprehensible static. In the midst of the heated argument, though one cannot call it an argument when both sides drown out each other with their own voices, I stood up, walked out, and went into the recreation room of Site-01.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOur break-room remains hardly what one would expect for R&R. The enormous room\u2019s walls are covered with bookshelves, filled by thousands upon thousands of centuries-old books, pamphlets, and tomes of Foundation history. Yet, despite the mostly antiquated interior, there was, at the time, a portable Westinghouse set on a small table. I stared at the device for a moment, wondering what it would do to me. Would I notice it? Would the effect work on me? I activated the TV, turned the dials, and sat down as the voice of an old man, only truly meant for radio, filled the airwaves.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt was us.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"fifthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('fifthText');\">>Still watching?</a></div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"fifthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Florencio Hospital explosion, the Minnesota Wood-Chipper Killer, the rotface outbreak in Arlosville, all of them were our doing, our reports, our lies. Switching from channel to channel, more of our doing, the same kinds of incidents, deaths, and disappearances as always. Everyone was so somber, and horrified, and scared. I couldn\u2019t look away. Like kids playing pretend car crash, watching our cars obliterating each other, over and over and over again. There was no meme, no anomaly. Just violence and terror to cover up real fear. The TV simply let me watch it unfold.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI went back into the Council room and everyone fell silent. I took a note card, wrote \u201cNo action necessary\u201d, and put it on the table for all to see. They all looked at me, then at O5-3. O5-7 looked disappointed, while O5-10 was sweating bullets, but I was the most paranoid person in the room. O5-3 simply smiled and started writing in their notebook.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"sixthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('sixthText');\">>Watch</a></div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"sixthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe next few decades have been calmer. SCP-1927 was explained, the media companies were infiltrated and, in most cases, bought out by us, and the technology required to make television was and still is highly controlled by the Foundation. In the end, I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s one channel that isn\u2019t controlled by us. But I think I learned why SCP-1927-EX was initially written. We weren\u2019t trying to save others. We were scaring the public into safety. Now we\u2019re scaring ourselves. Even if we're really safer, sometimes the perception of danger is worse than a gun pointed at your head.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"seventhCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('seventhText');\">>CERTIFY CLEARANCE CHECK</a></div>\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"seventhText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n\n\n<div style=\"border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;\">\n\n<h1>CLEARANCE CHALLENGED</h1>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Please wait at your terminal.

Civilians approaching the Lake are to be turned away on the grounds of the area being scouted out for construction. Due to SCP-1933's memetic effects, removal from the Lake is highly unlikely to occur. Individuals who claim to have seen SCP-1933 are to be administered Class A amnestics, and released. Personnel being transferred to research SCP-1933 are not to be informed of SCP-1933 or any documentation regarding it until they have observed SCP-1933 firsthand. Individuals discovering this document without having first seen SCP-1933 are advised to immediately exit this document, and contact Dr. B. Reynard as soon as possible for Class A amnestics, or observation of SCP-1933.</span> No special containment procedures are required for SCP-1933-EX at this time. Distribution of Class A amnestics to subjects who claim to have observed SCP-1933-EX is currently discontinued.</p>\n<p><strong>Description (REVISED):</strong> SCP-1933-EX is allegedly a creature measuring an estimated 6 to 8 meters in length, residing in Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, British Columbia. Exact details vary from report to report, but SCP-1933-EX is almost always reported to have a long, serpent-like neck and head, a similarly long tail, dark blue coloration, and long, leaf-like protrusions running from the base of its head to the end of its body. However, SCP-1933-EX has been, in each report of sighting, quickly determined to have been a misidentified common occurrence, such as a large piece of driftwood, large eel or fish, or simple unreliable testimony. Recovered 'footage' of SCP-1933-EX has been easily explained by photo or video manipulation, or intentional staging to simulate an SCP-1933-EX encounter. It is most likely that reports of SCP-1933-EX are the result of subjects being influenced by local myths and legends.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Show\u00a0original\u00a0documentation\u00a0for\u00a0SCP-1933-EX</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1933 is an unidentified aquatic creature, measuring an estimated 6-8 meters in length, residing in Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, British Columbia. SCP-1933 is dark blue in coloration, possessing a long, smooth neck and tail, a serpentine head, and numerous leaf-like protrusions running from the base of its head to the end of its body. Details regarding the lower half of SCP-1933's body are predominately unknown, as it has never been observed to beach itself, or surface more than its neck and upper half of its body. As SCP-1933 does not appear to possess gills, it is currently theorized to reside in an underwater cave, which is currently being searched for using sonar. SCP-1933 has been observed camouflaging itself with aquatic plants or fallen trees, and ambushing large prey that approaches the water, as well as preying on passing birds and fish. SCP-1933 has been observed to actively avoid boats in most situations, but has occasionally attacked solitary humans entering or around the lake.</p>\n<p>SCP-1933 possesses a secondary effect, possibly memetic in nature, that causes those who become aware of it from any method except firsthand experience, (including documentation, personal testimony, or video or photo evidence) to become extremely unwilling to consider its existence. This can include finding flaws in a subject's testimony that are not actually present, seeing 'wires' 'animatronics', or 'photo-manipulation' where none are present, or verbally shutting down conversation regarding SCP-1933. This is thought to be the result of a defense mechanism designed to keep potential prey from becoming wary of approaching the lake. While this has caused significant delay in documentation and observation of SCP-1933, it has expedited ensuring civilians do not become aware of SCP-1933. At time of writing, only a small group of researchers are aware of SCP-1933, and a way of informing the rest of the Foundation of its existence, allowing more effective containment, is being researched.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an experiment with the intent of proving the existence of SCP-1933 to the rest of the Foundation will take place.

Civilians approaching the Lake are to be turned away on the grounds of the area being scouted out for construction. Due to SCP-1933's memetic effects, removal from the Lake is highly unlikely to occur.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals who claim to have seen SCP-1933 are to be administered Class A amnestics, and released. Personnel being transferred to research SCP-1933 are not to be informed of SCP-1933 or any documentation regarding it until they have observed SCP-1933 firsthand. Individuals discovering this document without having first seen SCP-1933 are advised to immediately exit this document, and contact Dr. B. Reynard as soon as possible for Class A amnestics, or observation of SCP-1933.-- No special containment procedures are required for SCP-1933-EX at this time. Distribution of Class A amnestics to subjects who claim to have observed SCP-1933-EX is currently discontinued. \n\n\n\n**Description (REVISED):** SCP-1933-EX is allegedly a creature measuring an estimated 6 to 8 meters in length, residing in Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, British Columbia. Exact details vary from report to report, but SCP-1933-EX is almost always reported to have a long, serpent-like neck and head, a similarly long tail, dark blue coloration, and long, leaf-like protrusions running from the base of its head to the end of its body. However, SCP-1933-EX has been, in each report of sighting, quickly determined to have been a misidentified common occurrence, such as a large piece of driftwood, large eel or fish, or simple unreliable testimony. Recovered 'footage' of SCP-1933-EX has been easily explained by photo or video manipulation, or intentional staging to simulate an SCP-1933-EX encounter. It is most likely that reports of SCP-1933-EX are the result of subjects being influenced by local myths and legends. \n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Show original documentation for SCP-1933-EX\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-1933 is an unidentified aquatic creature, measuring an estimated 6-8 meters in length, residing in Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, British Columbia. SCP-1933 is dark blue in coloration, possessing a long, smooth neck and tail, a serpentine head, and numerous leaf-like protrusions running from the base of its head to the end of its body. Details regarding the lower half of SCP-1933's body are predominately unknown, as it has never been observed to beach itself, or surface more than its neck and upper half of its body. As SCP-1933 does not appear to possess gills, it is currently theorized to reside in an underwater cave, which is currently being searched for using sonar. SCP-1933 has been observed camouflaging itself with aquatic plants or fallen trees, and ambushing large prey that approaches the water, as well as preying on passing birds and fish. SCP-1933 has been observed to actively avoid boats in most situations, but has occasionally attacked solitary humans entering or around the lake.\n\n\n\nSCP-1933 possesses a secondary effect, possibly memetic in nature, that causes those who become aware of it from any method except firsthand experience, (including documentation, personal testimony, or video or photo evidence) to become extremely unwilling to consider its existence. This can include finding flaws in a subject's testimony that are not actually present, seeing 'wires' 'animatronics', or 'photo-manipulation' where none are present, or verbally shutting down conversation regarding SCP-1933. This is thought to be the result of a defense mechanism designed to keep potential prey from becoming wary of approaching the lake. While this has caused significant delay in documentation and observation of SCP-1933, it has expedited ensuring civilians do not become aware of SCP-1933. At time of writing, only a small group of researchers are aware of SCP-1933, and a way of informing the rest of the Foundation of its existence, allowing more effective containment, is being researched. \n\n\n\n**Note:** On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an experiment with the intent of proving the existence of SCP-1933 to the rest of the Foundation will take place. SCP-1933 will be lured to the surface using the carcass of one elk, deposited in the middle of Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by boat. Dr. Reynard will then contact MTF Eta-10 (\"See No Evil\") and attempt to live stream an appearance of SCP-1933 directly to them. If this is a success, then we will have taken the first step in successfully containing SCP-1933. If not, then we're probably going to all be brought in for questioning and/or amnestic treatments. Either way, it's been a pleasure working with you all. - B.

Details regarding the case were to be concealed from the general public. The UIU were to report all findings to the Foundation.</p>\n<p>Upon SCP-1949-EX's capture, it was to be transferred to a nearby Foundation facility. Long-term cover-up procedures of the case were to be performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1949-EX were a series of homicides between 1967 to 1969 throughout the midwestern United States. A total of 8 victims were recovered under circumstances appearing ritualistic in nature. Cause of death was by asphyxiation or suffocation although two bodies exhibited signs of cranial trauma.</p>\n<p>Each body was found in a ring of crushed mushrooms mixed with salt in local forests. The eyes, a tooth, a vertebral rib, and a patch of skin were removed from the body. On nearby objects in a 3\u00a0m radius to the victim, unidentified symbols were engraved that faced toward the direction of the corpse. The significance of these symbols were unknown.</p>\n<p>The Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU) brought SCP-1949-EX to the Foundation's attention on September 5, 1967. The corpses of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were found in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest of Indiana. The nature of the deaths attracted the suspicion of the UIU of possible cult-related activity. Foundation agents were sent to monitor the investigation, and attempt to apprehend those responsible for questioning.</p>\n<p>The investigation concluded on March 13, 1969 with the arrest of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

There are no special containment procedures to enact. Submit a request to RAISA personnel to access additional files relevant to the document.\n\n\n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-1949-EX\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Explained\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Agents were to operate alongside the Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU), and local law enforcement in apprehending SCP-1949-EX. Details regarding the case were to be concealed from the general public. The UIU were to report all findings to the Foundation.\n\n\n\nUpon SCP-1949-EX's capture, it was to be transferred to a nearby Foundation facility. Long-term cover-up procedures of the case were to be performed.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-1949-EX were a series of homicides between 1967 to 1969 throughout the midwestern United States. A total of 8 victims were recovered under circumstances appearing ritualistic in nature. Cause of death was by asphyxiation or suffocation although two bodies exhibited signs of cranial trauma.\n\n\n\nEach body was found in a ring of crushed mushrooms mixed with salt in local forests. The eyes, a tooth, a vertebral rib, and a patch of skin were removed from the body. On nearby objects in a 3 m radius to the victim, unidentified symbols were engraved that faced toward the direction of the corpse. The significance of these symbols were unknown.\n\n\n\nThe Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU) brought SCP-1949-EX to the Foundation's attention on September 5, 1967. The corpses of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were found in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest of Indiana. The nature of the deaths attracted the suspicion of the UIU of possible cult-related activity. Foundation agents were sent to monitor the investigation, and attempt to apprehend those responsible for questioning.\n\n\n\nThe investigation concluded on March 13, 1969 with the arrest of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Therefore, the contents of his journal entries are most likely just mad ramblings. All actions committed by the subject were simply the result of a delusion, and displayed no anomalous effect when recreated. The subjects claims of having a sister named \"Abby\" are false. No siblings are listed in any record. It is considered to be another delusion of the subject. Nothing anomalous was found at any crime scenes or at Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's home.\n\n> \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0I have submitted a separate request for him to be transfered to the D-Class program.

Selected affiliate physicists and Foundation researchers are to continue any ongoing research on SCP-1964 until an understanding of the phenomenon is reached.</p>\n<p>Research pertaining to SCP-1964 is to be closely monitored by the Foundation in case of any potential breakthrough. Foundation researchers assigned to SCP-1964 are not to engage in traditional scientific research, but are instead to devise procedures that attempt to identify potential anomalous properties. Research on SCP-1964 is based in Site-11.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1964 is the phenomenon of 'mass' in quantum physics.</p>\n<p>Given that gauge bosons are required to have unbroken gauge symmetry, this phenomenon runs counter to our understanding of physics: it fundamentally breaks gauge symmetry and no mechanism has as of yet been discovered which allows this.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-760981-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-760981-1')\">1</a></sup> The mass exhibited by such particles as the W and Z bosons has gone unexplained by scientists: the best current theories return nonsensical infinite results when mass is given to these particles.</p>\n<p>An unknown mechanism, designated SCP-1964-A, prevents such predictions from coming to fruition. Current theories as to its nature include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reality warping agent manipulating events</li>\n<li>A massless mediating particle</li>\n<li>Intervention by SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the mechanism preventing these worrying predictions from occurring is to fail, a ZK-Class Reality Failure Event is likely to occur. At this time, the Foundation has no method to contain the phenomenon.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1964-A</strong><br/>\nProposal to upgrade SCP-1964 from Euclid to Keter given its worrying implications on the universe as we know it.</p>\n<p>- Senior Researcher Williams</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Approved.</p>\n<p>Due to the potentially destructive nature of SCP-1964, research into its inner workings is now a high priority.</p>\n<p>- O5-\u2588\u2588</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>TEST LOG-1964-01:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SCP-1964 Testing</strong><br/>\nThese tests are being overseen by Senior Researcher Williams on March 1957.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Procedure:</strong><br/>\nVarious SCPs are to be asked if they posses any knowledge pertaining to SCP-1964-A. The designated questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you posses any information about SCP-1964-A?</li>\n<li>Can you shed light on its inner workings?</li>\n<li>Is it SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, or another reality warping anomaly?</li>\n<li>Based on your knowledge of our operation, is the Foundation close to gaining an understanding of this phenomenon?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>\nThe questioned SCPs provided nearly no relevant information or acted evasively. Results are overall inconclusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations:</strong><br/>\nSCPs tested who were known to be knowledgeable about/posses reality warping abilities were quick to dismiss this proposition. Given this and the scope of SCP-1964-A's effects, it is likely reasonable to assume that SCP-1964-A is not the result of a reality warping agent.<br/>\nSCPs who provided any response to the final question typically replied something to the effect of \"I have my doubts as to if the Foundation will ever figure it out.\" This suggests our currents methods are irreparably flawed. Further testing will continue following approval to experiment with the use of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 as a stand-in for SCP-1964-A.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1964-B</strong><br/>\nProposal to use SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 in case of the collapse of SCP-1964-A, potentially averting a ZK-Class Reality Failure Event.</p>\n<p>- Senior Researcher Williams</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Granted.</p>\n<p>Staff assigned to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 have been informed of the new procedure.

In addition, it also failed to give mass in any form to photons or gluons.</p>\n<p>This test has been deemed a <strong>failure.</strong> Research on SCP-1964 remains a top priority and other potential stand-ins are currently being considered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1964-C</strong><br/>\nAs of 19/10/1964 it appears that SCP-1964 may now be an understood, non-anomalous, phenomenon.

The predicted outcome of this is the potential appearance of the so-called 'Higgs boson'. Several measurement instruments including a modified electron microscope are to be fitted around the points of collision.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>\nNo abnormalities or new particles detected.

SCP-2014-RU can be observed on most of the combatants.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2014-RU</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid (provisional)</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation's agents planted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation and the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation are tasked with locating, detecting and confiscating SCP-2014-RU specimens from corpses, prisoners of war and civilians, as well as from seized inventories. Due to the context of the object's employment, access to the relevant documentation should be restricted to the staff of this Branch until the source of SCP-2014-RU can be definitively established.</p>\n<p>If a live carrier or unused specimen is seized, it shall be transported immediately to the nearest properly equipped Branch facility for further examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> The object constitutes a yellow adhesive tape, visually identical to the packing tape of the same colour. Although the analysis of the used samples has not yet revealed any deviations of chemical or physical structure from the typical substances and composition of the non-anomalous product, the nature of the anomalous properties of the object suggests such differences in the active samples. Therefore, their securement and further research constitute a high-priority task.</p>\n<p>SCP-2014-RU is widely employed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Ukrainian volunteer military units involved in the conflict in the east of the country. It may usually be observed in key frontline positions and on advanced units during combat operations. The origin of the object has not yet been established; stability of the form and supply suggests the existence of a single source \u2014 either in the form of centralised production facilities, or in the form of several production points that coordinate and employ common technical standards and production technologies. The information available to the Branch indicates the absence of <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ua#PORA\">independent groups</a> in Ukraine that would be both capable of producing anomalous items and interested in participating in the abovementioned conflict.</p>\n<p>Anomalous properties of the object are manifested when it is applied to the clothes or body of a living person, and cease either with their death or after an indefinite period of time following it. They can vary depending on the width, number of layers and place of tape application, as well as, apparently, the carriers themselves. At the time of writing, the following manifestations of SCP-2014-RU properties have been recorded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improved accuracy of firearms. During the analysis of video data from the battles for Slovyansk, Donetsk Oblast, it was established that some members of Ukrainian volunteer and freshly mobilised army units demonstrated shooting accuracy 40% higher than modelled for their civilian professions, even if accounting for the standard error. Thus, Agent Vorobiov, who was at that time attached to the 1st Detached Motorised Infantry Brigade of the 1st Army Corps of the DPR Peoples Militia as s Deputy Commander of the Technical Support Company, has been terminated by a gunshot from a distance of 790 meters. The shooter has been later identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 a programmer from the Irpin city of Kyiv Oblast, with no previous military record. Similar cases have been repeatedly reported for teachers, musicians, librarians and other civilian professions in no way related to the firearms expertise. This effect usually correlates with SCP-2014-RU being applied to subjects' arms and is usually observed during offensives;</li>\n<li>decreased sensitivity of pain receptors, as well as interference with standard nervous' and endocrine system's reaction to trauma. This allows the subjects to withstand injuries that are usually incompatible with active operation.

When the cow had calmed down, Anakara, who had a beard of grey and hair crowned with hawk feathers, stood up from the bonfire, took his hammer in both of his hands, and struck her hard in the abdomen. The horned one roared, and dropped her child, but restrained she could do naught. Anakara then snatched the dagger from his right scabbard, took off the baby's caul, and carefully inserted the blade into their abdomen, cutting the convulsive frail body from top to bottom. After removing the bowels, Anakara unfolded them to their full length and cut guts into short ribbons, which he then wrapped around the arms of as many men as there were ribbons and placed them in the front row.

SCP-2014-RU can be observed on most of the combatants.| width= 400px]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-2014-RU\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid (provisional)\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation's agents planted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation and the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation are tasked with locating, detecting and confiscating SCP-2014-RU specimens from corpses, prisoners of war and civilians, as well as from seized inventories. Due to the context of the object's employment, access to the relevant documentation should be restricted to the staff of this Branch until the source of SCP-2014-RU can be definitively established.\n\n\n\nIf a live carrier or unused specimen is seized, it shall be transported immediately to the nearest properly equipped Branch facility for further examination.\n\n\n\n**Description:** The object constitutes a yellow adhesive tape, visually identical to the packing tape of the same colour. Although the analysis of the used samples has not yet revealed any deviations of chemical or physical structure from the typical substances and composition of the non-anomalous product, the nature of the anomalous properties of the object suggests such differences in the active samples. Therefore, their securement and further research constitute a high-priority task.\n\n\n\nSCP-2014-RU is widely employed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Ukrainian volunteer military units involved in the conflict in the east of the country. It may usually be observed in key frontline positions and on advanced units during combat operations. The origin of the object has not yet been established; stability of the form and supply suggests the existence of a single source -- either in the form of centralised production facilities, or in the form of several production points that coordinate and employ common technical standards and production technologies. The information available to the Branch indicates the absence of [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ua#PORA |independent groups]]] in Ukraine that would be both capable of producing anomalous items and interested in participating in the abovementioned conflict.\n\n\n\nAnomalous properties of the object are manifested when it is applied to the clothes or body of a living person, and cease either with their death or after an indefinite period of time following it. They can vary depending on the width, number of layers and place of tape application, as well as, apparently, the carriers themselves. At the time of writing, the following manifestations of SCP-2014-RU properties have been recorded:\n\n\n\n* improved accuracy of firearms. During the analysis of video data from the battles for Slovyansk, Donetsk Oblast, it was established that some members of Ukrainian volunteer and freshly mobilised army units demonstrated shooting accuracy 40% higher than modelled for their civilian professions, even if accounting for the standard error. Thus, Agent Vorobiov, who was at that time attached to the 1st Detached Motorised Infantry Brigade of the 1st Army Corps of the DPR Peoples Militia as s Deputy Commander of the Technical Support Company, has been terminated by a gunshot from a distance of 790 meters. The shooter has been later identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 -- a programmer from the Irpin city of Kyiv Oblast, with no previous military record. Similar cases have been repeatedly reported for teachers, musicians, librarians and other civilian professions in no way related to the firearms expertise. This effect usually correlates with SCP-2014-RU being applied to subjects' arms and is usually observed during offensives;\n\n* decreased sensitivity of pain receptors, as well as interference with standard nervous' and endocrine system's reaction to trauma. This allows the subjects to withstand injuries that are usually incompatible with active operation. Illustrative is the example recorded by the servicemen of the 31st Detached Guards Air Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during their offensive near Ilovaisk, Donetsk Oblast. When they stormed one of the Ukrainian strongpoints as a part of the general encirclement effort, a VOG-25M[[footnote]]40 mm shrapnel grenade for under-barrel launchers.[[/footnote]] was fired directly into the pillbox's embrasure, exploding inside. Despite that, machine-gun fire, directed at the unit, continued for four more minutes; when the shooting ceased and the assault squad entered the room, it found a body of a soldier with his legs torn off above the knees, his right arm slashed heavily with shrapnel, still clutching the machine gun, and SCP-2014-RU on his bulletproof vest and helmet. Such place of application is considered to be typical for this kind of effect;\n\n* increased endurance. Aerial photography has repeatedly recorded the forced marches of infantry units, the distance and speed of which exceeded those modelled for the relevant terrain and personnel anthropometry. Interestingly, as in the previous case, SCP-2014-RU was mainly applied to the bulletproof vests and helmets of the marchers.\n\n\n\n**Expert assessments of the possible nature of the object:**\n\n\n\n> The sum of available observations and known characteristics of SCP-2014-RU allows us to draw a well-founded conclusion that we are dealing with a thaumaturgical product, to which similar can be found in most of the warlike nations of the world -- including the Sarmatians, who previously lived within the territories of the modern Ukraine.

SCP-2140-CI was created through <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-914/offset/1\">Test 914-0269</a> with SCP-914. No record of Test 914-0269 exists outside of its documentation and SCP-2140-CI, which was reported missing soon after. Reconstruction of the exact event was hindered by several personnel who would have been responsible for overseeing such a test having died days prior to the incident through various circumstances.</p>\n<p>The Foundation only came in contact with SCP-2140-CI again when the image was uploaded to the terminals of various Foundation personnel by the Chaos Insurgency. As soon as the Foundation became aware of this, affected personnel were either terminated or exposed to SCP-2140-EX. Among the personnel re-exposed to SCP-2140-EX, none were found to be Insurgency moles. Among the terminated, only three personnel were found to be moles. It is now assumed that SCP-2140-CI <a href=\"/sc-48-404-97-786\">never worked</a>, with the termination of specific Foundation personnel being the intended goal. Notably, SCP-2140-CI was created through the '1:1' setting of SCP-914 and should therefore have similar properties to SCP-2140-EX.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The investigation revealed that Project Kali was never finished. The current version of SCP-2140-EX is a non-functional prototype of SCP-2140 that was nevertheless put into use after Project Kali could not acquire personnel for enough separate teams to finish the project.</p>\n<p>The fact that only very few experiments on subjects without the 2/2140-EX clearance exist can be attributed to the assumption by Foundation personnel that SCP-2140-EX was working as intended. Investigator Lambrecht's theory is supported by the fact that experiments with SCP-2140-EX have historically always been accepted as having been completed when only Foundation personnel were the intended target. This was done to prevent a \"loop\" in which experiments are always rescheduled to target test subjects instead of Foundation personnel. As a consequence, the non-existence of experiments on test subjects was accepted as normal and never questioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Excerpt Appendix G:</strong></p>\n<p>Following the investigation SCP-2140-EX was provisionally classified as Explained.

No record of Test 914-0269 exists outside of its documentation and SCP-2140-CI, which was reported missing soon after. Reconstruction of the exact event was hindered by several personnel who would have been responsible for overseeing such a test having died days prior to the incident through various circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation only came in contact with SCP-2140-CI again when the image was uploaded to the terminals of various Foundation personnel by the Chaos Insurgency. As soon as the Foundation became aware of this, affected personnel were either terminated or exposed to SCP-2140-EX. Among the personnel re-exposed to SCP-2140-EX, none were found to be Insurgency moles. Among the terminated, only three personnel were found to be moles. It is now assumed that SCP-2140-CI [[[sc-48-404-97-786|never worked]]], with the termination of specific Foundation personnel being the intended goal. Notably, SCP-2140-CI was created through the '1:1' setting of SCP-914 and should therefore have similar properties to SCP-2140-EX.[[footnote]] Further details about SCP-2140-CI may be found in Appendix C.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nThe investigation revealed that Project Kali was never finished. The current version of SCP-2140-EX is a non-functional prototype of SCP-2140 that was nevertheless put into use after Project Kali could not acquire personnel for enough separate teams to finish the project.\n\n\n\nThe fact that only very few experiments on subjects without the 2/2140-EX clearance exist can be attributed to the assumption by Foundation personnel that SCP-2140-EX was working as intended. Investigator Lambrecht's theory is supported by the fact that experiments with SCP-2140-EX have historically always been accepted as having been completed when only Foundation personnel were the intended target. This was done to prevent a \"loop\" in which experiments are always rescheduled to target test subjects instead of Foundation personnel. As a consequence, the non-existence of experiments on test subjects was accepted as normal and never questioned. \n\n\n\n**Excerpt Appendix G:**\n\n\n\nFollowing the investigation SCP-2140-EX was provisionally classified as Explained. The [[[SCP-5226|Explanation and Research Department]]] reviewed the Reclassification. The Department found several open questions that need to be answered before a full classification and corresponding treatment of an Explained SCP.\n\n\n\n* The fact that while SCP-2140-EX has failed from time to time, the image was still only viewed by Foundation personnel with appropriate clearance to an overly significant amount.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0The fact that SCP-2140-EX was tested on civilians exactly once.\n\n* The fact that the non-functionality of SCP-2140-EX was only noticed now and not at one of its previous failures.\n\n* The fact that the assumption of SCP-2140-EX \"working as intended\" was not present during the early days of its usage.\n\n* The fact that not enough separate teams could be created to complete Project Kali despite enough resources being blocked for it at the start of the project.\n\n* The fact that Senior Researcher Quansah, Director of Outpost 457 before the current Director Bawumia, would have participated in Project Kali but decided to retire[[footnote]]Quansah chose the amnestics retirement plan.[[/footnote]] after being hit by a car the day before the Project started. Quansah\u2019s only statement about the reason for his retirement was a concern about \"Daevite Ritual Compensation\".\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"4/BASILISK CLEARANCE REQUIRED\" hide=\"DISPLAYING SCP-2140-EX\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=image 2140-EX.png style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 1px; max-width: 50%\" ]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]] \n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 2140-EX.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user ethagon]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Additional Notes:** Based off image from [[[SCP-2140]]] by [[*user petrograd]]\n\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> ----\n\n> **Filename:** Glyph3PetrogradFixed.png\n\n> **Author:** Juan Carlos Porcel\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://elderprops.tumblr.com/89934858272 Elderprops]\n\n> ----\n\n> **Name:** logo.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user far2]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [/ SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["ethagon-s-author-page", "scp-2140", "scp-6471", "scp-076", "incident-zero-part-1", "scp-682", "experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682#682-2140", "scp-5582", "scp-5582-containment-log#5582-2140", "scp-7017", "experiment-log-914/offset/1", "sc-48-404-97-786", "scp-5226", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-2140-EX", "scp_number": 2140, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "chaos-insurgency", "daevite", "explained", "foundation-made", "historical", "inscription", "remixcon2023", "scp", "thaumiel", "visual"], "title": "SCP-2140-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2140-ex"}, "SCP-2346-EX": {"created_at": "2024-07-26T23:01:00", "creator": "Queerious", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Queerious", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/queerious", "comment": "", "date": "2024-07-26T23:01:00"}, {"author": "Queerious", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/queerious", "comment": "Added tags: concept, explained, keter, mathematical, pending, scp.

Dr. Endicott logged a total of 2,346 instances between 07/06/2004-19/05/2005, 1,058 of which were submitted during the three months prior to his suspension. Upon detailed investigation, no causal link was found between the reported instances.</p>\n<p>In fact, further investigation revealed a further 13,327 instances of the sequence '2346' in documents related to or created by Dr. Endicott that were neither reported, nor correlated to any anomalous effects. It is the conclusion of both the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Replication Studies that any correlations between '2346' and negative consequences were the direct result of selective perception by Dr. Endicott.</p>\n<p>On 03/07/2005, after Dr. Endicott failed to return to work at the conclusion of his suspension, Foundation agents were dispatched to perform a wellness check, accompanied by Site Psychiatrist Dr. Erza Fisher. A written statement from Dr. Fisher is provided below.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>On the 3rd of July, I was dispatched to perform a wellness check on Dr. Endicott, a Foundation researcher, due to concerns of his worsening mental state. Upon our arrival, Dr. Endicott greeted us at the door, appearing disheveled and gaunt. He quickly ushered us in, before shutting the door. I observed as he performed as series of knocks: 2, then 3, then 4, then 6, muttering under his breath as he did.</p>\n<p>Dr. Endicott led us into his sitting room, where the walls had been covered with pages of documents, hospital records, overdue bill notices and a variety of unrelated advertisements or flyers. Each one was covered in notation, each instance containing the sequence of numbers '2346'. The room was disorderly, full of piles of trash and takeout. Dr. Endicott sat in a stool, staring at the wall of pages, seemingly ignoring us.</p>\n<p>He then stated \"You know? It's kinda funny. It's all my fault. But none of you believed that.\" After asking questions to clarify, Dr. Endicott became distressed, ranting and violently tearing at the pages on the walls. The agents present moved to draw their weapons, but, at my order, stopped and left Dr. Endicott and I alone. I observed Dr. Endicott sink to the floor, gripping a sheet of paper tight in his hands.</p>\n<p>I asked Dr. Endicott what he was holding, at which point he stated: \"I'm sorry. I killed him. I should have noticed. I should have been more careful. 2,3,4,6. So yeah. I killed him. He didn't trust me. Why didn't Charles trust me anymore? I just. I knew better. The doctors didn't understand. I'm smarter than those brainless doctors. 2,3,4,6. They didn't. Nobody else understood. Charles didn't understand either. It was everywhere, ruining my life. Those numbers. The same sequence. 2346, again and again. Again and again and again just \u2014 Never 2,3,4,5. Of course not. That would make sense. 2346 is more clever than that. It hides. In plain sight. Lurking around every corner. But I got distracted, you know? Fuck me. I was worried. Charles was getting worse. I had to get him out. Back home. Away from there. I wasn't thinking straight. I wasn't focused, I wasn't prepared \u2014 2,3,4,6 \u2014 I wasn't. I wasn't thinking. I just didn't notice. I know I should have noticed. I didn't. I didn't notice. Should have known better. I didn't notice it, not then.\"</p>\n<p>At that point, Dr. Endicott stopped responding to my questions. After multiple attempts to resume communication between us, Dr. Endicott shook his head, and handed a sheet of paper to me. At this point, he began to repeat the sequence of phrases: \"I didn't. I didn't notice. Should have known better. I didn't notice it, not then.\"</p>\n<p>Upon review, the page I was given was a hospital discharge bill, dated 19/05/2005. The total, circled in red was \"$23,468.21\". It was then I noticed another page on the wall; an autopsy report for one Charles Endicott. It was mostly obscured with Dr. Endicott's writings, but the time of death was encircled in red: 11:46PM.</p>\n<p>I asked Dr. Endicott what had happened to Charles, at which point, Dr. Endicott froze. In the only moment of true lucidity that I noted during my visit, he spoke and said: \"I wish I had seen the total, maybe then I could have saved Charles. I just\u2026 didn't notice.\", before returning to his former repetition.</p>\n<p>It is plain to see that Dr. Endicott is a man in pain. His obsession with SCP-2346 has taken over his entire life, defining not only how he perceives the world, but also in how he copes. His compulsive behaviors have taken over his entire being, SCP-2346 being integrated in every part of his routine, occupying his entire life. Dr. Endicott is terrified of breaking those rituals; after all, in his mind, that sequence killed his husband. It's tough to make out through his hand writing, but the ME report lists the cause of death as 'heart attack due to comorbidity'. Nothing about the situation was anomalous, and yet, to him, it was real.</p>\n<p>At the Foundation, we train our researchers to notice the unnoticeable. We praise those who find the anomalous in the mundane, promote the scientists who overwork themselves, pushing themselves along the delicate balance between greatness and self-destruction.

It is presented in the original form, as updates to the file have been deemed irrelevant following said review. Relevant notes have been left throughout, to provide clarification.\n\n\n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-2346[[footnote]] SCP-2346-EX [[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Keter/Pending[[footnote]] Explained [[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Endicott is to monitor any and all communications, missives or daily events for instances of SCP-2346.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2346 is an anomalous sequence of numbers, \"2346\" that appears in ~85% of all written material observed by Dr. Endicott. Whether the anomalous sequence was already present, or is inserted when observed by Dr. Endicott is currently unknown -- SCP-2346 appears to be the result of a sentient being that targets exclusively Dr. Endicott for unknown reasons.\n\n\n\nEach time Dr. Endicott observes an instance of SCP-2346, the resulting anomalous effect is of minor negative consequence. If Dr. Endicott fails to notice a new instance of SCP-2346, the resulting anomalous effect has widespread or disastrous consequences.\n\n\n\nResearch into the origins and mechanics behind SCP-2346 are under investigation. A non-comprehensive list of notable SCP-2346 instances is included below:\n\n\n\n||~ Date ||~ Document ||~ Sequence Excerpt ||~ Consequence ||\n\n|| 07/06/2004 || Foundation Issue ID || ID# 9472346012 || Dr. Endicott appears blinking in their ID Photo. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//When I first got my ID, the sequence jumped out at me. '2346'. Nondescript, but unexpected. It caught my eye.// ||\n\n|| 19/06/2004 || Chocolate Box Barcode || fDs-2346-SkD || Dr. Endicott is seen choking on a chocolate, but suffers no permanent damage. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//God I'm embarrassed. The first gift Charles sends me at work and I end up choking in front of my boss.//||\n\n|| 30/06/2004 || Digital Clock Error || 11:46PM || The digital clock in Dr. Endicott's office froze and was stuck on 11:46PM. This wasn't noticed until 2:34AM on 01/07/2024. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I can't believe I missed our date night. Charles stayed up for me the entire time, half-awake on the couch when I got home. I'm slipping, and I don't know why.//||\n\n|| 11/07/2004 || Calorie Intake Log || 2,346 Calories || Dr. Endicott goes significantly over his caloric intake target for the next week. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Charles has got us both on this new diet where we're counting calories. Don't tell him, but I've been fudging my numbers -- it's only because I keep staying late and binging on vending machine snacks.//||\n\n|| 09/08/2004 || Receipt from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 || Total: $23.46 || Dr. Endicott's order of lab coats is delivered. All are size 'XXS'. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I wanted to surprise Charles for our anniversary, so I stopped at an adult boutique on the way home.

He went bust, with High Card of 6. His lost chips equated to ~3 months salary. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Charles can't find out, it was stupid and I shouldn't have taken that risk. I should have seen it. Maybe if I work some later nights, I can hide this?//||\n\n|| 18/08/2004 || Resubmitted Invoice || Number 02832723468 || Dr. Endicott's invoice contained errors, and was denied. It was also denied for similar reasons on the next two attempts. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I'm falling apart here. I'm on-Site, what, 15 hours a day? I barely see Charles anymore, and I feel like shit, but I have to make it up to him. It'll be worth it in the long run. Right?//||\n\n|| 21/08/2004 || Gift Basket || Contents: 2 Bottles of Wine, 3 Candles, 4 Gourmet Spreads and 6 Incense Blends. || Dr. Endicott tripped while leaving the Site and hit his head on the curb. Dr. Endicott was embarrassed, but unharmed. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I don't even care, I'm too excited.

I didn't notice the sequence until months later.//||\n\n|| 19/12/2004 || Christmas String Lights || Bulbs in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th position were burned out. || Dr. Endicott requested additional time off from work. It was denied. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I can't believe it. First, I burned the turkey, then I was denied extra time off? I've been neglecting Charles and I feel terrible, I need to make it up to him.//||\n\n|| 31/12/2005 || Restaurant Address || 2346 Lillard Way || Dr. Endicott fails to appear for their scheduled shift. They receive a formal reprimand. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I don't give a fuck. For the first night in a long time, I got to be with Charles. I wouldn't trade that for the world.//||\n\n|| 03/01/2005 || Foundation Issue Door Lock || Lock# 2346984 || Dr. Endicott forgets their keys inside their office and is locked out for 2 hours, 34 minutes and 06 seconds. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I'm all over the place lately. Charles was doing great on New Years, but he's staying in bed more and more. I wish I could be home to look after him, but I need to keep my job.//||\n\n|| 23/01/2005 || Locker Combination || 11-23-46 || Dr. Endicott is unable to remember the first two digits of the combination, and in frustration, breaks a Foundation issued tablet. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//This has to be something more. Something is after me, something is after Charles. And I keep seeing it, over and over and over again. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but at this point... it's anomalous, right?//||\n\n|| 17/02/2005 || Personal Letter|| Zip Code: 92346 || Charles Endicott, Dr. Endicott's husband, gets a flat tire while driving home from visiting family. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I should have gone with him, but I couldn't get the time off. Charles was staying with family in Highland while he saw a specialist. Nobody's sure what's going on, and I'm terrified. The letter just made it sting more.//||\n\n|| 21/04/2005 || After Action Report || Report Number #493234601 || Dr. Endicott informed his superior of the repeated sequence, and his belief that it was an anomaly, but was dismissed at the time. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Nobody believes me. It's not just me though, the data doesn't lie. Something is going on.//||\n\n|| 28/04/2005 || Voicemail Transcript || \"Dr. Endicott? This is Sarah. Please call me back. We need to talk about Charles.\" || Dr. Endicott was observed storming out of his performance review in tears. His promotion request was denied. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//No way. This isn't real. I can't take it. What the fuck do I do?//||\n\n|| 05/05/2005 || Dr. Endicott's Credit Card || Last 4 Digits: 2346 || Dr. Endicott's new credit card was rejected by all vending machines on Site. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//It has to be 2346. I keep seeing it, day in, day out. I feel like I'm going insane. Charles is in and out of the hospital every day now, meanwhile, I'm stuck at the fucking Site and still things are going wrong. What am I going to do?//||\n\n|| 16/05/2005 || Plane Ticket || Reference #: 02023461 || Dr. Endicott noticed the sequence right before Charles Endicott boarded the plane, and was able to convince him to take the next flight. Flight OF-2346 disappeared approximately 3775.5 kilometers into their flight plan, and has not been found. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Fuck. I can't believe I almost missed it. If I had... I can't think about that. Charles was going to see a specialist; I asked the Foundation if they could help, but I was told that 'the health of non-employees is outside of the scope of our concerns'. Assholes. I need to figure this out. It's not safe anymore.//||\n\n|| 17/05/2005 || Internal Foundation Records Search || \"12346 Results Found\" || Dr. Endicott's computer crashed, and had to be replaced. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//It's making fun of me now. Why does nobody else believe me? Bad things are happening, I know I can prove it.// ||\n\n|| 18/05/2005 || Lab Entry Code || 2346# || The entry code to the lab was randomized, per procedure. Despite proper entry, Dr. Endicott was unable to enter the lab. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Why does nobody else believe me? How am I the only one noticing things?//||\n\n|| 18/05/2005 || Car Odometer || 23460 Miles || Dr. Endicott did not notice the odometer tick over from 23459 to 23460. Their car engine shut off, and could not be restarted. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//I can't deal with this today. I need to get home.//||\n\n|| 19/05/2005 || Incoming Phone Number || \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588-2346 || Dr. Endicott missed the phone call, as they were at the hospital at the time. Medical staff report that Dr. Endicott was seen screaming at a doctor. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Leave him alone.//||\n\n|| 19/05/2005 || Hospital Room Number || Floor 2, Room 346 || Dr. Endicott refuses to enter the room upon noticing the number. Despite their protests, the room is unable to be changed. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//What do you want from me? Why can't you leave me alone?//||\n\n|| 19/05/2005 || Hospital Chimes || Note Sequence: BCDF || Dr. Endicott becomes agitated upon hearing the chime, and is heard yelling \"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\" They are forcibly ejected from the hospital. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//You thought you could sneak it past me, didn't you? I have perfect pitch you dick. BCDF? It's everywhere, I keep seeing it. In the paper. In my emails. License plates, reports, receipts, puzzle answers, dates, everything. I'm surrounded by 2346 and it's ruining my life.//||\n\n|| 19/05/2005 || Clinical Trial Results || Success Rate: 2.346% || Dr. Endicott misses a review meeting and is suspended for a failure to complete their work. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//Look. 2346? You can fuck with me, you can ruin my career, you can hurt me. But leave Charles out of this.//||\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\nFollowing Dr. Endicott's suspension, an internal review began due to concerns surrounding the quickly degrading mental state shown in the submitted instances. Dr. Endicott logged a total of 2,346 instances between 07/06/2004-19/05/2005, 1,058 of which were submitted during the three months prior to his suspension. Upon detailed investigation, no causal link was found between the reported instances.\n\n\n\nIn fact, further investigation revealed a further 13,327 instances of the sequence '2346' in documents related to or created by Dr. Endicott that were neither reported, nor correlated to any anomalous effects. It is the conclusion of both the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Replication Studies that any correlations between '2346' and negative consequences were the direct result of selective perception by Dr. Endicott.\n\n\n\nOn 03/07/2005, after Dr. Endicott failed to return to work at the conclusion of his suspension, Foundation agents were dispatched to perform a wellness check, accompanied by Site Psychiatrist Dr. Erza Fisher. A written statement from Dr. Fisher is provided below.\n\n\n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\nOn the 3rd of July, I was dispatched to perform a wellness check on Dr. Endicott, a Foundation researcher, due to concerns of his worsening mental state. Upon our arrival, Dr. Endicott greeted us at the door, appearing disheveled and gaunt. He quickly ushered us in, before shutting the door. I observed as he performed as series of knocks: 2, then 3, then 4, then 6, muttering under his breath as he did.\n\n\n\nDr. Endicott led us into his sitting room, where the walls had been covered with pages of documents, hospital records, overdue bill notices and a variety of unrelated advertisements or flyers. Each one was covered in notation, each instance containing the sequence of numbers '2346'. The room was disorderly, full of piles of trash and takeout. Dr. Endicott sat in a stool, staring at the wall of pages, seemingly ignoring us.\n\n\n\nHe then stated \"You know? It's kinda funny. It's all my fault. But none of you believed that.\" After asking questions to clarify, Dr. Endicott became distressed, ranting and violently tearing at the pages on the walls. The agents present moved to draw their weapons, but, at my order, stopped and left Dr. Endicott and I alone. I observed Dr. Endicott sink to the floor, gripping a sheet of paper tight in his hands.\n\n\n\nI asked Dr. Endicott what he was holding, at which point he stated: \"I'm sorry. I killed him. I should have noticed. I should have been more careful. 2,3,4,6. So yeah. I killed him. He didn't trust me. Why didn't Charles trust me anymore? I just. I knew better. The doctors didn't understand. I'm smarter than those brainless doctors. 2,3,4,6. They didn't. Nobody else understood. Charles didn't understand either. It was everywhere, ruining my life. Those numbers. The same sequence. 2346, again and again. Again and again and again just -- Never 2,3,4,5. Of course not. That would make sense. 2346 is more clever than that. It hides. In plain sight. Lurking around every corner. But I got distracted, you know? Fuck me. I was worried. Charles was getting worse. I had to get him out. Back home. Away from there. I wasn't thinking straight. I wasn't focused, I wasn't prepared -- 2,3,4,6 -- I wasn't. I wasn't thinking. I just didn't notice. I know I should have noticed. I didn't. I didn't notice. Should have known better. I didn't notice it, not then.\"\n\n\n\nAt that point, Dr. Endicott stopped responding to my questions. After multiple attempts to resume communication between us, Dr. Endicott shook his head, and handed a sheet of paper to me. At this point, he began to repeat the sequence of phrases: \"I didn't. I didn't notice. Should have known better. I didn't notice it, not then.\"\n\n\n\nUpon review, the page I was given was a hospital discharge bill, dated 19/05/2005. The total, circled in red was \"$23,468.21\". It was then I noticed another page on the wall; an autopsy report for one Charles Endicott. It was mostly obscured with Dr. Endicott's writings, but the time of death was encircled in red: 11:46PM.\n\n\n\nI asked Dr. Endicott what had happened to Charles, at which point, Dr. Endicott froze. In the only moment of true lucidity that I noted during my visit, he spoke and said: \"I wish I had seen the total, maybe then I could have saved Charles. I just... didn't notice.\", before returning to his former repetition.\n\n\n\nIt is plain to see that Dr. Endicott is a man in pain. His obsession with SCP-2346 has taken over his entire life, defining not only how he perceives the world, but also in how he copes. His compulsive behaviors have taken over his entire being, SCP-2346 being integrated in every part of his routine, occupying his entire life. Dr. Endicott is terrified of breaking those rituals; after all, in his mind, that sequence killed his husband. It's tough to make out through his hand writing, but the ME report lists the cause of death as 'heart attack due to comorbidity'. Nothing about the situation was anomalous, and yet, to him, it was real.\n\n\n\nAt the Foundation, we train our researchers to notice the unnoticeable. We praise those who find the anomalous in the mundane, promote the scientists who overwork themselves, pushing themselves along the delicate balance between greatness and self-destruction. We sacrifice ourselves for the greater good, knowing we have saved thousands more from the same fate.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, looking at Dr. Endicott, I cannot help but doubt things. If our mission is right, is Dr. Endicott an acceptable loss? He is still hurting, haunted by an imaginary specter, a sequence that seems to taunt him wherever he looks. His mental health issues and obsessive compulsive behaviors intensified this, yes, but -- could we have done something?\n\n\n\nShould we have done something?\n\n[[>]]\n\nDr. Ezra Fisher\n\nPsychiatry\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nFollowing the submission of the above written statement, further diagnostic sessions and a full internal review, Dr. Endicott was placed into psychiatric care and SCP-2346 was reclassified as SCP-2346-EX.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-2346-EX", "scp_number": 2346, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_licensebox", "bittersweet", "bleak", "concept", "explained", "keter", "lgbtq", "mathematical", "pending", "phenomenon", "scp"], "title": "SCP-2346-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2346-ex"}, "SCP-252-EX": {"created_at": "2021-06-11T22:38:00", "creator": "ObserverSeptember", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "ObserverSeptember", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/observerseptember", "comment": "", "date": "2021-06-11T22:38:00"}, {"author": "ObserverSeptember", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/observerseptember", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-ex\".", "date": "2021-06-11T22:41:00"}, {"author": "EstrellaYoshte", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/estrellayoshte", "comment": "removing unnecessary div", "date": "2021-06-12T02:34:00"}, {"author": "ObserverSeptember", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/observerseptember", "comment": "", "date": "2021-06-12T02:41:00"}, {"author": "ObserverSeptember", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/observerseptember", "comment": "", "date": "2021-06-12T06:58:00"}, {"author": "ObserverSeptember", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/observerseptember", "comment": "", "date": "2021-06-12T17:07:00"}, {"author": "ObserverSeptember", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/observerseptember", "comment": "Added tags: explained, foundation-made, metallic, mind-affecting, scp, weapon.

This document is retained for archival purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-252-EX is a Mark 65 general-purpose aerial bomb, used by the armed forces of the United States during World War II and the Korean War. The words \u201cThe Pink Scare\u201d were drawn on its side, likely with a pink-colored highlighter marker. Its appearance and properties are otherwise unremarkable.</p>\n<p>SCP-252-EX\u2019s anomalous properties allegedly manifested when activated with a remote switch. When flipped into the \u201con\u201d position this switch (labeled SCP-252-A-EX) supposedly caused any persons within a 3.5km to temporarily experience same-sex attraction if they had previously self-identified as heterosexual.

This document is retained for archival purposes. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-252-EX is a Mark 65 general-purpose aerial bomb, used by the armed forces of the United States during World War II and the Korean War. The words \u201cThe Pink Scare\u201d were drawn on its side, likely with a pink-colored highlighter marker. Its appearance and properties are otherwise unremarkable. \n\n\n\nSCP-252-EX\u2019s anomalous properties allegedly manifested when activated with a remote switch. When flipped into the \u201con\u201d position this switch (labeled SCP-252-A-EX) supposedly caused any persons within a 3.5km to temporarily experience same-sex attraction if they had previously self-identified as heterosexual. This effect was said to have lasted for 2-3 weeks for most individuals; in approximately 10% of cases, however, the effects were described as \u201cpermanent and irreversible by all known means.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Further examination of SCP-252-EX was impeded by its apparent tendency to prematurely detonate if disassembly was attempted.\n\n\n\nIt has since been discovered that SCP-252-EX\u2019s documentation was entirely fictitious.

Deceased specimens are to be brought to research station 2600-Prime. Specimens of SCP-2600 found alive are to be contained immediately. Personnel are to notify the site director immediately if a live specimen is contained.</span> No special containment procedures are needed for SCP-2600-EX at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2600-EX is an anomalous species of trout located in [REDACTED]. The trout are cytologically identical to speckled trout, but have shaggy white fur covering 90% of their bodies. It is not known what purpose this fur serves, but it is hypothesized that the trout have much lower body temperature than normal speckled trout.</p>\n<p>No specimen of SCP-2600-EX have been discovered alive to date, and it is believed that their spawning ground is in a location not normally inhabited by speckled trout, such as an underground reservoir. All specimens of SCP-2600-EX currently in the Foundation's possession were deceased upon discovery.</p>\n<p>SCP-2600-EX is believed to have the ability to transfer its fur to normal speckled trout via unknown means. Normal speckled trout tagged with Foundation micro-radio beacons have turned up bearing SCP-2600-EX's distinctive fur.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following log contains notes made by SCP-2600-EX's research director James Dobson. It is currently believed that Director Dobson was influenced by the folklore and culture that he experienced growing up in the area he was researching. This is the probable cause of the highly unprofessional and dishonest way he behaved during his tenure as SCP-2600-EX's research director.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>January 15th, 1919</p>\n<p>Due to my history with the area and knowledge of lore surrounding it, I have been selected as SCP-2600's research director. Words do not do justice to the excitement I feel. Ever since I was a boy I have dreamed of catching the furred trout. And now I am in charge of the world's most advanced lab completely dedicated to it. I've hand picked the personnel that are going to work for me. They all have the youth and zeal to get the job done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>February 2nd, 1919.</p>\n<p>Research station has been finished. All of my staff tell me of their excitement. As the primary research director, I have been allotted my own office. I put a stuffed furred trout over my door. Although it may be fake, my staff seemed to find it amusing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>April 3rd, 1919.</p>\n<p>A real breakthrough! Lawrence was out in the field today, checking some of the local waterways when he found a deceased instance of SCP-2600! I've ordered greater exploration of the area Lawrence found it at. Gave Lawrence a little bonus while I was at it. I've got research on top priority doing tests on it. We'll have our data soon. And to think I was starting to get discouraged\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>June 21st, 1919.</p>\n<p>Nothing. Just a whole lot of nothing. That's all we got from the tests. No major differences, no anomalous properties. Just a trout with fur. And right before our annual review\u2026 I will have to come up with a solution quickly</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>August 8th, 1919</p>\n<p>I can't believe I did it. But I had to. We're just so close to achieving a breakthrough. I couldn't have let them take my team apart. I had Bern draw up some\u2026 speculative research. But it's okay. The review period is over. If we can find a real one, I can make my new report confirming our hypothesis to add to the main document.

Deceased specimens are to be brought to research station 2600-Prime. Specimens of SCP-2600 found alive are to be contained immediately. Personnel are to notify the site director immediately if a live specimen is contained.-- No special containment procedures are needed for SCP-2600-EX at this time.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2600-EX is an anomalous species of trout located in [REDACTED]. The trout are cytologically identical to speckled trout, but have shaggy white fur covering 90% of their bodies. It is not known what purpose this fur serves, but it is hypothesized that the trout have much lower body temperature than normal speckled trout.\n\n\n\nNo specimen of SCP-2600-EX have been discovered alive to date, and it is believed that their spawning ground is in a location not normally inhabited by speckled trout, such as an underground reservoir. All specimens of SCP-2600-EX currently in the Foundation's possession were deceased upon discovery. \n\n\n\nSCP-2600-EX is believed to have the ability to transfer its fur to normal speckled trout via unknown means. Normal speckled trout tagged with Foundation micro-radio beacons have turned up bearing SCP-2600-EX's distinctive fur.\n\n\n\n> The following log contains notes made by SCP-2600-EX's research director James Dobson. It is currently believed that Director Dobson was influenced by the folklore and culture that he experienced growing up in the area he was researching. This is the probable cause of the highly unprofessional and dishonest way he behaved during his tenure as SCP-2600-EX's research director.\n\n\n\n> January 15th, 1919\n\n> \n\n> Due to my history with the area and knowledge of lore surrounding it, I have been selected as SCP-2600's research director. Words do not do justice to the excitement I feel. Ever since I was a boy I have dreamed of catching the furred trout. And now I am in charge of the world's most advanced lab completely dedicated to it. I've hand picked the personnel that are going to work for me. They all have the youth and zeal to get the job done.\n\n\n\n> February 2nd, 1919.\n\n> \n\n> Research station has been finished. All of my staff tell me of their excitement. As the primary research director, I have been allotted my own office. I put a stuffed furred trout over my door. Although it may be fake, my staff seemed to find it amusing.\n\n\n\n> April 3rd, 1919.\n\n> \n\n> A real breakthrough! Lawrence was out in the field today, checking some of the local waterways when he found a deceased instance of SCP-2600! I've ordered greater exploration of the area Lawrence found it at. Gave Lawrence a little bonus while I was at it. I've got research on top priority doing tests on it. We'll have our data soon. And to think I was starting to get discouraged...\n\n\n\n> June 21st, 1919.\n\n> \n\n> Nothing. Just a whole lot of nothing. That's all we got from the tests. No major differences, no anomalous properties. Just a trout with fur. And right before our annual review... I will have to come up with a solution quickly\n\n\n\n> August 8th, 1919\n\n> \n\n> I can't believe I did it. But I had to. We're just so close to achieving a breakthrough. I couldn't have let them take my team apart. I had Bern draw up some... speculative research. But it's okay. The review period is over. If we can find a real one, I can make my new report confirming our hypothesis to add to the main document. I have faith that we will be okay.\n\n\n\n> November 1st, 1919\n\n> \n\n> Nothing. Still nothing. None of our results gave us any new data. It's like we've been sitting on our hands for months. We had nothing for the document. So... I had to tell staff that we had results that confirmed them, and added it to the report. But we'll get real results soon. I can feel it in my gut. \n\n\n\n> January 3rd, 1920.\n\n> \n\n> My nightmare has come true. Our records are being audited. They're going to go through all of our papers, they're going to see what's different. No. I have research working triple overtime to get anything. All my agents are in the field looking for the possible spawn points I mapped in the document. We can't fail now. I just can't.\n\n\n\n> February 17th, 1920.\n\n> \n\n> I've ordered agents to start dynamiting the places I marked as spawn points. They can't use it against me if I put it out of commission. I can explain it. I'll say they got dangerous. It'll work I'll be okay be okay be okay. I need to be okay. \n\n\n\n> March 3rd, 1920.\n\n> \n\n> I think it's over. I'm sitting in this tiny office.

All research into SCP-2700 and its cure has been suspended indefinitely. The documentation will be locked, but remains accessible to serve as evidence for the related Ethics Committee investigation. Researcher Perry will be held in [DATA EXPUNGED] until sentencing is complete.//\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-2700\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Personnel implanted within medical insurance corporations are to monitor incoming claims for symptoms of SCP-2700. Upon detection, the nearest Mobile Task Force with biomedical capabilities is to be deployed to the subject\u2019s location in order to secure a quarantine. Family or roommates cohabitating with the subject are to be checked for infection; those cleared are to be amnesticized and released while those infected are to be transported with the initial subject to Area-12 for study.\n\n\n\nDue to SCP-2700's highly contagious nature, the following quarantine measures have been enacted:\n\n\n\n* All personnel assigned to SCP-2700 are to be male.\n\n* Unauthorized personnel are not permitted access to Ward-2700. \n\n* Level Four decontamination protocols are required for 2700-Personnel to leave Ward-2700.\n\n* As few personnel are to be assigned to SCP-2700 as possible.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2700 is an anomalous, multi-stage illness with an exceptionally infectious nature. While it has been found to affect male subjects, it is over one hundred times more likely to infect females; it is hypothesized that ~12.5% of women worldwide are currently infected with some form of SCP-2700.\n\n\n\nSCP-2700 infection causes the cellular cycle to breakdown at the apoptosis stage; rather than dying naturally, cells affected by SCP-2700 will continue to live and group together into large clumps causing the following symptoms:\n\n\n\n* Unusual thickness of the skin.\n\n* Puckering or dimpling of the skin.\n\n* Rash or discharge around infection site.\n\n* Constant pain and swelling at infection site. \n\n* Necrotizing of surrounding tissue causing black, oozing sores.\n\n* More severe cases may become metastatic, spreading throughout the body and multiplying symptoms across multiple sites.\n\n* Left untreated, SCP-2700 infection can lead to full body necrotizing fasciitis and [REDACTED].\n\n\n\nResearcher Harold Perry has volunteered to lead research into SCP-2700; any and all inquiries are to be directed through him.\n\n\n\n> **Note from EC-3:**\n\n> \n\n> //The best place to hide a lie is inside the truth. The symptoms of SCP-2700-EX are, in fact, all factual symptoms of breast cancer, as is that ~12.5% number; 1 in 8 women born in 2015 will likely face breast cancer at some point in their life. All Perry had to do was exaggerate a symptom and claim that it was a highly contagious epidemic; that let him both claim the anomaly and get the ability to quarantine himself with his work.//\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Evidence of Infractions: Harold Perry\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n\n\n> **Note from EC-3:**\n\n> \n\n> //Evidence against SCP-2700-EX Head Researcher Harold Perry has been gathered from his research notes, e-mail correspondence, and security footage; all information is presented in chronological order.//\n\n\n\n> **01/17/2015 - Research Note:** The new group of D-Class personnel has come in.

The items previously designated as SCP-3000-1 through -4, together with related materials, have been returned to civilian authorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3000-EX is the collective designation for a set of four modified hospital beds and other items which were originally hypothesised to have mind-affecting properties. Comprehensive testing of SCP-3000-EX, PoI-3000-1 and all other materials recovered in conjunction with SCP-3000-EX, have confirmed that they are not anomalous.</p>\n<p>A full list of SCP-3000-EX items is set out below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 x hospital beds (date of manufacture no later than 1975). The beds have been modified by the attachment of short lengths of metal pipe of various sizes and configurations. The pipes are attached to the side rails of the beds by metal clamps, or have been imprecisely welded in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>7 x IKEA-brand directional floor lamps (2 without bulbs) together with extension leads and power strips.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>12 x bottles of sleeping pills</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>9 x pairs of handcuffs, together with several sets of what appear to be improvised manacles. Several of these were attached to the metal pipes on the hospital beds.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>6 x steak knives</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>1 x knife sharpener</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>1 x chest freezer containing multiple cuts of red meat. Meat was later identified as beef.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>3 x eviscerated human corpses (all teenaged males). The bodies were later identified as those of Gavin Staub, Mitchell Clark and Jerome Simmons, noted in Texas state records as missing persons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-3000-EX was recovered on 4 April 1987 following interception of Tarrant County police communications with a high incidence of trigger phrases. Key phrases included \"murder\", \"ritual\", \"kids\", \"flesh\", \"speaking in tongues\" and \"cult-like\". Agents from Site-73 were deployed to the crime scene, a suburban house in Arlington, Texas owned by Carl Fraser (designated PoI-3000-1). PoI-3000-1 had been arrested by county officers.</p>\n<p>All SCP-3000-EX items were located in the basement of the house. The bodies were handcuffed or manacled to hospital beds by the wrists and ankles, and had been dead for between five days and three months before discovery. All three corpses were emaciated and showed signs of malnutrition and starvation over a period of at least four weeks. Their torsos were smeared with a combination of human and animal blood. Cause of death was determined to be severe internal bleeding, organ damage and disembowelment, likely with the steak knives found at the scene. Each of the bodies was found holding a steak knife in its right hand.</p>\n<p>Further investigation uncovered a pit dug beneath the garage, filled with quicklime and containing body parts from at least ten unidentified individuals.</p>\n<p>Based on the use of animal blood and the apparent self-inflicted wounds, Foundation agents suspected the possibility of a compulsion effect generated by the hospital beds or other SCP-3000-EX materials. All items were removed by the Foundation for testing, and PoI-3000-1 was taken into Foundation custody, with local law enforcement amnesticised as necessary.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Addendum\u00a03000-EX-A\u00a0-\u00a0Interview\u00a0with\u00a0PoI-3000-1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Re-secure\u00a0data</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Addendum 1: Interview SCP-3000-EX-A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> PoI-3000-1<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Curtis<br/>\n<strong>Date:</strong> 5 April 1987</p>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Relevant extracts of this interview are set out below. The full interview logs (275 minutes) are available at Document 3000-EX/084.

It was my grandma's house.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Do you know why you're here, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Yes, I am here because the policeman came to my house and he went down into my basement and he found those boys laying there dead.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did you kill those boys, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Yes I did, I killed them or at least I had to help kill them.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Who helped you kill them, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> They did. Those boys themselves did. I had to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Tell me how you met those boys.</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Most of them were at the bus station in Fort Worth, and \u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Where did you get the hospital beds?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I bought them. My grandma had one and she died but I liked how the mattress felt when I lay down on it, so I bought some more and they were the same type but they didn't feel the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Where did you buy them from?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> From a store in Fort Worth, Jackson's Bric-a-brac. They have old things there.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did you change the beds after you bought them?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I put the metal on them so their arms could reach. I tried it without but it didn't work, the handcuffs were too short. And I jammed the backs so they were sitting up a little bit. So they could lean forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did you do anything else to the beds, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Do you know what magic is?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Yes, like Siegfried and Roy.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> What about real magic, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> There's no such thing as real magic, just stories and illusions, it's not real.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Can you do illusions, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did you do an illusion with the beds?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> No. What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did the beds make those boys hurt themselves? Did the beds speak to the boys in their minds?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I don't understand what you mean, I think you're trying to trick me and I don't like it when people trick me.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Okay, Carl, I'm not trying to trick you. I just want to ask questions. Would you like some more water?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I don't like it when people trick me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did you put the animal blood on those boys, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> It came from the meat. From the freezer.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Did you spread the blood in a pattern?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> No, it was them and it was just messy, not a pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Are you saying the animal blood was an accident?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Yes, it was an accident, why are you asking me -</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> But killing the boys wasn't an accident, was it Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> No, no it wasn't an accident, but -</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Why did you kill them, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I didn't kill them! I told you, I didn't kill them, I just helped.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> Okay, then -</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I killed the other ones, the first ones, but I didn't know any better and I was funny from the beer and I just grabbed his neck to stop him leaving and then when I woke up he was dead. I didn't mean to but he was so pretty and I didn't want him to leave and I tried to keep him but after he was dead he began to rot and I had to get rid of him so I -</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> What about later on, Carl? What about Gavin Staub?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Gavin, Gavin, yes I remember he had a strong face and bright eyes but he got too weak.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> What do you mean by weak?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I tried feeding them, after the first ones, once I got the handcuffs and the basement arranged, but they didn't want to eat, they were beautiful but the food was making them less beautiful and then they died so I realised that there was another way, that the only way they could stay beautiful was if they ate themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> If they ate themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Yes, you see it's like a beautiful loop and the beauty goes around and around and never wears off and they would be able to stay, but I couldn't make them understand even though I gave them the knives and told them but they wouldn't do it, so for Gavin I had an idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> What was your idea, Carl?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> After he woke up and he was on the bed and he was yelling, I told him that he had to eat himself, and he said no, so I said he couldn't have any food, and every day I told him and I could see he was hungry but he still said no so I waited and waited and then I gave him the steak.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> This is one of the steaks you were keeping in the freezer?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> Yes, I put it on his belly and told him he could eat it and the freezer is good because the cold numbs the belly and it makes the meat harder and slippery for the knife and I knew how sharp the knife was, it was like a trick but it wasn't a mean trick and if he could only start cutting he would smell his body and he would be so hungry and the beauty would go on and on forever. But he was too weak, he couldn't hold the knife steady enough, so I had to help him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Curtis:</strong> &lt;<em>silence, 5 seconds</em>&gt; So what happened -</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-3000-1:</strong> I always had to help them, it never worked!

Officer Douglas was adamant that he had nothing to hide, but admitted that he could not rule out tampering with the crime scene or the evidence during the alleged gaps.</p>\n<p>Following this answer, the District Attorney immediately asked the judge's permission to withdraw charges.

Dr. Rivera is unable to retain knowledge regarding Dr. Verity or perceive him when directly confronted. No such anomalous properties were exhibited by Dr. Rivera prior to 04/12/16. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">The origin of these anomalous properties is still under investigation.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The following is security footage from Dr. Rivera's office demonstrating the effects of Rivera's anomalous properties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dr. Verity approaches Dr. Rivera's office. He stands in front of the door with his hand raised to knock. Dr. Verity then looks up and down the hallway, and checks his phone. He turns back to the door. He knocks on the door twice.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey? You in there?</p>\n<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> I know you're in there. Rachel told me you didn't have any meetings today.</p>\n<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> I can tell you're not exactly happy with me. I just want to talk to you about it.</p>\n<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Talking through a door probably isn't helpful\u2026 I'm coming in.</p>\n<p><em>Verity opens the door and enters the office. Rivera is sitting at her computer, writing up a recent testing report.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey\u2026 we can't work through this if all you do is ignore me.</p>\n<p><em>Rivera does not turn around.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Can't you at least turn around? Look at me. Like, this is just being a dick.</p>\n<p><em>Rivera does not turn around. Verity grabs the back of Rivera's chair.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Just a little spin. It's not that hard.</p>\n<p><em>Verity spins Rivera's chair to face him. Rivera stops typing and places her hands in her lap.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> See, that wasn't that hard. Right? Hailey?</p>\n<p><em>Verity waves a hand in front of Rivera. There is no response.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey? Hailey!</p>\n<p><em>Verity shakes Rivera.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Why won't you say anything!</p>\n<p><em>Verity stops shaking Rivera. His breathing is erratic. Rivera turns back to her computer.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey?</p>\n<p><em>There is no response.

The interview was conducted one day after Dr. Verity recognized that Dr. Rivera had been exhibiting anomalous properties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Oh, you even brought a recorder. I thought \"interview\" was a coy way of asking if I wanted to grab lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Sorry about that. Unfortunately this is official business.</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> So, you're not asking me about Hailey?</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> I am. That's why it's official business.</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> You're kidding.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> She's not answering my texts, my calls and when I went to her office\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I already told you, that's called the silent treatment, Julius.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> But she stared right through me! Like I wasn't even there!</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Oh.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> You've seen amnestized people before. There's that look in their eyes, like an emptiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Uh huh.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> You can see why I'm worried.</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I do, yeah. But I'm also pretty sure that it's just you.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Exactly, which is why I need you to talk to her.</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I mean, even if she did get wiped\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Please. I need to go back and see if I can see if anything sparked this, but I only know so much. I'm not in her head and\u2026 well I'm not anywhere to her.</p>\n<p><strong>Frie:</strong> \u2026 fine. I'll talk to her.</p>\n<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: blue\">Verity then left Frie to eat lunch by herself.</span></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 3393-EX-1:</strong> The following is a timeline regarding Dr. Rivera and Dr. Verity's interactions while working at the Foundation, augmented with Dr. Verity's thoughts on each notable event to provide additional context.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Dr. Verity's Recollections</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06/07/15</td>\n<td>Dr. Rivera meets Dr. Verity during Foundation Researcher Orientation.</td>\n<td>There were about fifty of us, so I couldn't get to know anyone else super well.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> But Hailey and I sat next to each other on the first day and made awkward ice-breaker conversation to pass the time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06/21/15</td>\n<td>Dr. Rivera and Dr. Verity are assigned to the Antimemetics Department.</td>\n<td>I was happy.

That's the work we've done on Identity Erasure Amnestics. Do we have any questions?</p>\n<p><em>A line forms in front of a microphone set up in the middle of the audience. Dr. Johanson is the first in line.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Johanson:</strong> You said that the drug works by breaking down and then repairing certain synapses. How do you ensure that you only target neural connections regarding people and not, say, general knowledge or habits.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Well, um, luckily most of the time, people are not directly tied to that type of knowledge. They may be associated, but there's degrees of separation so there's a lower likelihood we'll, uh, we'll touch those synapses.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Johanson:</strong> I see. Also congratulations on your presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Thank you!</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Johanson returns to his seat. Dr. Verity approaches the microphone next.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> You mentioned earlier you had strong success with erasing memories of most forms of relationships, could you expand on which relationships you had issues with?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Which kind of relationships? I'm not exactly sure what you mean\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Like, say, twins.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Oh. Like twins.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Or other forms of intimate or familiar relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Well, we did have issues with twins\u2026 they um, they have a few issues with um\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Could you speak up?<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> They would sometimes over-flow into untargeted neural pathways, okay?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Can you elaborate?</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: blue\">Dr. Rivera squeezes her hands into fists.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> People forgot what their own face looked like!

Next question.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Verity returns to his seat. <span style=\"color: blue\">Dr. Rivera turns away from the microphone, takes three deep breaths before continuing with the questions.

You can even use that word for word.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Currently, it is believed that during her demonstration of her amnestics for the Ethics Committee, Dr. Rivera's drug malfunctioned, causing her to mentally suppress the existence of Dr. Verity. Investigation of how to possibly recover from such an erasure is underway.

Investigation of the anomaly is to be solely conducted by Dr. Verity.[[footnote]]##blue|You breached this when you asked me for help.##[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-3393-EX is Dr. Hailey Rivera, Level 3 researcher in the Antimemetics Department. Dr. Rivera is unable to retain knowledge regarding Dr. Verity or perceive him when directly confronted.\u00a0\u00a0No such anomalous properties were exhibited by Dr. Rivera prior to 04/12/16. --The origin of these anomalous properties is still under investigation.--\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** The following is security footage from Dr. Rivera's office demonstrating the effects of Rivera's anomalous properties. \n\n\n\n> //Dr. Verity approaches Dr. Rivera's office. He stands in front of the door with his hand raised to knock. Dr. Verity then looks up and down the hallway, and checks his phone. He turns back to the door. He knocks on the door twice.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Hailey? You in there? \n\n> \n\n> //There is no response.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** I know you're in there. Rachel told me you didn't have any meetings today. \n\n> \n\n> //There is no response.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** I can tell you're not exactly happy with me. I just want to talk to you about it. \n\n> \n\n> //There is no response.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Talking through a door probably isn't helpful... I'm coming in. \n\n> \n\n> //Verity opens the door and enters the office. Rivera is sitting at her computer, writing up a recent testing report.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Hailey... we can't work through this if all you do is ignore me. \n\n> \n\n> //Rivera does not turn around.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Can't you at least turn around? Look at me. Like, this is just being a dick.\n\n> \n\n> //Rivera does not turn around. Verity grabs the back of Rivera's chair.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Just a little spin. It's not that hard.\n\n> \n\n> //Verity spins Rivera's chair to face him. Rivera stops typing and places her hands in her lap.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** See, that wasn't that hard. Right? Hailey? \n\n> \n\n> //Verity waves a hand in front of Rivera. There is no response.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Hailey? Hailey!\n\n> \n\n> //Verity shakes Rivera.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Why won't you say anything!\n\n> \n\n> //Verity stops shaking Rivera. His breathing is erratic. Rivera turns back to her computer.//\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Hailey?\n\n> \n\n> //There is no response. Verity runs out of Rivera's office.//\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n##blue|I see you left out that I suggested you to talk to her face to face instead of just texting \"Hello?\" every day.##\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3393-EX-2:** The following is a transcript from an interview between Dr. Verity and Dr. Rachel Frie, a close friend of Dr. Rivera. The interview was conducted one day after Dr. Verity recognized that Dr. Rivera had been exhibiting anomalous properties. \n\n\n\n> **Frie:** Oh, you even brought a recorder. I thought \"interview\" was a coy way of asking if I wanted to grab lunch.\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Sorry about that. Unfortunately this is official business.\n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** So, you're not asking me about Hailey?\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** I am. That's why it's official business. \n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** You're kidding.\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** She's not answering my texts, my calls and when I went to her office\u2014\n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** I already told you, that's called the silent treatment, Julius.\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** But she stared right through me! Like I wasn't even there!\n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** Oh.\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** You've seen amnestized people before. There's that look in their eyes, like an emptiness. \n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** Uh huh.\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** You can see why I'm worried.\n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** I do, yeah. But I'm also pretty sure that it's just you. \n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Exactly, which is why I need you to talk to her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** I mean, even if she did get wiped\u2014\n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Please. I need to go back and see if I can see if anything sparked this, but I only know so much. I'm not in her head and... well I'm not anywhere to her. \n\n> \n\n> **Frie:** ... fine. I'll talk to her. \n\n> \n\n> **Verity:** Thank you so much.\n\n> \n\n> //##blue|Verity then left Frie to eat lunch by herself.##//\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3393-EX-1:** The following is a timeline regarding Dr. Rivera and Dr. Verity's interactions while working at the Foundation, augmented with Dr. Verity's thoughts on each notable event to provide additional context.\n\n\n\n||~ Date ||~ Event ||~ Dr. Verity's Recollections ||\n\n|| 06/07/15 || Dr. Rivera meets Dr. Verity during Foundation Researcher Orientation. || There were about fifty of us, so I couldn't get to know anyone else super well.[[footnote]] ##blue|Anyone else? There really wasn't anyone else?##[[/footnote]] But Hailey and I sat next to each other on the first day and made awkward ice-breaker conversation to pass the time.\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| 06/21/15 || Dr. Rivera and Dr. Verity are assigned to the Antimemetics Department. || I was happy. At least there'd be one person I'd know in the department with me.||\n\n|| 07/02/15 - 08/04/15 || Dr. Rivera and Dr. Verity travel to the Polynesian isles, to observe and track SCP-2256 instances. || It was a fun trip. Felt like a safari, but with more note taking.[[footnote]]##blue|You don't need to say how much you enjoyed it...##[[/footnote]] ||\n\n|| 08/05/15 || Dr. Rivera and Dr. Verity join the amnestic subject evaluation team, and are given an office to share. || I didn't have much preference to where in the department I was assigned, but I knew Rivera wanted to do this, so I decided I'd join her. It wasn't in the best interest of our work ethic, but it was around this time when I asked her out. I still can't believe she said yes.||\n\n|| 12/15/15 || Dr. Rivera is reassigned to aid in development of new amnestic drugs, and is moved to a different office.|| I knew we wouldn't be able to share an office forever, but I was still a little sad. It felt lonely having the office to myself. I've been doing the same testing work since, but now I have no one to immediately share it with.[[footnote]]##blue|You told me you were jealous. That she got to move on to bigger things and left you behind. Are you lying to yourself about that as well?##[[/footnote]]||\n\n|| 02/22/16 || Dr. Rivera is promoted to oversee the design and production of her new amnestic drugs.\u00a0\u00a0||I tried to make sure we could find time to be together. Everyone needs a break at times, especially someone who works as hard as she did. I needed to be there to make sure she didn't overdo anything.[[footnote]]##blue|Does this not sound clingy to you? Is this how you justify just being a self absorbed little shit?##[[/footnote]]\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| 04/09/16 || Dr. Rivera presents to the Antimemetics division on the successful completion of her new amnestics. || She was never great at public speaking. I asked Hailey questions from the audience to help her train of thought, and expand on some points she must've forgotten during the talk. ||\n\n|| 04/11/16 || Dr. Rivera presents her work to the Ethics Committee, volunteering herself for a demonstration. || I didn't know she was demonstrating on herself until Rachel told me. ||\n\n|| 04/12/16 || Dr. Rivera begins exhibiting anomalous properties. || And I stopped existing for her.||\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-3393-EX-3:** Below is the transcript from the Q&A section of Dr. Rivera's presentation on her new amnestic drugs:\n\n\n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** Umm... and yeah. That's the work we've done on Identity Erasure Amnestics. Do we have any questions?\n\n> \n\n> //A line forms in front of a microphone set up in the middle of the audience. Dr. Johanson is the first in line.// \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Johanson:** You said that the drug works by breaking down and then repairing certain synapses. How do you ensure that you only target neural connections regarding people and not, say, general knowledge or habits.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** Well, um, luckily most of the time, people are not directly tied to that type of knowledge. They may be associated, but there's degrees of separation so there's a lower likelihood we'll, uh, we'll touch those synapses.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Johanson:** I see. Also congratulations on your presentation.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** Thank you!\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Johanson returns to his seat. Dr. Verity approaches the microphone next.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Verity:** You mentioned earlier you had strong success with erasing memories of most forms of relationships, could you expand on which relationships you had issues with?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** Which kind of relationships? I'm not exactly sure what you mean\u2014\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Verity:** Like, say, twins. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** Oh. Like twins. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Verity:** Or other forms of intimate or familiar relationship.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** Well, we did have issues with twins... they um, they have a few issues with um...\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Dr. Verity:** Could you speak up?[[footnote]]##blue|Her volume was fine.##[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** They would sometimes over-flow into untargeted neural pathways, okay?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Verity:** Can you elaborate?\n\n> \n\n> //##blue|Dr. Rivera squeezes her hands into fists.##// \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** People forgot what their own face looked like! But using amnestics to make twins forget each other is\u2014 \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Verity:** Did the new amnestic experience similar failures in any circumstances?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Dr. Rivera:** No. Just the twins. Next question.\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Verity returns to his seat. ##blue|Dr. Rivera turns away from the microphone, takes three deep breaths before continuing with the questions. Her voice remains strained and on edge.##//\n\n> \n\n> <**Remaining transcript elided for brevity**>\n\n\n\n##blue|What should go here is \"As demonstrated above, Dr. Verity took out his bottled up feelings of jealousy through purposefully provocative questioning during a public event, instead of being open about his emotions\". You can even use that word for word.##\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** Currently, it is believed that during her demonstration of her amnestics for the Ethics Committee, Dr. Rivera's drug malfunctioned, causing her to mentally suppress the existence of Dr. Verity. Investigation of how to possibly recover from such an erasure is underway. Additional information from Dr. Frie's interview with Dr. Rivera may lead to new breakthroughs.[[footnote]] ##blue|You didn't even give me time to talk.

Though the subject's anomalous properties remain largely unknown, it is currently believed that SCP-3874 possesses one or more of the following anomalous properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Probability-altering capabilities,</li>\n<li>Clairvoyance,</li>\n<li>Indestructibility/Rapid regeneration properties,</li>\n<li>or Pataphysical Omniscience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-3874 has not demonstrated any of the aforementioned anomalous properties in public nor shows any signs typical of a Class-B metahuman; however, the quantity of survived assassination attempts demonstrated by SCP-3874 has been deemed most likely anomalous. According to leaked Pentagram documentation supplied by defector Matthew Shah, the organization has made over 600 attempts<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> to assassinate SCP-3874 since 1963.

In response, the Foundation implemented Procedure-343FB21 \"The Strong-Arm\", a plan to capture William Alton Carter<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>. Under the guise of a terrorist front organization, the Foundation issued the threat to the President, who signed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11905\">Executive Order 11905</a> in response, disallowing United States government employees from engaging in political assassination.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum.02:</strong> Despite the signing of Executive Order 11905, Pentagram continued to undertake covert assassination attempts, most notably in 2000 when the group converted the recently captured <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli%C3%A1n_Gonz%C3%A1lez#Taken_by_federal_authorities\">Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez</a> into a sleeper agent to assassinate SCP-3874.

Operation \"90\u00a0A\u00f1os\" was launched shortly after, with the goal of retrieving the cadaver of SCP-3874 and bringing it to Facility-72<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> in Colombia. Due to the lack of anomalous guards or GOC operatives present at the morgue, Agent LaFerrier was able to successfully obtain the cadaver of SCP-3874 prior to cremation, substituting SCP-3874's cremains with those of D-1221's.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival to Facility-72, an autopsy was conducted to identify any possible anomalous properties possessed by SCP-3874. No results were found. Additional experiments yielded no results. The cause of death was additionally confirmed to be natural and no involvement of Pentagram was found in relation to the death of SCP-3874.</p>\n<p>On January 1st 2017, Agent LaFerrier, disguised as a new Venezuelan diplomat, was tasked with approaching Raul Castro<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> and attempting to gather any information regarding SCP-3874's anomalous properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum.05:</strong> Following an interview with Raul Castro, it was determined that SCP-3874 did not at any point possess anomalous properties. Though Foundation statisticians have questioned the possibility of a mundane human surviving and evading over 600 assassination attempts, the possibility is non-anomalously more than 0, therefore rendering it possible.</p>\n<p>SCP-3874's documentation is to be reclassified immediately.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u00a0OPEN\u00a0SCP-3874\u00a0RECLASSIFICATION?</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">CLOSE</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3874/castro3.jpeg\"><img alt=\"castro3.jpeg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-3874/castro3.jpeg/medium.jpg\"/></a>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>SCP-3874-EX attending a conference in Brazil in 2005.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3874-EX</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized (Explained)</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> N/A</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3874-EX is the former Prime Minister (1959-1976) and President (1976-2008) of Cuba, Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz.

The Foundation is to instead monitor the activities of\u00a0\u00a0GoI-616 \"Pentagram\"[[footnote]] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4220|The occult branch of the Department of Defense.]]] [[/footnote]] in relation to the anomaly and attempts to sabotage any known attempts to assassinate SCP-3874. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-3874 is the former Prime Minister (1959-1976) and President (1976-2008) of Cuba, Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz. Though the subject's anomalous properties remain largely unknown, it is currently believed that SCP-3874 possesses one or more of the following anomalous properties:\n\n\n\n* Probability-altering capabilities,\n\n* Clairvoyance,\n\n* Indestructibility/Rapid regeneration properties,\n\n* or Pataphysical Omniscience.\n\n\n\nSCP-3874 has not demonstrated any of the aforementioned anomalous properties in public nor shows any signs typical of a Class-B metahuman; however, the quantity of survived assassination attempts demonstrated by SCP-3874 has been deemed most likely anomalous. According to leaked Pentagram documentation supplied by defector Matthew Shah, the organization has made over 600 attempts[[footnote]] Prior to this documentation being supplied to the Foundation, only 52 attempts had been discovered. [[/footnote]] to assassinate SCP-3874 since 1963. The methods of the attempts to assassinate the subject include both anomalous and mundane means. \n\n\n\nAttempted methods include:\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=castro2.jpg|caption=SCP-3874 in 1959.]]\n\n\n\n* An exploding cigar,\n\n* Poisoned ice cream,\n\n* Contracting ex-Chicago Spirit members and UIU Persons of Interest to participate in the Bay of Pigs invasion,\n\n* Cognitohazardous diplomatic speech,\n\n* Voodoo,\n\n* [[[scp-3521|Radioactive Para-pharmaceuticals]]],\n\n* and an Orbital Disintegration Beam.\n\n\n\n**Addendum.01:** Upon discovery of SCP-3874's anomalous properties and an assassination attempt in 1975, the Foundation began covert lobbying to support the Church Committee's investigations of abuse of the United States Intelligence agencies by several departments of the state. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to political pressure from the Department of Defense, the Church Committee instead focused their investigations on the NSA. In response, the Foundation implemented Procedure-343FB21 \"The Strong-Arm\", a plan to capture William Alton Carter[[footnote]] Brother of at-the-time POTUS James \"Jimmy\" Earl Carter Jr.[[/footnote]]. Under the guise of a terrorist front organization, the Foundation issued the threat to the President, who signed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11905 Executive Order 11905] in response, disallowing United States government employees from engaging in political assassination.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum.02:** Despite the signing of Executive Order 11905, Pentagram continued to undertake covert assassination attempts, most notably in 2000 when the group converted the recently captured [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli%C3%A1n_Gonz%C3%A1lez#Taken_by_federal_authorities Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez] into a sleeper agent to assassinate SCP-3874. This plan was discovered by Site-19's Lead GoI Researcher Dr. Everwood, and Foundation Intelligence Agents were dispatched to administer amnestics to Gonz\u00e1lez, removing all sleeper agent programming.\n\n\n\n**Addendum.03:** On June 23rd, 2001, the following correspondence was received from Pentagram's Chairman and US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-weight: bold; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n[[=image bro.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\n\n\nThough the United States government understands and appreciates the service the SCPF provides to our great country and the world at large, we can no longer abide by your constant interference in national security.

Operation \"90 A\u00f1os\" was launched shortly after, with the goal of retrieving the cadaver of SCP-3874 and bringing it to Facility-72[[footnote]] [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/i-57-hub The equivalent of Foundation Sites in South America.] [[/footnote]] in Colombia. Due to the lack of anomalous guards or GOC operatives present at the morgue, Agent LaFerrier was able to successfully obtain the cadaver of SCP-3874 prior to cremation, substituting SCP-3874's cremains with those of D-1221's. \n\n\n\nUpon arrival to Facility-72, an autopsy was conducted to identify any possible anomalous properties possessed by SCP-3874. No results were found. Additional experiments yielded no results. The cause of death was additionally confirmed to be natural and no involvement of Pentagram was found in relation to the death of SCP-3874. \n\n\n\nOn January 1st 2017, Agent LaFerrier, disguised as a new Venezuelan diplomat, was tasked with approaching Raul Castro[[footnote]] SCP-3874's brother. [[/footnote]] and attempting to gather any information regarding SCP-3874's anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n**Addendum.05:** Following an interview with Raul Castro, it was determined that SCP-3874 did not at any point possess anomalous properties. Though Foundation statisticians have questioned the possibility of a mundane human surviving and evading over 600 assassination attempts, the possibility is non-anomalously more than 0, therefore rendering it possible.\n\n\n\nSCP-3874's documentation is to be reclassified immediately.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\" OPEN SCP-3874 RECLASSIFICATION?\" hide=\"CLOSE\"]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=castro3.jpeg|caption=SCP-3874-EX attending a conference in Brazil in 2005.]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3874-EX\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Neutralized (Explained)\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** N/A\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-3874-EX is the former Prime Minister (1959-1976) and President (1976-2008) of Cuba, Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz.

As a safeguard to prevent potential global contamination and microbial extinction events, an antibiotic resistance plasmid for SCP-4023-EX was developed and released to ensure that natural genetic drift mechanisms keep bacterial populations alive.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-4023-EX", "scp_number": 4023, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_licensebox", "alive", "chemical", "euclid", "explained", "medical", "scp"], "title": "SCP-4023-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4023-ex"}, "SCP-4445-EX": {"created_at": "2019-08-28T19:55:00", "creator": "Weryllium", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Weryllium", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/weryllium", "comment": "Uploaded file \"wearevenom.JPG\".", "date": "2019-08-28T19:55:00"}, {"author": "Weryllium", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/weryllium", "comment": "OPEN THE DOOR GET ON THE FLOOR", "date": "2019-08-28T19:55:00"}, {"author": "Weryllium", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/weryllium", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-ex\".", "date": "2019-08-28T20:55:00"}, {"author": "aismallard", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aismallard", "comment": "Added tags: _image, alive, dinosaurian, explained, neurological, scp, sentient.

Inside each kit are 36 square pieces of construction paper, of various colors, and a paper booklet that gives instructions on how to make several origami figures with the provided papers. Pouring salt over the paper will activate microscopic sensors calibrated to detect salt crystals, which in turn activate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_elastomers\" target=\"_blank\">dielectric elastomers</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> within the construction paper.</p>\n<p>The resulting effect is a minimal but thematically appropriate movement \u2014 for example, a crane made with this paper, following the instructions in the booklet exactly, will slowly flap its wings when introduced to salt.</p>\n<p>Due to the Dr. Wondertainment brand, SCP-445-EX were immediately confiscated from storefronts across the United States, and given an SCP number and Euclid object class. However, research quickly revealed that SCP-445-EX were, despite their seemingly anomalous effects, entirely mundane in nature. SCP-445-EX's effects were able to be reproduced using non-anomalous means.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry discovered that SCP-445-EX had arrived at storefronts in a non-anomalous fashion, against the usual operations of GoI-386. Documents tracing the acquisition of SCP-445-EX determined that they were being manufactured at a GoI-386 owned factory in Boston. Covert surveillance of the factory discovered no anomalous activity within, except for the presence of two workers matching the profiles for <a href=\"/wonder-world-dossier\">Wonder World</a> denizens. Said individuals, however, hid their anomalous nature from other mundane workers within the building.</p>\n<p>The GoI-386 Research &amp; Investigation team met on 04/12/2042 to discuss how best to proceed. <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-everwood#pages\">Dr. Justine Everwood</a>, the head of the team, suggested they call the help number in the back of the booklets, and ask directly about the product. Despite mixed feedback, it was agreed that the possibility of negative consequences was minimal. Calling the number yielded the following conversation:</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25ba\u00a0Access\u00a0SCP-445-EX\u00a0Phone\u00a0Call</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c4\u00a0Hide\u00a0SCP-445-EX\u00a0Phone\u00a0Call</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-2983\">May Waters</a><br/>\n<strong>Interviewed:</strong> PoI-445-EX-003 (Respondent)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>(After two rings, Unknown picks up the phone, and speaks in a feminine voice with a Boston accent.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Respondent:</strong> Hello, this is Dr. Wondertainment's Origami Ori-Games help hotline, how may I help you?</p>\n<p><strong>May Waters:</strong> Hello, this is May Waters, a record donor to the Sweets &amp; Consumables Department in 2002.

It doesn't help you get up in the morning. It holds down your smile.</p>\n<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> I like my smile, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> You\u2026 lost hope? What, what made you lose hope?</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Oh, many things. The earth cooks, the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. The people at the top don't care and the people at the bottom lack the power to do anything. Famine and drought rates are rising, natural disasters and weather patterns are becoming more severe. It feels like there are too many problems, and I'm just one woman. I'm an old woman, too. Maybe older than you would think by looking at me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> 70 something?</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Oh, older than that, sweetie. I'm a natural born Wonder World tee em citizen \u2014 one of the first, even. I was 44 when I gained the title of Dr. Wondertainment in 1999. I grew up during the later days of Chester Williams. He was just about to reach 100 in 1976, when he passed and Cornelius took his place. I lived through the Civil Rights era, and the Vietnam War. I've since lived through the nuclear scare under President Trump, the election of Bolsonaro. I've seen countless coups and I've seen sinking cities.</p>\n<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I'm\u2026</p>\n<p><em>(The jingle of a door opening and closing can be heard in the background.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Growing up in Wonder World tee em gives you a lot of things. It fills you with a sense of magic, and wonder at everything on earth and elsewhere. It tells you that you can do anything you set your mind to, accomplish all of your dreams and more. Best yet, it tells you that you can make the world a better place. Just by being here and being yourself. What it doesn't do, it doesn't prepare you for when that doesn't happen. For when everything you've ever done amounts to the smallest possible blip on the radar, a tiny squiggle up on a graph that trends down.</p>\n<p><em>(Holly breathes audibly for five seconds.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> Uhh\u2026 don't be, I\u2026 take your time.</p>\n<p><em>(There is a fifteen second pause.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> The more hope you have, the more you have to lose, and the longer you have it, the less you know how to live without it. But it still remains that without hope, the spirit dies. And hope was a scarce commodity. So\u2026 so, I appointed Judy. Judy's\u2026 such a sweetie. Such a slice of pie. <em>(Giggles, and then pauses.)</em> She'd figured out something I hadn't. I still don't know where she gets it, but good Lord I am so happy she has it. She still has hope. She has faith that we can make the world a better place. And even if I've lost that soul myself\u2026 it keeps me afloat to see just how much she has. Maybe it rubs off on me a little, because even when all I feel like doing is crying and giving up, Judy can make me smile. And even when I feel like everything is lost, she can convince me to go out and make friends out of enemies, eheh.</p>\n<p><em>(Pause. Holly sips her drink.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I still don't think I understand, why\u2026 why create a toy without properties? Why make something mundane?</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> <em>(Finishes her sip before speaking.)</em> Dr. Wondertainment, the company, had been content to supply toys to the wondrous community alone for a very long time. There came a point at which we realized that we couldn't keep doing what we were doing and also supply the normal kids with magic. We still gave it a shot, every once in a while. I have it on good authority that you seem to find toys that have snuck through and into a child's lap every once in a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> Heh, yes, yes we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> I like to believe that for every one you find, there are five or ten you don't. And those are the children that will know what magic is. How the world is filled with wonder. But for every five or ten that do get an original Dr. Wondertainment brand toy, there are thousands, millions that don't. Children that don't ever learn that they can be surprised by the beauty of the world. That don't know what it's like to sit down and let their imagination take them everywhere and anywhere. Who don't know what it's like to truly have hope that something magical and miraculous will happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Well, Judy thought, if we can't touch the hearts of every man woman and child, then what are we even doing here. What's our point. She said it less pessimistically of course, the darling\u2026 but that was the idea. In the world's time of need, it's not enough that we give those gifted enough to be born with magic in their bodies more magic in their lives. Our truest dedication needs to be to those people who don't know magic. Who don't know wonder. Who don't know what it's like to be awestruck in the confines of their own room. Those people that never believed in Santa Claus, or the Tooth Fairy. Those are the people we need to touch. And those people don't get magical toys. Other people make sure that they don't.</p>\n<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I'm so sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Don't be, please. Despite my disagreements with your organization, I'm of the belief that everyone is trying to do what they think is best. Sometime's it's hard to hold that belief. But I at least think it makes me happier to believe it. I understand that you believe that society crumbles without rules, and those include the rules of the universe. I know we seem to break them to you, sweetie. It's alright.</p>\n<p><em>(Holly sighs.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> I need you to know that I love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> I need you to know that, because we started this project out of love for each and every human being. No matter their flaws. No matter who they are. No matter what they believe. And we need you to feel that love. Because that's the only way this will work. Because we need you to agree with us, to set aside our differences. We made Origami Ori-Games to attract your attention. It's worked, clearly. But the next step is that you let us distribute our toys. Please.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> We promise we won't break the veil \u2014 nothing anomalous in the non-anomalous community. We promise we will operate in plain sight. We'll leave a paper trail. We're a registered national company now. But we need your support, or we will fail. <em>(Pause.)</em> Please.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Please.</p>\n<p><em>(Pause. The sound of a coffee grinder can be heard in the background.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I\u2026 I can contact my superiors, and try to arrange a meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Are you sure they will listen to you, darling? To me?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> I can't promise anything but\u2026 yes, but, yes, I'm almost certain they'll listen. They would love to hear that an anomalous company is\u2026 going mundane.</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> It would mean a lot to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Everwood:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Light:</strong> Thank you ever so much.

Inside each kit are 36 square pieces of construction paper, of various colors, and a paper booklet that gives instructions on how to make several origami figures with the provided papers. Pouring salt over the paper will activate microscopic sensors calibrated to detect salt crystals, which in turn activate [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_elastomers dielectric elastomers][[footnote]]Materials that expand or contract when given an electrical signal.[[/footnote]] within the construction paper.\n\n\n\nThe resulting effect is a minimal but thematically appropriate movement -- for example, a crane made with this paper, following the instructions in the booklet exactly, will slowly flap its wings when introduced to salt.\n\n\n\nDue to the Dr. Wondertainment brand, SCP-445-EX were immediately confiscated from storefronts across the United States, and given an SCP number and Euclid object class. However, research quickly revealed that SCP-445-EX were, despite their seemingly anomalous effects, entirely mundane in nature. SCP-445-EX's effects were able to be reproduced using non-anomalous means.\n\n\n\nFurther inquiry discovered that SCP-445-EX had arrived at storefronts in a non-anomalous fashion, against the usual operations of GoI-386. Documents tracing the acquisition of SCP-445-EX determined that they were being manufactured at a GoI-386 owned factory in Boston. Covert surveillance of the factory discovered no anomalous activity within, except for the presence of two workers matching the profiles for [[[Wonder World Dossier|Wonder World]]] denizens. Said individuals, however, hid their anomalous nature from other mundane workers within the building.\n\n\n\nThe GoI-386 Research & Investigation team met on 04/12/2042 to discuss how best to proceed. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-everwood#pages Dr. Justine Everwood], the head of the team, suggested they call the help number in the back of the booklets, and ask directly about the product. Despite mixed feedback, it was agreed that the possibility of negative consequences was minimal. Calling the number yielded the following conversation:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"\u25ba Access SCP-445-EX Phone Call\" hide=\"\u25c4 Hide SCP-445-EX Phone Call\"]]\n\n> **Interviewer:** [[[SCP-2983|May Waters]]]\n\n> **Interviewed:** PoI-445-EX-003 (Respondent)\n\n> \n\n> -----\n\n> \n\n> //(After two rings, Unknown picks up the phone, and speaks in a feminine voice with a Boston accent.)//\n\n> \n\n> **Respondent:** Hello, this is Dr. Wondertainment's Origami Ori-Games help hotline, how may I help you?\n\n> \n\n> **May Waters:** Hello, this is May Waters, a record donor to the Sweets & Consumables Department in 2002.

She has faith that we can make the world a better place. And even if I've lost that soul myself... it keeps me afloat to see just how much she has. Maybe it rubs off on me a little, because even when all I feel like doing is crying and giving up, Judy can make me smile. And even when I feel like everything is lost, she can convince me to go out and make friends out of enemies, eheh.\n\n> \n\n> //(Pause. Holly sips her drink.)//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** I still don't think I understand, why... why create a toy without properties? Why make something mundane?\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** //(Finishes her sip before speaking.)// Dr. Wondertainment, the company, had been content to supply toys to the wondrous community alone for a very long time. There came a point at which we realized that we couldn't keep doing what we were doing and also supply the normal kids with magic. We still gave it a shot, every once in a while. I have it on good authority that you seem to find toys that have snuck through and into a child's lap every once in a while.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** Heh, yes, yes we do.\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** I like to believe that for every one you find, there are five or ten you don't. And those are the children that will know what magic is. How the world is filled with wonder. But for every five or ten that do get an original Dr. Wondertainment brand toy, there are thousands, millions that don't. Children that don't ever learn that they can be surprised by the beauty of the world. That don't know what it's like to sit down and let their imagination take them everywhere and anywhere. Who don't know what it's like to truly have hope that something magical and miraculous will happen.\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** Well, Judy thought, if we can't touch the hearts of every man woman and child, then what are we even doing here. What's our point. She said it less pessimistically of course, the darling... but that was the idea. In the world's time of need, it's not enough that we give those gifted enough to be born with magic in their bodies more magic in their lives. Our truest dedication needs to be to those people who don't know magic. Who don't know wonder. Who don't know what it's like to be awestruck in the confines of their own room. Those people that never believed in Santa Claus, or the Tooth Fairy. Those are the people we need to touch. And those people don't get magical toys. Other people make sure that they don't.\n\n> \n\n> //(Pause.)//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** I'm so sorry.\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** Don't be, please. Despite my disagreements with your organization, I'm of the belief that everyone is trying to do what they think is best. Sometime's it's hard to hold that belief. But I at least think it makes me happier to believe it. I understand that you believe that society crumbles without rules, and those include the rules of the universe. I know we seem to break them to you, sweetie. It's alright.\n\n> \n\n> //(Holly sighs.)//\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** I need you to know that I love you.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** What?\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** I need you to know that, because we started this project out of love for each and every human being. No matter their flaws. No matter who they are. No matter what they believe. And we need you to feel that love. Because that's the only way this will work. Because we need you to agree with us, to set aside our differences. We made Origami Ori-Games to attract your attention. It's worked, clearly. But the next step is that you let us distribute our toys. Please.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** I--\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** We promise we won't break the veil -- nothing anomalous in the non-anomalous community. We promise we will operate in plain sight. We'll leave a paper trail. We're a registered national company now. But we need your support, or we will fail. //(Pause.)// Please.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** I...\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** Please.\n\n> \n\n> //(Pause. The sound of a coffee grinder can be heard in the background.)//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** I... I can contact my superiors, and try to arrange a meeting.\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** Are you sure they will listen to you, darling? To me?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** I can't promise anything but... yes, but, yes, I'm almost certain they'll listen. They would love to hear that an anomalous company is... going mundane.\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** It would mean a lot to me.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Everwood:** Yeah.\n\n> \n\n> **Holly Light:** Thank you ever so much. Thank you for meeting me here and listening to me. Thank you for giving me hope.\n\n> \n\n> -----\n\n> \n\n> **Note:** Dr. Everwood asked that the rest of the recording be cut.

That piece was just <em>titled</em> \"My Magnum Opus\".</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Balodis quietly sighs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> But if one thing could <em>actually</em> be my most important piece, my <em>true</em> Magnum Opus, it'd be that juicer y'all took. It alone has given to me the knowledge and creativity to make anart that the world has never seen before!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Could\u2026 you explain what you mean by that?</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 chuckles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> I'm surprised you don't already know how it's done. After all, you must have had a reason for taking it beyond just being a dick to lil' old me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Actually, we don't. We received an anonymous tip about it saying that it had the ability to alter concepts but-</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 interrupts Dr. Balodis.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Fuck, I bet it was Sara, she seemed pretty pissed that I wouldn't let her use it when she came over the other day. Was it a woman who gave the tip? Heavyset, bit of a lisp?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 points at Dr. Balodis.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> It <em>is</em> Sara! I could tell by the way you avoided the question.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> This isn't relevant, and I would <em>appreciate it</em> if you stop worrying about petty rivalries and tell us how that juicer actually works.</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 crosses his arms.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Sure. No harm in it since I'll be busting out of here with it once nobody's looking. It's not just a normal juicer, it juices <em>ideas</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Could you go into a bit more detail than that? We haven't quite figured out how that happens.</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 grins smugly and leans back in his chair.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Oh, it's simple, really. Just think about something you want to focus on, make some juice with that juicer and anything you think about is instantly sharper, more focused in your head. It will let you see things that you never thought of before!</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Balodis opens his mouth to speak but then pauses, squinting at PoI-8675.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Mr. Francis, are you telling me that you just think about something, make some juice and then\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Then have my third eye opened and create art that the world has never seen before? That's correct.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Balodis covers his mouth, attempting to stifle a laugh.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Laugh if you want, not everyone will get my genius.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Balodis lowers his hand, revealing an amused smile.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> It's not that, it's that\u2026 that explains why none of our tests were able to pick up anything anomalous about it!</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> 'Scuse me?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> I mean, it's a really well-made juicer, we put a whole durian in there and it turned it into a thin liquid, but\u2026 Mr. Francis, you just built a juicer.</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 snorts.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Nah, you're just doing it wrong. You're not thinking about things the right way.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Mr. Francis, do you know what a placebo effect is?</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675 leans forward on the table.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> It's not fake. It's real, and I know it is. You just\u2026</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675's face drops briefly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> Y'all're doing it wrong! You gotta be!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Or alternatively, thanks to all those fruits and vegetables that you drink on a supposedly daily basis, you lead a healthy lifestyle that lets you think more clearly and focus on your work.</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> What? No! No, that's\u2026 No!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> If you're confident that we're using it wrong, we'll let you drink from it and run some scans on you to prove your claim.</p>\n<p><em>PoI-8675's face becomes angry.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-8675:</strong> I'll do it! I'll show you that it's not just all in my head, that thing is <em>real</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Balodis:</strong> Sure. Personally, I just think you like juice.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Soon after the interview, PoI-8675 was restrained to prevent any attempts at escape and escorted to a secure holding chamber. Several tests were done with SCP-4734-EX using PoI-8675 as the test subject, none of which resulting in any form of anomalous properties manifesting. Approximately two hours after testing was concluded and PoI-8675 was left alone in his holding cell, he was reported to have exclaimed, \"It's just fucking juice!\"</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-4734-ex\">SCP-4734-EX</a>\" by OthellotheCat, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

SCP-500-EX is the current CEO and owner of the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation, which apart from the production of SCP-500-EX-1, is non-anomalous. The company was formed in 1878 and specializes in the production of medicine and medical materials such as bandages, disinfectants, and medical syringes. The company owns and operates seven factories across four U.S. states<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.

These effects become more pronounced after repeated usage. The label on SCP-500-EX-1 stated that it was able to cure ailments including, but not limited to: Migraines, Cramps, Fatigue, Insomnia, and the Flu. It is not currently understood how SCP-500-EX enhances the properties of SCP-500-EX-1. Prior to its discovery, SCP-500-EX-1 was labeled as \"Miracle Migraine Pills\" and sold across the US States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Why is, \"-EX\" placed in the text after the mention of SCP-500 and SCP-500-1?

But alas, he swore that the merchants stated that these pills would cure any cramps and after believing his rhetoric, I took them and was filled with an immense energy, and within less than 3 hours I was once again walking without being halted by any pain!

Both sides wanted the Maumee River that runs through the city just a few blocks away from 'ere. Something about controlling the trade from The Great Lakes I think. But regardless, in the end, Ohio won but as compensation, President Jackson awarded Michigan the upper peninsula. I had a granpappy who was part of the militiamen in Perrysburg. You lot should go sightseeing around during your stay.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Indeed. Grow up in this area? Or are you from somewhere else?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> I was born 'ere. I mean, not 'ere exactly I was born down in Waterville just down the river but y'know, same area.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX lets out a brief chuckle.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> But we moved 'round the states lot. Sometime in 1856, ma pappy moved us all out to Maryland. Always was disgusted by the rebels and them owning slaves so he joined the army and fought from 1861 to Appomattox Courthouse. Even in the battle of Gettysburg. When he got back he moved us all out west to San Francisco for 'bouta decade. Then he bought a farm 'round Topeka and I stayed there 'till I was 23. Then I left for my hometown right here in Toledo where I started to sell some medicine. One decade later, 'ere I am!</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Speaking of, today we are here to talk about some of the medicine your company sells. The \"Miracle Migraine Pills\". Can you inform us about how you make them and their anomalous effects? What we are curious about is that they are nearly identical to common sugar pills, but still manage to cure many things. Can you explain how it works?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX chuckles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> All in the magic! It's just a little personal secret that I myself know.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX taps on their head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> As you may have surmised, the SCP Foundation is an organization that is dedicated to the containment of the anomalous and unexplainable within our world. We believe that your pills are anomalous and as such wish to contain them. We hope to get your cooperation with this but will proceed without it.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Relax! I am fully willing to cooperate with the Foundation! I would just like to enter some negotiations first! After all, Miracle Migraine Pills do make up a sizeable chunk of my company's revenue. Can I assume that you use 'em after purchasing them? Or do you throw 'em all into a fire to destroy them after?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Our goal is to contain anomalies, not destroy them. But yes, we have undergone limited practical use with the pills.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Wonderful! Perhaps we can negotiate a deal where you are the only people who will get the Miracle Migraine Pills at a competitive price, and they're left offa the public market!</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> I will talk with my superiors to see if we can attempt to negotiate a purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Wonderous! Perhaps in two days time at 12:30 PM, I'll show you around my factory? It is only a 20-minute horse carriage ride away from this hotel! We can discuss the details right there in my office!</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> That would be lovely! We will prepare to meet at that date with any potential deal. Before we end the interview I have one last question.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Of course! What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Do you have a list of what stores you give the Miracle Migraine Pills to?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Hmmm. I do not know exactly what stores I provide the pills to off of the top of my head but will provide you with one when you visit my office!</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX stands up and shakes Wallace's and the rest of the agent's hands.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Well it's great meeting y'all! I hope to see you again soon! Well I know I will haha. I look forward to it! I will make sure to stay quiet about this meeting until our next. Have a good day fellows!</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX leaves and the team returns to their hotel rooms. A report is transmitted to Site-11 command via telegraph.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[END INTERVIEW]</p>\n<p><strong>CLOSING NOTES:</strong> Follow-up interview set for 12:30 PM on March 4th, 1894, at 555 Star Lane, Toledo, Ohio, United States. The intro offer is to buy three thousand pills of SCP-500-EX-1 (500 packets) at a price of $150 and an additional twelve hundred pills (200 packets) for $75 every three months. In exchange, SCP-500-EX will agree to not sell SCP-500-EX-1 to the general public, or any other organization without approval from the SCP Foundation. SCP-500-EX will be able to retain their freedom so long as they abide by the agreement.</p>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>INTERVIEW LOG</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>DATE:</strong> March 4th, 1894. 12:30 AM</p>\n<p><strong>INTERVIEWEE:</strong> Arthur Jackson Swanson \"SCP-500-EX\"</p>\n<p><strong>INTERVIEWER'S:</strong> William Charles Wallace, George Richard McDonnell</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Welcome to ma office gentlemen! I already know Mr. Wallace but I haven't met you yet! What's your name?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX stands up and shakes McDonnell's and Wallace's hands.</em></p>\n<p><strong>McDonnell:</strong> George McDonnell. I'm here to make the deal between you and the Foundation today.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Of course! No point in wasting any time. What're y'all offering?</p>\n<p><strong>McDonnell:</strong> There's much more paperwork with the specifics of the arrangement, however, the general provisions are that in exchange for 500 packs of SCP-500-EX-1-</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Sorry to interrupt, but just to clarify SCP-500-EX-1 is the Miracle Migraine Pills?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Yes. You're also referred to as SCP-500-EX in transposition.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX nods and raises his hands.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Just making sure! Sorry 'bout interrupting, but go ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>McDonnell:</strong> Don't worry about it. As I was saying; the general provisions are quickly read out in the article. They're pretty short, basically, just you agree to supply us with SCP-500-EX-1 in exchange for money, along with following some rules as to not release info you know about the Foundation to the public.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Howbout this, for nothing extra I'll give you all of the SCP-500-EX-1 that I have at the moment. But there will be an additional $10 for every additional mass purchase. Sound good?</p>\n<p><strong>McDonnell:</strong> How many extra SCP-500-EX-1 packets do you have on hand?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> One hundred and eighty-four!</p>\n<p><strong>McDonnell:</strong> I believe that will work.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX lets out a grin and shakes both of their hands.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Alright! Now I will likely take a few days to read this over gentlemen. After all, always read the fine print! But I promise you that I will personally walk to the hotel you folks are staying in to hand the signed paperwork over!</p>\n<p><strong>McDonnell:</strong> Well, it is probably best if I go back to the hotel to report this. A chunk of the agreement that I am sure you will read focuses on research. Dr. Wallace here will occasionally study the creation process and you yourself. I am assuming that is okay?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Of course it is! Ya guys are my new business partners! So I should show some level of trust! Matter of fact, ya guys ready for that tour 'round the facility I have, here and now?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Splendid! Well all of us best be going now!</p>\n<p><em>Everyone walks out of the room. SCP-500-EX quickly runs back in to get something from a drawer on his desk.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Whew! Almost forgot 'bout this!</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX hands Wallace a couple of pieces of paper.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> There's a list of all of the names and addresses of the 284 stores that I sell Mira- er, sorry. SCP-500-EX-1 in. This should help in your containment correct?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> Correct. Thank you for all of your assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Not a problem at all! Now, let's go on with that tour!</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX and Wallace leave to tour the factory while McDonnell leaves for the hotel to telegraph the report back.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[END INTERVIEW]</p>\n<p><strong>CLOSING NOTES:</strong> SCP-500-EX seems to be very cooperative with the Foundation so far. As you have seen in the transcribed conversation, the Foundation has managed to secure hundreds more of SCP-500-EX-1 with the cooperation of SCP-500-EX and I believe our relationship with SCP-500-EX is going to be greatly beneficial.

Five subjects ingest one pill a day for the duration of one year, five subjects ingest three pills a day for the duration of one year, and ten subjects ingest two pills a day for the duration of one year. Upon the conclusion of testing, broader usage of SCP-500-EX-1 will be considered.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1896:</strong></td>\n<td>January 25th, 19 subjects survive in good health at the end of testing. The 20th subject, Edward LaFoullate, ceased life function following a severe infection of Influenza. Gradual usage in Site-11 approved by site command. From July 18th, SCP-500-EX-1 is to be used on all D-Class personnel to treat non-life-threatening injuries.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1897:</strong></td>\n<td>February 1st, medical resources used to medically treat D-Class personnel had declined by 71%. SCP-500-EX-1 is to be used as a primary treatment ten hours prior to other means of treatment to reduce unnecessary medical expenditures. September 4th, usage of SCP-500-EX-1 is to be used across all SCP Facilities across the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1898:</strong></td>\n<td>March 20th, Foundation medical expenditures within sites using SCP-500-EX-1 down 67%. Negotiations have begun with SCP-500-EX to purchase additional SCP-500-EX-1 instances. November 27th, a business deal has been made to purchase an additional 200 packs of SCP-500-EX-1 for $65. A further agreement was reached that the price for each packet would be $0.50 starting January 1st, 1900.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1899:</strong></td>\n<td>April 1st, an effort is to begin to ship several dozen packets of SCP-500-EX-1 to all global Foundation locations. All Foundation facilities within North America are to be equipped with SCP-500-EX-1 by December 31st, 1899. O5 vote: 11-2.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1900:</strong></td>\n<td>January 1, Distributionary hubs have been established at Site-14 for shipping across the Pacific Ocean and at Site-184 for shipping across the Atlantic Ocean. The previous arrangement has gone into effect, and the price per packet of SCP-500-EX-1 has risen to $0.50. SCP-500-EX has informed the Foundation about the opening of a third factory for its non-anomalous business.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1901:</strong></td>\n<td>June 11th, 90% of Foundation locations globally have received an adequate supply of SCP-500-EX. Global supply is expected to be complete by January 1st, 1902. August 9th, an additional 500 packets of SCP-500-EX-1 have been purchased for $250.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1902</strong></td>\n<td>January 1st, Foundation medical expenditures since March 20th, 1898 have decreased by 71%. SCP-500-EX has reported the opening of a fourth factory owned by the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. October 12th, SCP-500-EX has reported the opening of another two factories.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1903</strong></td>\n<td>April 14th, an additional 1000 packs of SCP-500-EX-1 have been purchased by the Foundation due to mass shortages. SCP-500-EX offered to give all packets for free in exchange for the price of each packet of SCP-500-EX-1 being raised to $1. O5 vote: 5-8. A counteroffer has been reached to raise the price to $0.75 per packet. In addition, a further 200 packets are going to be ordered per every routine order.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1904:</strong></td>\n<td>February 20th, usage of SCP-500-EX-1 is to begin field testing to determine of SCP-500-EX-1 has practical use during missions. August 20th, SCP-500-EX-1 only had success in improving the results of agents in the field 4.3% of the time. Senior Researcher William Wallace hypothesized that heightened levels of adrenaline lead to SCP-500-EX-1 having a reduced effect in the majority of cases. This was determined to be the solution and field usage of SCP-500-EX-1 has been scrapped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1905:</strong></td>\n<td>June 14th, SCP-500-EX has reported the opening of a seventh factory for the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. Senior Researcher William Wallace has announced his retirement effective January 15th, 1906. Researcher Johnathan Cleveland is to be promoted to the head researcher of SCP-500-EX and SCP-500-EX-1 effective immediately following Wallace's retirement.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Production Test 500-EX-A</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> March 19th, 1906</p>\n<p><strong>Researcher(s):</strong> Johnathan Cleveland, Jerimiah Dougherty</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To conclude if it is necessary for SCP-500-EX to oversee the production line of SCP-500-EX-1 at a factory owned by the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation, or if SCP-500-EX-1 will be produced if SCP-500-EX oversees any production line producing sugar pills. If so, transportation costs to transport SCP-500-EX-1 from the location of the factories in Ohio to Site-14 and Site-184. SCP-500-EX was awarded $100 for their participation, although they repeatedly stated that the new process will most likely not produce SCP-500-EX-1, as they can not adequately ensure that the pills become anomalous outside of their original production lines.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>A technician activates a phonograph in the room while Cleveland and Dougherty are having a conversation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> It isn't too late to call off the experiment. We could save $10 for each of the personnel volunteering.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> If I wanted to save money, I would've just used D-Class.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> That's another thing, why didn't you just get D-Class to do this? Why'd it have to be employees?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> The D-Class'd just tell us what we want them to hear. It's happened before. Besides, barely any of the D-Class in the site have even had the current SCP-500-EX-1 cause we cycle through 'em too fast. So they wouldn't know what it actually does. Then the few that have aren't sick right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Fine. But I still stand that it is not too late to cancel the whole thing. With SCP-500-EX saying that it won't work I doubt-</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Come on? You're seriously going to take that charlatan's word for it? You do know that he also charges the Foundation for transportation and imagine aaaaallll of that money he would lose out on if he stopped shipping from Toledo to Sacramento.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Yeah, but then wouldn't he just decide to not make SCP-500-EX-1?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Eh. Even if he does it's worth a shot. The old researcher barely did any actual research because he didn't need to as his SCP was \"The Thaumiel SCP that is reducing costs\".</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> You make a good point.</p>\n<p><em>Ten Foundation personnel walk in accompanied by SCP-500-EX and two members of security.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Greetings ladies and gentlemen. For the purposes of these tests, you ten will be designated as TS-500-EX-1 through TS-500-EX-10. All of you have already been handed a note with your designation for this test, you may take this time to memorize it if you haven't already.</p>\n<p><em>Cleveland pauses for two minutes to let the personnel memorize their temporary identification.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Alright. I assume y'all are good. Today you have all been selected for a test as you all have reported to the medical bay citing symptoms ranging from migraines to cramps. As you all are aware, the standard procedure is to give you folks a sample of SCP-500-EX-1 until your condition improves, however, we are undergoing testing to discover a new means of producing SCP-500-EX-1. We believe that this new way of producing SCP-500-EX-1 will work exactly the same and save the Foundation expenses on trans~</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Just to clarify someth'n a brief second, this new way of producing SCP-500-EX-1 likely will not work. From what they've told me, this is merely a test to permanently conclude if it will or will not. Which I am most certain it won't. But I guess the higher-ups just ain't listenin' to me! Guess it makes me more in the end so why should I care?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Yes\u2026 thank you, Mr. Swanson. As he said, this may not be fully effective though we do have significant reasoning to believe it will. You each will be given two pills of SCP-500-EX-1 a day for one week and we will check back in then. That is all for now.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX turns on a machine within the room they are standing in, which has been designed to replicate the production process of SCP-500-EX-1 in the factories of the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. 11 minutes pass before the first pills are produced.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> There ya have it gentlemen! 140 fine pills of \"SCP-500-EX-1\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>.

It stinks back here. Literally, y'all need to install some sorta ventilation 'round this section.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> I believe you two should leave to get your payment assorted. Have a great day.</p>\n<p><em>Dougherty leaves with SCP-500-EX and the two guards to head to accounting.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Ignore what SCP-500-EX said. He gets paid extra to ship it directly to our facilities from Nova Scotia to Sacramento. He's only saying that to try to dissuade us from testing. The pills will work exactly the same as normal ones.</p>\n<p><em>Various conversations between the test subjects can be heard, ranging from subjects doubting the legitimacy of this SCP-500-EX-1 to believing in it. Cleveland walks over to the production line and hands each test subject one pill of SCP-500-EX-1.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Go directly here later to get the second pill before you sleep. By tomorrow we will have pills in containers ready for all of you.</p>\n<p><em>The test subjects walk out as Dougherty walks back into the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> That guy has to have sabotaged it. But why'd he try so hard to convince everyone that it wouldn't work?</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Probably wants to look smart. If it fails he can say \"Oh. You know I did tell you that it wouldn't work.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Regardless, he gives me the same appearance as a snake oil salesman. But of course, I'm stuck studying him unless I can transfer to another SCP.</p>\n<p><em>Dougherty laughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Very sad. You have to spend a few days every few months overseeing the production line of the factory with him. I couldn't dare stand it.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Shut up.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Fine. After work wanna head to get a bit of whiskey?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Sure. Oh yeah, can you turn this thing off?</p>\n<p><em>Cleveland points to the phonograph and the technician turns it off.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Test results</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> March 26th, 1906</p>\n<p><strong>Researcher(s):</strong> Johnathan Cleveland, Jerimiah Dougherty</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Mixed results. Six test subjects reported that SCP-500-EX-1 had no effect. Four subjects (TS-500-EX-2, TS-500-EX-3, TS-500-EX-7, and TS-500-EX-9) reported being symptom-free by the end of the one week period.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-1:</strong> Nothing changed. I had terrible cramps in my leg and they never got less severe and are still present.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-2:</strong> I was a bit skeptical at first, but low and behold within a few hours of ingesting SCP-500-EX-1 my headache was feeling better. By day two it was gone.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-3:</strong> Had some pretty bad sleep. By day six it was pretty much gone and by now I feel a lot better rested.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-4:</strong> As soon as SCP-500-EX said that it wasn't gonna work I knew it wouldn't help. Sure as hell, I was right.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-5:</strong> Felt a really bad headache and the pills didn't help with my pain like they normally do. I would say SCP-500-EX was right in that it wouldn't work.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-6:</strong> Whilst SCP-500-EX-1 usually does help with any issues, in this case, my issue (constipation) did not get fixed by the new SCP-500-EX-1 pills.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-7:</strong> I had been feeling nausea for about a day prior but just two days of SCP-500-EX-1 were able to relieve it. I told TS-500-EX-9 about it and he was shocked. Saying it wasn't working for him or whatnot.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-8:</strong> After this can I get actual treatment for my fever? Cause the pills didn't do shit. I can barely focus on anything. The only thing I remember clearly is you giving me the pills that the guy said wouldn't work. Then over the week, nothing changed. What the fuck is the point of this study?</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-9:</strong> At first the pills didn't kick in. But ironically literally right as TS-500-EX-7 told me it was working for her it started working for me. I didn't really notice it but my cramps were gradually getting better. By today it is gone.</p>\n<p><strong>TS-500-EX-10:</strong> Had a migraine for a while and the pills didn't take away my headache. I was pretty much always skeptical from the start and it didn't improve afterwards. The pain slowly went away by around day five but I am not convinced it was the pills rather than just it being natural.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> No current explanation has been provided to explain the decisive results shown in the trial. As such, until one is provided the experiment is to be considered a failure. SCP-500-EX-1 is to continue to be purchased from the previous factories.<br/>\n\"I know some people let SCP-500-EX read the classified versions of these reports, and I would prefer if you did not. But in this case, it is critical that SCP-500-EX does not read this report. There is a high likelihood that there is a factor in the production of SCP-500-EX that we were close to discovering which SCP-500-EX attempted to halt via trying to stop the experiment prior to its start. I believe this hidden element was used on some of the subjects, and if we can isolate this factor we may even be able to halt any further purchases in favor of our own production. Experimentation is to begin in five days.\" <em>-Johnathan Cleveland</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> March 31st, 1906</p>\n<p><strong>Researcher(s):</strong> Johnathan Cleveland</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Recommence the same test conditions as done five days prior.

Past infractions will not be punished retroactively, however, future misconduct will result in harsh punishment.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014 Senior Researcher Johnathan Cleveland</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 8th, 1906</p>\n<p><strong>Researcher(s)</strong> Johnathan Cleveland, Jerimiah Dougherty</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> It ain't gonna work.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> It will.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> You can't just call some pills you made an anomaly and expect it to be anomalous.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> SCP-500-EX did. So far, it's worked well enough for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Of course! That explains everything! SCP-500-EX somehow tricked hundreds of independent shops and the entire Foundation for decades! With dozens of agents watching his every move!</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> C'mon. For every individual shop that was selling the pills, there were at least 10 more that SCP-500-EX wasn't able to convince to sell them. The guy gave us all of his documents and there were 'round 4,000 stores that refused to sell SCP-500-EX-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> And how exactly does that relate to this experiment? You haven't exactly given me any reasoning or even a written hypothesis. The only thing I know is that if any of the personnel are naughty and let slip any of the information related to SCP-500-EX they get demoted to monster food.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> I have personally traveled to around 400 drugstores that either denied to sell SCP-500-EX-1 or have sold it. All of the ones that denied it said that the pills didn't work, and the only reason SCP-500-EX-1 began to be sold was because SCP-500-EX paid the store around $10 a week to sell it while the store still got the majority of profits. Even then SCP-500-EX spent about a month having to convince people SCP-500-EX-1 worked before it finally took off. The vast majority of its success was after people were convinced it would work.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Then that convinced you that it was the reason why the first experiment had mixed results?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> I've spent hours analyzing every second of the test and interviewed each of the subjects over a dozen times, and the only thing that I've noticed different is that in the first experiment, SCP-500-EX told the subjects that it would fail, and in the second I told the subjects it would work.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Then the Foundation just didn't realize that for 14 years! Perfectly logical.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> The old researcher is a bum who sat back on the easiest job in the Foundation. Literally, all he had to do was watch over the production line a few times with SCP-500-EX and oversee distribution and he became one of the most important researchers.</p>\n<p><em>Site-11 Junior Guard Williams Zumpano walks into the room in which the two researchers are conversing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Hello Mister Zumpano. I trust you have come to report your migraine dissipating.</p>\n<p><strong>Zumpano:</strong> Indeed! Within the hour of taking the pills, my energy had rejuvenated! By now I am feeling berry!</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Glad to hear it. Take your pills tomorrow to ensure that the migraines are done and dealt with, and I am glad to hear you are in great health. Do you feel any other symptoms, or did SCP-500-EX-1 cure everything?</p>\n<p><strong>Zumpano:</strong> Nope! I feel great!</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Excellent.</p>\n<p><em>Cleveland hands Zumpano a letter.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Within there are three pills. Take one tonight before you sleep, one tomorrow when you wake up, and one tomorrow when you sleep. Within $5 are also found for your participation in the experiment. Have a great night, Williams.</p>\n<p><em>Williams exits the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> There you have it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Damn. Guess you were right. I mean, I guess there is still a chance that this is an isolated incident.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> We'll monitor others to see if there are similar results, if there are similar results we can conclude it to be the cause of the anomaly for SCP-500-EX-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> As for SCP-500-EX?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Probably detain them and seize their company. At least attempt to recover some of the lost finances. As for now, we should keep the results of the study classified to relevant personnel prior to further action.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Alright. Should we begin preparations regardless of the results to detain SCP-500-EX?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Of course. I shall send a report to O5-command regarding the new experiment as soon as it concludes. Tell the guards of SCP-500-EX to be on alert for reinforcements, and send additional personnel to secure the factories owned by SCP-500-EX.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> On it.</p>\n<p><em>Dougherty exits the room while Cleveland writes a report on the experiment.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Post-Experiment Report:</strong> All subjects receiving treatment via Foundation-produced specimens of SCP-500-EX-1 have recovered from their ailments. With the SCP-500-EX-1 specimens functioning the same as normal variants, it is believed that SCP-500-EX and SCP-500-EX-1 are non-anomalous, and function via the subject's belief that the pills are anomalous.</p>\n<p>Further experimentation is to be conducted to deduce the exact science behind the effect seen in SCP-500-EX-1. Action is under review to determine the appropriate way to deal with SCP-500-EX and recuperate lost funding.</p>\n<p>SCP-500-EX has officially been designated as explained, documents are to retroactively have \"-EX\" applied after \"SCP-500\" or prior to \"-1\" in all documentation and transcribed logs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>Containment-Mission 500-EX</span></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>April 11th, 1906</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>T-minus, four hours:</strong> Means of communication through known properties of the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation have been severed. Five of the seven factories have been seized by Foundation agents and 86% of employees have been temporarily detained. A delegation consisting of Head Researcher Cleveland, Assistant Researcher Dougherty, and four armed Foundation employees have entered Toledo, Ohio, United States, to interview and detain SCP-500-EX.</p>\n<p><strong>T-minus, one hour and thirty minutes:</strong> All properties owned by SCP-500-EX and the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation have been seized by the Foundation, with the exception of the Toledo factory. 89% of employees have been temporarily detained.</p>\n<p><strong>T-minus, forty-six minutes:</strong> All employees not actively working at the Toledo factory have been successfully detained.</p>\n<p><strong>T-minus, fourteen minutes:</strong> The Foundation delegation has proceeded en-route to the location of SCP-500-EX.</p>\n<p><strong>T-minus, two minutes:</strong> The delegation has arrived at the factory. Efforts are underway to detain all employees.

I was unaware of your lil' visit today! If I were I would've made the office not look like shit.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX laughs. The other three remain silent.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Not much of a sense of humor? Eh, no worries. What's your business 'ere?</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> We believe there is a substantial threat to the safety of you and your enterprises, as such we are securing your facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Explains the well-dressed well-armed man. You know the telegraph lines to my other facilities ain't been working for the past few hours. It may be worthwhile to check those as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Efforts are already underway. If you may, I would like to ask you a few brief questions. But first, may you inform your employees that we are here for their safety?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Of course! Small price to ensure ma security!</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX reaches for the intercom microphone.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Attention workers, there are some fine gentlemen here with one of our company's business partners. They are here to guard our facilities from any potential dangers, as such, do not interfere with their activities and follow anything they say. They are armed, but just take that to show how safe we are. Thank you.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX places down the microphone.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> As you were saying, what questions do ya have?</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Firstly, may you tell us as to what allows you to create SCP-500-EX-1?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Told ya already! It's a part of ma whatchamacallit\u2026 anomaly!</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Are you sure?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Of course! Make your own pills and try.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> We did.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Ah yes, Mr. Cleveland, I recall was there! From what I ponder it was a resounding failure. That is very sad.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> It was.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Exactly ma point! Ya need me to-</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> I'm going to cut you off there. Remember the second batch of pills we paid you to produce? Well for some reason, the second time around the pills worked.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Oh. That's fascinating\u2026 Do ya have any clues as to how it worked?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Well, after days of meticulous analyzing, we discovered that there was a singular difference in the circumstances. That was you telling the subject that it would not work. So we constructed a completely new production line void of your influence, and without your presence proceeded to make new pills. The most interesting result was that subjects whom were told that the pills were SCP-500-EX-1 were surprisingly healed of their ailments. Do you have any clue as to why that was the result?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-500-EX remains silent.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Not a clue?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Well, our leading theory is that SCP-500-EX-1 is actually non-anomalous. Just works via one's own belief. More importantly, we believe that you knew about this prior, and are going to get answers.</p>\n<p><em>The guard walks over to SCP-500-EX and detains them.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> If you do this I will expose everything I fucking know to everyone as soon as I get out. Unhand me this instant!</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> You won't exactly be \"getting out\" anytime soon.

All of the employees have been rounded up into one room as reinforcements previously assigned to contain SCP-500-EX arrive to help keep the crowd detained.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Did you guys fucking kidnap all of my staff? What are you going to do? Kill them all? All of this over a few thousand fucking dollars?</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> We are not going to terminate them.

The transcript is recorded three (3) hours into the interview.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Tell the truth. If you do, you'll be let out a lot sooner than you would otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Fine. I was reading literature, \"On the Imagination as a Cause &amp; as a Cure of Disorders of the Body\" by John Haygarth. Someth'n like that. He demonstrated that one of the popular medical devices at the time worked via the same effect as SCP-500-EX-1, where the patients believed that it would work. One of my brothers got sick-</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Pause just a second. You have brothers that you have not informed the Foundation about?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Three of em. But one of em got sick as hell with headaches and shit and since we couldn't afford any medicine I gave him some sugar and water and told him it would cure him. Then it worked and he said he didn't have any symptoms anymore. So, after I moved back to Toledo I did a few experiments which saw similar results, and then I tried to start selling em at drug stores.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Then I am assuming afterward when the opportunity presented itself, you decided to scam the foundation?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> I'll talk about getting you released soon, though you will likely not be for a few months if not years. In addition, your assets will be seized by the Foundation in addition to recoup lost finances. Fortunately, your personal assets are selling for a substantial sum of money.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-500-EX:</strong> Fuck you.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Have a great day too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span><strong>O5 Consensus-500-EX-A</strong></span></h3>\n</div>\n<p>\"Given the exemplary research by Dr. Cleveland, paired with the confession of SCP-500-EX, it has unanimously been concluded that SCP-500-EX is <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">non-anomalous</span></strong>.

Medical analysis has concluded that SCP-500-EX's anatomy is non-anomalous, however, SCP-500-EX is able to produce anomalous pills (SCP-500-EX-1) while overseeing a production line within any of the seven factories owned by the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. SCP-500-EX is the current CEO and owner of the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation, which apart from the production of SCP-500-EX-1, is non-anomalous. The company was formed in 1878 and specializes in the production of medicine and medical materials such as bandages, disinfectants, and medical syringes. The company owns and operates seven factories across four U.S. states[[footnote]] In the cities of Toledo (Ohio), Sandusky (Ohio), Dayton (Ohio), Cleveland (Ohio), Chicago (Illinois), Detroit (Michigan), and South Bend (Indiana).[[/footnote]]. Around half of the managerial and high-ranking staff at the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation are embedded Foundation agents to ensure the provisions of Agreement-500-EX are followed by SCP-500-EX.\n\n\n\nSCP-500-EX-1 provides numerous positive anomalous effects in a several-day/week-spanning period following ingestion. These effects become more pronounced after repeated usage. The label on SCP-500-EX-1 stated that it was able to cure ailments including, but not limited to: Migraines, Cramps, Fatigue, Insomnia, and the Flu. It is not currently understood how SCP-500-EX enhances the properties of SCP-500-EX-1. Prior to its discovery, SCP-500-EX-1 was labeled as \"Miracle Migraine Pills\" and sold across the US States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario.\n\n\n\n\n\n> \"Why is, \"-EX\" placed in the text after the mention of SCP-500 and SCP-500-1?

If personnel inquire, they are to be informed that \"-EX\" stands for \"Experimental\" and that the Foundation is working to produce an experimental, higher-quality variant of SCP-500-EX.\n\n\n\nThere is to be a minimum of ten bottles containing a minimum of fifty pills per bottle at every facility.\n\n\n\nAll employees of the Spring Bottom Medical Corporation have been located, amnesticized, and allowed to retain their positions within the company as of 04/08/1913.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-500-EX refers to sugar pills produced by the Foundation for medical use via the Placebo Effect. SCP-500-EX does not possess anomalous qualities, however, due to the Placebo Effect SCP-500-EX still functions to cure minor ailments among unaware staff and D-Class personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Placebo Effect is a psychological medical effect wherein subjects receive fabricated medical treatment but believe they are getting the real treatment for their medical condition. This results in their condition improving due to a series of complex neurobiological actions within subject's brains. The most common form of the Placebo Effect globally is via Placebo pills which are identical to sugar pills in most cases, although there are numerous variants with Placebo pills having herbs within them. Numerous studies have shown that subjects who undergo the ingestion of Placebo pills may report the pills to improve nausea or pain that they are dealing with and better sleep patterns. \n\n\n\n+++++ **SCP-500-EX may be used at the discretion of medical personnel if subjects complain of the following:**\n\n* Difficulty sleeping\n\n* Headaches\n\n* Cramps\n\n* Anxiety[[footnote]] At a revision undergone during the 2002 Foundation mental health awareness week, SCP-500-EX-1 may only be used to treat anxiety if it is the first time within one year that the subject reports severe anxiety. If reports are more frequent, legitimate medical treatment is to be pursued. [[/footnote]]\n\n* Symptoms of the Common Cold\n\n* Fatigue\n\n* Nausea\n\n\n\nWhen subjects are given SCP-500-EX, they are to be informed to return to the medical wing if symptoms persist for a period of eight to seventy-two hours, depending on what SCP-500-EX is used to combat on a case-by-case basis. In the event that subjects return and claim that SCP-500-EX was ineffective, they are to be given legitimate treatment for the ailment that they claim to suffer from. In the event that subjects report similar or identical symptoms within a three-month span, they are to be given proper medical treatment. Failure to do so/the abuse of SCP-500-EX by medical personnel will result in a reprimand.\n\n\n\n+++ Discovery and Research\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOn July 18th, 1892, Senior Commander Horace Meier of Site-11 sent a letter to O5-11 detailing an anomalous experience they had, from Cleveland, Ohio, United States.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n[[size 135%]] Gretings, for I wish that this letter finds you in good health, I most certainly will be.

I had one of my assistants run into the town of Norwalk to get something to help with my mobility, only for him to return not with a wheelchair nor a cane, but with a pack of 6 white pills that he claimed advertised as being able to cure my pain within hours. I was initially filled with fury at him as he stated that the pills cost 25 cents! But alas, he swore that the merchants stated that these pills would cure any cramps and after believing his rhetoric, I took them and was filled with an immense energy, and within less than 3 hours I was once again walking without being halted by any pain! I immediately went to the store with the assistant again and after inquiring, we were able to learn of this salesman named \"Arthur\".\n\n@@ @@\n\nWe bought several more packets of the pills and have sent them in an attached package. The only other information we have been able to extract was that the pills were made by a company named \"Spring Blossom\" and that these pills can supposedly deal with headaches, other pain, and even minor illness. What intrigued me and leads me to believe that these pills are anomalous is that the company advertises these pills as being 3 ingredients only, of which all three are non-anomalous.\n\n@@ @@\n\nI hope that my hypothesis about these pills is true, as this will greatly benefit productivity within the Foundation if that is the case.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[>]]\n\nSincerely,\n\nHorace.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting would promptly begin with the supply of 80 pills to conclude if SCP-500-EX-1 was anomalous prior to its designation as an SCP. \n\n\n\n> [[=]]\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SITE-11 STAFF BULLETIN FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1892.**\n\n> [[Size 75%]] ALL PERSONNEL WITH MINOR MEDICAL ISSUES WILL BE ABLE TO OPT INTO A MEDICAL TESTING PROGRAM FOR A $10 REWARD FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE TEST.

Thank you for offering and agreeing to this interview.\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** My pleasure! I hope y'all people are having a wonderful time so far right 'ere Toledo! If I am correct, I understand y'all folks are with a group known as the \"SCP Foundation\"? \n\n\n\n**Wallace:** Yes we are. The Foundation would like to extend its gratitude for the hotel rooms you have provided to our agents for the duration of their stay.\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** No worries at all! It's my pleasure and duty to ensure any customers of my company are well acquainted! You know this city does have quite a history. Ya ever pondered 'bout why Michigan has that weird peninsula above the state? It's cause Michigan went to war with Ohio over this very town! Both sides wanted the Maumee River that runs through the city just a few blocks away from 'ere. Something about controlling the trade from The Great Lakes I think. But regardless, in the end, Ohio won but as compensation, President Jackson awarded Michigan the upper peninsula. I had a granpappy who was part of the militiamen in Perrysburg. You lot should go sightseeing around during your stay.\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** Indeed. Grow up in this area? Or are you from somewhere else?\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** I was born 'ere. I mean, not 'ere exactly I was born down in Waterville just down the river but y'know, same area.\n\n\n\n//SCP-500-EX lets out a brief chuckle.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** But we moved 'round the states lot. Sometime in 1856, ma pappy moved us all out to Maryland. Always was disgusted by the rebels and them owning slaves so he joined the army and fought from 1861 to Appomattox Courthouse. Even in the battle of Gettysburg. When he got back he moved us all out west to San Francisco for 'bouta decade. Then he bought a farm 'round Topeka and I stayed there 'till I was 23. Then I left for my hometown right here in Toledo where I started to sell some medicine. One decade later, 'ere I am!\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** Speaking of, today we are here to talk about some of the medicine your company sells. The \"Miracle Migraine Pills\". Can you inform us about how you make them and their anomalous effects? What we are curious about is that they are nearly identical to common sugar pills, but still manage to cure many things. Can you explain how it works?\n\n\n\n//SCP-500-EX chuckles.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** All in the magic! It's just a little personal secret that I myself know.\n\n\n\n//SCP-500-EX taps on their head.//\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** As you may have surmised, the SCP Foundation is an organization that is dedicated to the containment of the anomalous and unexplainable within our world. We believe that your pills are anomalous and as such wish to contain them. We hope to get your cooperation with this but will proceed without it.\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Relax! I am fully willing to cooperate with the Foundation! I would just like to enter some negotiations first! After all, Miracle Migraine Pills do make up a sizeable chunk of my company's revenue. Can I assume that you use 'em after purchasing them? Or do you throw 'em all into a fire to destroy them after? \n\n\n\n**Wallace:** Our goal is to contain anomalies, not destroy them. But yes, we have undergone limited practical use with the pills.\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Wonderful! Perhaps we can negotiate a deal where you are the only people who will get the Miracle Migraine Pills at a competitive price, and they're left offa the public market!\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** I will talk with my superiors to see if we can attempt to negotiate a purchase.\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Wonderous! Perhaps in two days time at 12:30 PM, I'll show you around my factory? It is only a 20-minute horse carriage ride away from this hotel! We can discuss the details right there in my office!\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** That would be lovely! We will prepare to meet at that date with any potential deal. Before we end the interview I have one last question.\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Of course! What is it?\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** Do you have a list of what stores you give the Miracle Migraine Pills to? \n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Hmmm. I do not know exactly what stores I provide the pills to off of the top of my head but will provide you with one when you visit my office!\n\n\n\n**Wallace:** Thank you.\n\n\n\n//SCP-500-EX stands up and shakes Wallace's and the rest of the agent's hands.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Well it's great meeting y'all! I hope to see you again soon! Well I know I will haha. I look forward to it! I will make sure to stay quiet about this meeting until our next. Have a good day fellows!\n\n\n\n//SCP-500-EX leaves and the team returns to their hotel rooms. A report is transmitted to Site-11 command via telegraph.//\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[END INTERVIEW]\n\n\n\n**CLOSING NOTES:** Follow-up interview set for 12:30 PM on March 4th, 1894, at 555 Star Lane, Toledo, Ohio, United States. The intro offer is to buy three thousand pills of SCP-500-EX-1 (500 packets) at a price of $150 and an additional twelve hundred pills (200 packets) for $75 every three months. In exchange, SCP-500-EX will agree to not sell SCP-500-EX-1 to the general public, or any other organization without approval from the SCP Foundation.

With SCP-500-EX saying that it won't work I doubt-\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** Come on? You're seriously going to take that charlatan's word for it? You do know that he also charges the Foundation for transportation and imagine aaaaallll of that money he would lose out on if he stopped shipping from Toledo to Sacramento.\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:** Yeah, but then wouldn't he just decide to not make SCP-500-EX-1?\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** Eh. Even if he does it's worth a shot. The old researcher barely did any actual research because he didn't need to as his SCP was \"The Thaumiel SCP that is reducing costs\".\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:** You make a good point.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> //Ten Foundation personnel walk in accompanied by SCP-500-EX and two members of security.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** Greetings ladies and gentlemen. For the purposes of these tests, you ten will be designated as TS-500-EX-1 through TS-500-EX-10. All of you have already been handed a note with your designation for this test, you may take this time to memorize it if you haven't already.\n\n> \n\n> //Cleveland pauses for two minutes to let the personnel memorize their temporary identification.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** Alright. I assume y'all are good. Today you have all been selected for a test as you all have reported to the medical bay citing symptoms ranging from migraines to cramps. As you all are aware, the standard procedure is to give you folks a sample of SCP-500-EX-1 until your condition improves, however, we are undergoing testing to discover a new means of producing SCP-500-EX-1. We believe that this new way of producing SCP-500-EX-1 will work exactly the same and save the Foundation expenses on trans~\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-500-EX:** Just to clarify someth'n a brief second, this new way of producing SCP-500-EX-1 likely will not work. From what they've told me, this is merely a test to permanently conclude if it will or will not. Which I am most certain it won't. But I guess the higher-ups just ain't listenin' to me! Guess it makes me more in the end so why should I care?\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** Yes... thank you, Mr. Swanson. As he said, this may not be fully effective though we do have significant reasoning to believe it will. You each will be given two pills of SCP-500-EX-1 a day for one week and we will check back in then.

He gets paid extra to ship it directly to our facilities from Nova Scotia to Sacramento. He's only saying that to try to dissuade us from testing. The pills will work exactly the same as normal ones.\n\n> \n\n> //Various conversations between the test subjects can be heard, ranging from subjects doubting the legitimacy of this SCP-500-EX-1 to believing in it.

You know I did tell you that it wouldn't work.\"\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** Regardless, he gives me the same appearance as a snake oil salesman. But of course, I'm stuck studying him unless I can transfer to another SCP.\n\n> \n\n> //Dougherty laughs.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:** Very sad.

Six test subjects reported that SCP-500-EX-1 had no effect. Four subjects (TS-500-EX-2, TS-500-EX-3, TS-500-EX-7, and TS-500-EX-9) reported being symptom-free by the end of the one week period. \n\n> \n\n> -----\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-1:** Nothing changed. I had terrible cramps in my leg and they never got less severe and are still present.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-2:** I was a bit skeptical at first, but low and behold within a few hours of ingesting SCP-500-EX-1 my headache was feeling better. By day two it was gone.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-3:** Had some pretty bad sleep. By day six it was pretty much gone and by now I feel a lot better rested.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-4:** As soon as SCP-500-EX said that it wasn't gonna work I knew it wouldn't help. Sure as hell, I was right.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-5:** Felt a really bad headache and the pills didn't help with my pain like they normally do. I would say SCP-500-EX was right in that it wouldn't work.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-6:** Whilst SCP-500-EX-1 usually does help with any issues, in this case, my issue (constipation) did not get fixed by the new SCP-500-EX-1 pills.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-7:** I had been feeling nausea for about a day prior but just two days of SCP-500-EX-1 were able to relieve it. I told TS-500-EX-9 about it and he was shocked. Saying it wasn't working for him or whatnot.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-8:** After this can I get actual treatment for my fever? Cause the pills didn't do shit. I can barely focus on anything. The only thing I remember clearly is you giving me the pills that the guy said wouldn't work. Then over the week, nothing changed. What the fuck is the point of this study?\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-9:** At first the pills didn't kick in. But ironically literally right as TS-500-EX-7 told me it was working for her it started working for me. I didn't really notice it but my cramps were gradually getting better. By today it is gone.\n\n> \n\n> **TS-500-EX-10:** Had a migraine for a while and the pills didn't take away my headache. I was pretty much always skeptical from the start and it didn't improve afterwards. The pain slowly went away by around day five but I am not convinced it was the pills rather than just it being natural.\n\n> \n\n> -----\n\n> \n\n> **Note:** No current explanation has been provided to explain the decisive results shown in the trial. As such, until one is provided the experiment is to be considered a failure. SCP-500-EX-1 is to continue to be purchased from the previous factories.\n\n>\n\n> \"I know some people let SCP-500-EX read the classified versions of these reports, and I would prefer if you did not. But in this case, it is critical that SCP-500-EX does not read this report. There is a high likelihood that there is a factor in the production of SCP-500-EX that we were close to discovering which SCP-500-EX attempted to halt via trying to stop the experiment prior to its start. I believe this hidden element was used on some of the subjects, and if we can isolate this factor we may even be able to halt any further purchases in favor of our own production. Experimentation is to begin in five days.\" //-Johnathan Cleveland//\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n> **Date:** March 31st, 1906\n\n> \n\n> **Researcher(s):** Johnathan Cleveland\n\n> \n\n> **Purpose:** Recommence the same test conditions as done five days prior.

So far, it's worked well enough for them.\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:** Of course! That explains everything! SCP-500-EX somehow tricked hundreds of independent shops and the entire Foundation for decades! With dozens of agents watching his every move!\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** C'mon. For every individual shop that was selling the pills, there were at least 10 more that SCP-500-EX wasn't able to convince to sell them. The guy gave us all of his documents and there were 'round 4,000 stores that refused to sell SCP-500-EX-1.\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:** And how exactly does that relate to this experiment?

Site-11 command wouldn't sign off on that over a few pills. Hell, they probably wouldn't even approve of demoting 'em.

But your motive for cracking down on that isn't exactly as noble as fixing security gaps rather than a hunch you have with very little evidence.\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** I have personally traveled to around 400 drugstores that either denied to sell SCP-500-EX-1 or have sold it. All of the ones that denied it said that the pills didn't work, and the only reason SCP-500-EX-1 began to be sold was because SCP-500-EX paid the store around $10 a week to sell it while the store still got the majority of profits. Even then SCP-500-EX spent about a month having to convince people SCP-500-EX-1 worked before it finally took off. The vast majority of its success was after people were convinced it would work.\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:**\u00a0\u00a0Then that convinced you that it was the reason why the first experiment had mixed results?\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** I've spent hours analyzing every second of the test and interviewed each of the subjects over a dozen times, and the only thing that I've noticed different is that in the first experiment, SCP-500-EX told the subjects that it would fail, and in the second I told the subjects it would work.\n\n> \n\n> **Dougherty:** Then the Foundation just didn't realize that for 14 years! Perfectly logical.\n\n> \n\n> **Cleveland:** The old researcher is a bum who sat back on the easiest job in the Foundation.

Class:</strong> Explained</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Under absolutely no circumstances is this object to be designated anything other than Explained. Any effects which might appear to be caused by SCP-5050-EX must be investigated fully to determine their true cause. Attempts to prematurely attribute anomalous effects to SCP-5050-EX will be met with discipline up to and including termination of employment.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5050-EX is a 43 year old Hispanic male individual named James Garcia. SCP-5050-EX's primary occupation is as a stage magician/entertainer, and originally possessed no inherent anomalous qualities. However, due to the presence of SCP-5050-EX-1, SCP-5050-EX's typical stage routines have the byproduct of becoming anomalous <em>ex post facto.</em></p>\n<p>SCP-5050-EX-1 is a humanoid entity with an unknown capacity for reality bending and spontaneous anomaly generation. SCP-5050-EX-1 is not currently under Foundation containment, and has only been directly communicated with on one occasion. SCP-5050-EX-1 is believed to be the origin of SCP-5050\u2019s anomalous interactions.</p>\n<p>SCP-5050-EX's anomalous byproducts occur upon the conclusion of one of its stage magic routines. Initially, all routines and effects created by SCP-5050-EX are entirely non-anomalous, and can be replicated using mundane equipment or techniques. However, should any viewer of SCP-5050-EX's performance go 24 hours after the performance without learning how the effect was performed, SCP-5050-EX-1's influence causes all subsequent performances of the trick to become anomalous.</p>\n<p>SCP-5050-EX has generally seemed unaware of SCP-5050-EX-1's presence, as well as the newly anomalous nature of its tricks following performance. It is not currently believed that SCP-5050-EX is acting in concert with SCP-5050-EX-1, and general research has focused on removing SCP-5050-EX-1's influence over SCP-5050-EX.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5050-EX Performance Log:</strong> The following is an abridged list of SCP-5050-EX performances, as well as explanations for how each trick was performed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>The Amazing Rabbit out of a Hat!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Original Routine:</strong> SCP-5050-EX procures a rabbit (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) from a top hat.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> None found. Routine was performed prior to Foundation intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The hat used in the routine possesses an anomalous portal to an unspecified dimension that is entirely populated by non-anomalous members of the <em>Leporidae</em> family. SCP-5050-EX can withdraw an unknown number of these creatures from the hat; the tested limit reached 129 specimens before testing was terminated due to safety concerns. All other users are unable to access this dimension.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>The Escaping Man!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Original Routine:</strong> SCP-5050-EX appears to be bound with a series of manacles, chains, and other restrictive equipment, before escaping from them within ten minutes after being bound.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> None found. Routine was performed prior to Foundation intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> SCP-5050-EX can no longer be restrained by any mundane restrictive tools such as handcuffs, manacles, or rope. Shortly after being bound with such equipment, SCP-5050-EX will appear to have removed them without the notice of any observers, even while under direct surveillance. Containment for SCP-5050-EX was upgraded to include non-physical constraints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>The Magical Saw Trick!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Original Routine:</strong> A participant enters into a wooden box, and lays down with their head and feet visible to the audience. SCP-5050-EX proceeds to saw through the midsection of the box and create the illusion that the participant has been bisected, before \"reattaching\" the two halves.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Upon examination by Foundation staff, the box has a series of mirrors and removable sections that create the illusion of bisection. No anomalous effects were observed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>The Bullet Catch!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Original Routine:</strong> An assistant loads a gun with a bullet in front of the audience. SCP-5050-EX stands behind a pane of glass, while blindfolded. The assistant then aims at SCP-5050-EX, and is seen to fire the gun, which results in a broken pane of glass. SCP-5050-EX then produces the \"caught\" bullet from its mouth, suggesting that SCP-5050-EX has caught the bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Originally believed to have been conducted with a fake bullet and blank rounds, a late email from Assistant Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 raised the possibility that the trick was in fact performed with a real bullet that was simply aimed away from SCP-5050-EX. This had the effect of introducing doubt to the explanation of SCP-5050-EX's routine, allowing for SCP-5050-EX-1's anomalous effect to activate.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> SCP-5050-EX is now impervious to small arms fire. Assistant Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was given an official reprimand and placed on two weeks of unpaid leave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>SCP-5050-EX-1 Interview Log:</strong> Researchers studying similar situations (notably, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and multiple historical accounts) were able to raise the possibility of the existence of SCP-5050-EX-1 as the source of SCP-5050-EX's anomalous byproducts. Utilizing a Class A Esoteric Capture Chamber, researchers were able to isolate SCP-5050-EX-1 shortly after one of SCP-5050-EX's performances. Lead researcher Dr. Julio Marquez conducted an interview with the entity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Begin video transcript. SCP-5050-EX-1 appears in the form of a male human, indeterminate racial origin, and between the ages of 20-30.

Any effects which might appear to be caused by SCP-5050-EX must be investigated fully to determine their true cause. Attempts to prematurely attribute anomalous effects to SCP-5050-EX will be met with discipline up to and including termination of employment.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5050-EX is a 43 year old Hispanic male individual named James Garcia. SCP-5050-EX's primary occupation is as a stage magician/entertainer, and originally possessed no inherent anomalous qualities. However, due to the presence of SCP-5050-EX-1, SCP-5050-EX's typical stage routines have the byproduct of becoming anomalous //ex post facto.//\n\n\n\nSCP-5050-EX-1 is a humanoid entity with an unknown capacity for reality bending and spontaneous anomaly generation. SCP-5050-EX-1 is not currently under Foundation containment, and has only been directly communicated with on one occasion. SCP-5050-EX-1 is believed to be the origin of SCP-5050\u2019s anomalous interactions.\n\n\n\nSCP-5050-EX's anomalous byproducts occur upon the conclusion of one of its stage magic routines. Initially, all routines and effects created by SCP-5050-EX are entirely non-anomalous, and can be replicated using mundane equipment or techniques. However, should any viewer of SCP-5050-EX's performance go 24 hours after the performance without learning how the effect was performed, SCP-5050-EX-1's influence causes all subsequent performances of the trick to become anomalous.\n\n\n\nSCP-5050-EX has generally seemed unaware of SCP-5050-EX-1's presence, as well as the newly anomalous nature of its tricks following performance. It is not currently believed that SCP-5050-EX is acting in concert with SCP-5050-EX-1, and general research has focused on removing SCP-5050-EX-1's influence over SCP-5050-EX.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5050-EX Performance Log:** The following is an abridged list of SCP-5050-EX performances, as well as explanations for how each trick was performed.\n\n\n\n> **Name:** //The Amazing Rabbit out of a Hat!//\n\n> \n\n> **Original Routine:** SCP-5050-EX procures a rabbit (//Oryctolagus cuniculus//) from a top hat.\n\n> \n\n> **Solution:** None found. Routine was performed prior to Foundation intervention.\n\n> \n\n> **Outcome:** The hat used in the routine possesses an anomalous portal to an unspecified dimension that is entirely populated by non-anomalous members of the //Leporidae// family. SCP-5050-EX can withdraw an unknown number of these creatures from the hat; the tested limit reached 129 specimens before testing was terminated due to safety concerns. All other users are unable to access this dimension.\n\n\n\n> **Name:** //The Escaping Man!//\n\n> \n\n> **Original Routine:** SCP-5050-EX appears to be bound with a series of manacles, chains, and other restrictive equipment, before escaping from them within ten minutes after being bound.\n\n> \n\n> **Solution:** None found. Routine was performed prior to Foundation intervention.\n\n> \n\n> **Outcome:** SCP-5050-EX can no longer be restrained by any mundane restrictive tools such as handcuffs, manacles, or rope. Shortly after being bound with such equipment, SCP-5050-EX will appear to have removed them without the notice of any observers, even while under direct surveillance. Containment for SCP-5050-EX was upgraded to include non-physical constraints.\n\n\n\n> **Name:** //The Magical Saw Trick!//\n\n> \n\n> **Original Routine:** A participant enters into a wooden box, and lays down with their head and feet visible to the audience. SCP-5050-EX proceeds to saw through the midsection of the box and create the illusion that the participant has been bisected, before \"reattaching\" the two halves.\n\n> \n\n> **Solution:** Upon examination by Foundation staff, the box has a series of mirrors and removable sections that create the illusion of bisection. No anomalous effects were observed.\n\n\n\n> **Name:** //The Bullet Catch!//\n\n> \n\n> **Original Routine:** An assistant loads a gun with a bullet in front of the audience. SCP-5050-EX stands behind a pane of glass, while blindfolded. The assistant then aims at SCP-5050-EX, and is seen to fire the gun, which results in a broken pane of glass. SCP-5050-EX then produces the \"caught\" bullet from its mouth, suggesting that SCP-5050-EX has caught the bullet.\n\n> \n\n> **Solution:** Originally believed to have been conducted with a fake bullet and blank rounds, a late email from Assistant Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 raised the possibility that the trick was in fact performed with a real bullet that was simply aimed away from SCP-5050-EX. This had the effect of introducing doubt to the explanation of SCP-5050-EX's routine, allowing for SCP-5050-EX-1's anomalous effect to activate.\n\n> \n\n> **Outcome:** SCP-5050-EX is now impervious to small arms fire. Assistant Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was given an official reprimand and placed on two weeks of unpaid leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n**SCP-5050-EX-1 Interview Log:** Researchers studying similar situations (notably, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and multiple historical accounts) were able to raise the possibility of the existence of SCP-5050-EX-1 as the source of SCP-5050-EX's anomalous byproducts. Utilizing a Class A Esoteric Capture Chamber, researchers were able to isolate SCP-5050-EX-1 shortly after one of SCP-5050-EX's performances. Lead researcher Dr. Julio Marquez conducted an interview with the entity.\n\n\n\n> //Begin video transcript. SCP-5050-EX-1 appears in the form of a male human, indeterminate racial origin, and between the ages of 20-30. SCP-5050-EX-1 is seen to visibly struggle against the confines of the Esoteric Capture Chamber.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Marquez:** Good evening. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-5050-EX-1:** Oh, it's one of you.

The source of this fiction is the SCP Foundation. The fiction consists of a) now-abated memories of Clark's life and political activities, b) manufactured documentary records attesting to the same, and c) an individual claiming to be Clark, who remains active as a senior statesman to the present day.</p>\n<p>Various works of history and contemporary journalism erroneously report that Clark was born in the fictional High River, Alberta in 1939 to the fictional Charles and Grace Clark, educated in history, political science, journalism and law at the fictional University of Alberta and the fictional Dalhousie Law School, and married to Maureen McTeer in 1973. He supposedly succeeded Robert Lorne Stanfield as leader of the federal Progressive Conservative political party in 1976, defeating Liberal Pierre Elliott Trudeau three years later to become Prime Minister. In actuality, Stanfield and Trudeau retained their posts until 1983 and 1984 respectively.</p>\n<p>Media from the \"Clark years\" describes an unlikely, ridiculous figure in often unflattering terms:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Joe Clark has a face like a cartoon frog, the gravitas of a pre-pubescent high-schooler, a laugh like a choking Santa Claus and a fake baritone that wouldn't sound out of place coming from\u2026 a cartoon frog.

He produced a work of political science he had been studying the previous night which seemingly confirmed his claim; further investigation revealed extensive public documentation attesting to the existence of this previously-unknown historical figure. The 43NET database offered up conflicting data sets; files created after 1980 mentioned Clark where appropriate, while files created prior instead described Foundation interactions with the third of four sequential governments under the leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. It became apparent that the entire Site-43 staff had believed in the existence of Joe Clark until 22 May 2019, at which point this belief subsided except when reinforced by textual evidence. Consultation with other Foundation Sites in Canada revealed that this phenomenon was occurring across the entire nation simultaneously.</p>\n<p>A thorough vetting of the 43NET database revealed encrypted files belonging to former staff member Dr. Edwin Falkirk, permanently comatose since a containment breach incident in 2003, which when decrypted shed considerable light on the subject. Clark's handler, sworn to secrecy since 1979, provided additional details once it was made clear to her that the masquerade was no longer necessary. After painstaking reconstruction of the following series of events, Archives and Revision has officially reclassified SCP-5054 as Explained.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5054-EX-2, 1979 Canadian Federal Election Incident:</strong> The period from 1967 to 1980 saw an unexpected surge of bad actors attempting to compromise the Canadian federal government, particularly the Prime Minister, his cabinet, and the leader of the official opposition. The reasoning behind these acts, and the source of the anomalous materials used to perform them, was unclear. Frequent encounters with malicious memetic compulsion effects prompted the funereally-dignified Progressive Conservative Party leader Robert Lorne Stanfield to wear a pair of long underwear over his suit pants to parliament in 1967, acquiring for him the nickname \"Underwear Man,\" while former Prime Minister John George Diefenbaker was driven to a state of near-clinical paranoia by repeated cognitohazard exposure. The following report, prepared in April of 1979 for Overwatch Command, sums up the challenges faced by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's handlers stationed at Site-43:</p>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span><strong>Operation TRUDEAUMANIA</strong></span></h2>\n<p><strong>Final Report (Provisional)</strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>I am pleased to report the anticipated conclusion of Operation TRUDEAUMANIA after ten years.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:200px;\"><img alt=\"Trudeau.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5054-ex/Trudeau.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Prime Minister Trudeau, under the influence of a memetic compulsion effect.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As a former member of MTF Beta-43 (\"Con-Trollers\"), my area of expertise is memetic interdiction. I have served as Prime Minister Trudeau's first line of defence from anomalous interference since his election as Prime Minister in 1969. My primary duty has been to protect him from attacks by Groups of Interest, which have been numerous. Despite his low profile as leader of one of the least populous and least powerful nations in the western world, he has been exposed to dozens of life and reputation-threatening memetic effects. Those I was not able to intercept compelled him to perform multiple wild acts of public chicanery, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>attempting to strangle himself with his own necktie;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>sliding down banisters;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>pirouetting;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>swearing in the House of Commons;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>making obscene gestures at the press;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>marrying a woman thirty years his junior;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>demanding that the Canadian people \"just watch\" him.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As each of these actions ran deeply counter to his aristocratic, autocratic, authoritarian, antisocial personality, Operation TRUDEAMANIA was enacted to prevent public discovery of the existence of memetics. Trudeau's bizarre antics were characterized as a public relations campaign by his Liberal Party to make him more \"down-to-Earth\" and appealing to the average voter.</p>\n<p>The Foundation Elections Monitoring Commission expects Trudeau to be defeated in 1979, and our protective efforts will therefore be redirected to the new Prime Minister.<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><em>\u2014 Agent C.

Alleging that Trudeau intended to remain in office indefinitely by rigging ballots, the Righting Institute demanded a parliamentary subcommittee to investigate potential fraud. A remarkably effective leaflet campaign targeting members of parliament resulted in unprecedented private sector consultation; the Geschenk Group, a for-profit political services company headquartered in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, worked with Elections Canada to develop tamper-proof ballots.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:175px;\"><img alt=\"Geschenk.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5054-ex/Geschenk.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>The Geschenk Group.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Geschenk Group supplied all voting apparatus for the 1979 federal election. As the ballots were tallied on 22 May, the SCP Foundation Elections Monitoring Commission reported a crisis situation to Overwatch Command. One hundred percent of the vote was being cast for Pierre Trudeau's Liberal Party. Exit polls suggested that thirty-five percent of Canadians had intended to vote for Robert Stanfield, but had changed their minds in favour of Trudeau upon reviewing the ballots. Embedded agents at polling stations conducted exit interviews to determine the cause of this phenomenon; many interviewees stated their own personal beliefs, then described their entirely contradictory actions with no apparent sense of contradiction, then ended the interviews in distress as realization dawned. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I've voted Conservative on every ticket. I would never vote Liberal. Except for just now, where I voted Liberal. I voted Liberal?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I hate that arrogant son of a bitch. He thinks he can do no wrong. He thinks we crowned him king in the last election. I can't wait to see his face when the results come in! Even though I voted for him. Fuck?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\"My riding always turns out Liberal, but this time we're gonna teach P.E.T. a lesson. Canada's still gonna go Liberal, but not nearly so much. For example, I voted Liberal. That doesn't make sense. That doesn't\u2026 wait, <em>what</em> did I just say?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\"You know Stanfield's campaign slogan? \"It's time for a change\"? He's absolutely right. I hope Canada votes for him. I didn't vote for him.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tentative calculations suggested Stanfield would have achieved a minority government without this sudden reversal.<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The party with the most seats forms the government in a Canadian parliament, but relies on alliances with smaller parties to pass legislation unless it acquires a majority of the available seats.</span> The ballots were studied by the Memetics and Countermemetics Section of Site-43, and found to be infected with a lingering compulsion effect: researchers expressed an immediate desire to vote for Pierre Trudeau, regardless of whether or not they possessed Canadian citizenship or had in fact already voted.

In cases of extreme memetic compulsion, subjects frequently experience cognitive dissonance on a scale closely approximating the effects of a psychotic break. If incumbent Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau retains his post under these circumstances, thirty-five percent of Canadians are likely to engage in potentially violent antisocial behaviour as they attempt and fail to square their actions with their beliefs. We therefore recommend the SCP Foundation directly tamper with the results of the 1979 federal election and declare Robert Stanfield the sixteenth Prime Minister of Canada.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Site-43 Director V.L.

Multiple additional potential Stanfields were also taken into custody and tested, to no avail.</p>\n<p>While this testing was carried out, Agent Scrivens conducted interviews to determine whether Conservative voters could be convinced that they had, in fact, voted for Stanfield rather than Trudeau. The results were less than promising; Agent Scrivens concluded that propping up Stanfield would exacerbate rather than relieve the cognitive dissonance. Responses included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"That's a made-up name.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Who?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Underwear Man?!\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I don't know who that is, but he looks like an undertaker.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Archives and Revision Section began extensive investigation of the Geschenk Group and the Righting Institute.

Sit down.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens sits on the stoop beside Zwist.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> You've been a doctor, though. Several of them: Dr. Scoffield, Dr. Bromide, Dr. Braun. And you do sell medicine. I've read the file for <a href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5382\">5382</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Well, either you were speed-reading, or your file needs updating. My work has nothing to do with medicine. I'm a writer.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Yes, I know. You create memes that cure a disease.

In my ignorance.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Is that why Dr. Scout wanted me to meet with you? Did you have something to do with the election? Did you\u2026 create another disease?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> No, I didn't create a disease that makes people change their votes. This is something much simpler, and something much worse. Much more difficult to correct. What do you know about the <em>giftschreiber?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Not a lot. I've read Dr. Scout's paper on them; they made weaponized memes for the German army in the Hundred Years' War, and they all died.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> It was the Thirty Years War, and they didn't all die. Not all of them. You have to understand, the powers they have, the powers <em>I</em> have, they're inherently\u2026 wrong. They're immoral. We compel people to do things against their will. We set our will against everyone else's, and ours always wins. What kind of practitioner does an art like that attract?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> So, they were <em>bad</em> writers.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Very funny. Yes, they were bad writers, in every sense of the word. Compared to my order, the <em>schriftsteller,</em> the <em>giftschreiber</em> were apes banging on a keyboard that hadn't been invented yet. I could write you a poem that would make you re-think your whole approach to romance, or commerce, or even the simple process of breathing, if I wanted to; they made banners that made men catch fire. They always outnumbered us; abilities like that naturally attract the wrong sort of person. The only saving grace is that selfish, opportunistic, sadistic people don't generally work well together. They were lone wolves, making vague individual gestures to a vague destructive cause, all across Europe. Until the Bavarian army brought most of them together.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> But not all of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> No. Some of them survived the war, and they trained apprentices. They honed their craft.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Have you ever trained apprentices?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Once or twice, in special cases. But in general I think the world would be much improved if abilities like mine ceased to exist. I've only hung on these past few centuries to clean up after myself, and to find out if the <em>giftschreiber</em> still pose a threat to humanity.

They were never an organization, before now, so I could never destroy them\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> \u2026before now.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Sorry, no. I realize the sentence symmetry was leaning that way, but.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> So, Dr. Scout thinks the <em>giftschreiber</em> rigged the election.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> What Vivian thinks is almost always correct. They definitely did rig the election; trust me on that, <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5813\">I've interfered with elections before</a>. I've seen the ballots, in any case, and I was barely able to resist the effect myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> So, you voted Conservative?</p>\n<p><em>Zwist laughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> I've lived too long to be that backward, agent. I voted my conscience. It just happened to align with what the ballots wanted.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Yeah, I would've voted NDP, but I was on a stakeout at the time.<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">The New Democratic Party is the most outwardly socialist of Canada's major political parties.</span> So, why are they finally so organized after all these centuries?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> They learn. If the past forty years have taught humanity anything, it's that organizational evil is much more effective. If you can put aside your differences to work at one or two really reprehensible things you all agree on, you can get a lot accomplished. The great triumph of fascism has been to show selfish people the efficiency of a common cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> I have a very hard time believing that their common cause is \"fuck Canada.\" We're just not that important.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> They have something to gain from this. But that doesn't really matter, in the short term.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Because whatever it is, it's bound to be terrible, so we need to stop them. How?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> To begin with, we fix this election disaster. But I don't think you're going to like my solution.</p>\n<p><em>[Log ends.]</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Agent Scrivens returned to Dr. Scout with a detailed list of suggestions for stop-gap measures to hold off the inevitable. Dr. Scout reviewed the suggestions, workshopped them at Archives and Revision, and presented the following revised and completed proposal to Overwatch Command on 24 May:</p>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc2\"><span><strong>Operation SHADOWPLAY</strong></span></h2>\n<p><strong>Situational Summary and Action Items</strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p>\n<p>WHEREAS a hostile Group of Interest has interfered with the 1979 Canadian federal election, and;</p>\n<p>WHEREAS this interference is likely to result in the complete collapse of the Canadian polity, and;</p>\n<p>WHEREAS Research and Containment Site-43 will be responsible for ameliorating this collapse, and;</p>\n<p>WHEREAS Research and Containment Site-43 is already responsible for managing two (2) potentially K-Class Scenario-triggering SCP objects;</p>\n<p>THEREFORE a plan of action must immediately be implemented for managing the effects of this interference in a targeted, efficient manner in order that day-to-day Foundation operations and the Veil of Secrecy be maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>\n<p>Operation SHADOWPLAY will create a fictional politician and declare him the winner of the 1979 federal election. This politician will nominally lead the 31st Parliament of Canada as Prime Minister; in actuality, present Prime Minister Trudeau and the 30th Parliament of Canada will be retained to execute all relevant duties behind-the-scenes. A media blackout will prevent the discovery of this ruse until a means is found to a) reverse the memetic effects of the 1979 ballots, b) create extensive video and photographic evidence of the fictional Prime Minister's existence and activities, and c) memetically insinuate him and the aforementioned material into the minds of Canadians, such that they and posterity will recognize no disjuncture with reality.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ahead of O5 approval, the Archives and Revision Section canvassed the other Sections for suggestions and then began brainstorming a personality, appearance, and background for the fictional Prime Minister.

This won't take a minute, and you can get back to your good work.</p>\n<p><em>O5-8 leafs through a collection of documents.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I want you to coordinate with the other Canadian Sites. We need a complete logistical breakdown for an indefinite extension of Operation SHADOWPLAY.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Indefinite\u2026? Is this for a contingency plan? I thought I was here to discuss how we might engineer the government's collapse, get a new election going and <em>retire</em> Operation SHADOWPLAY.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> We're not going to retire it.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> I don't understand.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Our mysterious friends have gifted us with a golden opportunity. We've hardly ever bothered replacing a government before because the numbers rarely justify it, but they gave us an excuse, and you made it work. The apparatus is all in place. We'd be fools to throw it away.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> I didn't know we were allowing democracy to exist because of the <em>numbers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Democracy has always been a numbers game. There's no practical reason for us to relinquish control now. In retrospect, Canada never needed its own government in the first place. It's only a few million people.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Twenty-four million, and with respect, sir, I think this is the wrong play.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Aren't you the one who's always complaining about federal interference? There's no federal interference anymore, Vivian. We <em>are</em> the federal government.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> As a stopgap measure only. We don't intrude on normalcy, we maintain it.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> You're splitting hairs. It's not like this is a new idea; we've only rejected it in the past because it's too difficult. We'd never be able to control a larger government, or falsify an election in a real world power, but Canada is small potatoes. Who knows? If this works out, it might be a gateway to something more ambitious in the future.</p>\n<p><em>O5-8 hands Dr. Scout a dossier.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Look at these financial reports. It costs us less to shadowpuppet the Canadian government than it does to hide our activities from them!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> It costs us less <em>financially,</em> maybe.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Finishing that thought would waste both your time and mine, Vivian.

After an educational crash course from Archives and Revision, Agent Scrivens accompanied Zwist to the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and the Beaverbrook Gallery. He tutored Zwist on Canadian landscape art, joined him in consultation with indigenous elders, and attended lectures with him at seven Canadian universities on topics ranging from architecture to food to political science. Scrivens continued to film file footage as Joe Clark, in the event that a replacement could not be found in time.</p>\n<p>In August, Zwist indicated that he had developed an action plan; he met Agent Scrivens at a secure safehouse to discuss its implications.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Transcript</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 12 August 1979</p>\n<p><strong>Investigating Agent:</strong> C. Scrivens</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[Log begins.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens and PoI-382 are sitting opposite each other at a metal table in a sparsely-furnished room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> So, if I understand this right, the Geschenk Group didn't tamper with the ballots themselves. They tampered with the Elections Canada logo, which was <em>on</em> the ballots.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> That's right. They took your symbol, and they made it <em>their</em> symbol. Very simple. Beneath them, if we're being honest; I could've done a much better job in the 1630s, if we'd had elections back then.</p>\n<p><em>Zwist shakes his head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> So, what. Elections Canada needs to change its logo now?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> No, the effect has already abated.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Alright, but the damage is done. What're you going to do to fix it? The same thing? Meme up the logo, send out a post-election survey, get everyone to look at it again?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> What is this, amateur hour? That would be terribly ineffective. The attack might have been crude, but it affected every single voter in the nation. Nobody fills out surveys, conversely.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Alright, so we think bigger. You're supposed to be some kind of wizard with this stuff, right? Can you\u2026 infect symbols at a distance, all at once instead of individually? Weaponize, say, the Canadian flag, so that everyone who looks at it forgets about the last election?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Still not enough. <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5859\">That sort of thing</a> has been tried before, and it doesn't really work. We need a one hundred percent catch rate for this, voters and non-voters included. No, I'm not going to throw good words after bad. I'm going to show you all a higher class of meme.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens nods, then freezes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Explain.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> It's very simple. I'm going to try to replicate, experimentally, what I did in error so many centuries ago, on a grander and more targeted scale. I'm going to infuse the Canadian <em>zeitgeist</em> with the concept of your imaginary leader, so that everyone who understands what it is to be Canadian will know him to be real.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> You're going to put Joe Clark\u2026 into the concept of Canada.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Essentially.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> And that's going to work? Indefinitely?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Nothing works indefinitely. I daren't risk pouring too much of myself into this. I don't want another linguistic disease, and I can't risk shuffling off the mortal coil with the rest of my work left undone. But a short effect, something on the order of half a century\u2026 that much I can manage, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> That's short, huh? I guess it would be, to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> It's going to be a very strong effect, and it's going to work on <em>everyone.</em> I'm going to put a little extra <em>oomph</em> into my magic, and make the <em>giftschreiber</em> lose their focus on Canada at the same time. You're all going to lose the thread together, unfortunately\u2026 you'll have to prepare a select staff to liaise with the shadow government, make absolutely certain their memories remain intact, and you'll also want to nominate someone to keep a complete record of the true course of events, plus one more someone to keep tabs on our fictional fellow. You're all going to forget that Joe Clark never existed, and you won't remember again until the new millennium when it won't even matter anymore. By the time people have believed something for four or five decades, it's functionally true.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> This is absurd.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> It gets worse. It isn't enough to convince them that the figure of Joe Clark has been, and remains, Prime Minister. That he won the election, that he rose through the ranks of his party the usual way. They need to be convinced that a real person, in the real world, <em>one</em> real person, is Joe Clark. The concept needs an anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Okay\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> It needs to be someone who understands the character. It needs to be someone who's dedicated to the cause the character was created to serve. And it needs to be someone I know well. Very, very well. Or I won't be able to make this happen.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens nods. He looks down at his notes. He looks up at Dr. Zwist. He nods again, slowly. He opens his mouth.

You were making a profile on <em>me,</em> Agent Charles Scrivens, fucking stupid Canadian stupid ASSHOLE, expendable Chuck the chucklefuck. You planned this from the start.</p>\n<p><em>Zwist shakes his head sadly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> The field trips have been important. I need to truly <em>feel</em> this place in my bones, whatever passes for the soul of this nation, if I'm going to change something so fundamental as its <em>zeitgeist.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Yeah, that's the hard part, right?

You set me up for this from the get-go.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> What I do isn't simple, Agent Scrivens. It takes a long time to wrap my mind around it. And I make mistakes. I wasn't going to tell you my plan until I was certain it would\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens kicks the wall, leaving a sizeable scar in the plaster.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Horse <em>shit.</em> You're roping me into this on purpose. You set this up with Scout. I do everybody's scut work, I fall on the grenades for assholes like Trudeau, I get run off my god-damn feet managing every last angle of this <em>farce</em> and then when I'm good and used up, I get turned into a god-damn caricature.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> The character is the caricature, Agent Scrivens. You're the artist who brings him to life. Who brings life to all of us.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens snatches up his chair and slams it onto the floor beside Zwist's. He sits down.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Explain that to me. Explain to me why it's so god-damn important that Canada, Canada, CANADA, doesn't fall the fuck apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> I have only my suspicions.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Well, pass them on! Tell me. Make me suspicious too. It's my job to be as suspicious as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Scrivens pulls at his own hair.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> If I'd been more suspicious, I wouldn't be in this mess.</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> My people, the <em>schriftsteller,</em> were taught their craft long ago. Our first teacher was cruel. He was fickle. He was dangerous. We broke from him, and were the better for it. The <em>giftschreiber</em> never did. They have paid the price, and reaped the reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> More cryptic bullshit. What's the point?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> They believe their master is interred beneath your Site.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> So? Is he?</p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> I don't know. Vivian won't tell me, and obviously I can't go looking myself. But what matters is that they think it's true. They can't destroy you outright, but they can tear your country apart, make the land you live under uninhabitable, force you to fight so many fires that they'll be able to march right in and take what's theirs, if it's down there.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> This is just the excuse. You're feeding me a line, and you expect me to just swallow it whole and\u2026 and\u2026 become a <em>fucking conservative</em> before I've even gone senile. You're a liar. You're a <em>liar.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Zwist:</strong> Yes, I am. I've lied to too many people for too long to ask you to believe me. And after five lifetimes spent pushing a boulder uphill, I can't be the one who tells you that you need to spend your <em>one</em> life making the world a better place. Vivian can't tell you.

Extensive experimentation by the Archives and Revision Section revealed that PoI-382 had fully integrated the person of Joe Clark into the conceptual category of \"Canada.\" The parliamentary footage heretofore prepared was released to the public, and its memetic effects were immediate: Canadians instantly formed memories of having seen Agent Scrivens in his role as Joe Clark over the preceding six months. Live broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings resumed as per usual in October, as Agent Scrivens was now fully capable of inhabiting the role of Joe Clark full-time.</p>\n<p>In December of 1979, however, Dr. Falkirk submitted the following report to the O5 Council.</p>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span><strong>Operation SHADOWPLAY</strong></span></h2>\n<p><strong>Situational Summary and Action Items</strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Agent Scrivens is acting dangerously off-script, and the memetic effect preventing us from fully focusing on his activities or recalling his prior occupation is making it difficult to rein him in.

Hurried amendments to Operation SHADOWPLAY resulted in an abortive attempt by Foundation operatives to rig the election in favour of the Progressive Conservatives; these operatives were non-fatally neutralized by memetic attacks at ballot production facilities and polling stations. While <em>giftschreiber</em> involvement was obviously suspected, the election proceeded as normal without further interference by any organization, returning a new Liberal administration under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. One final round of amnesticization removed all traces of the shadow government's activities.</p>\n<p>Agent Scrivens officially cut ties with the SCP Foundation following the election, but remained a member of Canadian parliament as Joe Clark. He engineered his own removal from the leadership of his party and became instead an active member, promoting liberal causes within the Progressive Conservative ranks. He initiated humanitarian relief for Ethiopia, denounced apartheid, encouraged the immigration of refugees to Canada and strongly opposed neoconservative elements in the party even after his retirement in 2004.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5054-EX-3, Aftermath:</strong> Mistrustful of Dr. Scout's motives due to his affiliation with PoI-382, O5 Command ordered that Dr. Falkirk be fortified with a permanent schedule of high-effect mnestics and made the keeper of all data pertaining to SCP-5054-EX, that he might reveal it to his colleagues upon the diminishment of Zwist's memetic effect. Dr. Falkirk's unfortunate accident prevented this, and it was not until the effect expired entirely that the files were discovered and decrypted.</p>\n<p>The initial rediscovery of the SCP-5054-EX effect led to hurried attempts by Archives and Revision to a) determine why Joe Clark had been forgotten, and then b) suppress knowledge of Joe Clark when it was determined that he had never existed. These activities were terminated upon the reconstruction of the true events of 1979-80.</p>\n<p>To complete the SCP-5054-EX file, Joe Clark's handler Maureen McTeer invited Dr. Blank to visit her home and interview her husband. This invitation was accepted.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Transcript</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 25 May 2019</p>\n<p><strong>Investigating Agent:</strong> Dr. H.

Maybe get a guard dog?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> I don't think that'll be necessary. You did us all a great service, back then, and whatever else you might have done is water under the bridge.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> I'm not sure I believe that. The O5s don't forgive easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> You must have known that at the time.</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens nods.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> And yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> And yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> You took an awful risk, bucking the plan the way you did.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Some things are more important than Site security, doctor. Even to an agent. I didn't spend ten years jumping on memetic grenades for an autocrat just to turn into one myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> You never were much of a conservative, were you?</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens shakes his head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Have you seen them? Who would want to be?</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Blank nods.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> I still vote NDP, you know.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Blank laughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> So, the memetic effect doesn't work on you? You still know who you are?</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> As much as anyone does.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> That must have been lonely.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Not so much. I love my wife, I love my daughter, and I've managed to paint a pretty enough picture in between the lines Zwist and Scout gave me. It's enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Agent McTeer seems relieved to get it all out in the open.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> It's been a strange four decades for her. She's been an active agent, an active public figure and the wife of an active anomaly this entire time. She thought about quitting the Foundation, but\u2026 anyway. We'd decided that if whoever was keeping the secret didn't spill it by the fifty-year mark, she'd do it for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> If the effect hadn't faded, it wouldn't have done any good.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> True enough. Well, I know Mo's looking forward to telling everyone at 43 who she's married to. She hasn't done field work since the nineties, and you lot were starting to wonder why a desk worker would need so many doses of mnestics! I don't know what I'd've done if she'd started to forget me, too. She was my last link to Beta-43, and the Site.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> She didn't turn out to be much of a handler, did she?</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Well, that's your perspective.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Partners in crime, huh? Lucky. I'm still confused about the 1980 election, though, the one you lost. If the <em>giftschreiber</em> were able to infiltrate the ballot-makers and the polling stations, to prevent us from meddling\u2026 why didn't <em>they</em> meddle?</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> It wasn't the <em>giftschreiber,</em> obviously. They'd forgotten all about Canada, remember?</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens smiles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> And who made them do that?</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Zwist.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> I still had connections at the Foundation, and they tipped me off that the O5s were planning to steal the election. I tipped Zwist off. He has very particular opinions about fascism, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> I do know. Who were your Foundation connections? Obviously I have to ask.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Is this Scout asking, really?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Dr. Scout passed away more than twenty years ago.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> I honestly thought he'd live forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> He nearly did.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Well, give me a moment. I've got something for you to listen to.</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens exits the room, leaving Dr. Blank alone for several minutes. He is carrying an old portable tape recorder when he returns.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> You're in charge of A&amp;R, I assume?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> That's right.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Then you've read all the files? You know about Scout and Falkirk coming to my office in December, 1979?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> I've read a transcript.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Well, Falkirk was the one recording, and he stormed out. Scout stayed for a few more minutes.</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens places the device on his coffee table.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> I'm a good agent. I always keep my own recordings.</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens activates the device.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Dr. Falkirk:</strong> Traitor.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording. A door slams shut.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Think he'll wait for me?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> Maybe. Think he suspects us?</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Scout laughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Not a chance. But let the O5s know, once I'm in my grave. Should be good for a laugh.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Scrivens:</strong> You'll bury us all, Vivian.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Lord, I hope not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Was it Scout's idea to let your government fall? Lose the election?</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> It was our idea: him, Maureen, and myself. We had a shared sense of duty.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> What about your duty to the Foundation?</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Our duties are nested, doctor. We serve the Foundation, and the Foundation serves mankind. That's only a conflict of interest if someone's doing their job wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> You've been doing this job, this self-appointed job, for decades now. Don't you ever get tired of it? Of being someone you're not? Don't you ever wish you could go back to being Charles Scrivens?</p>\n<p><em>Scrivens laughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> We are what we do. I don't think I ever really was Charles Scrivens, I don't like what he got up to. I didn't want to be Joe Clark, either, but\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> \u2026I think I've managed to make Joe Clark be me.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Well. I'll be in touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Oh, I doubt it. But one more thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> You all remember what happened, now.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Blank:</strong> That's right.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrivens:</strong> Which means <em>they</em> will, too.</p>\n<p><em>[Log ends.]</em></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5054-EX-4, Present-Day Context:</strong> Memetic burnout continues to make retention of the concept of Joe Clark difficult for most Canadians.

The source of this fiction is the SCP Foundation. The fiction consists of a) now-abated memories of Clark's life and political activities, b) manufactured documentary records attesting to the same, and c) an individual claiming to be Clark, who remains active as a senior statesman to the present day.\n\n\n\nVarious works of history and contemporary journalism erroneously report that Clark was born in the fictional High River, Alberta in 1939 to the fictional Charles and Grace Clark, educated in history, political science, journalism and law at the fictional University of Alberta and the fictional Dalhousie Law School, and married to Maureen McTeer in 1973. He supposedly succeeded Robert Lorne Stanfield as leader of the federal Progressive Conservative political party in 1976, defeating Liberal Pierre Elliott Trudeau three years later to become Prime Minister. In actuality, Stanfield and Trudeau retained their posts until 1983 and 1984 respectively.\n\n\n\nMedia from the \"Clark years\" describes an unlikely, ridiculous figure in often unflattering terms:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nJoe Clark has a face like a cartoon frog, the gravitas of a pre-pubescent high-schooler, a laugh like a choking Santa Claus and a fake baritone that wouldn't sound out of place coming from... a cartoon frog.

He produced a work of political science he had been studying the previous night which seemingly confirmed his claim; further investigation revealed extensive public documentation attesting to the existence of this previously-unknown historical figure. The 43NET database offered up conflicting data sets; files created after 1980 mentioned Clark where appropriate, while files created prior instead described Foundation interactions with the third of four sequential governments under the leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. It became apparent that the entire Site-43 staff had believed in the existence of Joe Clark until 22 May 2019, at which point this belief subsided except when reinforced by textual evidence. Consultation with other Foundation Sites in Canada revealed that this phenomenon was occurring across the entire nation simultaneously.\n\n\n\nA thorough vetting of the 43NET database revealed encrypted files belonging to former staff member Dr. Edwin Falkirk, permanently comatose since a containment breach incident in 2003, which when decrypted shed considerable light on the subject. Clark's handler, sworn to secrecy since 1979, provided additional details once it was made clear to her that the masquerade was no longer necessary. After painstaking reconstruction of the following series of events, Archives and Revision has officially reclassified SCP-5054 as Explained.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5054-EX-2, 1979 Canadian Federal Election Incident:** The period from 1967 to 1980 saw an unexpected surge of bad actors attempting to compromise the Canadian federal government, particularly the Prime Minister, his cabinet, and the leader of the official opposition. The reasoning behind these acts, and the source of the anomalous materials used to perform them, was unclear. Frequent encounters with malicious memetic compulsion effects prompted the funereally-dignified Progressive Conservative Party leader Robert Lorne Stanfield to wear a pair of long underwear over his suit pants to parliament in 1967, acquiring for him the nickname \"Underwear Man,\" while former Prime Minister John George Diefenbaker was driven to a state of near-clinical paranoia by repeated cognitohazard exposure. The following report, prepared in April of 1979 for Overwatch Command, sums up the challenges faced by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's handlers stationed at Site-43:\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Operation TRUDEAUMANIA**\n\n**Final Report (Provisional)**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n\n\nI am pleased to report the anticipated conclusion of Operation TRUDEAUMANIA after ten years.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=Trudeau.jpg|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=Prime Minister Trudeau, under the influence of a memetic compulsion effect.|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width=200px\n\n]]\n\n\n\nAs a former member of MTF Beta-43 (\"Con-Trollers\"), my area of expertise is memetic interdiction. I have served as Prime Minister Trudeau's first line of defence from anomalous interference since his election as Prime Minister in 1969. My primary duty has been to protect him from attacks by Groups of Interest, which have been numerous. Despite his low profile as leader of one of the least populous and least powerful nations in the western world, he has been exposed to dozens of life and reputation-threatening memetic effects. Those I was not able to intercept compelled him to perform multiple wild acts of public chicanery, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n* attempting to strangle himself with his own necktie;\n\n\n\n* sliding down banisters;\n\n\n\n* pirouetting;\n\n\n\n* swearing in the House of Commons;\n\n\n\n* making obscene gestures at the press;\n\n\n\n* marrying a woman thirty years his junior;\n\n\n\n* demanding that the Canadian people \"just watch\" him.\n\n\n\nAs each of these actions ran deeply counter to his aristocratic, autocratic, authoritarian, antisocial personality, Operation TRUDEAMANIA was enacted to prevent public discovery of the existence of memetics. Trudeau's bizarre antics were characterized as a public relations campaign by his Liberal Party to make him more \"down-to-Earth\" and appealing to the average voter.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation Elections Monitoring Commission expects Trudeau to be defeated in 1979, and our protective efforts will therefore be redirected to the new Prime Minister.\n\n[[>]]\n\n//-- Agent C. Scrivens, Site-43//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nIn 1978 the Righting History Institute, a conservative think tank founded by political scientist Ophelia Righting, claimed the Canadian federal elections system was susceptible to tampering. Alleging that Trudeau intended to remain in office indefinitely by rigging ballots, the Righting Institute demanded a parliamentary subcommittee to investigate potential fraud. A remarkably effective leaflet campaign targeting members of parliament resulted in unprecedented private sector consultation; the Geschenk Group, a for-profit political services company headquartered in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, worked with Elections Canada to develop tamper-proof ballots. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=Geschenk.png|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=The Geschenk Group.|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width=175px\n\n]]\n\n\n\nThe Geschenk Group supplied all voting apparatus for the 1979 federal election. As the ballots were tallied on 22 May, the SCP Foundation Elections Monitoring Commission reported a crisis situation to Overwatch Command. One hundred percent of the vote was being cast for Pierre Trudeau's Liberal Party. Exit polls suggested that thirty-five percent of Canadians had intended to vote for Robert Stanfield, but had changed their minds in favour of Trudeau upon reviewing the ballots. Embedded agents at polling stations conducted exit interviews to determine the cause of this phenomenon; many interviewees stated their own personal beliefs, then described their entirely contradictory actions with no apparent sense of contradiction, then ended the interviews in distress as realization dawned. Examples include:\n\n\n\n* \"I've voted Conservative on every ticket. I would never vote Liberal. Except for just now, where I voted Liberal. I voted Liberal?\"\n\n\n\n* \"I hate that arrogant son of a bitch. He thinks he can do no wrong. He thinks we crowned him king in the last election. I can't wait to see his face when the results come in! Even though I voted for him. Fuck?\"\n\n\n\n* \"My riding always turns out Liberal, but this time we're gonna teach P.E.T. a lesson. Canada's still gonna go Liberal, but not nearly so much. For example, I voted Liberal. That doesn't make sense. That doesn't... wait, //what// did I just say?\"\n\n\n\n* \"You know Stanfield's campaign slogan? \"It's time for a change\"? He's absolutely right. I hope Canada votes for him. I didn't vote for him.\"\n\n\n\nTentative calculations suggested Stanfield would have achieved a minority government without this sudden reversal.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The party with the most seats forms the government in a Canadian parliament, but relies on alliances with smaller parties to pass legislation unless it acquires a majority of the available seats.[[/span]] The ballots were studied by the Memetics and Countermemetics Section of Site-43, and found to be infected with a lingering compulsion effect: researchers expressed an immediate desire to vote for Pierre Trudeau, regardless of whether or not they possessed Canadian citizenship or had in fact already voted. An emergency conference by the Psychology and Parapsychology Section submitted the following resolution to Overwatch Command:\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Operation SHADOWPLAY**\n\n**Rationale and Tentative Proposal**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nA memetic compulsion effect has dramatically overturned the Canadian federal election. In cases of extreme memetic compulsion, subjects frequently experience cognitive dissonance on a scale closely approximating the effects of a psychotic break. If incumbent Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau retains his post under these circumstances, thirty-five percent of Canadians are likely to engage in potentially violent antisocial behaviour as they attempt and fail to square their actions with their beliefs. We therefore recommend the SCP Foundation directly tamper with the results of the 1979 federal election and declare Robert Stanfield the sixteenth Prime Minister of Canada.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSite-43 Director V.L. Scout dispatched agents to Stornoway, Robert Stanfield's residence as Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, to brief him on these events and prepare him for his upcoming Prime Ministership. Stornoway's staff exhibited uncertainty when asked where Stanfield could be found; several claimed to have never heard of an individual by that name. An individual matching Stanfield's rough physical description was found pacing his office, exhibiting signs of memetically-induced distress. Agent C.

Multiple additional potential Stanfields were also taken into custody and tested, to no avail.\n\n\n\nWhile this testing was carried out, Agent Scrivens conducted interviews to determine whether Conservative voters could be convinced that they had, in fact, voted for Stanfield rather than Trudeau. The results were less than promising; Agent Scrivens concluded that propping up Stanfield would exacerbate rather than relieve the cognitive dissonance. Responses included:\n\n\n\n* \"That's a made-up name.\"\n\n\n\n* \"Who?\"\n\n\n\n* \"Underwear Man?!\"\n\n\n\n* \"I don't know who that is, but he looks like an undertaker.\"\n\n\n\nThe Archives and Revision Section began extensive investigation of the Geschenk Group and the Righting Institute. They were found to be bankrolled by Austrian immigrants residing in the Canadian capital of Ottawa; MTF Beta-43 determined that their stated street addresses did not correspond to any existing structures. Furthermore, documents attesting to either group's activities before 1979 were found to have been forged.

This explained the Group's ability to participate in the electoral system despite Elections Canada having resisted private sector consultation for nearly sixty years, as well as the brazen clue to their origins embedded in the name.\n\n\n\nAn almost imperceptible second effect impelled observers, once again, to vote for Pierre Trudeau in the now long-concluded election.\n\n\n\nDr. Scout arranged a meeting between Agent Scrivens and PoI-382, Thilo Zwist, to devise a response plan. As PoI-382 was technically a capture-on-sight target, this meeting was kept out of official records until sanction was retroactively granted by the O5 Council in 1980. Zwist and Scrivens met at a supposedly abandoned rowhouse in Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Interview Transcript**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 24 May 1979\n\n\n\n**Investigating Agent:** C.

Sit down.\n\n\n\n//Agent Scrivens sits on the stoop beside Zwist.//\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** You've been a doctor, though. Several of them: Dr. Scoffield, Dr. Bromide, Dr. Braun. And you do sell medicine. I've read the file for [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5382 5382].\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Well, either you were speed-reading, or your file needs updating. My work has nothing to do with medicine. I'm a writer.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Yes, I know. You create memes that cure a disease. A disease carried by the English language.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Not just the English language, but yes. A disease I created, accidentally, a long time ago. In my youth. In my ignorance.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Is that why Dr. Scout wanted me to meet with you? Did you have something to do with the election? Did you... create another disease?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** No, I didn't create a disease that makes people change their votes. This is something much simpler, and something much worse. Much more difficult to correct. What do you know about the //giftschreiber?//\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Not a lot. I've read Dr. Scout's paper on them; they made weaponized memes for the German army in the Hundred Years' War, and they all died.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** It was the Thirty Years War, and they didn't all die. Not all of them. You have to understand, the powers they have, the powers //I// have, they're inherently... wrong. They're immoral. We compel people to do things against their will. We set our will against everyone else's, and ours always wins. What kind of practitioner does an art like that attract?\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** So, they were //bad// writers.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Very funny. Yes, they were bad writers, in every sense of the word. Compared to my order, the //schriftsteller,// the //giftschreiber// were apes banging on a keyboard that hadn't been invented yet. I could write you a poem that would make you re-think your whole approach to romance, or commerce, or even the simple process of breathing, if I wanted to; they made banners that made men catch fire. They always outnumbered us; abilities like that naturally attract the wrong sort of person. The only saving grace is that selfish, opportunistic, sadistic people don't generally work well together. They were lone wolves, making vague individual gestures to a vague destructive cause, all across Europe. Until the Bavarian army brought most of them together.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** But not all of them.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** No. Some of them survived the war, and they trained apprentices. They honed their craft.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Have you ever trained apprentices?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Once or twice, in special cases. But in general I think the world would be much improved if abilities like mine ceased to exist. I've only hung on these past few centuries to clean up after myself, and to find out if the //giftschreiber// still pose a threat to humanity. I honestly didn't think they did, until this happened. They were never an organization, before now, so I could never destroy them...\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** ...before now.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Sorry, no. I realize the sentence symmetry was leaning that way, but.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** So, Dr. Scout thinks the //giftschreiber// rigged the election.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** What Vivian thinks is almost always correct. They definitely did rig the election; trust me on that, [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5813 I've interfered with elections before]. I've seen the ballots, in any case, and I was barely able to resist the effect myself.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** So, you voted Conservative?\n\n\n\n//Zwist laughs.//\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** I've lived too long to be that backward, agent. I voted my conscience. It just happened to align with what the ballots wanted.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Yeah, I would've voted NDP, but I was on a stakeout at the time.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The New Democratic Party is the most outwardly socialist of Canada's major political parties.[[/span]] So, why are they finally so organized after all these centuries?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** They learn. If the past forty years have taught humanity anything, it's that organizational evil is much more effective. If you can put aside your differences to work at one or two really reprehensible things you all agree on, you can get a lot accomplished. The great triumph of fascism has been to show selfish people the efficiency of a common cause.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** I have a very hard time believing that their common cause is \"fuck Canada.\" We're just not that important.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** They have something to gain from this. But that doesn't really matter, in the short term.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Because whatever it is, it's bound to be terrible, so we need to stop them. How?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** To begin with, we fix this election disaster. But I don't think you're going to like my solution.\n\n\n\n//[Log ends.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAgent Scrivens returned to Dr. Scout with a detailed list of suggestions for stop-gap measures to hold off the inevitable. Dr. Scout reviewed the suggestions, workshopped them at Archives and Revision, and presented the following revised and completed proposal to Overwatch Command on 24 May:\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Operation SHADOWPLAY**\n\n**Situational Summary and Action Items**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Preamble:** \n\n\n\nWHEREAS a hostile Group of Interest has interfered with the 1979 Canadian federal election, and;\n\n\n\nWHEREAS this interference is likely to result in the complete collapse of the Canadian polity, and;\n\n\n\nWHEREAS Research and Containment Site-43 will be responsible for ameliorating this collapse, and;\n\n\n\nWHEREAS Research and Containment Site-43 is already responsible for managing two (2) potentially K-Class Scenario-triggering SCP objects;\n\n\n\nTHEREFORE a plan of action must immediately be implemented for managing the effects of this interference in a targeted, efficient manner in order that day-to-day Foundation operations and the Veil of Secrecy be maintained.\n\n\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n\n\nOperation SHADOWPLAY will create a fictional politician and declare him the winner of the 1979 federal election. This politician will nominally lead the 31st Parliament of Canada as Prime Minister; in actuality, present Prime Minister Trudeau and the 30th Parliament of Canada will be retained to execute all relevant duties behind-the-scenes. A media blackout will prevent the discovery of this ruse until a means is found to a) reverse the memetic effects of the 1979 ballots, b) create extensive video and photographic evidence of the fictional Prime Minister's existence and activities, and c) memetically insinuate him and the aforementioned material into the minds of Canadians, such that they and posterity will recognize no disjuncture with reality.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAhead of O5 approval, the Archives and Revision Section canvassed the other Sections for suggestions and then began brainstorming a personality, appearance, and background for the fictional Prime Minister. Final determinations were made the following day.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Archives and Revision Section Daily Briefing**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 25 May 1979\n\n\n\n**Present:** Section Chair/Site Director Dr. V.L.

Of course it wouldn't.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Edwin.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Achterberg:** I mean, in this case he's not wrong. We need this concept to gel with people's preconceptions. We need to play to their biases, or their minds will reject it.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Anything would be better than Trudeau or the Conservatives.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Falkirk:** Look at this one. \"The son of a previous Prime Minister.\" What country do they think this is? That'll never fly.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Achterberg:** I thought we specifically...\n\n\n\n//Dr. Achterberg rifles through his papers.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Achterberg:** ...yeah, we put it right here on the suggestion slip: \"No joke/lark suggestions.\"\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** A certain amount of silliness will go a long way, though.

Operation SHADOWPLAY was approved, and the following measures were to be implemented immediately:\n\n\n\n* The opening of parliament was to be postponed until October;\n\n\n\n* Careful political analysis would determine the likely makeup of the 1979 parliament had the memetic attack not occurred, and secure the cooperation of its putative members via regular briefing and amnesticization;\n\n\n\n* This parliament would meet in a complex teleplay to be aired on the Canadian Public Affairs Channel (CPAC), filmed daily in the House of Commons, to give the appearance of a functioning Progressive Conservative government;\n\n\n\n* Documentary records attesting to the actions of this government would be created, and filed in the appropriate archival repositories;\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=Senate.jpg|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=The Senate Chamber.|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width=260px\n\n]]\n\n\n\n* The existing federal government of Pierre Trudeau's Liberals would continue to perform their administrative duties in the Senate Chamber, after exposure to a specialized memetic agent inducing disorientation and red-green colourblindness to prevent them from recognizing their unusual surroundings,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The House of Commons is larger, and has green carpet; the Senate Chamber is smaller, and has red carpet.[[/span]] or the duplication of their duties;\n\n\n\n* The Senate of Canada would be temporarily dissolved, as it served no vital purpose;\n\n\n\n* Agent Scrivens would be coached in political philosophy and parliamentary procedure and stand in for the person of the new Prime Minister. He would make periodic public appearances until a suitable replacement could be found and his image insinuated memetically into the public consciousness by PoI-382.\n\n\n\nThe sham government of the invisible Joe Clark successfully occluded the electoral disaster of 1979 while the shadow government carried out the actual work of governance. As the official opening of parliament approached, however, Dr. Scout was summoned to Site-01 to discuss future plans with Overwatch Command.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Site-01 Closed Circuit Recording**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 17 July 1979\n\n\n\n**Present:** O5-8, Site Director Dr. V.L.

We need a complete logistical breakdown for an indefinite extension of Operation SHADOWPLAY.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Indefinite...? Is this for a contingency plan?

We've hardly ever bothered replacing a government before because the numbers rarely justify it, but they gave us an excuse, and you made it work. The apparatus is all in place. We'd be fools to throw it away.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** I didn't know we were allowing democracy to exist because of the //numbers.//\n\n\n\n**O5-8:** Democracy has always been a numbers game. There's no practical reason for us to relinquish control now. In retrospect, Canada never needed its own government in the first place. It's only a few million people.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Twenty-four million, and with respect, sir, I think this is the wrong play.\n\n\n\n**O5-8:** Aren't you the one who's always complaining about federal interference? There's no federal interference anymore, Vivian. We //are// the federal government.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** As a stopgap measure only. We don't intrude on normalcy, we maintain it.\n\n\n\n**O5-8:** You're splitting hairs. It's not like this is a new idea; we've only rejected it in the past because it's too difficult. We'd never be able to control a larger government, or falsify an election in a real world power, but Canada is small potatoes. Who knows? If this works out, it might be a gateway to something more ambitious in the future.\n\n\n\n//O5-8 hands Dr. Scout a dossier.//\n\n\n\n**O5-8:** Look at these financial reports.

After an educational crash course from Archives and Revision, Agent Scrivens accompanied Zwist to the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and the Beaverbrook Gallery. He tutored Zwist on Canadian landscape art, joined him in consultation with indigenous elders, and attended lectures with him at seven Canadian universities on topics ranging from architecture to food to political science. Scrivens continued to film file footage as Joe Clark, in the event that a replacement could not be found in time.\n\n\n\nIn August, Zwist indicated that he had developed an action plan; he met Agent Scrivens at a secure safehouse to discuss its implications.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interview Transcript**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 12 August 1979\n\n\n\n**Investigating Agent:** C.

Beneath them, if we're being honest; I could've done a much better job in the 1630s, if we'd had elections back then.\n\n\n\n//Zwist shakes his head.//\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** So, what. Elections Canada needs to change its logo now?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** No, the effect has already abated.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Alright, but the damage is done. What're you going to do to fix it? The same thing? Meme up the logo, send out a post-election survey, get everyone to look at it again?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** What is this, amateur hour? That would be terribly ineffective. The attack might have been crude, but it affected every single voter in the nation. Nobody fills out surveys, conversely.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Alright, so we think bigger. You're supposed to be some kind of wizard with this stuff, right? Can you... infect symbols at a distance, all at once instead of individually? Weaponize, say, the Canadian flag, so that everyone who looks at it forgets about the last election?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Still not enough. [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5859 That sort of thing] has been tried before, and it doesn't really work. We need a one hundred percent catch rate for this, voters and non-voters included.

I'm going to show you all a higher class of meme.\n\n\n\n//Agent Scrivens nods, then freezes.//\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Explain.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** It's very simple. I'm going to try to replicate, experimentally, what I did in error so many centuries ago, on a grander and more targeted scale. I'm going to infuse the Canadian //zeitgeist// with the concept of your imaginary leader, so that everyone who understands what it is to be Canadian will know him to be real.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** You're going to put Joe Clark... into the concept of Canada.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Essentially.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** And that's going to work? Indefinitely?\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** Nothing works indefinitely. I daren't risk pouring too much of myself into this. I don't want another linguistic disease, and I can't risk shuffling off the mortal coil with the rest of my work left undone. But a short effect, something on the order of half a century... that much I can manage, I think.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** That's short, huh? I guess it would be, to you.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** It's going to be a very strong effect, and it's going to work on //everyone.// I'm going to put a little extra //oomph// into my magic, and make the //giftschreiber// lose their focus on Canada at the same time. You're all going to lose the thread together, unfortunately... you'll have to prepare a select staff to liaise with the shadow government, make absolutely certain their memories remain intact, and you'll also want to nominate someone to keep a complete record of the true course of events, plus one more someone to keep tabs on our fictional fellow. You're all going to forget that Joe Clark never existed, and you won't remember again until the new millennium when it won't even matter anymore. By the time people have believed something for four or five decades, it's functionally true.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** This is absurd.\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** It gets worse. It isn't enough to convince them that the figure of Joe Clark has been, and remains, Prime Minister. That he won the election, that he rose through the ranks of his party the usual way. They need to be convinced that a real person, in the real world, //one// real person, is Joe Clark. The concept needs an anchor.\n\n\n\n**Agent Scrivens:** Okay...\n\n\n\n**Zwist:** It needs to be someone who understands the character. It needs to be someone who's dedicated to the cause the character was created to serve. And it needs to be someone I know well. Very, very well. Or I won't be able to make this happen.\n\n\n\n//Agent Scrivens nods. He looks down at his notes. He looks up at Dr. Zwist. He nods again, slowly. He opens his mouth.

Extensive experimentation by the Archives and Revision Section revealed that PoI-382 had fully integrated the person of Joe Clark into the conceptual category of \"Canada.\" The parliamentary footage heretofore prepared was released to the public, and its memetic effects were immediate: Canadians instantly formed memories of having seen Agent Scrivens in his role as Joe Clark over the preceding six months. Live broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings resumed as per usual in October, as Agent Scrivens was now fully capable of inhabiting the role of Joe Clark full-time.\n\n\n\nIn December of 1979, however, Dr. Falkirk submitted the following report to the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Operation SHADOWPLAY**\n\n**Situational Summary and Action Items**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAgent Scrivens is acting dangerously off-script, and the memetic effect preventing us from fully focusing on his activities or recalling his prior occupation is making it difficult to rein him in. His assigned handler is no help at all; it was an obvious mistake to select her from among his MTF colleagues.\n\n\n\nWhile we have repeatedly stressed to him the importance of a farcical-but-competent performance, Scrivens often chooses to act either directly against the interests of his party, in flagrant disregard of present circumstances, or against the political calculus provided by Site-43. His //faux pas// so far include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n* weakening his own party by refusing to form alliances;\n\n* inexplicably promising to move Canada's Israeli embassy;\n\n* pursuing legislation to ensure governmental transparency;\n\n* adding a gasoline tax to the budget against the desires of conservative voters;\n\n* inexplicably failing to move Canada's Israeli embassy;\n\n* intentionally courting an election he is projected to lose.\n\n\n\nIt is my considered opinion that Agent Scrivens is attempting to unilaterally end Operation SHADOWPLAY, perhaps to resume his former life. As Director Scout has refused to take action, I am on my own initiative requesting a formal review of these events.\n\n[[>]]\n\n//--Dr. Edwin Falkirk//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe O5 Council ordered Drs.

Hurried amendments to Operation SHADOWPLAY resulted in an abortive attempt by Foundation operatives to rig the election in favour of the Progressive Conservatives; these operatives were non-fatally neutralized by memetic attacks at ballot production facilities and polling stations. While //giftschreiber// involvement was obviously suspected, the election proceeded as normal without further interference by any organization, returning a new Liberal administration under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. One final round of amnesticization removed all traces of the shadow government's activities.\n\n\n\nAgent Scrivens officially cut ties with the SCP Foundation following the election, but remained a member of Canadian parliament as Joe Clark. He engineered his own removal from the leadership of his party and became instead an active member, promoting liberal causes within the Progressive Conservative ranks. He initiated humanitarian relief for Ethiopia, denounced apartheid, encouraged the immigration of refugees to Canada and strongly opposed neoconservative elements in the party even after his retirement in 2004.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5054-EX-3, Aftermath:** Mistrustful of Dr. Scout's motives due to his affiliation with PoI-382, O5 Command ordered that Dr. Falkirk be fortified with a permanent schedule of high-effect mnestics and made the keeper of all data pertaining to SCP-5054-EX, that he might reveal it to his colleagues upon the diminishment of Zwist's memetic effect. Dr. Falkirk's unfortunate accident prevented this, and it was not until the effect expired entirely that the files were discovered and decrypted.\n\n\n\nThe initial rediscovery of the SCP-5054-EX effect led to hurried attempts by Archives and Revision to a) determine why Joe Clark had been forgotten, and then b) suppress knowledge of Joe Clark when it was determined that he had never existed. These activities were terminated upon the reconstruction of the true events of 1979-80. \n\n\n\nTo complete the SCP-5054-EX file, Joe Clark's handler Maureen McTeer invited Dr. Blank to visit her home and interview her husband.

I love my wife, I love my daughter, and I've managed to paint a pretty enough picture in between the lines Zwist and Scout gave me. It's enough.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Agent McTeer seems relieved to get it all out in the open.\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** It's been a strange four decades for her. She's been an active agent, an active public figure and the wife of an active anomaly this entire time. She thought about quitting the Foundation, but... anyway. We'd decided that if whoever was keeping the secret didn't spill it by the fifty-year mark, she'd do it for them.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** If the effect hadn't faded, it wouldn't have done any good.\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** True enough. Well, I know Mo's looking forward to telling everyone at 43 who she's married to. She hasn't done field work since the nineties, and you lot were starting to wonder why a desk worker would need so many doses of mnestics! I don't know what I'd've done if she'd started to forget me, too. She was my last link to Beta-43, and the Site. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** She didn't turn out to be much of a handler, did she?\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** Well, that's your perspective.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Partners in crime, huh?

If the //giftschreiber// were able to infiltrate the ballot-makers and the polling stations, to prevent us from meddling... why didn't //they// meddle?\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** It wasn't the //giftschreiber,// obviously.

I tipped Zwist off. He has very particular opinions about fascism, you know?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I do know. Who were your Foundation connections? Obviously I have to ask.\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** Is this Scout asking, really?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Dr. Scout passed away more than twenty years ago.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** I honestly thought he'd live forever.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Blank:** He nearly did.\n\n\n\n**Scrivens:** Well, give me a moment.

Many Canadians now insist that Stanfield actually served as Prime Minister at some unspecified point in the past.

Their effects have induced acts of unstatesmanlike behaviour including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n* repeated random acts of public cultural appropriation;\n\n* intentionally falling down sets of stairs;\n\n* making obscene gestures at\u00a0\u00a0other heads of state;\n\n* growing what he has described as \"that beard Spock had in that one episode of //Star Trek//\";\n\n* spontaneous disrobing;\n\n* demanding that the Canadian people \"just watch\" him.\n\n\n\nA tentative proposal for Operation THAT'S JUST JUSTIN has been submitted to the O5 Council, and Trudeau has been assigned an agent from Site-43 for his protection.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< **[[[Defence]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[SCP-5162]]]** >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=HarryBlank]]\n\n=====\n\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** 5054EX.png\n\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Clark.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Joe Clark PC LeadershipConvention 1983\n\n> **Author:** Alasdairroberts\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Joe_Clark_PC_LeadershipConvention_1983.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Clark2.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark and Minister of Parliament Peter Bawden\n\n> **Author:** Sgc4a\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/6afc1339-856b-457d-934c-f06332a13052 Wikimedia Commons]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Fountain.jpg\n\n> **Author:**\u00a0\u00a0HarryBlank\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Geschenk.png\n\n> **Name:** The Geschenk Group\n\n> **Author:**\u00a0\u00a0\tHarryBlank\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** JoeClark.jpg\n\n> **Name:** JoeClark\n\n> **Author:** Canada Jack aka Jeremy Gilbert\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/6f797b9d-1314-4855-8b09-5dd19ebb3b62 Wikimedia Commons]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Justin.jpg\n\n> **Name:** President Donald J.

Externally, SCP-5218 resembles a simple metal cube 3m wide, weighing 200kg, constructed of a metallic alloy of unclear composition. All attempts to force open, pierce, or otherwise damage SCP-5218 have ended in failure.</p>\n<p>All faces of SCP-5218 are flat save for one. All faces furthermore display a metal stamp reading \"PROPERTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ABNORMALITIES.\"</p>\n<p>One face contains a simple pull-open metal cabinet that pulls flush when closed, and when opened allows a small space to drop objects into while blocking vision into the rest of the device. Below this is a small rectangular slot akin to that of a vending machine.</p>\n<p>Upon placing an item or items into the metal cabinet and closing it, allowing the item to fall in, SCP-5218 will vibrate for a varying length of time, generally a few seconds to a minute, and release a single item into the output slot. These items vary in practically every quality save for their size; all are small enough to fit into the slot.</p>\n<p>Upon SCP-5218's discovery in 2013, it was immediately shipped to Site-19 for experimentation. Over the course of the following month, several tests were performed on SCP-5218. An abridged list of experiments follows.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span>Addendum 5218.1</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\"><span><tt>TESTING LOG</tt></span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> A single apple, Red Delicious variety</p>\n<p><strong>Output:</strong> A military-surplus MRE of the variety used across Foundation sites. Chicken alfredo flavor.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> A 1kg granite stone.</p>\n<p><strong>Output:</strong> A small poster tube containing detailed blueprints of Sublevels 1 through 5 of Site-19.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> A 2kg weight.</p>\n<p><strong>Output:</strong> A plastic trophy covered in dried blood. DNA of the blood has been matched to Leon Abrams, a now-deceased former Site-19 security guard. Abrams' body was cremated after death.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> A plastic cube.</p>\n<p><strong>Output:</strong> A Nokia 3310 cellphone with one number programmed into its directory. The area code correlates to Tennesee, but all attempts to trace the phone number have failed. Attempting to call it simply results in a generic out of service error.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> A single bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>Output:</strong> An armed grenade.

Externally, SCP-5218 resembles a simple metal cube 3m wide, weighing 200kg, constructed of a metallic alloy of unclear composition. All attempts to force open, pierce, or otherwise damage SCP-5218 have ended in failure. \n\n\n\nAll faces of SCP-5218 are flat save for one. All faces furthermore display a metal stamp reading \"PROPERTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ABNORMALITIES.\" \n\n\n\nOne face contains a simple pull-open metal cabinet that pulls flush when closed, and when opened allows a small space to drop objects into while blocking vision into the rest of the device. Below this is a small rectangular slot akin to that of a vending machine.\n\n\n\nUpon placing an item or items into the metal cabinet and closing it, allowing the item to fall in, SCP-5218 will vibrate for a varying length of time, generally a few seconds to a minute, and release a single item into the output slot. These items vary in practically every quality save for their size; all are small enough to fit into the slot. \n\n\n\nUpon SCP-5218's discovery in 2013, it was immediately shipped to Site-19 for experimentation. Over the course of the following month, several tests were performed on SCP-5218. An abridged list of experiments follows.\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Addendum 5218.1\n\n+++ {{TESTING LOG}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n**Input:** A single apple, Red Delicious variety\n\n\n\n**Output:** A military-surplus MRE of the variety used across Foundation sites.

DNA of the blood has been matched to Leon Abrams, a now-deceased former Site-19 security guard. Abrams' body was cremated after death.\n\n----\n\n**Input:** A plastic cube.\n\n\n\n**Output:** A Nokia 3310 cellphone with one number programmed into its directory. The area code correlates to Tennesee, but all attempts to trace the phone number have failed. Attempting to call it simply results in a generic out of service error.\n\n----\n\n**Input:** A single bullet.\n\n\n\n**Output:** An armed grenade. The pin had been pulled but the safety lever had not been released, preventing its detonation. A security team safely disposed of the bomb without incident. The grenade was inscribed with the Foundation logo, but detailed analysis could not be performed for obvious reasons.\n\n----\n\n**Input:** A single dead lab rat.\n\n\n\n**Output:** A MTF-issue Bowie knife. 13 scratches have been carved into the flat of the otherwise-pristine blade.\n\n----\n\n**Input:** A single live lab rat.\n\n\n\n**Output:** Screaming from inside the machine, followed by a Clearance Level 4 keycard belonging to one Dr. Daniel Jackson.

How are you doing today?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> I'm alright. Just- I don't know, I guess I'm hanging in there.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> I see. Well, McGill has informed me as to why you're visiting me. I hear you've been struggling with various hallucinations surrounding technology in your day-to-day life? Your alarm, vending machines, automatic doors? Just to name a few?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> They're not hallucinations. They <em>can't</em> be. They just feel too real, and it's always happening! I didn't see it at first, I tried keeping it to myself, felt silly, but <em>something's</em> going on. I don't know. Do you really think I'm crazy, doc?</p>\n<p><em>Periwinkle sighs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Maybe I am crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> Now hold on, we don't use words like \"crazy,\" Charlie. Be gentle with yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Sorry. I mean, I've just been stuck with this for so long, and I've been keeping it to myself, and\u2026 I just want someone on the outside to tell me what's wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Groebler:</strong> Do you recall how you asked McGill to \"Look into\" the supposed anomaly afflicting you?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Groebler turns his monitor to face Periwinkle. An mp4 file is visible on the screen.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> Well, she did, and she figured I should be the one to show you this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Groebler presses play.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> At about four fifteen last Tuesday, you reported being unable to walk into the office wing because the automatic door refused to open for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The footage shows Periwinkle walking, then stopping in front of the automatic doors. They open to reveal the office space within, but Periwinkle stays standing there. He lifts his arms and waves them. Another technician walks out of the office and greets Periwinkle, but he doesn't respond. Periwinkle tries swiping his card again, continues dancing in front of the door, and mimes banging on it, but doesn't perceive the door as open. At last, Periwinkle groans and turns back around, disappearing from the camera's frame.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Christ- I- No, you don't understand. I spent thirty minutes trying to get in there. No one came in or out. It was so cold.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Doesn't anyone else remember this?</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> I'm afraid the footage doesn't lie. You submitted a similar complaint about the vending machines.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The next clip shows Periwinkle standing in front of a vending machine. He deposits a $1 bill. A soda can slides into the delivery slot, but Periwinkle doesn't notice it. He waits, then deposits another dollar. Periwinkle does this six more times, before giving a frustrated yell and kicking the machine- then walking away. A coworker appears and picks up one of the cans, calling towards Periwinkle- but he keeps walking away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> What? No, that can't be it. I-</p>\n<p><em>Periwinkle rewinds the footage and watches it again.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> I-I sent complaints to the main office each day for a week. Did-I-I don't understand.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> McGill and I already checked the system, but found no such record. Did you ever follow up in person?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> S-Should I have? I just- It was just eight bucks. I figured it wasn't worth the hassle. Oh! But I definitely complained to James and George about it. Maybe they could verify this is something I went through?</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> Do you normally speak with George and James?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> We have lunch together every day in the breakroom, and we've been friends since orientation!</p>\n<p><em>Groebler fasts-fowards the video while mumbling to his breath, then hits play.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Camera monitors the East wing of Site-140's cafeteria. Periwinkle sits in a booth in the back, looking intently at the empty seat in front of him. He then smiles and chuckles, before starting to tell a personal story to no one in particular. One minute in, technicians George Torres and James Nelson enter the frame together. They shoot Periwinkle an odd glance, then sit three booths down from him and start their own conversation. Periwinkle continues talking to empty space for the remainder of the recording.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Groebler turns back towards Periwinkle, who has his head in his hands.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> I swear that isn't how things happened.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> Our perception of the world isn't always as accurate as we think it is. Neither is our memory. But at least we know now what the issue is so that we can work on fixing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> T-That has to be fake, right? Are you sure no one's playing a trick on me? I- No way-</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> I doubt anyone would be able to hack our systems and swap out our data with such a convincing replica- let alone do it exclusively to inconvenience you.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Oh god- we're feeding the Basilisk-</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> Charlie, please try to relax. Sit down. Let's talk about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Just-Just give me a chance to prove that I'm telling the truth. Something has to be wrong here. Please.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> What did you have in mind?</p>\n<p><em>Periwinkle pulls out his phone and dials a number.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> I-It's one thing if I keep hallucinating machines or whatever malfunctioning. But George and James and I have always been there for each other. They've always held me together, and I-I just want to make sure\u2026 I mean, they're my friends. That's all. I don't want to lose them.</p>\n<p><em>Periwinkle places the phone on speaker. He and Groebler are both silent as it rings for the following 90 seconds. George Torres' voice eventually answers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Torres:</strong> Hello? This is George Torres speaking?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Hi Georgie! It's Charlie! How are ya?</p>\n<p><strong>Torres:</strong> Charlie? As in Charlie Periwinkle, the technician that sits three cubicles down?</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Real funny, Georgie-</p>\n<p><strong>Torres:</strong> First off, please call me Mr. Torres. Second of all, I'm sort of busy right now. I told you I gave you my number only for emergencies, and this doesn't sound like one. You're crossing quite a few boundaries right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> It sort of is one. Some shit is going down, and I just wanted to double-check with you, we eat lunch together every day, right? And last Tuesday we had a movie night in the barracks. You always borrow my colored paper clips since you're a neat freak?</p>\n<p><strong>Torres:</strong> I'm not sure where this is all coming from, but no- we've never done any of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> By the way, I've got Groebler with me right now- this probably not the best time for you to pull this sort of joke.</p>\n<p><strong>Torres:</strong> I'm dead serious, and I don't know how to make that more apparent. Clearly, you're going through stuff right now, but I'd rather just maintain a professional relationship with you. I hope you get the help you need, but don't call my personal number again.</p>\n<p><em>Torres hangs up. Periwinkle jumps out of his seat and starts pacing around the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Georgie!? Georgie!? Dammit, George!</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> Charlie.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Let me call up Jamie! O-Or, let me talk to one of them in person. They'll back me up!</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> I think I've seen enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> You have to believe me! Please, just one more chance!</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler</strong> You're okay. Can you please sit back down? Let's chat about this.</p>\n<p><em>Periwinkle hesitantly obliges. He sits shaking in his chair, wiping tears away from his face.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> It seems like you've been under a lot of stress at work here lately, and that's been affecting your social and mental well-being.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> I-I'm not <em>that</em> stressed! I-It's those damn machines again. Isn't this just proof that technology hates me? All of that stuff had to be fake. Something made it up and is just- Please, believe me. Please trust me.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> I trust you, but you have to be honest with yourself, and you have to be honest with me. I'd like to place you under a 72-hour on-site observation period, just so we can monitor your health and make sure you're safe.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> I-I\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> I promise you'll be okay. How about I go get someone to escort you back to your quarters so you can get what you need?</p>\n<p><em>Periwinkle buries his face in his arms. He gives a slow nod.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> That's the spirit! I'm proud of you.</p>\n<p><em>Groebler stands up and walks towards the door, patting Periwinkle on the back as he leaves.</em></p>\n<p>&lt;END LOG&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span><strong>Incident-5257-3</strong></span></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following Interview 5257-2, Technician Periwinkle barricaded himself in Dr. Groebler's office.

You could be speaking with someone else's voice again. Just like you did with George.</p>\n<p><strong>McGill:</strong> They seemed like incredibly heartfelt and close friends, from your side.</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> But Torres set very clear boundaries for your relationship. The way you insist on continuing to cross them is simply crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> Crazy? You said we shouldn't use that word. I-You're not really Groebler, are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Groebler:</strong> It's a phrase. People can slip up from time to time.</p>\n<p><strong>Periwinkle:</strong> And so it seems machines can too.

Several calls were traced from Periwinkle's to Nelson's phone, occurring at the same time as the collision. Foundation accident reconstructionists currently believe Periwinkle's excessive calling distracted Nelson while he was driving.</p>\n<p>Both technicians survived the accident, although Torres remains on life support in Site-140's infirmary, while Nelson suffered significant brain damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 1:47 PM:</strong></p>\n<p>Technicians Periwinkle was found to have created and uploaded SCP-5257 to Site-140's database. The document was placed under review by Site-140's director. While further updates to the situation are to be made to the document, little evidence has been found of anomalous foul play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 3:21 PM:</strong></p>\n<p>The ventilator maintaining George Torres' breathing inexplicably ceased functioning, resulting in the Technician's death. Nelson remains unconscious. Further study of Nelson's vehicle also revealed several malfunctions in the vehicle's automated steering system. Both the malfunctions in Torres' ventilator and the steering system were attributed to non-anomalous causes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 3:58 PM:</strong></p>\n<p>All of Site-140's automated surveillance cameras ceased functioning due to a malfunction-inducing agent<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> uploaded to relevant security systems by Technician Periwinkle.</p>\n<p>After failing to reason with Periwinkle further by speaking to him through Groebler's office door, McGill ordered a security team to enter and retrieve the Technician via necessary force.

SCP-5257 is theorized by Technician Periwinkle to cause them to experience a much larger amount of technological glitches and errors than the average user.

They can't do that.\n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** She wasn't! She wasn't just a machine!\n\n\n\n**McGill:**\u00a0\u00a0I really think you should see Dr. Groebler. \n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** I'm not crazy! I'm cursed! The machines are after me, and you have to help me before they kill me, or worse!\n\n\n\n**McGill:**\u00a0\u00a0Worse?\n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** Have you ever heard of Roko's Basilisk?\n\n\n\n**McGill:**\u00a0\u00a0Never mind that. \n\n\n\n//McGill sighs.//\n\n\n\n**McGill:**\u00a0\u00a0Alright, you want me to look into this?\n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** Yes, //please//.\n\n\n\n**McGill:**\u00a0\u00a0Okay, I will. But I have one condition.\n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** Yes! Thank you! What is it?\n\n\n\n**McGill:**\u00a0\u00a0Go see Dr. Groebler. \n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** Promise you'll look into it?\n\n\n\n**McGill:** Yes.\n\n\n\n**Periwinkle:** Okay then, I will. \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n+++ Addendum-5257-2\n\n\n\n> The following interview was conducted between Dr. Groebler and Periwinkle. \n\n> \n\n> <BEGIN LOG> \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Hello, Charlie. How are you doing today?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I'm alright. Just- I don't know, I guess I'm hanging in there. \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** I see. Well, McGill has informed me as to why you're visiting me. I hear you've been struggling with various hallucinations surrounding technology in your day-to-day life? Your alarm, vending machines, automatic doors? Just to name a few? \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** They're not hallucinations. They //can't// be. They just feel too real,\u00a0\u00a0and it's always happening!\u00a0\u00a0I didn't see it at first, I tried keeping it to myself, felt silly,\u00a0\u00a0but //something's// going on. I don't know. Do you really think I'm crazy, doc?\n\n> \n\n> //Periwinkle sighs.//\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Maybe I am crazy.\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Now hold on, we don't use words like \"crazy,\" Charlie. Be gentle with yourself. \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Periwinkle:** Sorry. I mean, I've just been stuck with this for so long, and I've been keeping it to myself, and... I just want someone on the outside to tell me what's wrong. \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **Groebler:** Do you recall how you asked McGill to \"Look into\" the supposed anomaly afflicting you? \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Yes? \n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Groebler turns his monitor to face Periwinkle. An mp4 file is visible on the screen.//\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Well, she did, and she figured I should be the one to show you this. \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> //Groebler presses play.//\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** At about four fifteen last Tuesday, you reported being unable to walk into the office wing because the automatic door refused to open for you. \n\n> \n\n>> //The footage shows Periwinkle walking, then stopping in front of the automatic doors. They open to reveal the office space within, but Periwinkle stays standing there. He lifts his arms and waves them. Another technician walks out of the office and greets Periwinkle, but he doesn't respond. Periwinkle tries swiping his card again, continues dancing in front of the door, and mimes banging on it, but doesn't perceive the door as open. At last, Periwinkle groans and turns back around, disappearing from the camera's frame.//\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Christ- I- No, you don't understand. I spent thirty minutes trying to get in there. No one came in or out. It was so cold.[[footnote]] The temperature that day was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Witnesses report Technician Periwinkle shivering throughout the day. [[/footnote]] Doesn't anyone else remember this? \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** I'm afraid the footage doesn't lie. You submitted a similar complaint about the vending machines. \n\n> \n\n>> The next clip shows Periwinkle standing in front of a vending machine. He deposits a $1 bill. A soda can slides into the delivery slot, but Periwinkle doesn't notice it. He waits, then deposits another dollar.\u00a0\u00a0Periwinkle does this six more times, before giving a frustrated yell and kicking the machine- then walking away. A coworker appears and picks up one of the cans, calling towards Periwinkle- but he keeps walking away. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** What? No, that can't be it. I-\n\n> \n\n> //Periwinkle rewinds the footage and watches it again.//\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I-I sent complaints to the main office each day for a week. Did-I-I don't understand. \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** McGill and I already checked the system, but found no such record. Did you ever follow up in person?\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** S-Should I have? I just- It was just eight bucks. I figured it wasn't worth the hassle. Oh! But I definitely complained to James and George about it. Maybe they could verify this is something I went through?\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Do you normally speak with George and James? \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** We have lunch together every day in the breakroom, and we've been friends since orientation! \n\n> \n\n> //Groebler fasts-fowards the video while mumbling to his breath, then hits play.// \n\n>\n\n>> Camera monitors the East wing of Site-140's cafeteria.\u00a0\u00a0Periwinkle sits in a booth in the back, looking intently at the empty seat in front of him. He then smiles and chuckles, before starting to tell a personal story to no one in particular. One minute in, technicians George Torres and James Nelson enter the frame together. They shoot Periwinkle an odd glance, then sit three booths down from him and start their own conversation. Periwinkle continues talking to empty space for the remainder of the recording. \n\n> \n\n> //Groebler turns back towards Periwinkle, who has his head in his hands.//\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I swear that isn't how things happened.\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Our perception of the world isn't always as accurate as we think it is. Neither is our memory. But at least we know now what the issue is so that we can work on fixing it. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** T-That has to be fake, right? Are you sure no one's playing a trick on me? I- No way- \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** I doubt anyone would be able to hack our systems and swap out our data with such a convincing replica- let alone do it exclusively to inconvenience you.\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Oh god- we're feeding the Basilisk-\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Charlie, please try to relax. Sit down. Let's talk about it. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Just-Just give me a chance to prove that I'm telling the truth. Something has to be wrong here. Please. \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** What did you have in mind?\n\n> \n\n> //Periwinkle pulls out his phone and dials a number.//\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I-It's one thing if I keep hallucinating machines or whatever malfunctioning. But George and James and I have always been there for each other. They've always held me together, and I-I just want to make sure... I mean, they're my friends. That's all. I don't want to lose them. \n\n> \n\n> //Periwinkle places the phone on speaker. He and Groebler are both silent as it rings for the following 90 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0George Torres' voice eventually answers.//\n\n> \n\n> **Torres:** Hello? This is George Torres speaking? \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Hi Georgie! It's Charlie! How are ya?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Torres:** Charlie? As in Charlie Periwinkle, the technician that sits three cubicles down?\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Real funny, Georgie-\n\n> \n\n> **Torres:** First off, please call me Mr. Torres. Second of all, I'm sort of busy right now. I told you I gave you my number only for emergencies, and this doesn't sound like one. You're crossing quite a few boundaries right now. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** It sort of is one. Some shit is going down, and I just wanted to double-check with you, we eat lunch together every day, right? And last Tuesday we had a movie night in the barracks. You always borrow my colored paper clips since you're a neat freak?\n\n> \n\n> **Torres:** I'm not sure where this is all coming from, but no- we've never done any of that.\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** By the way, I've got Groebler with me right now- this probably not the best time for you to pull this sort of joke. \n\n> \n\n> **Torres:** I'm dead serious, and I don't know how to make that more apparent. Clearly, you're going through stuff right now, but I'd rather just maintain a professional relationship with you. I hope you get the help you need, but don't call my personal number again. \n\n> \n\n> //Torres hangs up. Periwinkle jumps out of his seat and starts pacing around the room.//\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Georgie!? Georgie!? Dammit, George! \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** Charlie. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Let me call up Jamie! O-Or, let me talk to one of them in person. They'll back me up! \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** I think I've seen enough.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** You have to believe me! Please, just one more chance! \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler** You're okay. Can you please sit back down? Let's chat about this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> //Periwinkle hesitantly obliges. He sits shaking in his chair, wiping tears away from his face.//\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** It seems like you've been under a lot of stress at work here lately, and that's been affecting your social and mental well-being. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I-I'm not //that// stressed! I-It's those damn machines again. Isn't this just proof that technology hates me? All of that stuff had to be fake. Something made it up and is just- Please, believe me. Please trust me. \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** I trust you, but you have to be honest with yourself, and you have to be honest with me. I'd like to place you under a 72-hour on-site observation period, just so we can monitor your health and make sure you're safe. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I-I... \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** I promise you'll be okay. How about I go get someone to escort you back to your quarters so you can get what you need? \n\n> \n\n> //Periwinkle buries his face in his arms. He gives a slow nod.//\n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** That's the spirit! I'm proud of you.\n\n> \n\n> //Groebler stands up and walks towards the door, patting Periwinkle on the back as he leaves.//\n\n> \n\n> <END LOG>\n\n\n\n+++ **Incident-5257-3**\n\n\n\n> **Foreword:** Following Interview 5257-2, Technician Periwinkle barricaded himself in Dr. Groebler's office. Site security was called, but proved unable to open the electronic deadbolt. However, Dr. McGill maintained communication through the two-way site intercom. \n\n> \n\n> <BEGIN LOG> \n\n> \n\n> **McGill:** Hello Charlie, can you hear me? Are you alright?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Would you stop asking that? How am I supposed to answer that when you won't believe a word I say?\n\n> \n\n> **McGill:** You can't stay in there forever. Please, just talk to us. We can help you. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** I'm not coming back out. Not until I can figure out what's wrong. It-It can't be me!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **McGill:** We can tell you what's wrong if you let us in. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** How do I know you're the real McGill anyways? You could be speaking with someone else's voice again. Just like you did with George. \n\n> \n\n> **McGill:** They seemed like incredibly heartfelt and close friends, from your side. \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** But Torres set very clear boundaries for your relationship. The way you insist on continuing to cross them is simply crazy.\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** Crazy? You said we shouldn't use that word. I-You're not really Groebler, are you? \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** It's a phrase. People can slip up from time to time. \n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** And so it seems machines can too. Just wait until George and James get here. They'll have my back. \n\n> \n\n> **Groebler:** You realize you're just making this worse for yourself?\n\n> \n\n> **Periwinkle:** This isn't real. You're just trying to make me look crazy again! Well, I'm not falling for it! I'm done listening to you! \n\n> \n\n> //Loud crashing can be heard as Periwinkle smashes an office chair onto the loudspeaker, preventing any further communication.//\n\n> \n\n> <END LOG>\n\n\u00a0\n\n> **Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 12:08 PM:**\n\n> Site-140 staff were alerted to a vehicular accident involving technicians George Torres and James Nelson, who were carpooling together. Several calls were traced from Periwinkle's to Nelson's phone, occurring at the same time as the collision. Foundation accident reconstructionists currently believe Periwinkle's excessive calling distracted Nelson while he was driving. \n\n> \n\n> Both technicians survived the accident, although Torres remains on life support in Site-140's infirmary, while Nelson suffered significant brain damage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n> **Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 1:47 PM:**\n\n> \n\n> Technicians Periwinkle was found to have created and uploaded SCP-5257 to Site-140's database. The document was placed under review by Site-140's director. While further updates to the situation are to be made to the document, little evidence has been found of anomalous foul play. \n\n\n\n> **Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 3:21 PM:**\n\n> \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0The ventilator maintaining George Torres' breathing inexplicably ceased functioning, resulting in the Technician's death. Nelson remains unconscious. Further study of Nelson's vehicle also revealed several malfunctions in the vehicle's automated steering system. Both the malfunctions in Torres' ventilator and the steering system were attributed to non-anomalous causes. \n\n\n\n> **Revised Entry, 05/22/2023, 3:58 PM:**\n\n> \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0All of Site-140's automated surveillance cameras ceased functioning due to a malfunction-inducing agent[[footnote]]A computer virus capable of hindering or destroying any intelligence-based aspects of technology. Often considered the equivalent of a memetic agent for .aics. [[/footnote]] uploaded to relevant security systems by Technician Periwinkle. \n\n> \n\n> After failing to reason with Periwinkle further by speaking to him through Groebler's office door, McGill ordered a security team to enter and retrieve the Technician via necessary force.\u00a0\u00a0This effort proved successful, and Periwinkle was placed under psychiatric observation. \n\n\n\n> **Revised Entry, 05/25/2023, 8:32 AM:**\n\n> \n\n> Investigation by Site-140's IT department, led by Dr. McGill, revealed no indicators of anomalous interference or alterations with any of the issues Periwinkle described or experienced. Furthermore, an extensive assessment by Dr. Groebler demonstrated Periwinkle's lack of mental well-being. This has proven sufficient evidence to mark SCP-5257 as an \"Explained\" anomaly.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n------ \n\n\n\n++++ For more information regarding SCP-5257, please visit:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\" Site-140's Administrative Documentation Department\" hide=\"Site-140's Administrative Documentation Department\"]]\n\n> \"Well, hello there!

The rucksack had apparently been abandoned by accident, and Blackmun took it upon himself to inspect its contents in an attempt to find its owner.

Historically, SCP-5737 has been assumed non-anomalous due to its near-universal presence in humans, and I expect that many will conclude this document with that belief still firmly in place. As the description below addresses an issue of significant personal value to many, discretion is advised when reading.</p>\n<p>- Dr. Copeland, head researcher for SCP-5737</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5737</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Explained</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Because of the extensive period of time elapsed between SCP-5737\u2019s occurrence and the present day, as well as the unacceptable risk of any method of ongoing containment causing an MK-Class \u201cEnd of Human Consciousness\u201d scenario, SCP-5737 is functionally uncontainable. Containment efforts are to focus on minimizing the effects of SCP-5737 expression among extant human cultures via the promotion of humanistic politics and maintenance of containment procedures associated with identified Groups of Interest. The existence of SCP-5737 is to be confirmed only to Level 4 and higher Foundation researchers; individuals without Level 4 clearance who become aware of SCP-5737 are to receive targeted amnesticization.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5737 is a hypothetical ontological shift, presumptively dated to the Ediacaran period (635-541 MYA), that affected the ancestral Nephrozoan<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> and all descendent lineages. The suite of physiological characters resulting from SCP-5737 permit the emergence of the set of qualia commonly described as \u201cspiritual/religious experiences\u201d. As spiritual or spiritual-like practices have been observed in both <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4067\">protostome</a> and deuterostome lineages, the influence of SCP-5737 is presumed plesiomorphic<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, and lineages in which spiritual-like practices are not present are hypothesized to have secondarily lost its influence.</p>\n<p>Due to the extremely widespread expression of SCP-5737 across bilaterian taxa and its universal expression across human cultures, several non-anomalous theories have been developed by civilian organizations as to the origin of its effects. These theories include SCP-5737 promoting social bonding and group cohesiveness, serving as a motivating force for the acquisition of resources and territory in early hominids, and being an emergent property at a certain level of cognitive development conferring no significant fitness benefits. However, the development by the Foundation of the Hume and Akiva scales has allowed accurate analysis of metaphysiological changes in organisms expressing SCP-5737-dependent behaviour, which permitted its anomalous nature to be determined.</p>\n<p>Human susceptibility to SCP-5737 expression follows a normal distribution, with approximately 15% of the human population considered abnormally prone to spiritual experiences and approximately 10% considered abnormally resistant. Cultural factors explain more than half (55%) of this variation. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with or who meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder have a significantly higher likelihood of being resistant to SCP-5737\u2019s effects than the general population. Research into the heritability of SCP-5737 susceptibility has proven inconclusive due to heavy confounding from upbringing and culture. In humans, SCP-5737 displays a mild antimemetic quality: individuals frequently express an inability to accurately describe the qualia produced by SCP-5737. Despite this, a number of indices have been developed both by the Foundation and by civilian organizations to estimate the degree of SCP-5737 expression in any given individual<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. Variability is also observed in emotional response to SCP-5737: while a majority of people (~60%) display no marked emotional response to the possibility of spiritual experience, the remaining 40% are evenly divided between individuals expressing openness and optimism regarding the possibility and those who claim such an experience has or would be significantly distressing for them. Typical methods of inducing spiritual experiences include the use of psychoactive substances, repetitive movements, and the recitation of creeds or songs, although spontaneous ones are also commonly reported.</p>\n<p>The presentation of SCP-5737 has been most extensively studied in <em>Homo sapiens</em>; however, ethological, paleo-anthropological, and paleontological research has revealed that it presents in similar ways in other species. The following table provides a generalized overview of major taxonomic groups in which evidence for SCP-5737 expression is present either behaviourally or physically: for more information, please see Document 5737-583-X4 (\u201cValidity and Ethology of Behavioural Markers for High-Penetrance SCP-5737 Expression Across the Tree of Life\u201d, by Foundation researchers Dr. T.I. Copeland, Dr. P.W. Goldschmid, and Assistant Researcher A. T. Zhang.)</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Taxonomic Group</th>\n<th>Behaviour/Documentation</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Homo sapiens</em></td>\n<td>Religious and spiritual behaviour in modern humans has been extensively documented. Approximately 93% of the current human population professes some degree of religious or spiritual belief; among the remaining 7% the majority also report at least one non-contextualized experience that aligns with sensations typical to SCP-5737. The recreational or ritual use of entheogens across diverse human cultures, even those with notable negative side effects, provides further evidence of the social significance placed upon expressions of SCP-5737.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Pan troglodytes</em></td>\n<td>Ritual behaviour is also well-documented in chimpanzee societies. The emotion-like states, symbolic information transmission, and metacognitive behaviour that are permissive of SCP-5737 expression are extensively evidenced. Pre-death and post-death care, as well as deliberate post-death silence, controlled vocalization, and observation of corpses indicate the presence of a death culture. Ritualized behaviours indicating respect and awe are also frequently directed towards water. At the onset of heavy rains, a \u201crain dance\u201d is performed involving rhythmic movements, repeated behaviours, and controlled vocalization matching religious rites of <em>Homo sapiens</em>; individualistic spiritual experiences are induced and expressed by behavioural displays and continuous observation resembling obeisance directed towards waterfalls and streambeds. These forms of pious expression are both individualized and normative, illustrating the qualitative nature of SCP-5737 expression.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</em></td>\n<td><em>H. s. neandenthalensis</em> is one of the best-known examples of non-human SCP-5737 expression both among the Foundation and the civilian population. Deliberate burial of the corpses of conspecifics, as well as the provision of grave goods, provide evidence a well-developed death culture. In particular, the inclusion among these grave goods of the bones of other animals and stone and bone items unusable as tools indicates that the metaphysical nature of these things was valued above the physical.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Loxodonta sp.</em></td>\n<td>Mourning behaviour in African elephants has been extensively documented, and individuals have been observed burying the corpses of deceased members of their kin groups, as well as, occasionally, unrelated animals including buffalos, cows, and humans. Some have been reported to observe the cycles of the moon, bathing preferentially upon the full moon and performing behaviours resembling obeisance, including the waving of branches and focussed observation, in the direction of a waxing moon. As SCP-5737-dependent behaviours act as a positive stimulus inducing or intensifying its expression in other individuals, the conviction with which multiple human subcultures believe African elephants are fully capable of religious and spiritual behaviour serves as an additional indicator of its expression in this genus.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arthropoda</td>\n<td>Cognition in arthropods is variable, in part because different arthropod groups display dramatically different social structures. The most developed cognitive abilities seem to be within the Hymenoptera: experimentation on <em>Apis</em> species illustrates the presence of the emotion-like states, symbolic information transmission, and metacognitive behaviour that are permissive of SCP-5737 expression. There is also controversy as to whether recently-translated writings from <em>Pseudomyrmex ferruginea</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> illustrate thought processes dependent on SCP-5737 or simply superficially similar. To date, full expression of SCP-5737 has only been observed in arthropod species or races that are themselves anomalous. See also documentation for <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4067\">SCP-4067</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ammonoidea</td>\n<td>See documentation for <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4246\">SCP-4246</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Therapoda</td>\n<td>See Addendum 5737-1.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5737-1:</strong> Paleontological evidence for SCP-5737 in therapods</p>\n<p>In primary investigation of SCP-5737\u2019s influence on metazoan evolution and cultural development, the Horizon Initiative was contacted for consultation, with particular research efforts focussed on the methodology by which they pursued the integration of themes from extant scriptures into a conceptually coherent whole known as the Universal Texts project. During discussions, Initiative representative S. Yilmaz informed Foundation representative Dr. T.I. Copeland that Foundation conjecture regarding SCP-5737 could be useful in contextualizing certain artifacts which the Initiative had contained in 1999.</p>\n<p>A Berriasian<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> paleontological dig site had retrieved multiple fossils that resembled deliberate engraving and embossing from a fluvial shale deposit and had published images of the fossils in the supplementary data of their preliminary results. Initiative webcrawlers identified potential anomalous activity and the fossils were taken into Initiative custody to be interpreted.

As I progressed in my research, I had been fearing - or hoping for - what felt like the inevitable approach of this day: that something would appear and prove to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the ontological naturalists were right, and metaphysical belief is objectively false. It is an ages-old war: is pure mechanism too cold and comfortless and inhuman? Is any sort of faith just self-delusion? It is clear why knowledge of SCP-5737 was so restricted, even though it bears no unforeseen threat; such a revelation would shake anybody to their core.</p>\n<p>So what are we, those with clearance to know this, to do? Ought we to doubt any belief we hold that has not been supported by extensive, rigorous, double-blind scientific study? Are we to discount the experience of any feeling that does not have a currently-available and strictly rational explanation? Are we to discount the experience of emotion at all? Such a worldview, although highly conservative and prone to Type II error, would serve as something of an inoculation against the effects of SCP-5737.</p>\n<p>And yet, it seems a miserable way to live. In consistent doubt of one\u2019s own ability to even perceive the world as it truly is, regardless of understanding. I am not a theologian, nor a ethologist, nor even a psychologist - I am a paleontologist, and have always considered myself somewhat detached from such philosophical questions. After all, the past is unchangeable, and what we have access to is merely a hugely-incomplete record of its physical processes. The mechanistic is the only view through which any kind of study is possible.</p>\n<p>Yet I can say with confidence that I am not among the resistant to SCP-5737. I have never professed a formal religion, but I have observed things that have taken away my breath, that I have felt myself unworthy to see: escarpments with bedding spanning hundreds of millions of years, that felt like looking down time itself, and acritarchs so perfectly and precisely formed, at such a small scale, that they seemed nearly impossible. Things that seemed very similar, qualia-wise, to the way my more religious colleagues speak of God.</p>\n<p>We, the Foundation, have since our inception been dedicated to the preservation of normalcy, as defined not in the mathematical sense but by our own, qualitative perceptions of the state of the world. Yet surely a truly scientific approach would make no claims as to normality. As well as we can measure, the anomalous and the non-anomalous exist with equal validity. The belief that there <em>is</em> a normal might not be supported by any other agency, and yet we are all willing to live and die in its name. I have heard that everyone worships something, and the only choice is what: perhaps that is ours. I say this not to condemn, nor to extol, merely to attempt to observe.</p>\n<p>What would the world have been like without SCP-5737? How much of what we think, feel, value can be attributed to its action? What traces has it left in our millions of years of history - and will it ever degrade? One thing every paleontologist knows with certainty is that his study cannot ever have control groups, or replications, or an <em>n</em> greater than 1; there has only been one history, and evolution winds the clock forwards but never winds it back. I may wonder what another world, and another normalcy, would have looked like until the day I die, and receive no more clarity than I have now.</p>\n<p>I suppose I will have to be content with that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Historically, SCP-5737 has been assumed non-anomalous due to its near-universal presence in humans, and I expect that many will conclude this document with that belief still firmly in place. As the description below addresses an issue of significant personal value to many, discretion is advised when reading.\n\n> \n\n> - Dr. Copeland, head researcher for SCP-5737\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-5737\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Explained\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Because of the extensive period of time elapsed between SCP-5737\u2019s occurrence and the present day, as well as the unacceptable risk of any method of ongoing containment causing an MK-Class \u201cEnd of Human Consciousness\u201d scenario, SCP-5737 is functionally uncontainable. Containment efforts are to focus on minimizing the effects of SCP-5737 expression among extant human cultures via the promotion of humanistic politics and maintenance of containment procedures associated with identified Groups of Interest. The existence of SCP-5737 is to be confirmed only to Level 4 and higher Foundation researchers; individuals without Level 4 clearance who become aware of SCP-5737 are to receive targeted amnesticization.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5737 is a hypothetical ontological shift, presumptively dated to the Ediacaran period (635-541 MYA), that affected the ancestral Nephrozoan[[footnote]]The clade Nephrozoa encompasses all animals with a true coelom, digestive tract, excretory organs, and nerve cords.[[/footnote]] and all descendent lineages. The suite of physiological characters resulting from SCP-5737 permit the emergence of the set of qualia commonly described as \u201cspiritual/religious experiences\u201d. As spiritual or spiritual-like practices have been observed in both [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4067 protostome] and deuterostome lineages, the influence of SCP-5737 is presumed plesiomorphic[[footnote]]Plesiomorphic characters are ancestral within a group of organisms, in contrast with apomorphic characters, which are more recent changes away from this ancestral state.[[/footnote]], and lineages in which spiritual-like practices are not present are hypothesized to have secondarily lost its influence. \n\n\n\nDue to the extremely widespread expression of SCP-5737 across bilaterian taxa and its universal expression across human cultures, several non-anomalous theories have been developed by civilian organizations as to the origin of its effects. These theories include SCP-5737 promoting social bonding and group cohesiveness, serving as a motivating force for the acquisition of resources and territory in early hominids, and being an emergent property at a certain level of cognitive development conferring no significant fitness benefits. However, the development by the Foundation of the Hume and Akiva scales has allowed accurate analysis of metaphysiological changes in organisms expressing SCP-5737-dependent behaviour, which permitted its anomalous nature to be determined.\n\n\n\nHuman susceptibility to SCP-5737 expression follows a normal distribution, with approximately 15% of the human population considered abnormally prone to spiritual experiences and approximately 10% considered abnormally resistant. Cultural factors explain more than half (55%) of this variation. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with or who meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder have a significantly higher likelihood of being resistant to SCP-5737\u2019s effects than the general population. Research into the heritability of SCP-5737 susceptibility has proven inconclusive due to heavy confounding from upbringing and culture. In humans, SCP-5737 displays a mild antimemetic quality: individuals frequently express an inability to accurately describe the qualia produced by SCP-5737. Despite this, a number of indices have been developed both by the Foundation and by civilian organizations to estimate the degree of SCP-5737 expression in any given individual[[footnote]]For more information, see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372782/ \u201cMeasuring Spirituality as a Universal Human Experience: A Review of Spirituality Questionnaires\u201d] by E.J. Meezenbroek et al.[[/footnote]]. Variability is also observed in emotional response to SCP-5737: while a majority of people (~60%) display no marked emotional response to the possibility of spiritual experience, the remaining 40% are evenly divided between individuals expressing openness and optimism regarding the possibility and those who claim such an experience has or would be significantly distressing for them. Typical methods of inducing spiritual experiences include the use of psychoactive substances, repetitive movements, and the recitation of creeds or songs, although spontaneous ones are also commonly reported.\n\n\n\nThe presentation of SCP-5737 has been most extensively studied in //Homo sapiens//; however, ethological, paleo-anthropological, and paleontological research has revealed that it presents in similar ways in other species. The following table provides a generalized overview of major taxonomic groups in which evidence for SCP-5737 expression is present either behaviourally or physically: for more information, please see Document 5737-583-X4 (\u201cValidity and Ethology of Behavioural Markers for High-Penetrance SCP-5737 Expression Across the Tree of Life\u201d, by Foundation researchers Dr. T.I. Copeland, Dr. P.W. Goldschmid, and Assistant Researcher A. T. Zhang.)\n\n\n\n||~ Taxonomic Group ||~ Behaviour/Documentation ||\n\n|| //Homo sapiens// || Religious and spiritual behaviour in modern humans has been extensively documented. Approximately 93% of the current human population professes some degree of religious or spiritual belief; among the remaining 7% the majority also report at least one non-contextualized experience that aligns with sensations typical to SCP-5737. The recreational or ritual use of entheogens across diverse human cultures, even those with notable negative side effects, provides further evidence of the social significance placed upon expressions of SCP-5737. ||\n\n|| //Pan troglodytes// || Ritual behaviour is also well-documented in chimpanzee societies. The emotion-like states, symbolic information transmission, and metacognitive behaviour that are permissive of SCP-5737 expression are extensively evidenced. Pre-death and post-death care, as well as deliberate post-death silence, controlled vocalization, and observation of corpses indicate the presence of a death culture. Ritualized behaviours indicating respect and awe are also frequently directed towards water. At the onset of heavy rains, a \u201crain dance\u201d is performed involving rhythmic movements, repeated behaviours, and controlled vocalization matching religious rites of //Homo sapiens//; individualistic spiritual experiences are induced and expressed by behavioural displays and continuous observation resembling obeisance directed towards waterfalls and streambeds. These forms of pious expression are both individualized and normative, illustrating the qualitative nature of SCP-5737 expression.||\n\n|| //Homo sapiens neanderthalensis// || //H. s. neandenthalensis// is one of the best-known examples of non-human SCP-5737 expression both among the Foundation and the civilian population. Deliberate burial of the corpses of conspecifics, as well as the provision of grave goods, provide evidence a well-developed death culture. In particular, the inclusion among these grave goods of the bones of other animals and stone and bone items unusable as tools indicates that the metaphysical nature of these things was valued above the physical.||\n\n|| //Loxodonta sp.// || Mourning behaviour in African elephants has been extensively documented, and individuals have been observed burying the corpses of deceased members of their kin groups, as well as, occasionally, unrelated animals including buffalos, cows, and humans. Some have been reported to observe the cycles of the moon, bathing preferentially upon the full moon and performing behaviours resembling obeisance, including the waving of branches and focussed observation, in the direction of a waxing moon. As SCP-5737-dependent behaviours act as a positive stimulus inducing or intensifying its expression in other individuals, the conviction with which multiple human subcultures believe African elephants are fully capable of religious and spiritual behaviour serves as an additional indicator of its expression in this genus. ||\n\n|| Arthropoda || Cognition in arthropods is variable, in part because different arthropod groups display dramatically different social structures. The most developed cognitive abilities seem to be within the Hymenoptera: experimentation on //Apis// species illustrates the presence of the emotion-like states, symbolic information transmission, and metacognitive behaviour that are permissive of SCP-5737 expression. There is also controversy as to whether recently-translated writings from //Pseudomyrmex ferruginea// [[footnote]]See [https://web.archive.org/web/20170721112310/http://interconnected.org/home/more/2007/03/acacia-seeds.html \"The Author of the Acacia Seeds\"] by U.K. Guin.[[/footnote]] illustrate thought processes dependent on SCP-5737 or simply superficially similar. To date, full expression of SCP-5737 has only been observed in arthropod species or races that are themselves anomalous.

During discussions, Initiative representative S. Yilmaz informed Foundation representative Dr. T.I. Copeland that Foundation conjecture regarding SCP-5737 could be useful in contextualizing certain artifacts which the Initiative had contained in 1999. \n\n\n\nA Berriasian[[footnote]]An age of the Early Cretaceous spanning 145-140 MYA.[[/footnote]] paleontological dig site had retrieved multiple fossils that resembled deliberate engraving and embossing from a fluvial shale deposit and had published images of the fossils in the supplementary data of their preliminary results. Initiative webcrawlers identified potential anomalous activity and the fossils were taken into Initiative custody to be interpreted.

As I progressed in my research, I had been fearing - or hoping for - what felt like the inevitable approach of this day: that something would appear and prove to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the ontological naturalists were right, and metaphysical belief is objectively false. It is an ages-old war: is pure mechanism too cold and comfortless and inhuman? Is any sort of faith just self-delusion? It is clear why knowledge of SCP-5737 was so restricted, even though it bears no unforeseen threat; such a revelation would shake anybody to their core.\n\n> \n\n> So what are we, those with clearance to know this, to do? Ought we to doubt any belief we hold that has not been supported by extensive, rigorous, double-blind scientific study? Are we to discount the experience of any feeling that does not have a currently-available and strictly rational explanation? Are we to discount the experience of emotion at all? Such a worldview, although highly conservative and prone to Type II error, would serve as something of an inoculation against the effects of SCP-5737.\n\n> \n\n> And yet, it seems a miserable way to live. In consistent doubt of one\u2019s own ability to even perceive the world as it truly is, regardless of understanding. I am not a theologian, nor a ethologist, nor even a psychologist - I am a paleontologist, and have always considered myself somewhat detached from such philosophical questions. After all, the past is unchangeable, and what we have access to is merely a hugely-incomplete record of its physical processes. The mechanistic is the only view through which any kind of study is possible. \n\n> \n\n> Yet I can say with confidence that I am not among the resistant to SCP-5737. I have never professed a formal religion, but I have observed things that have taken away my breath, that I have felt myself unworthy to see: escarpments with bedding spanning hundreds of millions of years, that felt like looking down time itself, and acritarchs so perfectly and precisely formed, at such a small scale, that they seemed nearly impossible. Things that seemed very similar, qualia-wise, to the way my more religious colleagues speak of God.\n\n> \n\n> We, the Foundation, have since our inception been dedicated to the preservation of normalcy, as defined not in the mathematical sense but by our own, qualitative perceptions of the state of the world. Yet surely a truly scientific approach would make no claims as to normality. As well as we can measure, the anomalous and the non-anomalous exist with equal validity. The belief that there //is// a normal might not be supported by any other agency, and yet we are all willing to live and die in its name. I have heard that everyone worships something, and the only choice is what: perhaps that is ours. I say this not to condemn, nor to extol, merely to attempt to observe.\n\n> \n\n> What would the world have been like without SCP-5737? How much of what we think, feel, value can be attributed to its action? What traces has it left in our millions of years of history - and will it ever degrade? One thing every paleontologist knows with certainty is that his study cannot ever have control groups, or replications, or an //n// greater than 1; there has only been one history, and evolution winds the clock forwards but never winds it back. I may wonder what another world, and another normalcy, would have looked like until the day I die, and receive no more clarity than I have now.\n\n> \n\n> I suppose I will have to be content with that.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-5736]]] | SCP-5737 | [[[SCP-5738]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a> author=OriCat]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Name:** sun.jpg\n\n> **Author:** [[*user sunnyclockwork]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-5736", "scp-5738", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-5737", "scp_number": 5737, "series": "explained", "tags": ["5000", "_cc", "_licensebox", "antimemetic", "dinosaur", "empathic", "explained", "historical", "horizon-initiative", "k-class-scenario", "religious", "scp", "uncontained"], "title": "SCP-5737", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5737"}, "SCP-6077": {"created_at": "2021-11-01T19:18:00", "creator": "pr0m37h3um", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:18:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:21:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:21:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:21:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:25:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:35:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:36:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "", "date": "2021-11-01T19:36:00"}, {"author": "pr0m37h3um", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pr0m37h3um", "comment": "Added tags: _licensebox, co-authored, esoteric-class, extraterrestrial, scp, transmission.

Is there anything else you need me for?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> There is only one thing left, that would require directorial approval. Will Ms. Neuhaus be amnesticized or monitored?</p>\n<p><strong>Weld:</strong> Monitored.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> I think Reintegration requires a reason to exempt somebody from amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Weld:</strong> <em>(hurried)</em> Hewlett should know why. Call me later if anything else comes up. <em>(Call ends)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hewlett:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> I believe he is concerned about the mirror neurons being able to bypass some of the amnestics effects. This would increase the likelihood of her noticing something is wrong, so it would be simpler to choose to monitor from the start.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> Will the Reintegration Committee handle the monitoring.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hewlett:</strong> Let me check\u2026yep. That leaves only the re-evaluation as an issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> Having someone from this Site give their perspective would be helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hewlett:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> It would, but as far as I could check, nobody sees themself responsible for her. Like a lot of older skips, every process with 6192 has been automated. Even the Psychology staff rotates.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> As is standard with Higher Mental Communicators.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> You don't operate a Site without somebody having a closer look at the humans contained there. I can search through the Site Archive to find who that person is for this Site.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hewlett:</strong> You <em>could</em>, but we don't have the time for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> In that case we'll have to start from zero. Make every test as if she just was contained and compare it to whatever old material we can find.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hewlett:</strong> What would this entail?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> From Ms. Neuhaus' file, a brain scan to confirm mirror neuron density and the activity that originally alerted the Foundation of SCP-6192 behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> \u2026There was no telepathy test?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> Yes. Although to be fair, the Higher Mental Transcommunicator protocols didn't exist then as they do now.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> That's no excuse. It should have been rectified as soon as the protocol was invented.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hewlett:</strong> You'll see this a lot when dealing with older skips. Containment Procedures are followed to the letter until no one knows their original intent. Until nobody's left who cares for necessary updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vasquez:</strong> Well, we can rectify that now.

M.

This can allow a person to mirror thought patterns with varying accuracy.[[/footnote]], Ms. F. M. Neuhaus has been classified as a Higher Mental Transcommunicator. Higher Mental Transcommunicators are persons with the ability to connect mentally with other life forms in this measure in order to exchange different information. This ability is colloquially called \"[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-121-de telepathy]\". It was confirmed that she possessed at minimum emphatic telepathy upon her original containment.\n\n\n\nDue to the \"telepathy\" provided by SCP-6192 being reliant on body language and facial expressions to accurately mirror thought patterns, it has been reclassified as Explained.

Is there anything else you need me for?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Richter:** There is only one thing left, that would require directorial approval. Will Ms. Neuhaus be amnesticized or monitored?\n\n\n\n**Weld:** Monitored.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** I think Reintegration requires a reason to exempt somebody from amnestics.\n\n\n\n**Weld:** //(hurried)// Hewlett should know why. Call me later if anything else comes up. //(Call ends)//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** //(sighs)// I believe he is concerned about the mirror neurons being able to bypass some of the amnestics effects. This would increase the likelihood of her noticing something is wrong, so it would be simpler to choose to monitor from the start.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Richter:** Will the Reintegration Committee handle the monitoring.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** Let me check...yep. That leaves only the re-evaluation as an issue.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** Having someone from this Site give their perspective would be helpful.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** //(sighs)// It would, but as far as I could check, nobody sees themself responsible for her. Like a lot of older skips, every process with 6192 has been automated. Even the Psychology staff rotates.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Richter:** As is standard with Higher Mental Communicators.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** You don't operate a Site without somebody having a closer look at the humans contained there. I can search through the Site Archive to find who that person is for this Site.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** You //could//, but we don't have the time for that.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** In that case we'll have to start from zero. Make every test as if she just was contained and compare it to whatever old material we can find.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** What would this entail?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Richter:** From Ms. Neuhaus' file, a brain scan to confirm mirror neuron density and the activity that originally alerted the Foundation of SCP-6192 behaviour.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** ...There was no telepathy test?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Richter:** Yes. Although to be fair, the Higher Mental Transcommunicator protocols didn't exist then as they do now.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** That's no excuse. It should have been rectified as soon as the protocol was invented.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** You'll see this a lot when dealing with older skips. Containment Procedures are followed to the letter until no one knows their original intent. Until nobody's left who cares for necessary updates.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** Well, we can rectify that now. So we need a brain scan and a telepathy test.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** Is the brain scan really necessary?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** Well, it doesn't hurt. And it's better to be on the safer side with evaluations.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** Right.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Richter:** I can conduct the scan and the test. I'm familiar with the HMT protocol, we just need to confirm her abilities are in line with SCP-6192-EX, correct?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** Yes, we can go through it now, to see what applies to this case.\n\n\n\n//The rest of this discussion is classified under Clearance 4/Higher Mental Transcommunicators.//\n\n\n\n= **<End Log>**\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[html]]\n\n\n\n<style>\n\n\n\nhr.style14 {\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0width: 600px;\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0border: 0;\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0height: 1px;\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0background-image: -o-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"style14\" align=\"center\">\n\n\n\n[[/html]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nA Correlation of SCP-6192-1-EX to SCP-6192 could be confirmed through a brain scan and a Higher Mental Transcommunicator test.

At the time of initial containment, the machinery contained approximately 2.8 liters of a blue-colored liquid, designated SCP-6384-A. Approximately 3.5 liters of a different green-colored liquid, designated SCP-6384-B, were discovered hidden in the vehicle's trunk.</p>\n<p>Both substances possess unknown chemical composition of presumed anomalous origin. For further information concerning SCP-6384-A and SCP-6384-B, see Addendum 02.</p>\n<p>During initial containment of SCP-6384, two adult males named \"Vernon Douglas\" and \"Ian Zambrano\" were identified as responsible for the phenomenon. Interrogation revealed Douglas to be the self-confessed inventor of substances SCP-6384-A and SCP-6384-B; they were designated as SCP-6384-1 due to their involvement. Zambrano's relation to the SCP substances could not be ascertained; they were designated as PoI-6384.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 01:</strong> SCP-6384 was discovered in damaged condition on March 25, 1995 by civilian law enforcement in Slipchester, Nevada, USA. Preliminary examination of SCP-6384-A and SCP-6384-B revealed their anomalous composition. Undercover Foundation operatives recognized the anomaly and transferred the vehicle and compounds to Site-56 for containment; amnestics were administered to civilian law enforcement as necessary.</p>\n<p>Foundation agents reviewed the collision report and identified SCP-6384-1 and PoI-6384 as the two occupants; Mobile Task Force Epsilon-33 (\"Ford Pintos\") was dispatched to retrieve both individuals from a local hospital.

Usually we'd be able to identify their makeup rather quickly through our methods, but we've faced quite some difficulty with this\u2026 \"antifreeze\", as you call it. Such a complex substance requires a high amount of intellect and <em>years</em> of academic study to successfully formulate.

I'd write down the time and date of every test I'd do where I'd drink the stuff\u2026 <em>before</em> drinking it, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-6384-1:</strong> I'd get knocked out for hours, sometimes an entire day after drinking even a tablespoon, I formed another habit of writing the time I'd wake up in my journal; when I'd do that, I'd read over past journal entries going: \"I don't remember any of this\". <em>That's</em> how I knew it worked.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> What happened to these journals?

Anyway, I knocked on the door, and my father answered. I almost thought he'd moved away, honestly. He let us stay for a few days, which also surprised me.</p>\n<p><strong>Solana:</strong> You thought he wouldn't let you back into his life?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-6384:</strong> That was a possibility.

During this era, it remained in the custody of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where two accidents involving it took place during sub-criticality experimentation (<em>See Addendum 666.1</em>). The several deaths which occurred as part of these incidents earned SCP-666-EX the colloquial monicker \u201cdemon core\u201d.</p>\n<p>Following the accidents, employees of the laboratory began reporting several anomalous occurrences attributed to SCP-666-EX. A report compiling these events was subsequently compiled and distributed to the Foundation<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> (<em>See Addendum 666.2</em>). After agents were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory for investigation, SCP-666-EX was placed into Foundation custody.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 666.1:</strong> Experimentation Overview</p>\n<p>It is suspected that the laboratory wanted the Foundation to remain ignorant of the initial experimentation which resulted in the deaths of their personnel. Agents dispatched to the facility were able to uncover the following points of interest regarding the experiments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The goal of the experiments was to determine the limits a nuclear core could be taken to before criticality is reached, primarily undergone by surrounding the cores with objects capable of reflecting neutrons. This is a highly dangerous practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Little to no safety precautions were taken during the experiments. Nuclear cores such as SCP-666-EX were likely brought to near-criticality on several occasions, almost causing significant damage to the laboratory and casualties if mistakes were made.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Small mistakes during the experiments were likely the primary cause of the multiple reported incidents in the facility.

The object itself has been secured in a standard nuclear-certified containment chamber by the Department of Nuclear Studies[[footnote]] While normally charged with ensuring the continued operation of the Foundation's nuclear stockpiles, the department will occasionally oversee the containment of nuclear anomalies. [[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nAs the object has been reclassified to Explained, no further procedures for its containment have been deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-666-EX is a plutonium device designed as the core for the third atomic bomb intended to be launched at the end of World War II as part of the Manhattan Project.\n\n\n\nAs only two atomic bombs were utilized in the conflict, SCP-666-EX initially remained unused, but was deemed a useful asset for early experimentation concerning nuclear weaponry and avoided being harvested for its plutonium. During this era, it remained in the custody of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where two accidents involving it took place during sub-criticality experimentation (//See Addendum 666.1//). The several deaths which occurred as part of these incidents earned SCP-666-EX the colloquial monicker \u201cdemon core\u201d.\n\n\n\nFollowing the accidents, employees of the laboratory began reporting several anomalous occurrences attributed to SCP-666-EX. A report compiling these events was subsequently compiled and distributed to the Foundation[[footnote]] Due to the Foundation's assistance with the Manhattan Project, the lab's personnel were familiar with the organization and its activities. [[/footnote]] (//See Addendum 666.2//). After agents were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory for investigation, SCP-666-EX was placed into Foundation custody.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 666.1:** Experimentation Overview\n\n\n\nIt is suspected that the laboratory wanted the Foundation to remain ignorant of the initial experimentation which resulted in the deaths of their personnel. Agents dispatched to the facility were able to uncover the following points of interest regarding the experiments:\n\n\n\n* The goal of the experiments was to determine the limits a nuclear core could be taken to before criticality is reached, primarily undergone by surrounding the cores with objects capable of reflecting neutrons. This is a highly dangerous practice.\n\n\n\n* Little to no safety precautions were taken during the experiments. Nuclear cores such as SCP-666-EX were likely brought to near-criticality on several occasions, almost causing significant damage to the laboratory and casualties if mistakes were made.\n\n\n\n* Small mistakes during the experiments were likely the primary cause of the multiple reported incidents in the facility. The labaratory was lucky to have avoided both sustaining more damage or lost more personnel as part of these incidents.\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of these experiments, the dispatched agents considered it unlikely that the United States government would have officially sanctioned their occurence.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 666.2:** Compiled Report\n\n\n\nThe following is the report provided to the Foundation regarding the anomalous phenomena reported to have occurred due to SCP-666-EX:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[size 200%]] **TOP-SECRET** [[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[size 110%]] **REPORT ON PARANORMAL PHENOMENA CONCERNING THE \"DEMON CORE\"** [[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nFollowing the events of May 21, 1946[[footnote]] Date of the second incident involving SCP-666-EX.

The inner structure was reported to comprise of a non-Euclidean hallway connecting at least 100 rooms on each side.</p>\n<p>It is currently hypothesized that SCP-6966-EX was merely a hallucination stemming from exposure of potential observers to psychoactive byproducts of a recent leak from the on-site parachemical labs, which has since been safely contained. Due to the lack of physical and non-anecdotal evidence for the existence of such a structure, SCP-6966 has been reclassified as Explained.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 6966.01: Discovery</strong><br/>\nSCP-6966 was first identified and reported by a security guard employed by Site-39, Casimir Anders, during a routine night patrol of the premises. Mr. Anders claims to have found the structure's door slightly ajar, and investigated further as part of his security duties.</p>\n<p>Upon exiting SCP-6966, Mr. Anders reported the structure to Site-39 personnel. The full report is currently filed <a href=\"javascript:;\">here</a>. Attached below is an audio log of an interview held as part of the reporting process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>CARTER:</strong> Good morning, Mr. Anders. I'm Dr. Carter, and I'll be taking your statements on that anomaly you reported earlier this morning. Could you describe what exactly it was you saw inside that structure?</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> Okay so, as I said in the report, it was a very long hallway leading to god-knows-where. It was dark as shit, too, couldn't see anything without my flashlight. I don't know if this is any use to you folks, but that hallway looked more like an old hotel than anything you'd find in the Site proper, but not as old as the one I have to live in until they finish processing my employment or whatever it is Administration does with new hands on deck.</p>\n<p><strong>CARTER:</strong> <em>[Coughs.]</em> Continue with your statements on the <em>anomaly</em>, please.</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> Right, right. So anyway, uh, there were doors with names on them on both sides of the hallway, but regular ones. Not the ones with keycard scanners. As a security guard I gotta check whether everything's in working order, watch out for intruders, all that noise, y'know? I didn't see any big signs yelling 'Restricted Area', and the doors weren't locked either, so I went in one of the rooms. Kinda small, had a bed with someone sleeping in it.</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> Now I thought to myself, 'shit, did I accidentally walk into some staff dorm?' before I remembered that Site-39 doesn't have onsite dorms. So now, I got ready to get an earful and a disciplinary from whoever's nap I might've interrupted, and then, nothing. I got out of there without any reaction from him.</p>\n<p><strong>CARTER:</strong> I take it this was the same for the other rooms?</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> Most of them were. If the bed wasn't empty, then it was being used by random people who I've never seen before. I went further into the hallway, and then I start seeing names I <em>do</em> know on those doors. Mostly the folks at security. The funny thing is I know some of these guys are supposed to be on patrol or nightwatch duty, so the fact that I see them lying in the beds really unsettles me.</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> Eventually I decide to man up and take a closer look at one of the people in the beds. You know those ancient Egyptian coffins? These guys looked a lot like those things, from the unusual straightness of the body to the crossing of the arms 'Wakanda forever' style. Now at this point, I'm really beginning to question whether these guys are actually alive, because like, I don't care who you are, once you conk out you're bound to move at least <em>something</em>. It's sorta like uh, that uncanny valley effect, when you look at a wax figure or an extremely detailed mannequin. Shit's unnerving.</p>\n<p><strong>CARTER:</strong> You mentioned your doubts on whether these entities were alive. What compelled you to infer that they weren't deceased?</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> Their chests. They rhythmically heaved up and down the entire time I was there. You could say they're just paralyzed or comatose, but \u2014 and this is the creepiest part \u2014 there was no air current when I checked their noses and mouths. Those 10 seconds were the tensest I've ever had throughout my career in security. I would've tried to check for a pulse as well, but y'know. Too risky. I already half-expected them to suddenly wake up while I had my fingers under their nose, so to feel around their wrists for a pulse\u2026 I don't think so.</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> I checked a few other rooms to make sure that guy wasn't an outlier or something, and whaddaya know? Every room that wasn't empty had one of these no-breathing sleepers in them. I don't think any of those things were really human, in hindsight.</p>\n<p><strong>CARTER:</strong> I see. I must say, you're taking this unusually well.</p>\n<p><strong>ANDERS:</strong> I mean, this sort of stuff's in the job description, no? First thing they told me at orientation was that being a security guard at a Foundation Site means seeing weird shit from time to time.

The inner structure was reported to comprise of a non-Euclidean hallway connecting at least 100 rooms on each side. \n\n\n\nIt is currently hypothesized that SCP-6966-EX was merely a hallucination stemming from exposure of potential observers to psychoactive byproducts of a recent leak from the on-site parachemical labs, which has since been safely contained. Due to the lack of physical and non-anecdotal evidence for the existence of such a structure, SCP-6966 has been reclassified as Explained.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 6966.01: Discovery** \n\nSCP-6966 was first identified and reported by a security guard employed by Site-39, Casimir Anders, during a routine night patrol of the premises. Mr. Anders claims to have found the structure's door slightly ajar, and investigated further as part of his security duties. \n\n\n\nUpon exiting SCP-6966, Mr. Anders reported the structure to Site-39 personnel. The full report is currently filed [# here]. Attached below is an audio log of an interview held as part of the reporting process.\n\n\n\n> ----\n\n> = \u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n> ----\n\n> **CARTER:** Good morning, Mr. Anders. I'm Dr. Carter, and I'll be taking your statements on that anomaly you reported earlier this morning. Could you describe what exactly it was you saw inside that structure?\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** Okay so, as I said in the report, it was a very long hallway leading to god-knows-where. It was dark as shit, too, couldn't see anything without my flashlight. I don't know if this is any use to you folks, but that hallway looked more like an old hotel than anything you'd find in the Site proper, but not as old as the one I have to live in until they finish processing my employment or whatever it is Administration does with new hands on deck.\n\n> \n\n> **CARTER:** //[Coughs.]// Continue with your statements on the //anomaly//, please.\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** Right, right. So anyway, uh, there were doors with names on them on both sides of the hallway, but regular ones. Not the ones with keycard scanners. As a security guard I gotta check whether everything's in working order, watch out for intruders, all that noise, y'know? I didn't see any big signs yelling 'Restricted Area', and the doors weren't locked either, so I went in one of the rooms. Kinda small, had a bed with someone sleeping in it.\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** Now I thought to myself, 'shit, did I accidentally walk into some staff dorm?' before I remembered that Site-39 doesn't have onsite dorms. So now, I got ready to get an earful and a disciplinary from whoever's nap I might've interrupted, and then, nothing. I got out of there without any reaction from him.\n\n> \n\n> **CARTER:** I take it this was the same for the other rooms?\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** Most of them were. If the bed wasn't empty, then it was being used by random people who I've never seen before. I went further into the hallway, and then I start seeing names I //do// know on those doors. Mostly the folks at security. The funny thing is I know some of these guys are supposed to be on patrol or nightwatch duty, so the fact that I see them lying in the beds really unsettles me. \n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** Eventually I decide to man up and take a closer look at one of the people in the beds. You know those ancient Egyptian coffins? These guys looked a lot like those things, from the unusual straightness of the body to the crossing of the arms 'Wakanda forever' style. Now at this point, I'm really beginning to question whether these guys are actually alive, because like, I don't care who you are, once you conk out you're bound to move at least //something//. It's sorta like uh, that uncanny valley effect, when you look at a wax figure or an extremely detailed mannequin. Shit's unnerving. \n\n> \n\n> **CARTER:** You mentioned your doubts on whether these entities were alive. What compelled you to infer that they weren't deceased?\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** Their chests. They rhythmically heaved up and down the entire time I was there. You could say they're just paralyzed or comatose, but -- and this is the creepiest part -- there was no air current when I checked their noses and mouths. Those 10 seconds were the tensest I've ever had throughout my career in security. I would've tried to check for a pulse as well, but y'know. Too risky. I already half-expected them to suddenly wake up while I had my fingers under their nose, so to feel around their wrists for a pulse... I don't think so.\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** I checked a few other rooms to make sure that guy wasn't an outlier or something, and whaddaya know? Every room that wasn't empty had one of these no-breathing sleepers in them. I don't think any of those things were really human, in hindsight.\n\n> \n\n> **CARTER:** I see. I must say, you're taking this unusually well.\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** I mean, this sort of stuff's in the job description, no? First thing they told me at orientation was that being a security guard at a Foundation Site means seeing weird shit from time to time. We have training for this sort of scenario.\n\n> \n\n> **CARTER:** That aside, did you manage to reach an end to the hallway? Or get a count of the rooms?\n\n> \n\n> **ANDERS:** I didn't see any sort of ending to the hallway. My flashlight only has so much range. As for the rooms, I counted about 100 of them on my left before I gave up and headed out the way I came from, so that's about 200 at least?\n\n> \n\n> **CARTER:** Very well, thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Anders. \n\n> ----\n\n> = \u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n> ----\n\n\n\nSite-39 staff were unable to locate any such structure as described by Mr. Anders, who could not be contacted for follow-up investigations after this interview. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++++ **[END OF FILE]**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[size 90%]]\n\n\n\n{{log-in}}\n\n\n\n{{> LOADING SCIP.NET LOGIN PROTOCOLS\u2026}}\n\n\n\n{{login: reyes-l-01622}}\n\n\n\n{{> REMEMBER: IMPERSONATION OF PERSONNEL IS A PUNISHABLE OFFENSE.}}\n\n\n\n{{password: omne-vetus-novabatur}}\n\n\n\n{{> IDENTITY VERIFIED.

SCP-711-4 is a pair of small stereophones that comes equipped with SCP-711-3, and allows a single user to listen to the sounds produced by SCP-711-3.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 711-1:** Events predicted by SCP-711 (//NOTE: SCP-711 is an American adolescent, and has a memory centered around popular culture and American history, as well as events closer to his time.// - Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n--Early 1970s - Future President Richard Nixon will be involved in a scandal, causing his impeachment--\n\n--Mid 1970s - A new wave of music labeled \"disco\" will become popular, but will \"die\" later on--\n\n--Mid 1970s - The Vietnam war will end--\n\n--Early 1980s - Film star Ronald Reagan will be elected President of the United States--\n\n--Late 1990s - Future President \"Bill Clinton\" will be in a scandal with an unmarried woman--\n\n--2000 - \"George W. Bush\", son of \"George Bush\", will be elected president of the United States--\n\n--September 11, 2001 - \"Terrorists\" of the Muslim religion will fly a plane into the \"World Trade Center\" causing \"both towers\" [sic] to collapse--\n\n--Early 2000s - The United States will be involved in a \"war on terror\" with the Republic of Iraq--\n\n--Mid 2000s - A large tsunami wave will strike southern Asia \"right after Christmas\"--\n\n--2008 - The United States will elect its first Negro president, \"Barack Hussein Obama\"--\n\n\n\n**Addendum 711-2:** Dr. Xyank of the [[[SCP-1780|Temporal Anomalies Department]]] has made multiple requests to return SCP-711 back to the point in time from which it claims to have been displaced. All requests have been denied.\n\n\n\n//We don't need to contain this person for no reason. He's verified. Let me take him home.// - Dr. Xyank\n\n\n\n**Addendum 711-3:** //SCP-711 has finally died. We were able to locate the exact time and place he was displaced (although all of our instruments showed no change). I don't know if this was a coincidence or not, but he was displaced at the exact same moment his older self's heart stopped.// - Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n//I hope you're all very proud of yourselves.// - Dr. Xyank\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-1780", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-711-EX", "scp_number": 711, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_licensebox", "alive", "delta-t", "explained", "future", "humanoid", "neutralized", "safe", "sapient", "scp", "thad-xyank"], "title": "SCP-711-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-711-ex"}, "SCP-7166": {"created_at": "2022-07-31T21:02:00", "creator": "WhoIsCthulhu", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "WhoIsCthulhu", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whoiscthulhu", "comment": "Added tags: 7000.

This phenomenon does not appear to affect all victims of lighting strikes, but SCP-7166 has been found to occur at higher frequencies if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The individual is struck by lightning, but survives,</li>\n<li>The individual retains higher brain functions,</li>\n<li>The individual resumes everyday activities after recovering from the lightning strike (e.g. work, leisure, family, etc.), and</li>\n<li>These activities place the individual outdoors.</li>\n</ul>\nIndividuals who meet these criteria, designated SCP-7166-1, will become significantly more likely to experience lightning strikes. This effect appears to be cumulative with repeated strikes, as individuals who survive more than two strikes become far more likely to experience a third strike, and so on. This effect will only demanifest following either SCP-7166-1's cessation of outdoor activities, loss of higher brain functions, or death.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<hr/>\n<p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #444\">Dr. Sanderson, come on.

In the event an individual survives multiple strikes within their lifetime, they are to be questioned, in order to ascertain any similarities between instances.\n\n\n\nIf any underlying cause for SCP-7166 is discovered, research into possible methods of neutralization is to be prioritized.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7166 is a phenomenon affecting individuals who are struck by lightning. This phenomenon does not appear to affect all victims of lighting strikes, but SCP-7166 has been found to occur at higher frequencies if:\n\n\n\n* The individual is struck by lightning, but survives,\n\n* The individual retains higher brain functions,\n\n* The individual resumes everyday activities after recovering from the lightning strike (e.g. work, leisure, family, etc.), and\n\n* These activities place the individual outdoors.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who meet these criteria, designated SCP-7166-1, will become significantly more likely to experience lightning strikes. This effect appears to be cumulative with repeated strikes, as individuals who survive more than two strikes become far more likely to experience a third strike, and so on. This effect will only demanifest following either SCP-7166-1's cessation of outdoor activities, loss of higher brain functions, or death.\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n----\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n##444|Dr. Sanderson, come on.

It was not the King that killed you. It was life. It was the meaningless twisting of fate that broke my heart. And what I've been doing isn't right. The King is a mindless thing, not even capable of consciousness, but when I blamed Him for you, I gave Him shape within your body. I gave Him form.

No anomalous activity or allegiance was found. This prompted further investigation into SCP-726-EX to determine if anomalous properties were present in the object.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> Chambers.</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> Kirby.</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> I assume you know why we're here.</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> I read your email. What's your issue with my dowsing rod?</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> I don't think it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> Bullshit. It works. I've seen it with my own two eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> Have you actually tested the damn thing?</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> Of course I have. It pointed out anomalies with no problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> Take a look at this.</p>\n<p><em>[Kirby places a file on the table. Chambers reaches forward to grab it.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> PoI-1221 came back clean. They're as baseline as it gets. Only thing anomalous about them is how much he sweat when we questioned him about the kids.</p>\n<p><em>[Chambers rifles through the attached files.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> That doesn't change the fact that this thing works.</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> You tested it in a facility full of anomalies. Of course it's going to point at one, it's a fucking dowsing rod. Those things are pseudoscience at best and shmuck-bait at worst, and those kids got played for schmucks. What's worse is we're getting played for schmucks now because of your insistence that it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> Then how do you explain how they got in here?</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> Anybody can wander onto the top level of the Site. It's by the highway, for crying out loud. Just admit you were wrong about the thing and we can all move on.</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> You're telling me this was all a big coincidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Chambers:</strong> But\u2026 I saw it respond to anomalies right in front of my eyes!</p>\n<p><strong>Kirby:</strong> Oh geez.

Initial communication with SCP-7474-1 established that it had not been harmed by the gunfire, and that it was willing to co-operate with the Foundation. SCP-7474-1 was then transported to Interview Room 24B and Dr Kowal arranged to interview the entity, from behind reinforced glass.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Hello, my name is Dr. Edna Kowal.

I\u2019d like to start by apologising for how you were treated by those soldiers earlier. I can promise you, you\u2019ll not be harmed here, we\u2019re much better prepared to deal with situations like this than those soldiers were. Although I will ask that you not spray anyone again, humans generally find that experience unpleasant.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> YES, I AM NOW AWARE. I ACCESSED YOUR RADIO SIGNALS FROM MY CRAFT AFTER THE INCIDENT AND LEARNED YOUR METHOD OF SPEECH. YOURS CONSISTS OF VIBRATING THE AIR AT EACH OTHER, RATHER THAN DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER VIA THE EJACULATION OF SPORES. INEFFICIENT.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> I see. Excuse me for asking the obvious, but can you tell me what exactly you are?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> NO</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> No?

It was hoped that by observing SCP-7474-1\u2019s attempts to repair the craft they would learn more of its function and mechanisms. Thus far, Dr. Warner and his team have been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The goal of this interview is to attempt to extract information from SCP-7474-1 regarding its technology, in order to assist Dr. Warner\u2019s efforts to understand the operation of SCP-7474.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Hey Dash One, how\u2019s it going?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> THINGS ARE WELL. I HAVE IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED THE ERROR WHICH CAUSED MY VESSEL TO CRASH. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CRASH CAUSED MULTIPLE OTHER ERRORS WHICH WILL TAKE TIME TO FIX.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Yeah, crashes will tend to do that. But listen, you can\u2019t go getting your hopes up. Even if you finish fixing your vessel, we can\u2019t let you leave, you know that.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> INQUIRY. WHY.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> I\u2019m sorry Dash One, but that\u2019s just not possible, at least not yet. Maybe if you were willing to help us out, explain how your ship works?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> NO. THAT IS NOT MY CHOICE TO MAKE AND I WILL NOT BETRAY MY PEOPLE.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> I can respect that. But I\u2019m sure your people wouldn\u2019t want you to be stuck here, they probably miss you as much as you miss them. I can promise you, we won\u2019t use anything you tell us against you or your people. In fact, I could probably even arrange a trade, if there\u2019s anything we have that could help you or your people, in exchange for any anomalous tech you could share?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> I CANNOT DO THAT. I AM NOT ANOMALOUS AND NEITHER IS MY TECHNOLOGY.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Look, Dash One, you know I like you and I can understand that you want your freedom. But you\u2019re certainly not human, and hell, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d even want to be human if you could.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> I KNOW. YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME. ANOMALIES ARE DEFINED WITHIN THE FOUNDATION CHARTER AS OBJECTS, ENTITIES OR CONCEPTS WHICH VIOLATE THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE. YOU FEAR THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE UNPREDICATBLE, AND UNPREDICTABILITY MEANS DANGER.I DO NOT VIOLATE THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Huh. Y\u2019know, there\u2019s a lot of physicists that would disagree with you there.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> THEY WOULD BE WRONG.

MY CULTURE FORBIDS ME FROM SHARING MY KNOWLEDGE. YOU KNOW THIS.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Well, we\u2019re at a bit of an impasse here then, buddy. Even if you could prove you and your vessel are obeying physics, the Foundation isn\u2019t going to be happy about just letting you leave. Especially if you won\u2019t let them know how all your shit works.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> INQUIRY. IS THIS NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.

I still have bosses, I still have to do my job, I still have to try and keep humanity safe.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> I THOUGHT BY NOW YOU WOULD KNOW THAT I AM NOT A THREAT TO HUMANITY.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> C\u2019mon Dash One, you know I didn\u2019t mean it like that.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7474-1:</strong> I WOULD LIKE TO BE ALONE WITH MY VESSEL NOW.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Fine.

But frankly, this is ridiculous.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> I know, I thought the same thing at first. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and it actually makes a lot of sense. If SCP-7474 and SCP-7474-1 actually do obey the laws of physics, then we\u2019ve no right to keep them in containment.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> So what, we\u2019re just meant to abandon the project to replicate its interstellar craft? We\u2019re supposed to abandon <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6240\">Dr. Fluv\u2019s soul</a>, and the souls of god knows how many others? It\u2019s all very well having the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6695\">fuel</a> if we don\u2019t have a way of building a craft that can actually use it effectively.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Kowal raises her hands in a conciliatory gesture.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> Come on Otto, that\u2019s not what I meant and you know it. I\u2019m just suggesting we take a different tack, there\u2019s other anomalies we could look to for clues on building an interstellar craft of our own. Besides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re making any progress in understanding SCP-7474, it\u2019s been months and we\u2019re just as clueless as when we started.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> This is nuts. It goes against Foundation principals, we are a scientific organisation, it makes no sense to stop pursuing knowledge. Think of the good we could do if we understood the mechanics of its craft, or even how its biology functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> You\u2019re wrong. The Foundation isn\u2019t a scientific organisation, and those aren\u2019t our principles. Sure, we\u2019re scientists and we try to learn all we can from the anomalies we contain, but our principles above all are to Secure, Contain and Protect. Holding an intelligent and non-anomalous being hostage because we want it to tell us its secrets doesn\u2019t fit those goals. Hell, if a human had invented something we didn\u2019t understand, we wouldn\u2019t hold them prisoner.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> That\u2019s different and you know it. I mean, come on, you can\u2019t tell me that thing doesn\u2019t violate normalcy, just look at it!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> You might have a point if it wanted to move to the suburbs, but SCP-7474 just wants to go back home, and it\u2019s not violating any sort of normalcy there.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> Yes, go back home and take with it any chance we have of figuring out its technology. When the Foundation found it, it was in the hands of the US military. If it\u2019s not anomalous, then protocol would be to return it to the custody of those who had the SCP object last. Is that what you want, to hand it over to those idiots?</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Kowal sighs</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> We\u2019re going in circles here. Otto, just try to talk to SCP-7474. Get to know it and you\u2019ll see its no threat to anyone, and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re making any headway with your experiments anyway. Let it go, and we can focus this department\u2019s efforts somewhere we can actually do some good.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> I\u2019m sorry, but no. It\u2019s obvious we aren\u2019t going to agree on this, I say we kick this up the chain, ask the O5 for a ruling.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> The O5? They don\u2019t have time to deal with one wrongly imprisoned alien and you know it, it\u2019d be months before we heard back, if ever.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Warner shrugs</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> You got a better idea?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> What if I could prove to you that SCP-7474 wasn\u2019t anomalous?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Warner:</strong> Then I guess, hypothetically, we\u2019d have to reclassify it as Explained. That doesn\u2019t answer what we\u2019d do with it though, even if we can\u2019t hold it as an anomaly I\u2019m not just going to let a working interstellar spacecraft fly off.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kowal:</strong> We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.

I can promise you, you\u2019ll not be harmed here, we\u2019re much better prepared to deal with situations like this than those soldiers were. Although I will ask that you not spray anyone again, humans generally find that experience unpleasant.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7474-1:** YES, I AM NOW AWARE.

Besides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re making any progress in understanding SCP-7474, it\u2019s been months and we\u2019re just as clueless as when we started.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Warner:** This is nuts. It goes against Foundation principals, we are a scientific organisation, it makes no sense to stop pursuing knowledge. Think of the good we could do if we understood the mechanics of its craft, or even how its biology functions. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** You\u2019re wrong. The Foundation isn\u2019t a scientific organisation, and those aren\u2019t our principles. Sure, we\u2019re scientists and we try to learn all we can from the anomalies we contain, but our principles above all are to Secure, Contain and Protect. Holding an intelligent and non-anomalous being hostage because we want it to tell us its secrets doesn\u2019t fit those goals. Hell, if a human had invented something we didn\u2019t understand, we wouldn\u2019t hold them prisoner.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Warner:** That\u2019s different and you know it.

When the Foundation found it, it was in the hands of the US military. If it\u2019s not anomalous, then protocol would be to return it to the custody of those who had the SCP object last.

Let it go, and we can focus this department\u2019s efforts somewhere we can actually do some good.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Warner:** I\u2019m sorry, but no. It\u2019s obvious we aren\u2019t going to agree on this, I say we kick this up the chain, ask the O5 for a ruling.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** The O5?

It is expected to accompany Dr. Warner and Dr. Kowal when the craft launches on 20\u2588\u2588/05/05.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]] \n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** meteor.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Perseid Meteor Shower 2016 from West Virginia\n\n> **Author:** NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://flickr.com/nasamarshall/28383678793 Flickr]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** slime.jpg\n\n> **Name:** slime mould\n\n> **Author:** Rob Cruickshank\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://flickr.com/84221353@N00/37456946854 Flickr]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["crystalmonarch-s-author-page", "scp-6240", "scp-6695", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-7474-EX", "scp_number": 7474, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "amorphous", "departmentcon2022", "explained", "extraterrestrial", "sapient", "scp", "vehicle"], "title": "SCP-7474-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7474-ex"}, "SCP-7525-EX": {"created_at": "2021-05-18T06:24:00", "creator": "HarryBlank", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "TECHNOLOGY", "date": "2021-05-18T06:24:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-ex\".", "date": "2021-05-18T06:27:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T06:33:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "Uploaded file \"slot goblin.png\".", "date": "2021-05-18T06:33:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T06:38:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T07:26:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T07:37:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T08:36:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T08:51:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:02:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:04:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:06:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:11:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:13:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:14:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:27:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:27:00"}, {"author": "PlaguePJP", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/plaguepjp", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:28:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T12:32:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T13:04:00"}, {"author": "HarryBlank", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/harryblank", "comment": "", "date": "2021-05-18T13:06:00"}, {"author": "Naepic", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/naepic", "comment": "Added tags: _cc.

The SCP-7525-EX file itself represents the primary containment apparatus for a phenomenon classified SCP-5257. Use of this database slot is the only practical means of recording information pertaining to SCP-5257, which remains actively anomalous.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5257 is a \"Trojan Horse\" virus formerly infecting the SCiPNET servers, now isolated to the SCP-5257, SCP-5257-EX, and SCP-7525-EX database files. The former two files have been taken offline as of 05/17/2021; all attempts to view them will be met with an error or a notification from Site-19's Technical Department.</p>\n<p>Until recently, SCP-5257 executed opportunistic vandalism attacks against slots in the SCP database. It appears to have a limited predictive capacity, as it tended to interact with empty database slots already slated for imminent official use. Statistical analysis established the following hierarchy of preferences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slots below SCP-1000;</li>\n<li>Slots with numbers relevant to a file's proposed contents;</li>\n<li>Slots below SCP-2000;</li>\n<li>Slots with numbers having humorous associations;</li>\n<li>Slots below SCP-3000;</li>\n<li>Slots with aesthetically or sonically pleasant numbers;</li>\n<li>Slots below SCP-4000.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>SCP-5257 attacked its targets by corrupting any existing data, inserting unwanted and extraneous new data, inserting SCP-5257-1, and reverting authorized edits by appropriate Foundation personnel.</p>\n<p>SCP-5257-1 is a photo with the file name slot_goblin.png which appeared in each slot affected by SCP-5257. It depicts a clean line-art rendering of a goblin, with two images of a man costumed as the Green Goblin from the <em>Spider-Man</em> franchise mirrored on the lower left-hand and right-hand corners. \"YOU HAVE BEEN GOBLINED BY THE SLOT GOBLIN\" <em>[sic]</em> and \"FUCK YOU AND YOUR SLOT\" <em>[sic]</em> appear on the top and bottom of the picture, respectively.</p>\n<p>While the image appears to be non-anomalous<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, it has proven exceedingly difficult to remove from affected files, and completely impossible to eradicate from SCiPNET as a whole. Its single persistent iteration was formerly hosted in the SCP-5257 slot; it is presently confined to SCP-7525-EX.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5257.1:</strong> Incident Log</p>\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<p>The following is an abridged log of notable incidents related to SCP-5257 activity within the SCP Foundation database.</p>\n<p><strong>02/07/2015:</strong> Agent Lament uploaded an SCP file to the <a href=\"/scp-1848\">SCP-1848</a> slot. The file's \"common name,\" used informally to distinguish SCP files at a glance, has read [ACCESS DENIED] since its initial posting. All attempts to correct this have resulted in reversion, with an edit comment reading simply \"OOPS.\"<br/>\n<em>Stop bugging me about this, I'm retired \u2014 Agent T. Lament</em></p>\n<p><strong>05/13/2016:</strong> The first occurrence of the \"Slot Goblin\" image appeared alongside corruption of the SCP-5257 file. The anomaly was classified SCP-5257 internally, though attempts to upload data on its effects to the related file were repeatedly reverted with an edit comment reading \"YOU CAN'T DEFINE THE SLOT GOBLIN!\"<br/>\n<em>We might not be able to fix this without abandoning SCiPNET altogether \u2014 Dir. M. Jones</em><br/>\n<em>I won't miss it \u2014 Dir. P. Lague</em></p>\n<p><strong>07/21/2019:</strong> All unoccupied slots in the database were corrupted by SCP-5257. They now contained short unpublished drafts of unlikely anomalous objects not otherwise attested by Foundation sources, with a level of completion ranging from full descriptions with testing logs, to fragmentary Special Containment Procedures, to completely unintelligible gibberish. Edit comments included \"HOW DO I POST,\" \"IN PROGRESS DON'T DELETE,\" and \"LOL SNIPED.\"<br/>\n<em>Getting tired of cleaning this junk out \u2014 H. Sturmatem</em></p>\n<p><strong>10/14/2020:</strong> Researcher Calvin's account uploaded an explained SCP file to the <a href=\"/scp-5025\">SCP-5025</a> mainlist slot, rather than SCP-5025-EX. The edit comment read \"I DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS LOL.\" Researcher Calvin denied uploading the file, and reported considerable backlash from his colleagues over the subversion of proper protocol.<br/>\n<em>I don't see the problem here \u2014 Dir. R. House</em></p>\n<p><strong>03/20/2021:</strong> Drs. Blank and McDoctorate prepared an SCP file for an object known as the REISNO Cannon. They indicated a preference for the <a href=\"/scp-5244\">SCP-5244</a> slot, as the item in question was thematically connected to both <a href=\"/scp-5242\">SCP-5242</a> and <a href=\"/scp-5243\">SCP-5243</a>. The slot had gone unused for nearly one year prior to this. They expressed this preference to Director Jones of RAISA; within one hour the slot had been corrupted by SCP-5257, with an edit comment reading \"LOL YOU HAD EIGHT MONTHS.\"<br/>\n<em>Research takes longer than eight months, asshole \u2014 Dr. H. Blank</em></p>\n<p><strong>06/10/2021:</strong> Site-17's Labeling Team encountered a massive database corruption wherein 98% of all entries on SCiPnet had their organizational tags removed. These were eventually reinstated when the servers were disconnected and reconnected to their power source.<br/>\n<em>Turning it off and on again was my idea \u2014 Jr. Designer S. Yvonne</em></p>\n<p><strong>06/27/2021:</strong> Dr. Septer removed an outdated file under the SCP-3775 designation. Upon its deletion, SCP-5257 immediately corrupted the slot. Later that same day, Junior Researcher Russ accidentally catalogued an entry in an out-of-range file series. This was subsequently corrected and SCP-5257 corrupted that slot.<br/>\n<em>I need a drink \u2014 Dir. S. Andrews</em></p>\n<p><strong>05/17/2022:</strong> Through a series of extreme technical interventions, RAISA successfully isolated SCP-5257's mainlist activities to its own slot. Attempts to suppress the associated image were unsuccessful until the creation of the SCP-5257-EX slot describing the anomaly, at which point the image (and all further vandalism) transferred there. Damage to the original slot appears at present to be irreversible; the file refuses to load on most terminals in approximately 50% of recorded attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> SCP-5257 has now permanently disabled the SCP-5257-EX file. Its contents have been migrated to the present file, SCP-7525-EX, which remains stable for unknown reasons.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5257.2:</strong> MTF Investigation:</p>\n<p>WALDO.aic was uploaded into the SCP-5257 file for the purposes of tracking it. Following the next flagged upload of SCP-5257-1, an originating location was pinged in the Delaware State Forest in Pennsylvania, USA. An edit comment accompanying this upload read \"Catch me if you can ;),\" and WALDO.aic was forcibly removed from the affected file.</p>\n<p>Two members of MTF \u03c6-103 \"Bark and Bite\" were deployed to the target location.</p>\n<div class=\"interview\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Members</span><br/>\nCommand - Dr. V.

The SCP-7525-EX file itself represents the primary containment apparatus for a phenomenon classified SCP-5257. Use of this database slot is the only practical means of recording information pertaining to SCP-5257, which remains actively anomalous. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5257 is a \"Trojan Horse\" virus formerly infecting the SCiPNET servers, now isolated to the SCP-5257, SCP-5257-EX, and SCP-7525-EX database files. The former two files have been taken offline as of 05/17/2021; all attempts to view them will be met with an error or a notification from Site-19's Technical Department.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, SCP-5257 executed opportunistic vandalism attacks against slots in the SCP database. It appears to have a limited predictive capacity, as it tended to interact with empty database slots already slated for imminent official use. Statistical analysis established the following hierarchy of preferences:\n\n\n\n# Slots below SCP-1000;\n\n# Slots with numbers relevant to a file's proposed contents;\n\n# Slots below SCP-2000;\n\n# Slots with numbers having humorous associations;\n\n# Slots below SCP-3000;\n\n# Slots with aesthetically or sonically pleasant numbers;\n\n# Slots below SCP-4000.\n\n\n\nSCP-5257 attacked its targets by corrupting any existing data, inserting unwanted and extraneous new data, inserting SCP-5257-1, and reverting authorized edits by appropriate Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\nSCP-5257-1 is a photo with the file name slot_goblin.png which appeared in each slot affected by SCP-5257. It depicts a clean line-art rendering of a goblin, with two images of a man costumed as the Green Goblin from the //Spider-Man// franchise mirrored on the lower left-hand and right-hand corners. \"YOU HAVE BEEN GOBLINED BY THE SLOT GOBLIN\" //[sic]// and \"FUCK YOU AND YOUR SLOT\" //[sic]// appear on the top and bottom of the picture, respectively.\n\n\n\nWhile the image appears to be non-anomalous[[footnote]]It was downloaded onto a virtual machine which suffered no ill effects, even when connected to the SCiPNET test servers. [[/footnote]], it has proven exceedingly difficult to remove from affected files, and completely impossible to eradicate from SCiPNET as a whole. Its single persistent iteration was formerly hosted in the SCP-5257 slot; it is presently confined to SCP-7525-EX.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5257.1:** Incident Log\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n\n\nThe following is an abridged log of notable incidents related to SCP-5257 activity within the SCP Foundation database.\n\n\n\n**02/07/2015:** Agent Lament uploaded an SCP file to the [[[SCP-1848]]] slot. The file's \"common name,\" used informally to distinguish SCP files at a glance, has read [ACCESS DENIED] since its initial posting. All attempts to correct this have resulted in reversion, with an edit comment reading simply \"OOPS.\"\n\n//Stop bugging me about this, I'm retired -- Agent T. Lament//\n\n\n\n**05/13/2016:** The first occurrence of the \"Slot Goblin\" image appeared alongside corruption of the SCP-5257 file. The anomaly was classified SCP-5257 internally, though attempts to upload data on its effects to the related file were repeatedly reverted with an edit comment reading \"YOU CAN'T DEFINE THE SLOT GOBLIN!\"\n\n//We might not be able to fix this without abandoning SCiPNET altogether -- Dir. M. Jones//\n\n//I won't miss it -- Dir. P. Lague//\n\n\n\n**07/21/2019:** All unoccupied slots in the database were corrupted by SCP-5257. They now contained short unpublished drafts of unlikely anomalous objects not otherwise attested by Foundation sources, with a level of completion ranging from full descriptions with testing logs, to fragmentary Special Containment Procedures, to completely unintelligible gibberish. Edit comments included \"HOW DO I POST,\" \"IN PROGRESS DON'T DELETE,\" and \"LOL SNIPED.\"\n\n//Getting tired of cleaning this junk out -- H. Sturmatem//\n\n\n\n**10/14/2020:** Researcher Calvin's account uploaded an explained SCP file to the [[[SCP-5025]]] mainlist slot, rather than SCP-5025-EX. The edit comment read \"I DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS LOL.\" Researcher Calvin denied uploading the file, and reported considerable backlash from his colleagues over the subversion of proper protocol.\n\n//I don't see the problem here -- Dir. R. House//\n\n\n\n**03/20/2021:** Drs. Blank and McDoctorate prepared an SCP file for an object known as the REISNO Cannon. They indicated a preference for the [[[SCP-5244]]] slot, as the item in question was thematically connected to both [[[SCP-5242]]] and [[[SCP-5243]]]. The slot had gone unused for nearly one year prior to this. They expressed this preference to Director Jones of RAISA; within one hour the slot had been corrupted by SCP-5257, with an edit comment reading \"LOL YOU HAD EIGHT MONTHS.\"\n\n//Research takes longer than eight months, asshole -- Dr. H. Blank//\n\n\n\n**06/10/2021:** Site-17's Labeling Team encountered a massive database corruption wherein 98% of all entries on SCiPnet had their organizational tags removed. These were eventually reinstated when the servers were disconnected and reconnected to their power source.\n\n//Turning it off and on again was my idea -- Jr. Designer S. Yvonne//\n\n\n\n**06/27/2021:** Dr. Septer removed an outdated file under the SCP-3775 designation. Upon its deletion, SCP-5257 immediately corrupted the slot. Later that same day, Junior Researcher Russ accidentally catalogued an entry in an out-of-range file series. This was subsequently corrected and SCP-5257 corrupted that slot.\n\n//I need a drink -- Dir. S. Andrews//\n\n\n\n**05/17/2022:** Through a series of extreme technical interventions, RAISA successfully isolated SCP-5257's mainlist activities to its own slot. Attempts to suppress the associated image were unsuccessful until the creation of the SCP-5257-EX slot describing the anomaly, at which point the image (and all further vandalism) transferred there. Damage to the original slot appears at present to be irreversible; the file refuses to load on most terminals in approximately 50% of recorded attempts.\n\n\n\n**Update:** SCP-5257 has now permanently disabled the SCP-5257-EX file. Its contents have been migrated to the present file, SCP-7525-EX, which remains stable for unknown reasons.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5257.2:** MTF Investigation:\n\n\n\nWALDO.aic was uploaded into the SCP-5257 file for the purposes of tracking it. Following the next flagged upload of SCP-5257-1, an originating location was pinged in the Delaware State Forest in Pennsylvania, USA. An edit comment accompanying this upload read \"Catch me if you can ;),\" and WALDO.aic was forcibly removed from the affected file.\n\n\n\nTwo members of MTF \u03c6-103 \"Bark and Bite\" were deployed to the target location.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n\n-----\n\n\n\n__Members__\n\nCommand - Dr. V.

This phenomenon is observed following the complete dissolution of the Veil, a metaphysical barrier that conceals and separates the anomalous from the mundane.</p>\n<p>The decline of anomalous phenomena is not limited to the Foundation's jurisdiction but extends globally, potentially further. Reports from other organizations and independent researchers in the anomalous community corroborate this trend. Verified data suggests that SCP-7973 is affecting all known anomalies, regardless of their origin or nature.</p>\n<p>Initial theories suggest that the destruction of the Veil disrupted the underlying metaphysical mechanisms responsible for the sustained existence of anomalous entities. It is hypothesized that the Veil acted as a stabilizing force, maintaining the balance between the anomalous and the non-anomalous. With its removal, anomalous phenomena appear to be returning to a state of equilibrium, aligning with the natural laws governing the universe.</p>\n<p>SCP-7973 only affects anomalies discovered or occurring after the Veil is dissipated, as anomalies documented before SCP-7973 remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this is currently unknown. Current models predict the prevalence of new anomalous phenomena will cease entirely by the year 2071.</p>\n<p>In order to better understand SCP-7973, and the anomalous at large, Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews with several anomalous researchers/related personnel. These interviews aimed to acquire additional insights into the nature of anomalies. The following logs contain the transcriptions of said interviews, accompanied by relevant contextual details.</p>\n<div class=\"limit\">\n<div class=\"anchor\">\n<div class=\"sidebox\">\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"8845981467_6945cef32a_b.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/3696/8845981467_6945cef32a_b.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Dr. Gears</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Gears<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Rosanne<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Foreword:</strong> The following interview was conducted a few weeks after the Veil was dissolved, with SCP-7973 being only theoretical at the time. Due to Dr. Gears being the current lead researcher for new anomalous phenomena, he specifically was chosen.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<em><strong>Dr. Rosanne walks into the room.

Don't look a day over thirty!<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Who are you?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<em><strong>Dr. Rosanne stands silently, before resuming.</strong></em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Tiana Mark Rosanne? Doctor, interviewer\u2026<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Apologies, you look different than I heard.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> No worries! So, anyhow, you're wondering why I dragged you out here\u2014<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> No, in fact, I think I know exactly why. Heard something about statistics being off.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> The statistics, yeah? Just need to say a few things for the file, hope you don't mind.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Go ahead.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well\u2014The guys at the statistics department were having\u2026 not the best time, if you can believe it. They were studying the number of anomalies that happened every week, as usual, and you'd expect it to just\u2026 Massively jump, right? 'Cause the Veil is gone now.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Did it not?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Not at all! It started to decrease. Not by much, mind you, but the top minds all agreed that its a roughly 0.005% decrease than normal. Granted, four weeks is often not enough data, but they've been going through that stuff for years and never has it went down consistently!<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Hm, I see.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well, I just have an important question. What do you consider \"anomalous\"?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Well, to put it simply, I define an anomaly as anything that deviates from our current understanding of the natural world and defies the laws of physics or known scientific principles. Granted, the natural world is surely changing, but I think it still makes sense.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Alright, got that jotted down. Do you think anomalies are inherently dangerous?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> No. Anomalies can certainly pose risks and threats, especially if they are uncontained or poorly understood. However, anomalies themselves are not inherently good or evil, they're simply anomalous. I have seen anomalies both capable of helping and harming the Foundation.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Makes sense to me. If this \"SCP-7973\" does exist, do you think it means anything big?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> It's impossible to say without more data. But in my opinion, it could signify a more troubling issue, such as a fundamental shift in the fabric of reality, although that is just a theory.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I see\u2014Once we got more information, I'll try to remind you! Although you're leagues above me, so you might know.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong><em>Dr. Gears nods.</em></strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Understood.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the subsequent weeks following the interview, SCP-7973's influence has exhibited a noticeable escalation. Over a period of seven months, only the subsequent categories of anomalies have been identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>16 instances of humanoid anomalies</li>\n<li>24 occurrences of anomalous wildlife</li>\n<li>38 instances of anomalous items</li>\n<li>41 recorded anomalous events</li>\n<li>12 designated anomalous locations</li>\n<li>2 occurrences of anomalies capable of causing a K-Class \"End Of the World\" Scenario</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to the dramatic decrease in anomalies, several groups of interest were interviewed in order to understand SCP-7973 further. Certain groups such as Gamers Against Weed and the Church of the Broken God were observed to continue their operations in an unchanged manner. Although most interviews yielded no notable information, the Global Occult Coalition have reported a similar number in decreased anomalies. Below is an interview with Undersecretary General D. C. Al Fine.</p>\n<div class=\"limit\">\n<div class=\"anchor\">\n<div class=\"sidebox\">\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-left\" style=\"width:200px;\"><img alt=\"Black_woman_with_women%27s_suit_2.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Black_woman_with_women%27s_suit_2.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>D.

We've seen the library end the world before, so we absolutely know how dangerous they can be!<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Yes, while that is true, they're not <em>all</em> dangerous. Like, random example\u2026 there's this big ball of slime, makes people happy! So they're not all\u2014<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Al Fine:</strong> I'm going to have to cut you off right there. Granted, there are a few anomalies that help. Hell, we got plenty of them. But the truth is, the majority of them are dangerous and deadly. It's astounding that the number has decreased, but maybe it's for the better.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> For the better? I wouldn't say that, like\u2026 for every deadly anomaly that no longer exists, there has to be another that could help us, right?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Al Fine:</strong> First, you never use the good ones for the sake of the people, so that shouldn't be your worry. And second, less anomalies means the Foundation doesn't have to employ as many people. For every murder monster, that's at least fifty people that work for something else.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong><em>Dr. Rosanne is silent.</em></strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Al Fine:</strong> See? Whatever is causing this\u2026 anomapocalypse, it doesn't matter. It's better in the end.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I'll be ending this interview.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Al Fine:</strong> It's the truth, sorry to burst your bubble.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Rosanne was disciplined for her unprofessional behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further statistic reports imply a significant downward trend for new anomalies. Contrary to the earlier projection of anomalies persisting until the year 2071, Foundation analysts now anticipate this occurrence to transpire within a considerably shorter time frame, potentially within the next decade. Over the past year, only 3 instances of anomalous humanoids have been documented. In an effort to further understand SCP-7973, Dr. Rosanne has submitted a formal request for an interview with a humanoid anomaly currently under Foundation custody.</p>\n<div class=\"limit\">\n<div class=\"anchor\">\n<div class=\"sidebox\">\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:200px;\"><img alt=\"Medico_peste.jpg?20120303140125\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Medico_peste.jpg?20120303140125\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>SCP-049</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-049\">SCP-049</a><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Rosanne<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-049 was situated behind a wall of glass in order to avoid accidental or intentional contact.

So, I'm guessing you heard the news about the Veil being broke?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> The veil?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Oh yeah, in captivity, sorry! Basically, everybody knows about the anomalous, and people like you! Unfortunately we still need to keep you contained, touch of death and all that\u2026 but that's some more interaction, maybe.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Interesting, I knew something felt\u2026 off. There was a lot of indistinct chatter about Korea, maybe some time I could visit? Bless them with my cure?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Yeah, sure\u2014Anyways! I do have a few things to say, but the main one is your opinion on the anomalous. What do you consider \"anomalous\"?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Ah, an intriguing question indeed. Don't think anyone has bothered to ask. Well, my fellow doctor, I consider the anomalous to be that which eludes your feeble comprehension. It is the essence of fear, the embodiment of the unknown. And I must say, I relish in it.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well, yes, but like\u2026 The dark <em>is</em> the unknown, but we don't try and contain darkness.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Ah, but darkness holds its own secrets, doesn't it? You fear the unknown lurking within the shadows. It is not the mere absence of light that sends shivers down your spine; it is the possibility that something watches you, that something sinister stirs in the depths.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I guess you're right. If that's the case, what we do understand can all be explained, there's reasoning behind all of it. But for you, no offense, your death-touch isn't anything we can put together with science.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Believe me, Dr. Rosanne, I am well aware of the limitations of your scientific endeavors. But let me ask you this: Would a caveman try to contain fire? Would a peasant attempt to harness electricity, keeping it hidden from the prying eyes of the masses? You may not grasp my true nature yet, but there is far more to me than meets the eye.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> So, there's aspects of things that transcend our perspective of science? Since we see things we don't know and we're all too quick to think its a threat?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Precisely, doctor. There are forces and phenomena in this world that exist beyond the feeble boundaries of conventional knowledge. Just because we cannot fathom or control them with our limited understanding does not render them purposeless or devoid of meaning.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Makes enough sense. Maybe some day, you can finally walk again\u2026 I do feel sorry for you sometimes.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Don't be burdened by sympathy, doctor.

This phenomenon is observed following the complete dissolution of the Veil, a metaphysical barrier that conceals and separates the anomalous from the mundane.\n\n\n\nThe decline of anomalous phenomena is not limited to the Foundation's jurisdiction but extends globally, potentially further. Reports from other organizations and independent researchers in the anomalous community corroborate this trend. Verified data suggests that SCP-7973 is affecting all known anomalies, regardless of their origin or nature.\n\n\n\nInitial theories suggest that the destruction of the Veil disrupted the underlying metaphysical mechanisms responsible for the sustained existence of anomalous entities. It is hypothesized that the Veil acted as a stabilizing force, maintaining the balance between the anomalous and the non-anomalous. With its removal, anomalous phenomena appear to be returning to a state of equilibrium, aligning with the natural laws governing the universe.\n\n\n\nSCP-7973 only affects anomalies discovered or occurring after the Veil is dissipated, as anomalies documented before SCP-7973 remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this is currently unknown. Current models predict the prevalence of new anomalous phenomena will cease entirely by the year 2071.\n\n\n\nIn order to better understand SCP-7973, and the anomalous at large, Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews with several anomalous researchers/related personnel. These interviews aimed to acquire additional insights into the nature of anomalies. The following logs contain the transcriptions of said interviews, accompanied by relevant contextual details.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=https://live.staticflickr.com/3696/8845981467_6945cef32a_b.jpg|caption=Dr. Gears|width=300px]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Interviewed:** Dr. Gears\n\n> @@ @@\n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Rosanne\n\n> @@ @@\n\n> **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted a few weeks after the Veil was dissolved, with SCP-7973 being only theoretical at the time.

Certain groups such as Gamers Against Weed and the Church of the Broken God were observed to continue their operations in an unchanged manner. Although most interviews yielded no notable information, the Global Occult Coalition have reported a similar number in decreased anomalies. Below is an interview with Undersecretary General D. C. Al Fine.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Black_woman_with_women%27s_suit_2.jpg|caption=D.

No special containment procedures have been devised for the anomaly. Furthermore, the phenomenon is functionally self-containing, so no Veil-preserving disinformation policies are necessary.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7982 is a phenomenon that manifests after a human's death. In first ten minutes after the cessation of the heartbeat, the subject's consciousness will be transported to a oneirotic space[[footnote]]Colloquially known as a \"dream-space.\"[[/footnote]] containing a humanoid entity known as SCP-7982-1. SCP-7982-1 will then engage the subject in conversation. Survivors have noted that they are \"intensely cordial\", with Naomi Murato[[footnote]] See Incident Log 7982.1 [[/footnote]] noting, \"My time with him was some of the calmest that I have ever had.\"\n\n\n\nAll survivors of SCP-7982 are known to have pleaded for their life, at which point SCP-7982-1 allowed them a board game of choice to play. All known survivors have won their game.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Naomi Murato\n\n**Personnel File**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n||~ Sex ||= F ||\n\n||~ Born ||= 1990-5-9 ||\n\n||~ Died ||= 2024-2-27 ||\n\n||~ Position ||= Security Guard, Containment Area-111 ||\n\n||~ Security Clearance Level ||= 1 ||\n\n||~ **Biography** ||= Naomi Murato was born in Tokyo, Japan to a middle-class household. At the age of 4 she was diagnosed with autism and social pragmatic communication disorder. Murato was unemployed and in poverty in 2013 when she was scouted out by the Foundation's Japanese branch to work as a Level 0 security guard. In 2020, she was promoted to Level 1 and transferred to Containment Area-111. Murato was killed by an unknown anomaly during a containment breach. ||\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Incident Log 7982.1:**\n\n\n\nOn February 27th, 2025, at 0434 hours, Naomi Murato was declared deceased; her brain, however, inexplicably showed continued activity.

Standard Cover Story L-95 (\"Induction Into/Abduction By Cult\") is to be implemented to explain their disappearances from the public. Personnel exposing themselves to materials that induce SCP-8000-EX for purposes outside of testing are to have their employment with the Foundation terminated.</p>\n<p>The Foundation has set up the front group, \"The Society for Christian Parents\", an organization dedicated to discouraging interaction with materials that cause SCP-8000-EX, such as <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, <em>Empire of the Petal Throne</em>, and <em>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</em>. Currently, these efforts are operating at only 40% effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8000-EX refers to anomalous effects produced from interacting with fantasy-based 'wargames' such as <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. Specifically, SCP-8000-EX refers to a form of cognitive decline wherein certain individuals who play these games cease to be able to distinguish reality from the world depicted by a fantasy wargame. This effect is most prevalent among men aged 15-25.</p>\n<p>Documented symptoms of SCP-8000-EX include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Belief that one is not human, or has thaumaturgical capabilities.</li>\n<li>Seeking out cavernous structures, such as maintenance tunnels or culverts, in an attempt to 'seek out adventure'.</li>\n<li>Cutting behavior (i.e. slitting wrists and mutilating legs)</li>\n<li>Abusing animals.</li>\n<li>Increased desire for acts of sexual deviance, including sodomy and public transvestitism.</li>\n<li>Attempts to call forth Tartarean entities using 'spells' included in the Player's Handbooks for these games; however, due to the lack of thaumaturgical knowledge displayed by the companies publishing these games, none of these rites are functional.</li>\n<li>Attempts at suicide.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-8000-EX by GOI-5705B (\"<a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5952\">The First United Temple of Dixieland</a>\") following the deaths of a pair of young adults connected with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Using their status as members of SUSEOCT, GOI-5705B forced the Foundation to open an investigation into SCP-8000-EX.</p>\n<p>Currently, one individual affected by SCP-8000-EX is in containment: 21-year-old Daniel Friedman, son of theologist Dr. Herman Friedman. Following exposure to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> at their college's board game society during the 1982 autumn semester, Daniel Friedman began showing symptoms of SCP-8000-EX following their return home for winter break, culminating in an attempt at suicide on December 27th. Dr. Friedman, a former member of GOI-5705B's congregation, had been a proponent of classifying <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> as an anomaly; he transferred his son into containment in the hopes of understanding the mechanisms behind SCP-8000-EX.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Friedman<br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Daniel Friedman<br/>\n<strong>Date:</strong> 01/17/1983</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> Daniel, you're awake, good.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Friedman:</strong> Dad?

After significant debate and careful review, the Ethics Committee has concluded that SCP-8000 is not, and has never been, an anomaly; the behavior exhibited by Daniel Friedman, and several other alleged SCP-8000 cases, are the result of a combination of factors, including previously untreated mental illness, such as manic-depressive disorder, homosexuality,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> and Gender Identity Disorder (Transsexualism).<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is the belief of the Ethics Committee that neither Daniel Friedman, nor any individual allegedly affected by SCP-8000, possess any anomalous properties. Dr. Friedman has fallen victim to the same panic that is affecting most of the United States at this time, fearing that he is losing his child to Satanic influence. As such, the Ethics Committee recommends the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reclassification of SCP-8000 from Keter to Explained, and the modification of the designation to SCP-8000-EX.</li>\n<li>Immediate release of Daniel Friedman and cessation of monitoring for SCP-8000-EX. Due to potentially dangerous drug interactions between Compound-72 and Class-A Amnestics, amnesticization is not advised at this time.</li>\n<li>Cessation of containment efforts related to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and other related fantasy games.</li>\n<li>Removal of Daniel Friedman from the custody of Dr. Herman Friedman, as it is believed that he cannot be trusted with his child's well-being.</li>\n<li>Psychological counseling for Daniel Friedman, provided by the Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n<p><em>The Foundation, and the majority of the world, were clueless back then about the role fantasy could play in leading a healthy life.

Standard Cover Story L-95 (\"Induction Into/Abduction By Cult\") is to be implemented to explain their disappearances from the public. Personnel exposing themselves to materials that induce SCP-8000-EX for purposes outside of testing are to have their employment with the Foundation terminated.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation has set up the front group, \"The Society for Christian Parents\", an organization dedicated to discouraging interaction with materials that cause SCP-8000-EX, such as //Dungeons & Dragons//, //Call of Cthulhu//, //Empire of the Petal Throne//, and //Tunnels & Trolls//. Currently, these efforts are operating at only 40% effectiveness.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-8000-EX refers to anomalous effects produced from interacting with fantasy-based 'wargames'\u00a0\u00a0such as //Dungeons & Dragons// and //Call of Cthulhu//. Specifically, SCP-8000-EX refers to a form of cognitive decline wherein certain individuals who play these games cease to be able to distinguish reality from the world depicted by a fantasy wargame. This effect is most prevalent among men aged 15-25.\n\n\n\nDocumented symptoms of SCP-8000-EX include:\n\n\n\n* Belief that one is not human, or has thaumaturgical capabilities.\n\n* Seeking out cavernous structures, such as maintenance tunnels or culverts, in an attempt to 'seek out adventure'.\n\n* Cutting behavior (i.e. slitting wrists and mutilating legs)\n\n* Abusing animals.\n\n* Increased desire for acts of sexual deviance, including sodomy and public transvestitism.\n\n* Attempts to call forth Tartarean entities using 'spells' included in the Player's Handbooks for these games; however, due to the lack of thaumaturgical knowledge displayed by the companies publishing these games, none of these rites are functional.\n\n* Attempts at suicide.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-8000-EX by GOI-5705B (\"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5952 The First United Temple of Dixieland]\") following the deaths of a pair of young adults connected with //Dungeons & Dragons//. Using their status as members of SUSEOCT, GOI-5705B forced the Foundation to open an investigation into SCP-8000-EX.\n\n\n\nCurrently, one individual affected by SCP-8000-EX is in containment: 21-year-old Daniel Friedman, son of theologist Dr. Herman Friedman. Following exposure to //Dungeons & Dragons// at their college's board game society during the 1982 autumn semester, Daniel Friedman began showing symptoms of SCP-8000-EX following their return home for winter break, culminating in an attempt at suicide on December 27th. Dr. Friedman, a former member of GOI-5705B's congregation, had been a proponent of classifying //Dungeons & Dragons// as an anomaly; he transferred his son into containment in the hopes of understanding the mechanisms behind SCP-8000-EX.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Friedman\n\n**Subject:** Daniel Friedman\n\n**Date:** 01/17/1983\n\n----\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** Daniel, you're awake, good.\n\n\n\n**Daniel Friedman:** Dad?

He's not sick, he could tell when we were pretending. That thing with the kid in the steam tunnels a few years ago, he was... he wasn't well. His parents mistreated him badly. The game didn't kill him.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** Do you know if Daniel Friedman was a sodomite?\n\n\n\n**Edgar Starkey:** ...a //what?//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** A homosexual psychopath. Queer. 'Gay' is the term people afflicted in such a way might use for themselves.\n\n\n\n**Edgar Starkey:** I ...who did you say you worked for, again?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** Stop Cults from Proliferating, a charitable organization dedicated to doing just that.\n\n\n\n**Edgar Starkey:** Maybe you want to take a look at your own materials, friendo. The fact that you'd describe a kid as sweet as Dan as a sodomite, or a psychopath, says a lot about you.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** It doesn't matter. We're very close to getting him back, I'm sure.\n\n\n\n**Edgar Starkey:** Well, if you do get... them back, I hope that they're not stuck with their parents.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** What makes you say that?\n\n\n\n**Edgar Starkey:** From the sound of it, his dad was a fundie nutcase who was worse at distinguishing fantasy from reality than any //Dungeons & Dragons// player I've ever met.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** ...I believe we're done here. Good day, Mr. Starkey.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Daniel Friedman\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Friedman\n\n**Date:** 03/07/1983\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Dr. Friedman:** Daniel.

However, continued administration has been deemed impractical by Dr. Friedman.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Treatment:** Therapeutic exorcism.[[footnote]]A controversial form of treatment meant for treating mental illnesses brought on by exposure to Tartarean entities.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n**Result:** Ineffective; subject showed no physical reaction to religious iconography or holy water. Subject's left collarbone was broken as he struggled to free himself from restraints.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Treatment:** Baptismal immersion.

Second attempt was made while subject was sedated, resulting in them nearly drowning.\n\n\n\nTreatment was deemed ineffective, as Subject still showed symptoms of SCP-8000-EX following this.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nConcerns regarding Dr. Friedman's treatment of his child in regards to their exposure to SCP-8000 have been brought forth by members of RAISA who have documented their interviews and attempts to treat his son. After significant debate and careful review, the Ethics Committee has concluded that SCP-8000 is not, and has never been, an anomaly; the behavior exhibited by Daniel Friedman, and several other alleged SCP-8000 cases, are the result of a combination of factors, including previously untreated mental illness, such as manic-depressive disorder, homosexuality,[[footnote]]RAISA Note: Despite homosexuality being no longer considered a mental illness by the American Psychological Association as of the publication of the DSM-II, the Foundation still considered it a 'disqualifying mental illness' until the early 1990s.[[/footnote]] and Gender Identity Disorder (Transsexualism).[[footnote]] Gender Identity Disorder was classified by the American Psychological Association as of the publication of the DSM-III in 1980. The term was reclassified as 'Gender Dysphoria' in the DSM-V (published in 2013.) in order to remove the stigma of transgender individuals being perceived as possessing a disability.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nIt is the belief of the Ethics Committee that neither Daniel Friedman, nor any individual allegedly affected by SCP-8000, possess any anomalous properties. Dr. Friedman has fallen victim to the same panic that is affecting most of the United States at this time, fearing that he is losing his child to Satanic influence. As such, the Ethics Committee recommends the following actions:\n\n\n\n* Reclassification of SCP-8000 from Keter to Explained, and the modification of the designation to SCP-8000-EX.\n\n* Immediate release of Daniel Friedman and cessation of monitoring for SCP-8000-EX. Due to potentially dangerous drug interactions between Compound-72 and Class-A Amnestics, amnesticization is not advised at this time.\n\n* Cessation of containment efforts related to //Dungeons & Dragons// and other related fantasy games.\n\n* Removal of Daniel Friedman from the custody of Dr. Herman Friedman, as it is believed that he cannot be trusted with his child's well-being.\n\n* Psychological counseling for Daniel Friedman, provided by the Foundation.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n//The Foundation, and the majority of the world, were clueless back then about the role fantasy could play in leading a healthy life. They saw adults playing pretend and called them childish, sick, demonic, and deluded, when in most cases, it was the only way some of us could// escape //delusion.//\n\n\n\n//In some cases, people have to escape into fantasy to be their true selves, and in that sense, the line is blurred. I don't know how many people I've met over the years who pretend to be someone they're not in order to survive, only for that mask to come off when they pick up a set of dice and a character sheet. It's\u2026 magical, honestly. That's the only way to describe it.//\n\n\n\n//My father died in 1999. I only visited his grave a week ago, and I only did it at the request of my psychiatrist, because after the way he treated me, I never wanted to speak to him again. He never really accepted me for who I am, even after the Foundation tried righting his wrongs. In a way, I should be thankful. They gave me a roof over my head, kept me clothed and fed when I couldn't go back to living how I used to before being abducted, and eventually, gave me a job. But at the same time, they bought into the mass delusion that I was somehow anomalous when in reality, I just wanted to be me.//\n\n\n\n//And now that I am me, I don't want to be anyone else.//\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n--Dr. Clara Friedman, RAISA Archivist, 2015.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Ihp, Uncle Nicolini]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-5952", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-8000-EX", "scp_number": 8000, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_licensebox", "bleak", "co-authored", "compulsion", "explained", "game", "historical", "keter", "lgbtq", "mind-affecting", "period-piece", "scp"], "title": "SCP-8000-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8000-ex"}, "SCP-8285": {"created_at": "2024-09-20T22:36:00", "creator": "Not Noodles", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Not Noodles", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/not-noodles", "comment": "Uploaded file \"All-Star_Bowling_Alley_(Orangeburg_SC)_front_entrance_1.JPG\".", "date": "2024-09-20T22:36:00"}, {"author": "Not Noodles", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/not-noodles", "comment": "Uploaded file \"Roth_1.jpg\".", "date": "2024-09-20T22:36:00"}, {"author": "Not Noodles", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/not-noodles", "comment": "", "date": "2024-09-20T22:36:00"}, {"author": "Not Noodles", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/not-noodles", "comment": "", "date": "2024-09-20T22:37:00"}, {"author": "Not Noodles", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/not-noodles", "comment": "", "date": "2024-09-20T22:47:00"}, {"author": "Diogene_s", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/diogene-s", "comment": "Added tags: _image, _licensebox, explained, humanoid, probability, reality-bending, sapient, scp, sport.

SCP-8285 currently resides in the small town of Blairsville, Georgia. SCP-8285 has bowled an estimated 43 perfect games, with eight consecutive perfect games having been recorded at the local bowling alley.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Though theoretically possible through non-anomalous means, the lack of a pursuit of a professional career in bowling by SCP-8285, combined with the statistical unlikelihood of this accomplishment, it is believed that SCP-8285 has achieved these feats through anomalous means.</p>\n<p>Though the details remain unclear at this time, SCP-8285 is believed to be capable of minor levels of reality bending. This most likely influencing the way the pins scatter after having been struck, allowing him to influence the outcomes of each roll with minimal risk of being caught.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8285-A:</strong> Initial Investigation</p>\n<p>SCP-8285\u2019s potential anomalous ability was discovered during a routine sweep of various Georgia counties. Various townspeople were to be questioned about their recollection of SCP-8285\u2019s activity as a bowler.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The local owner of Blairsville\u2019s bowling alley, Jason Troup, was willing to share the history of SCP-8285\u2019s success. Extraneous information was cut.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"All-Star_Bowling_Alley_(Orangeburg_SC)_front_entrance_1.JPG\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8285/All-Star_Bowling_Alley_(Orangeburg_SC)_front_entrance_1.JPG\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Blairsville Bowling Alley</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> Hell of a guy, I tell you. It was like clockwork, you\u2019d come in to get the electronics up and running, make sure the lanes were oiled, and he\u2019d already be knocking at the door.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> He was there every single day? Never on break, or working a job or anything?</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> I mean he had his days where he was MIA, so to speak.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Missing in action?</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> Never really felt comfortable to ask him about it. At least not until some weeks had gone by. We knew he struggled a bit health-wise, so we'd get scared sometimes, y'know?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> How'd he pay for all of this? Beyond the bowling, like groceries and utilities? God knows it ain't free.</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> Earl made a fortune off of fool's bets.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> What do you mean by fool\u2019s bets?</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> A fool would walk in here. He'd sit down at the lane and just watch Earl sink ball after ball into the gutter. Eventually, once Earl had really reeled him in, he'd ask the fool if he'd like to make it interesting. I\u2019d come out, set up a seven-ten split, or a big four, and the fool would have sold his daughter to place that kinda bet.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> And everyone would just fall for this?</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> You're not a bowler, are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Not outside of my kid's birthday parties, anyways. Just find it odd so many people would come in and just throw money down.</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> They're practically impossible shots to nail. Yet, almost every single time, Earl would knock em' down. Easy money, really. And since it drove traffic in sometimes, I had no issue with letting him bowl for free. Guy was a freak.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Your uh, wall of fame. Bit one sided, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Troup:</strong> Well, you can\u2019t really outcompete the best, can you? No one got close to what he could do. Putting anyone else up on that wall would be an insult to Earl. And trust me, no one would want to see their face on that wall, it'd be an insult to the greatest to ever walk these lanes.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Afterwards, SCP-8285 was approached for comment. Though living mostly a reclusive life due to his age and health complications, SCP-8285 was eager to talk about his past achievements. The interview was held in his living room, which had been carefully decorated with plaques, trophies and certificates, all neatly assorted by their date.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Please, please, come in. Hot as balls out there. Care for some sweet tea?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> No, I\u2019m fine. Thank you for the offer though.</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Troup called ahead and let me know y\u2019all were doing some digging, shooting a documentary or something?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Yeah, sort of. We stumbled upon your records, and we were quite intrigued to say the least. Always something special to be in the presence of an all-time great.</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> An all-time great? Don\u2019t make me laugh, I\u2019d have to actually bowl with em\u2019 to be considered one. Bowling's just a hobby of mine. End of the day, we're cut from the same cloth.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Well, I can tell you right now, the hall of famers haven\u2019t bowled anywhere close to your level, I mean surely you\u2019d have considered going pro?</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Going pro at a game has to be the silliest thing, y\u2019know? Bowling\u2019s not about the money, or the airtime and certainly no cute girls care about some ol' bowler.</p>\n<p><em>Roth laughs, before catching his breath.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Y\u2019see, life had dealt me bad hand from the start, you'd think you can\u2019t do nothing but fold\u2026 But that didn\u2019t quite sit right by me, y\u2019know?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Troup mentioned health issues, I'm assuming that's what you're talking about?</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Issues was puttin' it lightly. I wanted to make the most of the life I had left, and that didn\u2019t have me playing in some fancy ol\u2019 venue up in God knows where. It had me sitting down, having a beer with Jason and just bowling in that old, broken down joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Made quite a lot of money on those lanes though, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Sure, but you gotta pay the bills somehow.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> I really do find that quite odd, Mr. Roth.</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Earl\u2019s fine, bud.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> It's just - you\u2019d have to be stupid to not try to make something out yourself with that talent of yours. Why stop at betting and not just go a step beyond and bowl in tournaments? Travel the country and all that?</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> I must be a prime dumbass to you then!</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> It wasn't meant to get personal.</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> To hell with that. Point is, I grew up here, my pops grew up here, my pop-pop grew up here, it's my town. The PBA just don't get it, talking about some RPM bullshit and all these \"modern\" analytics. At the end of the day, I care about whether or not the pins are knocked down.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Want me to be upfront with you?</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> There\u2019s simply no way you are as good as they claim you are. Your achievements are astronomical, I mean, not even once in a lifetime rare, but flat out impossible. If you take a look at the numb-</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> It's not about no damn numbers. You listen here, bu-</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> You're misunderstandi-</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> I hear ya' loud and clear. You come in here and tell me what I'm supposed to be capable of? I know damn well how good I bowl, and I know I did it right by God.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> See, I just don't buy that. We've checked hundreds of bowler's stats, and you want to tell me you're the single outlier? It ain't possible, unless of course\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> I see what this is about. You're really gonna sit there in your fancy ol' suit and all and tell me I'm a cheat?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> A cheat's rubbing it in, I am just saying that whether you were aware of it or not-</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> I couldn't live myself to besmirch the beautiful game like that, I got here because of my damn work ethic. I came down to the alley and bowled night and day to get where I am.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> So you really want to sell me the idea that you just somehow are better than the people on the PBA tour? Those players who bowl on some of the most competitive patterns and genuinely understand each facet there is to the game? You\u2019re just that much better, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> Hell, I got the games to prove it! I spent decades perfecting my craft, and if some young buck \"professionals\" ain't able to roll better than me, then that's their problem, not mine.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Just skip the bullshit and tell me how you did it Roth.</p>\n<p><strong>Roth:</strong> I would very much prefer Earl! If you aren't gonna listen to a word I have to say or show me a semblance of respect, then I think we're done here. I ain't going to listen to some wisecracking guy, who's got no idea what it's like to be good at something through sheer grit alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Belmonte:</strong> Trust me, I\u2019ve got things I\u2019m good at Mr. Roth\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addendum SCP-8285-B:</strong> Containment Efforts\n<p>Through the sheer impossibility of his achievements, it was concluded that SCP-8285 had been capable of high class reality bending. Due to SCP-8285 having retired, containment measures were initially deemed unnecessary, though following an appeal by Agent Belmonte, the following containment protocol was put into place.</p>\n<p>Due to numerous witness accounts certifying SCP-8285\u2019s achievements during his amateur career, it was imperative that these accounts were contested. Amnestic usage was not only recommended, but necessary to prevent any potential threat to the veil posed by the publication of SCP-8285\u2019s accomplishments.</p>\n<p>A report was published, containing information pertaining to SCP-8285 having engaged in fraud throughout his bowling career. Pre-existing records were contested and altered to reflect the illegitimacy of SCP-8285\u2019s achievements. The fact that SCP-8285 was highly unathletic and never was capable of the high level of bowling that he has claimed was to be reinforced.</p>\n<p>Following the publication of the report, SCP-8285 was issued a life-time ban from the local bowling alley, and various awards granted to SCP-8285 were rescinded, including the \u201cBlairsville Committed Citizen Award\u201d, awarded for SCP-8285\u2019s contributions to the local community over the decades.</p>\n<p>Active containment of SCP-8285 himself is still deemed unnecessary. SCP-8285's reclusive lifestyle meant there was minimal threat to the veil, and due to his now disgraced social status, his impact on the local townspeople was minimal at best. Individuals who had previously recounted SCP-8285\u2019s career, have since been convinced SCP-8285 bowled illegitimately and have refused contact with SCP-8285.</p>\n<p>SCP-8285 continues to deny the allegations put against him and has challenged the reality of these newly created memories and records, although he has thusfar failed to regain his reputation, and if anything, has actively hurt his social status in the community of Blairsville.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8285-C:</strong> Incident Report 17/09/2005</p>\n<p>On the night of the 17th of September 2005, SCP-8285 forced his entry into the Blairsville bowling alley. While Jason Troup was still present on the premises, he only noticed SCP-8285 after he had begun bowling. When Troup confronted SCP-8285, he was told that he would prove all of them wrong. Troup attempted to deescalate the situation, after having contacted the local police department.</p>\n<p>SCP-8285 recorded the game as it was being played. During this time, SCP-8285 recorded 0 strikes and marked numerous frames as invalid or for \u201c0\u201d points, and has at least worsened his physical condition during play, spraining his knee and dislocating his hip.</p>\n<p>SCP-8285 was subsequently transported to the hospital, before being discharged the same night. SCP-8285 was guided back to his home and told to rest; a police report was filed, but Troup refused to press charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8285-D:</strong> Apology Letter</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>To the Roth Estate,</p>\n<p>We are saddened at the death of Earl Roth ( \u271e 08/02/2006).

Due to a low risk assessment, and a sudden lack of social presence within his community, active containment measures have been deemed unnecessary at this time. Following initial containment measures, the threat to the veil is negligible. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=Roth_1.jpg| caption=SCP-8285]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-8285 refers to 87 year old amateur bowler, Earl Roth. SCP-8285 currently resides in the small town of Blairsville, Georgia. SCP-8285 has bowled an estimated 43 perfect games, with eight consecutive perfect games having been recorded at the local bowling alley. [[footnote]] A perfect game in bowling consists of only rolling strikes, leading to a score of 300. [[/footnote]] Though theoretically possible through non-anomalous means, the lack of a pursuit of a professional career in bowling by SCP-8285, combined with the statistical unlikelihood of this accomplishment, it is believed that SCP-8285 has achieved these feats through anomalous means.\n\n\n\nThough the details remain unclear at this time, SCP-8285 is believed to be capable of minor levels of reality bending. This most likely influencing the way the pins scatter after having been struck, allowing him to influence the outcomes of each roll with minimal risk of being caught.\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-8285-A:** Initial Investigation\n\n\n\nSCP-8285\u2019s potential anomalous ability was discovered during a routine sweep of various Georgia counties. Various townspeople were to be questioned about their recollection of SCP-8285\u2019s activity as a bowler.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\nThe local owner of Blairsville\u2019s bowling alley, Jason Troup, was willing to share the history of SCP-8285\u2019s success. Extraneous information was cut.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=All-Star_Bowling_Alley_(Orangeburg_SC)_front_entrance_1.JPG| caption=Blairsville Bowling Alley]]\n\n\n\n**Troup:** Hell of a guy, I tell you. It was like clockwork, you\u2019d come in to get the electronics up and running, make sure the lanes were oiled, and he\u2019d already be knocking at the door. \n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** He was there every single day? Never on break, or working a job or anything?\n\n\n\n**Troup:** I mean he had his days where he was MIA, so to speak. \n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Missing in action? \n\n\n\n**Troup:** Never really felt comfortable to ask him about it. At least not until some weeks had gone by. We knew he struggled a bit health-wise, so we'd get scared sometimes, y'know?\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** How'd he pay for all of this? Beyond the bowling, like groceries and utilities? God knows it ain't free.\n\n\n\n**Troup:** Earl made a fortune off of fool's bets.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** What do you mean by fool\u2019s bets?\n\n\n\n**Troup:** A fool would walk in here. He'd sit down at the lane and just watch Earl sink ball after ball into the gutter. Eventually, once Earl had really reeled him in, he'd ask the fool if he'd like to make it interesting. I\u2019d come out, set up a seven-ten split, or a big four, and the fool would have sold his daughter to place that kinda bet.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** And everyone would just fall for this?\n\n\n\n**Troup:** You're not a bowler, are you?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Not outside of my kid's birthday parties, anyways. Just find it odd so many people would come in and just throw money down. \n\n\n\n**Troup:** They're practically impossible shots to nail. Yet, almost every single time, Earl would knock em' down. Easy money, really. And since it drove traffic in sometimes, I had no issue with letting him bowl for free. Guy was a freak.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Your uh, wall of fame. Bit one sided, huh? \n\n\n\n**Troup:** Well, you can\u2019t really outcompete the best, can you? No one got close to what he could do. Putting anyone else up on that wall would be an insult to Earl. And trust me, no one would want to see their face on that wall, it'd be an insult to the greatest to ever walk these lanes. \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAfterwards, SCP-8285 was approached for comment. Though living mostly a reclusive life due to his age and health complications, SCP-8285 was eager to talk about his past achievements. The interview was held in his living room, which had been carefully decorated with plaques, trophies and certificates, all neatly assorted by their date. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Please, please, come in. Hot as balls out there. Care for some sweet tea?\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** No, I\u2019m fine. Thank you for the offer though.\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Troup called ahead and let me know y\u2019all were doing some digging, shooting a documentary or something?\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Yeah, sort of. We stumbled upon your records, and we were quite intrigued to say the least. Always something special to be in the presence of an all-time great.\n\n\n\n**Roth:** An all-time great? Don\u2019t make me laugh, I\u2019d have to actually bowl with em\u2019 to be considered one. Bowling's just a hobby of mine. End of the day, we're cut from the same cloth.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Well, I can tell you right now, the hall of famers haven\u2019t bowled anywhere close to your level, I mean surely you\u2019d have considered going pro?\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Going pro at a game has to be the silliest thing, y\u2019know? Bowling\u2019s not about the money, or the airtime and certainly no cute girls care about some ol' bowler.\n\n\n\n//Roth laughs, before catching his breath.//\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Y\u2019see, life had dealt me bad hand from the start, you'd think you can\u2019t do nothing but fold... But that didn\u2019t quite sit right by me, y\u2019know?\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Troup mentioned health issues, I'm assuming that's what you're talking about?\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Issues was puttin' it lightly. I wanted to make the most of the life I had left, and that didn\u2019t have me playing in some fancy ol\u2019 venue up in God knows where. It had me sitting down, having a beer with Jason and just bowling in that old, broken down joint.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Made quite a lot of money on those lanes though, huh?\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Sure, but you gotta pay the bills somehow. \n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** I really do find that quite odd, Mr. Roth. \n\n\n\n**Roth:** Earl\u2019s fine, bud. \n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** It's just - you\u2019d have to be stupid to not try to make something out yourself with that talent of yours. Why stop at betting and not just go a step beyond and bowl in tournaments? Travel the country and all that?\n\n\n\n**Roth:** I must be a prime dumbass to you then! \n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** It wasn't meant to get personal.\n\n\n\n**Roth:** To hell with that. Point is, I grew up here, my pops grew up here, my pop-pop grew up here, it's my town.\u00a0\u00a0The PBA just don't get it, talking about some RPM bullshit and all these \"modern\" analytics. At the end of the day, I care about whether or not the pins are knocked down.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Want me to be upfront with you? \n\n\n\n**Roth:** Shoot.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** There\u2019s simply no way you are as good as they claim you are. Your achievements are astronomical, I mean, not even once in a lifetime rare, but flat out impossible. If you take a look at the numb-\n\n\n\n**Roth:** It's not about no damn numbers. You listen here, bu-\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** You're misunderstandi-\n\n\n\n**Roth:** I hear ya' loud and clear. You come in here and tell me what I'm supposed to be capable of? I know damn well how good I bowl, and I know I did it right by God.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** See, I just don't buy that. We've checked hundreds of bowler's stats, and you want to tell me you're the single outlier? It ain't possible, unless of course...\n\n\n\n**Roth:** I see what this is about. You're really gonna sit there in your fancy ol' suit and all and tell me I'm a cheat?\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** A cheat's rubbing it in, I am just saying that whether you were aware of it or not-\n\n\n\n**Roth:** I couldn't live myself to besmirch the beautiful game like that, I got here because of my damn work ethic. I came down to the alley and bowled night and day to get where I am.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** So you really want to sell me the idea that you just somehow are better than the people on the PBA tour? Those players who bowl on some of the most competitive patterns and genuinely understand each facet there is to the game? You\u2019re just that much better, huh?\n\n\n\n**Roth:** Hell, I got the games to prove it! I spent decades perfecting my craft, and if some young buck \"professionals\" ain't able to roll better than me, then that's their problem, not mine.\n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Just skip the bullshit and tell me how you did it Roth. \n\n\n\n**Roth:** I would very much prefer Earl! If you aren't gonna listen to a word I have to say or show me a semblance of respect, then I think we're done here. I ain't going to listen to some wisecracking guy, who's got no idea what it's like to be good at something through sheer grit alone. \n\n\n\n**Agent Belmonte:** Trust me, I\u2019ve got things I\u2019m good at Mr. Roth...\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum SCP-8285-B:** Containment Efforts\n\n\n\nThrough the sheer impossibility of his achievements, it was concluded that SCP-8285 had been capable of high class reality bending. Due to SCP-8285 having retired, containment measures were initially deemed unnecessary, though following an appeal by Agent Belmonte, the following containment protocol was put into place.\n\n\n\nDue to numerous witness accounts certifying SCP-8285\u2019s achievements during his amateur career, it was imperative that these accounts were contested. Amnestic usage was not only recommended, but necessary to prevent any potential threat to the veil posed by the publication of SCP-8285\u2019s accomplishments. \n\n\n\nA report was published, containing information pertaining to SCP-8285 having engaged in fraud throughout his bowling career.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-existing records were contested and altered to reflect the illegitimacy of SCP-8285\u2019s achievements. The fact that SCP-8285 was highly unathletic and never was capable of the high level of bowling that he has claimed was to be reinforced.\n\n\n\nFollowing the publication of the report, SCP-8285 was issued a life-time ban from the local bowling alley, and various awards granted to SCP-8285 were rescinded, including the \u201cBlairsville Committed Citizen Award\u201d, awarded for SCP-8285\u2019s contributions to the local community over the decades.\n\n\n\nActive containment of SCP-8285 himself is still deemed unnecessary. SCP-8285's reclusive lifestyle meant there was minimal threat to the veil, and due to his now disgraced social status, his impact on the local townspeople was minimal at best. Individuals who had previously recounted SCP-8285\u2019s career, have since been convinced SCP-8285 bowled illegitimately and have refused contact with SCP-8285. \n\n\n\nSCP-8285 continues to deny the allegations put against him and has challenged the reality of these newly created memories and records, although he has thusfar failed to regain his reputation, and if anything, has actively hurt his social status in the community of Blairsville.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-8285-C:** Incident Report 17/09/2005\n\n\n\nOn the night of the 17th of September 2005, SCP-8285 forced his entry into the Blairsville bowling alley. While Jason Troup was still present on the premises, he only noticed SCP-8285 after he had begun bowling. When Troup confronted SCP-8285, he was told that he would prove all of them wrong. Troup attempted to deescalate the situation, after having contacted the local police department.\n\n\n\nSCP-8285 recorded the game as it was being played. During this time, SCP-8285 recorded 0 strikes and marked numerous frames as invalid or for \u201c0\u201d points, and has at least worsened his physical condition during play, spraining his knee and dislocating his hip.\n\n\n\nSCP-8285 was subsequently transported to the hospital, before being discharged the same night. SCP-8285 was guided back to his home and told to rest; a police report was filed, but Troup refused to press charges. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-8285-D:** Apology Letter\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the Roth Estate,\n\n\n\nWe are saddened at the death of Earl Roth ( \u271e 08/02/2006).

Do you want to take this to my office?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** That's fine.\n\n> \n\n> //The manager of SCP-888-EX leads Agent Min into the back of SCP-888-EX and into his office, offering Agent Min a seat.//\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** So, the truth is that, uh, I've never actually met dado.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Never?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** No, not once. I have his phone number, but I've never actually met the man.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** How were you hired?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** I saw an ad in the paper a year back, looking for a manager. It said to send in a resume, so I did. A couple days later I got a call saying I was hired and was told to head over here. Once I got here, I had a whole list of tasks and a wad of cash.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** So you just ... started working for dado without ever meeting him?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Yeah... He files all the paperwork and everything fine, I've just never seen him. The job pays well enough and there's nothing illegal going on, so...\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Is it a fair assumption to say that you are responsible for running this, then?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** I'd really say so. I've done all of the hiring and filing. dado is mostly hands off.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** I see. You do have a way to contact dado, correct?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Well, I have his number, I can give you that.\n\n> \n\n> //The manager of SCP-888-EX writes a phone number down and gives it to Agent Min.//\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Thank you. While I'm here, I'd like to ask you about an advertising incident that occurred for this establishment.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** We've never advertised.\n\n> \n\n> //Agent Min produces photos of the billboards modified during Extranormal Event-82901 and places them on the table between himself and the manager of SCP-888-EX.//\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** When did this happen?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Last week.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** So, a couple weeks ago I mentioned to dado that business was slumping a little. He got all worried and said that he'd help me out, set up some advertising for us here. So I guess this is the result of that.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** You've never seen these before?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Never and... oh god, these are awful. They don't have our number or address on them! How are people supposed to find us? And... oh god, \"dirtier skin\"? //Dirtier skin//?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** So I imagine that you have not had an increase in business since then?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Well, now that you mention it... I think the FBI is monitoring us now, it started a week ago. There's all these unmarked vans in the parking lot now; I'm pretty sure I saw some point a geiger counter at me the other day; these guys will show up at the same time, walk in together and then not talk to each other at all while they're here, the whole time walking around looking everywhere. [[footnote]]All of these actions correspond to Foundation attempts to investigate SCP-888-EX.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Ah, well, dado is wanted for involvement in some, illegal activities.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Oh, he actually mentioned something like that once. He said he made \"magic\" drugs that were unlike anything you could get in the world.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Really?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Yeah, I asked him if he could make some magic stuff for here.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** What did he say?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** \"dado not god. dado cannot do all. dado is not in field of anomalaundry.\" Whatever that's supposed to mean.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** That's something.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Yeah, something all right.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** I have to say, your employer seems quite odd. Did he ever explain why he operates like this? With all the no contact? Why does he run this?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** I actually asked him why he was interested in this place. He said he was a \"true capitalist\" and this was a \"way to expand business opportunity\".\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** And you? Why do you work here?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Pays well, and in this economy I can't afford to be picky.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Min:** Well, thank you.

Indeed, it does not appear containable at this time.--\n\n\n\n--Persons and objects affected by SCP-8900 are to be quarantined and destroyed via flash incineration immediately. Flames resulting from this process are to be extinguished by vacuum in complete darkness to suppress the spread of infection. Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to come into contact with persons or objects affected by SCP-8900.--\n\n\n\n--**Addendum 8900-1:** It has been discovered that total darkness is effective in suppressing the spread of symptoms of SCP-8900 in living subjects. Agents Harker and Miriam have been detained and are being kept for study.--\n\n\n\n--**Description:** SCP-8900 is a complex perceptual phenomenon affecting the visible spectrum which seems to be spread by contact. It can be photographed using certain newly developed techniques, however, the process of photographing the anomaly seems to result in faster spread of its effect, and is considered inadvisable.-- \n\n\n\n--SCP-8900 is currently uncontained and theoretically uncontainable. It first began to appear in the mid to late 1800s, as a side effect of certain photography techniques, but was restrained only to the photographic plates themselves and did not spread. Of note is that the appearance of SCP-8900 manifestations in these photographs seems to [REDACTED]elopment of photographic technology. SCP-8900 as we know it today seems to have developed in or around 1935, possibly as a result of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporation's experiments with \"integral tripack\" \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 technology.--\n\n\n\n**Addendum 8900-2:** \n\n[[collapsible show=\"[SECTION AVAILABLE BY O-5 ORDER ONLY]\" hide=\"[From the desk of O5-8]\"]] \n\n//Gentlemen, we have failed. SCP-8900's effects have become so widespread as to be commonplace. The natural blue of the sky has been replaced with a gross and unnatural shade, and the green of trees has been equally corrupted. SCP-8900 has brought ruin down upon the entire visible spectrum, and we have been overrun.// \n\n\n\n//Our attempt at creating an opposing 'infection' has also failed. Although we were successful at restoring the natural colorization of our test subjects, the process seems to render them mute, and now a runner has arrived at my office to tell me that our little experiment has breached containment. Future agents may have to deal with it as an SCP object in its own right.//\n\n\n\n//We are left with only one option, gentlemen. I am activating the Foundation's final failsafe method, The Ennui Protocol.//\n\n\n\n//By the time this message reaches those of you cleared to receive it, Foundation resources on a global scale will have released vast amounts of compound ENUI-5, our most subtle amnestic. Worldwide, men and women who do not deserve the horror wreaked upon them will pause, confused, then resume their business, confident that this is the way it has always been, never knowing what they have lost. Only the photographs not affected by SCP-8900's taint will remain to tell the truth. I regret this, gentlemen. I regret it deeply.//\n\n\n\n//It must be done.//\n\n\n\n-- O5-8.\n\n\n\n//Secure. Contain. Protect.// \n\n\u00a0[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-8900-EX-new.jpg\n\n> **Author:** N/A, [[*user aismallard]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8900-ex The SCP Wiki]\n\n> **Note:** Created by [[*user aismallard]] as an edited version of the image below.\n\n\n\n> **Name:** File:German soldiers marching in Russian summer.jpg\n\n> **Author:** N/A\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:German_soldiers_marching_in_Russian_summer.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-8900-EX", "scp_number": 8900, "series": "explained", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "contagion", "explained", "illustrated", "keter", "light", "phenomenon", "scp", "sensory", "visual"], "title": "SCP-8900-EX", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8900-ex"}, "SCP-920-EX": {"created_at": "2012-03-09T03:45:00", "creator": "spikebrennan", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "spikebrennan", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spikebrennan", "comment": "", "date": "2012-03-09T03:45:00"}, {"author": "spikebrennan", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spikebrennan", "comment": "Added tags: -ex, printer, tale, workgroup.

The printer bears a placard indicating model number E466at but \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 manufactured no such model. The subject's physical components are unremarkable.</p>\n<p>The internal software of the subject printer consist of complex algorithms that affect the functionality of the subject's print function, and the functionality of computers, systems, networks or devices with which the subject directly or indirectly interacts. These effects manifest in several stages (not always in the following sequence):</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Stage</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>Normal functionality.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>Printer occasionally fails to properly execute print commands in any of several ways, including mechanical paper jams, failure to set toner such that print product smears, or displays flashing error codes while refusing to print.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>Same as Stage 2. On occasion, a document sent to printer will appear to print normally but with subtle changes in the content of document.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>Same as Stages 2-3. Other printers connected to the same network, regardless of make and model, will also exhibit Stage 3 behavior. It is believed that the subject propagates code to such other printers in the manner of a computer virus.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>Same as Stages 2-4. Printer (and other printers on the same network) will make dramatic changes to printed documents, including altering or reversing the meaning of text.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>Same as Stages 2-5. Electronic devices in the vicinity of any affected printer, such as enterprise telephone systems and photocopiers, will evince anomalous behavior such as \"phantom\" telephone calls, photocopier paper jams, telephone line static and changes to files stored on computers. The manner in which the algorithms are propagated from affected printers to other hardware is not understood.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>Same as Stages 2-6. Computers connected to the same network as any affected hardware will occasionally engage in spontaneous behavior such as creating and distributing documents such as email messages, Powerpoint presentations, paper memoranda and other files. Affected voicemail systems will produce phantom \"messages\", and users of affected telephone systems will receive phantom telephone calls which originate from SCP-920 but which impersonate the voice and mannerisms of other individuals within the organization. These documents and communications generally appear to be consistent in form with those normally produced by the organization maintaining or using the network, but they purport to change organizational policy or instruct personnel to take, or to refrain from taking, various actions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>Same as Stages 2-7. Mechanical and environmental systems of any structure housing affected equipment will occasionally engage in anomalous behavior. Such behavior may include elevator doors refusing to open, or closing suddenly and with great force; plumbing systems heating water to dangerous temperatures, HVAC systems introducing contaminants into the atmosphere, hazardous electrical shorts from wiring, and a failure of electronic door locks to disengage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>Same as Stages 2-8. Irregular behavior extends to electronic and mechanical systems in proximity to any electronic device that has, in turn, been in proximity to an affected system. Affected systems may include a cellular telephone that has been brought into a building that contains an affected network, a motor vehicle whose passenger cabin contains or formerly contained such a cellular telephone, or electronic systems in locations near such a vehicle.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>SCP-920's algorithms have the consequence of altering the behavior of organizations that use affected systems. The messages that affected systems deliver to individuals appear to originate from those individuals' superiors within the organization's chain of command. Those messages cause the organization to undertake particular policy initiatives, changes in management structure, or other organizational decisions that, when analyzed objectively, are not consistent with the organization's mission or goals. The agenda or underlying intentions of the algorithm are not understood.</p>\n<p>The SCP-920 algorithms are believed to incorporate self-preservation functionality. Among the actions and policy decisions that the SCP-920 causes an organization's personnel to undertake are actions that facilitate the acceleration of the spread of the algorithms, and that hinder actions that are likely to retard it. In particular, Stage 08 and 09 behavior appear to occur only when necessary in order to prevent an individual from interfering with the algorithm.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery Notes</strong>: SCP-920 was recovered from the headquarters of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Insurance Company in 20\u2588\u2588. The insurance company had become insolvent and entered receivership following a pattern of promoting unsuitable employees to positions of responsibility within the institution, which appears to have commenced approximately five months after the company had obtained and installed SCP-920 in its offices. This time period also coincided with seemingly arbitrary, and unsound, policy changes in the company's insurance underwriting and human resources practices.</p>\n<p>The subject came to the Foundation's attention after Foundation agents recovered the body of Jermaine \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was the assistant information technology officer for the company. He had asphyxiated in his automobile in the garage of his residence; investigation of the scene indicated that Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had entered his vehicle and activated the motor, but was then unable to operate the automatic garage door or the vehicle's power locks before he was overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning. Handwritten notes found on Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's person referred to SCP-920 and outlined a plan to remove it from the company office building and destroy it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Policy\u00a0Directive\u00a0K-23396-D6</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Policy Directive K-23396-D6 dated \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-20\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>SCP-920 is to be removed from containment and returned to normal service in the Accounts Payable department at the Foundation's administrative headquarters.
