Throughout all Groups of Interest included in the analysis, including the Foundation, we have identified an improbably high occurrence of temporal anomalies being lost, and an evident correlation to losses due to understaffing. The Manna Charitable Foundation is the worst affected, retaining less than one per cent of temporal anomalies after three months.

That\u2019s what your implying, right? These\u2026 Zero-ists are erasing people so they can steal everyone\u2019s anomalies?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-02:</strong> Yes.

Every influence those erased have had on the Foundation would be lost \u2013 information, discovered anomalies, averted containment breaches\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-05:</strong> We could use AICs; as competent as a person, but infinitely replaceable. Standard copy-and-pasting won\u2019t do, though; if this GOI erased one of the AICs, we\u2019d lose all the duplicates copied from it too.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> So they\u2019re useless.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-05:</strong> No, we just\u2026 have to go about it differently.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Do you have a proposal?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-05:</strong> I need a few minutes to think, but\u2026 I have an idea, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> AIs aren\u2019t enough.

The focus of this group is the complete eradication of everything, from all of time \u2013 even if we do stop them from changing history and confiscate Null Sum, they will keep looking for other ways to do the same, and they only have to succeed once. As much as I dislike it, I don\u2019t see any choice other than completely destroying the group, or at least changing their fundamental beliefs.

This meeting may now proceed. Overseer Thirteen, please present your reason for requesting this proceeding.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I need to oversee Black Dogma. Personally.</p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-01:</strong> Overseer Thirteen, could you please elaborate on this necessity?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I <em>must</em> be allowed to oversee and direct Operation Black Dogma, to ensure Ulysses isn\u2019t affected by it.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> <em>[Sighs.]</em> Not this again\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> If you just tell us \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I will not disclose Ulysses\u2019 identity.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-03:</strong> Then how can you expect us to keep them safe?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> By allowing me to oversee the operation \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> No! No, this is ridiculous. The only three departments we need for Dogma are Task Forces, the Techies, and the Diplomats. That puts Three, Five, and Ten in charge. We don\u2019t need your department and we don\u2019t need you, so why the hell would we put you in charge?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> The loss of Ulysses \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> Can be easily avoided if you just <em>give us the name.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-03:</strong> I agree. If you\u2019re genuinely concerned, we can take that into consideration and adjust our course accordingly \u2013 but beyond that, I don\u2019t see any reason for you to be involved.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> \u2026 reality benders. We\u2019re only targeting reality benders in Black Dogma.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-01:</strong> The approved proposal for Operation Black Dogma \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> Affects the whole Zeroist group, I know, but the only people that will get <em>hurt</em> are reality benders.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Your point?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> Well, if you\u2019re worried Ulysses will get hurt, then they must be a reality bender, no? One, remind me if I\u2019m wrong, but doesn\u2019t the charter expressly forbid us from working with reality benders?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-01:</strong> The Administrator\u2019s Charter prohibits the Foundation from creating or utilising anomalies for any reasons, and the manipulation of reality is classed as an anomalous phenomenon. Foundation personnel, including the Overseer Council, are therefore prohibited from collaborating with reality manipulators.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> Right, and if an Overseer breaks the charter\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-01:</strong> They are liable for immediate dismissal from the Council, and further penalties as determined by an court of inquiry conducted by the Department of Internal Security.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> I motion for Overseer Thirteen to be stripped of his position, on the grounds he is collaborating with and utilising an anomalous individual \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I did not say that Ulysses is a reality bender.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> Then you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about, since Black Dogma won\u2019t hit them if they aren\u2019t a reality bender, so there\u2019s no need for you to run the operation!</p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> \u2026 not necessarily.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> <em>Not necessarily?</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Operation Black Dogma is causally reliant on the completion of Project Polychrome. If the latter is retroactively erased, the former will be as well.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-05:</strong> \u2026 yes, but we\u2019ve taken every precaution we can to protect Project Polychrome from being altered. Everyone involved is completely anonymous, they have no reason to suspect we did anything more than approve the project \u2013 which anyone in our position could have done \u2013 and even otherwise, everyone on this council has been anonymous for decades thanks to our standard procedures. The Zeroists can\u2019t identify any specific person that was critical to Project Polychrome, their only choice is to erase the entire Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> No. They only need to erase one person.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-04:</strong> Oh, <em>hell.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-05:</strong> What? Who? How?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-04:</strong> <em>Ulysses.</em></p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> If the Zeroists erase Ulysses, they erase our discovery of their existence, and everything we have done in response. We would also lose all of Ulysses\u2019 previous contributions to the Foundation \u2013 not least of which is our survival of the 20\u2019s Crisis. We cannot afford to lose Ulysses.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> Then we need to protect them \u2013 Thirteen, <em>give us</em> \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Their name?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> Yes!</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> You want me to identify them, so you can record how to avoid harming them during Black Dogma?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> Yes, that\u2019s \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> A record that implies they are someone of extreme importance to us? A record the Zeroists could acquire \u2013 with time, or simply rewriting history until they do \u2013 to find the one, single individual who revealed their existence?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-07:</strong> We don\u2019t have to say that they\u2019re Ulysses \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-03:</strong> No, he\u2019s right. If we spare one of the Zeroists for no apparent reason, they\u2019ll get suspicious, and the fastest conclusion to come to is that they\u2019re a traitor. Erase the traitor, erase the problem.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> What if we spare several of them at random?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-04:</strong> Either they all get erased, or we risk survivors who can revive the group.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> I don\u2019t see how this changes anything. If Ulysses is a reality bender, we knock them off as usual so they can\u2019t erase themself; if they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re an average joe we aren\u2019t aiming for anyway, and they\u2019ll blend in with all the other joes we spare. Either way, we still don\u2019t need Thirteen involved!</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> You are overlooking the <em>ramifications</em> of our actions. Our goal is to change the fundamental beliefs of the Zeroist\u2019s faith \u2013 as with any religion some will accept them, others will not, and conflict will ensue between them. Conflict which the Zeroists will react to as they always have \u2013 by erasing their competition. Regardless of Ulysses\u2019 capabilities and position within the group, as long as someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 even suspects they are aligned with the opposing division, there is a catastrophically high risk they will erase Ulysses and unknowingly remove our influence over the group.</p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence elapse.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I <em>must</em> be allowed to oversee and direct Operation Black Dogma, to ensure Ulysses isn\u2019t affected by it. Their anonymity is their best protection, and the fact no-one else here knows anything conclusive about them, despite your repeated attempts using the extensive resources at your disposal, proves that I am aptly competent at preserving that anonymity even beneath intense scrutiny. None of you have prior experience with Ulysses, and any one of you could make a mistake that reveals their identity. This is not a time we can afford any mistakes, nor risk them.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-03:</strong> You don\u2019t have any experience with operations of this size \u2013 you could make a mistake that we could have avoided. We can\u2019t give it all over to you.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Then don\u2019t. I am not asking for singular control; I am asking for notification as events unfold, and permission to intervene when necessary. Control of the operation will remain with you, Five, and Ten. My intrusions may seem illogical and I will not be able to explain them, but I will only act to protect Ulysses, and I will aim to be as minimally interruptive and detrimental as possible. Does this sound reasonable?</p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-01:</strong> Are there any further concerns or comments that anyone would like to raise before we conduct a vote regarding Overseer Thirteen\u2019s request?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-06:</strong> I don\u2019t like this. At all.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Do you have an alternative?</p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Subsequent vote was 7-3-3 in favour; motion for Overseer Thirteen to oversee Operation Black Dogma, in addition to Overseers Three, Five, and Ten, approved.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span><strong>Operation Black Dogma</strong></span></h3>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Credentials\u00a0check</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Credentials\u00a0verified.\u00a0Displaying\u00a0file,\u00a0clearance\u00a0Level\u00a06</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2><span>Operation Black Dogma</span></h2>\n<h4><span>Operation Serial LQN-PZ88-5403</span></h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic\">\n<p>O5-01<br/>\nHigh Command</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The strategic dissemination of misinformation throughout GOI-4379 (\u2018Zeroists\u2019) to portray the anomalous capabilities of reality manipulating individuals as undesirable, to deter the group from utilising such capabilities for their own benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong> Using information covertly collected during earlier investigation into GOI-4379, VictorJohnDunneSmith.aic will create several independent AICs, which will contact members of GOI-4379 strongly motivated by self-guilt and/or more likely to accept reality manipulation as undesirable. These AICs will present themselves as former acquaintances who were improperly erased from reality, referring to personal information where necessary to convince the contacted parties, and vehemently request that GOI-4379 immediately cease all retroactive erasure activities on religious and moral grounds, as the (perceived) loss of all memories regarding the individuals prevents them from being totally erased from existence.</p>\n<p>A falsified Level 1 SCP document (SCP-2439, \u2018Forgotten Voices\u2019) will be disseminated to all Foundation personnel as mandatory reading, detailing digital communications from retroactively erased individuals as a newly encountered and ongoing anomalous occurrence; this file will be encountered by all GOI-4379 adherents within the Foundation, portraying the AIC\u2019s communications as genuine. This file will be decommissioned at a future period after the conclusion of Operation Black Dogma.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Zeroists, of course, will react by trying to erase the AICs, free them from the burden of half-existence they\u2019re stuck in. There\u2019s nothing we can do about that \u2013 if the AICs disagree, it\u2019ll immediately break the illusion.</p>\n<p>But depending on how the Zeroists\u2019 method works, this could actually <em>increase</em> Black Dogma\u2019s success; if the changes follow a path of least resistance \u2013 which it seems to \u2013 then erasing an AIC would just mean a slightly different one was created to do and say the exact same things.</p>\n<p>To the Zeroists, it\u2019d look like irrefutable proof that some, most, or all of the people they erase are actually damned to a half-existence the group views as abominable.

The entirety of GOI-4379 now perceives the retroactive erasure of individuals by reality manipulators as grossly immoral; while several cells initially voiced disapproval or suspicion against this, intercepted discussions revealed that the religion opposes the formation of any internal divisions, and so these groups acquiesced to the majority consensus of GOI-4379. It is possible, but unconfirmable, that the internal conflict predicted by O5-13 resulted in the retroactive erasure of all dissidents who would not accept this change.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span><strong>Truncated Interview with GOI-4379 Agent</strong></span></h3>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Credentials\u00a0check</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Credentials\u00a0verified.\u00a0Displaying\u00a0file,\u00a0clearance\u00a0Level\u00a06</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Informant for GOI-4379 (\u2018Zeroists\u2019)</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Mobile Task Force Gamma-1 (\u2018Lime Left Hand\u2019) Agent</p>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Identifying information removed to prevent retroactive erasure of either participant.

Even if there was, there\u2019s no possible way of doing it without being paradoxical \u2013 describing something says what it <em>is</em>, but nonexistence <em>isn\u2019t</em>. If I say it\u2019s black, then there is no colour black; it can\u2019t be alive, nor dead, nor inanimate, because those are characteristics that exist. I can\u2019t describe what it is because everything I\u2019d say is what it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> But that\u2019s a description. It\u2019s everything that isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Informant:</strong> But that\u2019s the thing \u2013 it isn\u2019t. Describing by negation, saying what something <em>is not</em> is just a vaguer way of saying what it <em>is</em>. It can\u2019t be black, because black exists \u2013 but it can\u2019t <em>not</em> be black, because it would <em>be</em> something that lacks the colour black. So it can\u2019t be either. It is what it isn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t what it is, but it\u2019s neither at the same time.</p>\n<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Informant:</strong> You don\u2019t get it, do you.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Not really, no.</p>\n<p><strong>Informant:</strong> Alright, uhh\u2026 the name.

Nonexistence <em>exists</em>, because we\u2019ve named it.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Mhm.</p>\n<p><strong>Informant:</strong> So when we say \u2018nonexistence\u2019, we aren\u2019t really talking about nonexistence \u2013 we\u2019re talking about a fa\u00e7ade of it. <em>That</em> is what I\u2019m describing \u2013 I\u2019m describing the fa\u00e7ade of nonexistence, as best I can, but in truth I can\u2019t really describe nonexistence itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> So when your group uses zero as an example\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Informant:</strong> It\u2019s a parable of a parable. Nonexistence can\u2019t really be understood except in relation to itself, but we\u2019re so used to existing, with everything being interconnected and comparable, that we just\u2026 can\u2019t process anything outside of that, anything isolated from everything else. The only way to lead people to it, to help them even begin to understand, is to compare it to the system of existence, and overlook how wrong the connection is.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> It <em>is</em> difficult to understand otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Informant:</strong> Exactly!
