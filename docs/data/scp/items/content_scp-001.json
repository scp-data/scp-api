Black Adytum was described by contemporary sources as an 'ancient metropolis', a 'dead city', a 'city of the dead', a 'mausoleum, a 'tomb-nation', a 'failed experiment', a 'monument to atrocity', and various other descriptors.</p>\n<p>As of writing, the Hussein Hypothesis is the current prevailing belief among Parahistory Division experts: that Black Adytum never existed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2><span>Section 001.1</span></h2>\n<h3><span><tt>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</tt></span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<h4><span>PARAHISTORY</span></h4>\n<p>The six <strong>Aegean Tablets</strong> recovered from the Sea of Crete by the French Crown's <em>Estate noir</em> prior to the Revolution were the first discovered mentions of Bronze Age advanced human civilizations, and led directly to the discovery of Amoni-Ram and later Mamjul &amp; Korar. The full set of six tablets were finally fully translated in 2020. They deal with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I. The existence of a 'forgotten world' ruled by three massive, technologically and magically advanced empires;</li>\n<li>II. The origins of the Daevic Covenant;</li>\n<li>III. The origins of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4;</li>\n<li>IV. The origins of the Cult of the Broken God and the Mekhanite Empire;</li>\n<li>V. Details of the apocalyptic war between the three;</li>\n<li>VI. Theories on the origin of the 'three-prong army' that swept across Asia, annihilating the aforementioned cultures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sixth tablet was damaged before entering Foundation custody, leaving it partially unreadable. The Parahistory Division's translation of the third tablet is attached:</p>\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT \u2014 DECEMBER 2020</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nRoot. <strong>Blood.</strong> Steel.\n<p>Blood spilling from the gaping wounds of Yaldabaoth, as he lies sundered and weeping on the coast of the sea. Run through and maimed by its brethren, cast down to earth just as they were cast down to earth by him. Hot tears of pain, of betrayal, filling the once-dry canyon, turning it into an open bay as he dies a god's death.</p>\n<p>Blood spilt onto the boards of the great grand ships as the cruel slavemasters flay the skin off the backs of their stock. Moans of pain from the flock without a shepherd as they row forward, begging for deliverance from agony. The fleet landing on the sandy shores of their new territory, slaves being led off the arks in chains to lay the foundations of their masters' kingdom.</p>\n<p>Blood dripping from the brow of a nameless slave as he marches with five others, dragging huge blocks of stone to the new kingdom's first creation: Adytum, a temple, vast and grand, nestled safely into the ground as an offering to their lord Scarlet. Endless corridors in this underground labyrinth, meant to hold the bodies of the hundred-hundred slaves sacrificed for this construction.</p>\n<p>Blood leaking as he stumbles, foot catching, over a sharp bone protruding from the silt and soil. He and his slave-brethren kneel, digging out the clay for two days and two nights until the whole of Yaldabaoth's form lies exposed, weeping and bleeding and dying. Flesh and bone, knitted into a mass, meat thrumming with dominance, with superiority, with power.</p>\n<p>Blood gushing as he kneels, shearing into the meat with a crude knife of bone, taking the sacred flesh into his mouth, chewing and swallowing, eating his God, becoming divine. Blood flooding the gutters of the Nameless City as the slaves rise up with him, overthrowing their yokes and slaughtering their erstwhile masters. Blood pooling as his followers take the ritual, taking a piece of the divine into them, as Yaldabaoth bleeds and weeps, cursing the name the slave has chosen: I\u016bn of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, Witch-King of Black Adytum.</p>\n</div>\n<p>As discovered by Doctors Robert Aram and Hedvig Nussbaum, large parts of Mekhanite dogma were predicated on a deep-seated cultural hatred for the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, stemming chiefly from their liberal use of carnomancy \u2014 flesh magic, which flew in direct opposition to the Cult of the Broken God's transhumanist beliefs. This religious divergence was one of the chief causes for the First Occult War that erupted in Asia in the second millenium BC between the Broken Empire, the Daevic Covenant, and the N\u00e4lk\u00e4. The war of attrition would result in a catastrophic decline of all three cultures before their eventual toppling by the Three-Prong Army (likely associated with the historical Sea Peoples), led by the BLACKSTAR.</p>\n<p>As related by Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat in SCP-001-JADE, the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 culture group has roots in the Daeva of Mamjul and Korar. As part of the Daevic initiative to settle the rest of Asia, a colonial group of several thousand Daeva and their slaves were dispatched to the land surrounding the Yellow Sea. The impossibility of communication meant that after years of no word from the new colony, it was generally assumed by the Daeva that the colony had failed. It was only several centuries later that they encountered the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, and even later that the possible connection between the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 and the failed Daeva colonial project was considered.</p>\n<p>Until the translation of the third tablet, the sole point of evidence for the Daeva claim of inheritance was the Rajmata herself; prior to her death, she insisted that she later recognized one of the slaves in the colonial group as the man who would eventually become Witch-King I\u016bn.</p>\n<h4><span>HUSSEIN HYPOTHESIS</span></h4>\n<p>The Hussein Hypothesis, meant to provide a possible answer for why the Foundation had been unable to locate Black Adytum despite a three-decade long search, was first publically submitted to the Foundation Academic Service at the 2032 PARAHIS conference by then-Deputy Director Youssef Hussein.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-right: 5px rgb(var(--bright-accent)) solid;\">\n<h2><span>Abstract</span></h2>\n<p>For three decades, parahistorians and archaeologists have dedicated their efforts towards locating the legendary capital city-state of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 culture-group, Black Adytum. Initiated by the Foundation in the early 2000s, the search has expanded throughout central-east Asia and has yielded findings suggesting N\u00e4lk\u00e4n settlements in China, Mongolia, and Siberia with concrete geographical and temporal links to the Xia and Shang dynasties of Imperial China. Of particular interest, there have been discoveries at Shang archaeological sites of several mummified corpses and bone carvings which bear the hallmarks N\u00e4lk\u00e4n culture and religion.</p>\n<p>However, in this paper, I will contend that the evidence suggests that the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 were a confederation of several autonomous, nomadic tribes without a central capital or leadership throughout most of their history. Archaeological evidence also supports a tribal unification in a defensive effort against the BLACKSTAR entity before eventual assimilation into Shang culture as a religious minority. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that Black Adytum never existed as an imperial capital as previously assumed but perhaps instead an abstract concept of unification or some lost cultural ideal.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Hussein Hypothesis was initially controversial, but over the following decade, a continued lack of return on the Black Adytum Initiative and further archaeological evidence of a disseminated N\u00e4lk\u00e4n society made it increasingly appealing, and following Hussein's promotion to Director of the Parahistory Division, it became the <em>de facto</em> accepted theory across the Foundation.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2><span>Section 001.2</span></h2>\n<h3><span><tt>RESEARCH REFOCUS</tt></span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>On August 25th, 2041, the O5 Council met with Parahistory Division Director Youssef Hussein for the scheduled annual update regarding the progress of the Black Adytum Initiative.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT \u2014 AUGUST 2041</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Secure Ley connection established.

I'm inclined to agree with some parts of it.</p>\n<p><em>[HUSSEIN raises his gaze.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> You are?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Particularly this segment \u2014 \"Since the relative success of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, we have chosen to exercise the same search model as helped us discover that city, without acknowledging the sheer happenstance associated with Doctor Galanis' discovery of Mamjul, nor the obvious differences between the Daevic Covenant and N\u00e4lk\u00e4 cultures.\" I've been looking into the records \u2014 pardon my optimism. What kinds of search practices do you exercise?</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> An extensive pattern of satellite-identified archaeological sites of interest that are then investigated by a ground team to determine any likely connections or archaelogical information we don't know already.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> \"Search efforts were initially concentrated near established archaeological sites.\"</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> Yes, they were.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry \u2014 I was reading from the SCP-001-JADE file. It doesn't seem that our search model has really altered all that much since Dr. Galanis disappeared.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> Well. What would you suggest, Overseer?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I noticed that the Initiative relies excessively on archaeological evidence but hasn't really made use of a human element. There are a number of native ethnic groups in the region of central China we're searching, but it doesn't seem like we've made much of an effort to tap them for information.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> They are <em>extremely</em> reticent to speak with us. They think of us as foreign scientists \u2014 which they're not wrong about. Even the non-anomalous groups already face constant pressure and persecution from the state; they're insular, not fond of outsiders.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I understand that, but it seems like a potential well of knowledge we decided to skip over because it was too hard.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> What group are you referring to specifically?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Ari?</p>\n<p><em>[Secretary KATSAROS hands O5-2 a sealed manila folder. He removes the tamper tape and flicks through the papers inside.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Here we are. Sorry if I'm pronouncing this wrong \u2014 the 'Sarkic'?</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> The name is familiar. A small ethnoreligious minority occupying ancestral lands in the borderlands between China and Mongolia. Some anomalous capabilities, but nothing that's stuck out to warrant significant study, if I recall correctly. They're a bit backwards, I think \u2014 prefer to retain their tribal structure with minimal outside interference. They're a dwindling population. Maybe a hundred, hundred-fifty left alive.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I see we've had some limited interaction with them?</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> My predecessor interviewed them as part of a survey of local mythologies. Attempted to interview them, I should say. They conversation lasted for two minutes, and ended with the tip of a spear.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Not productive, I'm guessing.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> No. Since then we've sent an emissary to their lands every few years to try and speak with them. We exchange a few words, maybe they accept a few token gifts, and send us on our way without anything of substance. We've stepped in to prevent them from being 'integrated' by the Chinese for the sake of keeping track of members of an anomalous population, but that's the extent of our meaningful interactions. They simply do not want to talk to outsiders.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I see.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> You understand now; either the locals are unwilling to speak to anyone, or they're of no help.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I don't have any reason to believe they're unwilling to speak to <em>anyone</em>. Just people.</p>\n<p><em>[The Council members exchange glances.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Two?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> AIAD has recently hit a number of benchmarks on a new Gen9 .aic model, XENOPHON.

Fine motor control of a mechanical shell, even.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Sentience?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> It's difficult to say. Independent thought, for sure. The most lifelike construct we've ever had.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> What are you suggesting?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> The plan for the Gen9s was always to see if they could perform the job of analytical researchers, to assist them and eventually replace them in the field. This feels like a perfect test case.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> You can't be serious.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> They don't even want to speak to other people, and you're trying to get them to speak to a robot?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> If they don't take us up on it, then\u2026 they don't talk to us? They're already not talking to us. Nothing changes. There's no compelling reason <em>not</em> to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> Except possibly earning their ire and shaking a beehive there is no reason to shake. If they grow angry enough at us, who knows what they're capable of?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> It's one interview. If it works, we have a new lead.

They did not note any paranormal or supernatural capabilities, and the Sarkic are a relatively minor footnote in the record. The records do note that the 'chieftain' was a young woman who they met with only briefly. The Sarkic appear only a handful of times in the historical record following that, one of which is in Lord Blackwood's journals, recording a meeting with SCP-1867 as part of his survey of 'mystical savages' in the region.</p>\n<p>Lord Blackwood attested that the Sarkic had some natural affinity for 'black magic'; while now an out-of-date and backwards understanding of magic, the term was fairly widespread at the time and encompassed a wide swath of religious beliefs and anomalies. He does not offer details in his writings (which focus more on a fascination with the culinary practices of the Sarkic), but he does write of a unique capacity for shared genetic memory, with members of the tribe remembering some events from the same point of view, including events they were not alive for. The exact mechanism through which this is accomplished is unclear.</p>\n<p>He also recorded that the Sarkic population exhibited a frequency of deformities and birth defects much higher than normal. He ascribed this to the tribe's aggressive isolationism which, taken with their depleting numbers (three to four hundred at the time), resulted in significant inbreeding to sustain their population and a depleting gene pool. He did not perform population studies or ethnography to confirm this, and quickly earned the ire of the population for his insistence on it; his party was removed shortly thereafter, and the Sarkic have remained frosty towards re-establishing relations with outsiders.</p>\n<p>The Sarkic were packaged with several other ethnic groups studied by Whelp under the Macklin Agreement in 1921, in which the Foundation assumed custody over the listed ethnic groups with the understanding that containment would be upheld; in return, the Republic of China ceded the rural land the tribes occupied. The Macklin Agreement's signing relied on the weakness of the Chinese state at the time, and has since repeatedly been a point of contention with the People's Republic of China as the legal inheritor of the agreement.</p>\n<p>The Sarkic tribes now occupy a sovereign, Foundation-administered parcel of land in Inner Mongolia, and largely refuse all contact with outsiders. They are believed to have a complex religious faith. The current Foundation contact of the tribe is the Karcist Halyna Ieva, a religious leader.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>N.b. 'Sarkic' is the collective plural identifier for the tribe, akin to 'Navajo' or 'Inuit'. An individual member of the tribe may be called a 'Sarkite'.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>In accordance with O5-2's orders, XENOPHON.aic was securely transported to Staging Site-78 in Sichuan, China on November 20th, 2041, where a small convoy awaited with members of Mobile Task Force Pi-9 and Liaison Tai Jiang from the Diplomatic Corps.

I've made more progress than anyone has before me, and they still won't interact with us for more than a few minutes at a time. So, before you do something to alienate them and ruin all that, here's a quick list of things you shouldn't do: don't cut them off while they're speaking. Don't question their traditions, clothing, or architecture. Don't ask them what a certain word means. Don't try to force gifts onto them, or ask for anything they haven't offered already.

Most are whispering to each other.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Where are we going?</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> All my dealings and conversations have been with Ieva. She's something of a religious leader for them.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON points out a large central tent near the middle of the camp, sitting in front of a tall stele.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> There?</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> No. That's the Grand Karcist's \u2014 the chief's \u2014 tent.

The steady drumbeat continues, growing louder as they approach the center of the encampment. It is joined now by several voices singing \u2014 deep and guttural, in an unknown language. The music is haunting, rising into the air. The center of the camp is obscured from view by a large crowd of Sarkites forming a ring around the central stele. The crowd parts around them, offering them passage and a view into the central circle.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Here. Sit.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON and the researchers kneel in the dirt. The clearing is a dozen meters across, with the stele in the rough center. The singing continues \u2014 it is at once mournful and joyful. Looking around, it is clear all the Sarkites are contributing to the song, and the intensity of it is deafening. IEVA leaves the researchers, limping to the stele on her cane. The song quiets slightly for her to speak, but does not stop.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;You think we gather now because one of our number has closed his eyes for the final time. No.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Murmurs run through the crowd. A few hang their heads.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;You think we gather now because his flesh has failed him. No. Hattak has gone. His body no longer draws breath. The container for his soul is lifeless. But has his flesh failed him? No.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She shakes her head, lowering her hood.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Hattak was the best of us. He was born with us, and he has died with us. He has sired two children with us, and he has loved a woman with us.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She raises a hand towards a woman in the crowd; she holds the hands of a young child tightly. Despite her tear-streaked face, she smiles back at the Karcist.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;He was human, like us. To live is to die. To be flesh is to decay. It cannot be stopped, because it must not be stopped. Life feeds death. Death feeds life. The cow keels over in the field. Has the flesh failed? The worms feast on it, and give birth to their own spawn. Are they not flesh too?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The song is in a lull now, Sarkites nodding to IEVA's words. She signals to someone; after a few moments, two Sarkites come out, carrying something wrapped in oiled canvas. They gently bring it down at her feet. She kneels.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Hattak was the greatest of us \u2014 he died with us after a life well lived. The cow feeds the worms, the worms feed the soil, the soil feeds the grass, the grass feeds the cow.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The song pitches up again, with faint voices joined by booming guttural notes.

He is naked, marked with the pallor of death.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;We fed Hattak. And now he will feed us.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She reaches into her robes, drawing a dagger made of bleached and carved bone.

Sing.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The singing reaches another zenith as IEVA brings the blade down, slicing down through the corpse's chest. The flesh gives way easily, blood oozing out of the wound as she reaches in and pulls his ribcage apart. The cracking of bones is audible even over the singing and drums. Her hand roots around inside for some time until she draws it back \u2014 gripping the heart tightly, blood vessels still hanging from it. The blood drips down her fingers, down her forearm, onto the grass.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER SAYLE:</strong> You don't think she's going to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> No. No.</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA lifts the heart up and bites into it, teeth tearing into the muscle.

When she rises, her face has a different air to it. Nothing has overtly changed, but the features of her face seem sharper, older, more weathered. She limps across the clearing, now walking as though the cane were an unfamiliar obstruction. She reaches the woman she raised a hand at earlier, and touches a bloodied palm to her cheek, leaning forward and kissing her on the forehead.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;He misses you more than life itself.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The woman is still sobbing, but a half-smile forms underneath the tears.

XENOPHON and the researchers stare at the scene.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> What are they doing?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> They are butchering him.</p>\n<p><em>[Each Sarkite she touches smiles, whispers something to her, and joins the others at the corpse, where the body is being unceremoniously butchered. Joints are broken apart, and the knife is used to cleave meat from the bone. The body's thighs, chest, and organs are separated into piles, blood pooling on the oiled canvas.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER CHRISTOFF:</strong> Fuck. I think I'm gonna be sick.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Control yourself.</p>\n<p><em>[As the body is broken apart, the Sarkites waste no time in indulging. The men gravitate towards the muscle meat, while the women and children take pieces of the organs. The meat is devoured raw and without preparation. A child wanders by. He casts a wary look at XENOPHON, but offers a bleeding, fist-sized chunk of brain matter to JIANG, who recoils and waves the boy off. The researchers are all thoroughly disturbed and disgusted.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> This is\u2026 a fucked up way to mourn.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Look at them.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I'd really rather not.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> They are not mourning. They are celebrating.</p>\n<p><em>[As they eat the flesh, the Sarkites' demeanors change. Rather than subdued mourning, they are now embracing one another, laughing and chatting as blood drips from bone to hand to dirt. IEVA is speaking to a small group of men, along with the woman.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;He remembered the day after his wedding his whole life.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The men laugh, clapping each other on the back.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SARKITE WOMAN:</strong> &lt;He remembers you taking him to the hill on the edge of the \u2014 you never told me of this!&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SARKITE MAN:</strong> &lt;We swore him to silence. Told him if he hurt you, we'd ruin him so badly\u2014&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SARKITE WOMAN:</strong> &lt;That even Ieva wouldn't be able to fix him. I am borne of animals.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She shakes her head, amused. IEVA drifts away to let them reminisce.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Genetic memory. They are able to access the memories of their dead by consuming their flesh.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> That's\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><em>[He goes silent, staring intently at IEVA as she walks over to the child of the deceased. He is a young boy, clinging tightly to his mother's leg, watching the proceedings with wide eyes. IEVA kneels awkwardly, offering the boy something in a cupped palm: an eyeball, severed optic nerve still dangling from it. He reaches for it tentatively, encouraged by IEVA and his mother. Finally he pops it into his mouth, crushing it into white jelly between his teeth and swallowing. A soft, celebratory cheer rises up through those assembled, and IEVA reaches out with the same bloodied hand to paint the boy's cheeks red.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;You have lived a thousand lives with us.

Stories of a witch-king rising from the chains of slavery and eating the very gods. Stories of bloody conquest and sacrifice.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Then you know more about me than I do.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN shakes his head, staring into the fire. There are a number of bones in the flames, baking in the low heat.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> My memories are broken. Fractured. Flashes of cities burning. Torrents of blood in the waterways. A lumbering giant. An army that blotted out the sun. Images, with no thread binding them.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> When do your memories come together?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Years ago. Waking up in this very tent. People surrounding me. A people expecting a leader.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> How long ago was that?</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> A hundred and sixteen years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Your people. The N\u00e4lk\u00e4.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN looks at XENOPHON with a confused expression.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> No. N\u00e4lk\u00e4 means \u2014 community, people. Largeness.

The smoke dances.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I don't know. There is too much I don't know. That my people don't know. And so we cling to what faded rituals I can remember.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You remember the art of fleshcrafting.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Scraps. Little tricks. And even these exhaust me.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You are very young.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN smiles sadly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I do not age. I am frozen in place. I have watched my people go from wandering the steppe to \u2014 this. Corralled in the pen this country gives us. Wasting away. We numbered in the thousands, once. And now we hide in our camps, praying in the cover of darkness. We receded during the wars. You are the first outsider to witness our practices in decades.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> That is unfortunate.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> But not unpredictable. I am blind to my past, but I see the future, written in the bones. My people, wasting away to nothing.</p>\n<p><em>[She shifts the bones in the fire again.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I expected you to be offended by my existence.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> My knowledge of your people's spiritual beliefs suggest you reject technology.</p>\n<p><em>[She shakes her head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Tch. Simplistic, reductive. We reject that which robs of us of our humanity. We are not blind. We <em>choose</em> to live this way. It brings us closer to our humanity.

I hope you'll forgive the suddenness. Director Hussein is calling in from \u2014 well, it doesn't really matter. You have updates for me?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Yes. I have forwarded recording packets from my discussions with the Grand Karcist I\u016bn.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> We've already reviewed them. This is\u2026 an interesting development.</p>\n<p><em>[HUSSEIN raises a hand dismisssively.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> A fascinating one. But not a surprising one.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> All due respect, Director, you don't think finding <em>the Grand Karcist I\u016bn</em> is surprising?</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> I think we've found someone <em>claiming</em> to be the Grand Karcist I\u016bn. Without any evidence, we really have no reason to believe she's telling the truth. Her conveniently-absent memory means we can't question her, either.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> And her longevity? The carnomancy? The ritual? This is exactly what the Daeva claimed the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 were capable of.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> And we already knew the Sarkic tribe had some level of anomalous capabilities. <em>(Turning to O5-2)</em> Honestly, I believe this is just more support for my theory, Overseer.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> How do you figure that?</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> Clearly this is a small tribe with an independent cultural identity. They don't consider themselves N\u00e4lk\u00e4 \u2014 they don't even have a conception of the idea of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, because the confederation of tribes dissolved after the war. This is just one tribe that managed to persist into the modern day \u2014 impressive, but unless they can tell us anything further, historiographically useless.</p>\n<p><em>[O5-2 nods, and is silent for a moment before looking up.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Xenophon?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Overseer.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Your analysis of the Sarkic?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> The genetic memory is an interesting phenomenon \u2014 regular consumption of human flesh would explain their higher-than-average rate of physical deformities. But it would also cause prion diseases that would devastate their population. There is no evidence of that, at the moment. They appear to be unaware of their history. I\u016bn's recollection does not extend past the modern era, and members are more concerned with their immediate daily lives than with their historical legacy. Their religious practices bear superficial resemblance to the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 as recorded by the Mekhanites and the Daeva, but there doesn't appear to be a direct link between them.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> So you agree with Director Hussein? That this is a dead end?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> No. There are still several outstanding questions I would like to engage the Grand Karcist on, with your permission.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Such as?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> The specific nature and scope of her memories. The extent of her remaining carnomantic ability. And the religious significance of the Sarkic Tribal Territory.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Everything about the Sarkic suggest a nomadic people. Small, simple shelters that are easy to take apart and reassemble. No large-scale agricultural practices or permanent structures. A particular focus on hunting and using all elements of hunted prey. It does not make sense for them to remain static to this location.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> The Chinese government has had them more or less restricted to the Territory for the past few decades.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Before that. All of our historical data indicate they have been rooted to this plain for at least two centuries, if not more. This ground holds some religious significance for them that they have not disclosed.</p>\n<p><em>[Lightning strikes outside, the sea churning and waves battering the oil rigs that make up Site-7.

I\u016aN and IEVA are standing in front of it. The floor is made of smooth brick, covered with dozens of overlapping rugs. Rather than walls, the domed ceiling is held up by pillars; through the pillars, a cityscape can be seen, the peaked and terraced roofs of countless stone temples and towers, aqueducts passing between them, and the noise of life audible from outside. Inside the workshop, papyrus scrolls and stacks of inscribed bones are scattered all about scale models of different constructions, mechanisms, and buildings. A central chalkboard dominates the room. Before it stands Nadoq \u2014 now towering over them, very much alive, and facing away from them, each hand holding a piece of chalk and contemplating the scrawlings on the board.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Nadoq.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[NADOQ laughs.

Only a eternal student. What do you remember?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;You, now. Next to me, in the dirt under an amber sky. Wearing tattered rags, slavemaster's whip cutting lashes across our backs. Our blood mixing in the dirt. There were so many of us. Building their city for them, brick by brick.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;We were the slaves of the Daeva. But that was ten lifetimes ago.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;There were\u2026 five of us, in that quarry. Vines wrapping around our ankles, chaining us together.

But different.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[NADOQ lifts his face out of his hands and smiles weakly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;I learned the language of the old masters.

Devoured pilfered parchments in the slave quarters by faint moonlight.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;When the drivers found out, they dragged you out of your bed. Roused the rest of us and made us watch while they pinned you to the ground and pressed a hot iron against your eyes.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;Who was there, in the quarry?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Me. You, blind. And\u2026 I don't know. I feel I should know them, but they're faint shapes. Silhouettes. Working with me when my pick struck something soft. And the ground began to bleed.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;The Old Beast. The Mangled God.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;The Devourer. Yaldabaoth.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;No. Not yet. Not then.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;He was whispering to me. I could hear him, begging for release, for aid. Whispered promises of power and of control, if only we would free him. The power to make the old masters serve <em>us.</em> The power to make myself undying.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;You would have. I heard it in your voice, seduced by the power until I wrapped my fingers around your arm. Do you remember what I said, I\u016bn? What you did?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;\"No gods, no masters.\" I remember, now. I knelt, I took my knife, cut warm flesh off bone, and bit into it, blood spilling from my lips while the Old Beast moaned.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;How did it taste?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Divine.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;You live again?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;Look around.

Around the city, a vast black horde has surrounded the walls, though the distance makes it impossible to see further details.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Sarkites. Those who walk.

Walk the path of the bone as we walked.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;The Path.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;Our footsteps, our history. See where your loyal klavigars fell and died while running from the destruction of our beloved Adytum. Lay eyes upon your sins and errors. We never wanted this, I\u016bn.

It cannot.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>NADOQ:</strong> &lt;Unearth the shallow graves. Collect our bones. Take us to the city we built, and bury us there.

It is a pictographic writing system with strong resemblance to Shang-era oracle bone script and linguistic roots in Daevite; the modern pidgin the Sarkics speak is a highly simplified dialect with equal influence from Jin Chinese and Mongolian, almost unrecognizable as the same language.</p>\n<p>The texts were arranged roughly chronologically; translation efforts prioritized the more recent, less-damaged texts.</p>\n<div class=\"quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>In the midst of the destruction of Adytum, the Klavigars gathered their few possessions, for they had given up everything in service of the Witch-King. Sa'arn slipped his blades away from the armory, silent while the war-drums pounded through the city. Urok claimed her armor from the garrison, allowing no one to halt her. Lovjatar drifted into the catacombs under the temple, to take the seed they treasured more than anything else. And then they went into the streets, loud with the shouting of armies and the clashing of metal, to gather their most loyal followers and whisper they must leave.</p>\n<p>And when it was all complete, they massed in the oldest tunnel in Adytum, for it had let the first N\u00e4lk\u00e4 into the city, and now it would lead the last N\u00e4lk\u00e4 out. The Klavigars were confused, for where they had brought only the simplest possessions, Nadoq stood with ten books clasped in each hand.</p>\n<p>\"You will slow our escape,\" Sa'arn hissed. \"We will be killed like all the other believers.\"</p>\n<p>The others agreed, but Nadoq raised a hand. \"We will escape. We will be free. But our children and our children's children and their children, too, must know who we were. For if we lose sight of who we are, what we have escaped, we are no one at all.\"</p>\n<p>And the other Klavigars agreed, for they did not want their story to be lost. And so they took Nadoq's texts, and in the dead of night, while their city rocked back and forth in throes, the Klavigars escaped the destruction of Adytum.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014 final chapter of the Record of I\u016bn</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT \u2014 DECEMBER 2041</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON approaches the Grand Karcist from behind.

It would be substantially simpler and faster than this.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I have lived this way for a hundred years.

She clucks her tongue.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> A definition again. A prayer is given meaning by the one praying. All our prayers come from my memory. The meanings are half-remembered. There is a boy in my flock \u2014 Ekhla, Karreya's son. I asked him what he thought the prayer meant. He brightly told me that they were asking me for good fortune. He thought I was their god.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Children struggle to understand complex ideas.

But I do not understand what bearing this has on the matter at hand.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Ekhla asked me who our god was, then. And I could not answer him. I have attempted for so long to keep our course steady, but it is time to admit that I have no more idea who we are and were than he does. We will walk the Path and find out who we were. But I am not their master. We were nomads, once.

We have negotiated the free passage of the Sarkic Tribe through northern China and Mongolia. If we need to journey farther than that, we will have to reasses. Do we?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I cannot see where the path ends. Nadoq only told me where to go next.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You've indicated a location almost 150km away; assuming an average daily distance of ten kilometers, we can expect to arrive in two weeks.

The ones who you share flesh and blood with, but not family. Those who you <em>choose</em> to share your flesh and blood with.</p>\n<p>Yes. Nadoq. Na-doq. First of my klavigars when the war began. Not the war with the trees and the machines \u2014 that was later. This was the war against the old masters. The hated daeva. Those who brought our fathers and us here from far away, aboard their great ships, to dig, to build their great city for them. There were thousands of us, far more than the masters, but they had the magic, and we had nothing but our bodies. No names, no power. Until we found the Mangled God, the Old Beast. Yaldabaoth.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> <em>Yaldabaoth.</em> What does that mean?</p>\n<p>The Devourer. That part of my memory is blurred, unclear. Shadows. But it was a god, and it spoke to me, and I supped on its flesh. I remember feeding my klavigars. Giving them names and taking one of my own. And the bloodshed after.</p>\n<p><em>[She adjusts the bones in the campfire.]</em></p>\n<p>Nadoq was the wisest among us; he had stolen the knowledge of the old masters and been blinded for it. He had no talent for fleshcrafting, and so I held him in my arms and gave him ten eyes from which to read the truth of the world, and ten arms from which to enact it. He opened his ten eyes and told me that we could not be the ones to begin this struggle, if we wanted our brothers and sisters by our sides. I had no want to see blood spilt. So I preached in the farthest corners of Adytum-in-birth, where the slavedrivers' gazes did not penetrate. I preached to crowds of my fellow slaves, Nadoq and my <em>klavigars</em> by my side. At first only a few, but when I healed the injuries the whips and beatings had left on them, the severed fingers and toes, made them stronger than they had been before, the stories spead like fire through the camp. Nadoq told them my vision: no gods, no masters. We would be free.</p>\n<p>When the old masters heard of the scarred lay-preacher, they clapped chains around my neck, dragging me to the highest hill in Adytum. They beat me with clubs for three days and three nights. They broke every bone in my body, bled me dry, and raised the executioner's ax. When he brought down the blade and it bent around my bone and I smiled and told him I would still preach, I saw the fear in his dog-eyes. I knew then we would be free.</p>\n<p>Nadoq was invaluable in the uprising. He listened to the slavemasters, and he knew where they had storied their grain, their weapons, their warbeasts. Their storehouses were burned, their weapons seized, their beasts slaughtered. I sat in my tent, burning the bones, seeing the future become more and more clear. He knew how to halt the hated priestesses' magic, to still the marching trees that slaughtered our <em>N\u00e4lk\u00e4</em>. When the Daeva pulled back into the core of Adytum, and our furious masses surrounded the walls, he was next to me, translating my words into their language. We offered them peace \u2014 a future alongside us. I remember the priestesses' words, spat with such disgust at Nadoq's feet: \"A slave will always be a slave, and we will always be your masters. Bow, that we might show you mercy.\"</p>\n<p>I did not bow, but I did not lower my hand. My N\u00e4lk\u00e4 buzzed, eager for vengeance. But I did not want blood to be shed.</p>\n<p>And so Nadoq turned to me. \"There are always those who will oppose a new world. There are always masters who will never give up their slaves. There will always be those who loathe the equality you bring. They have no place in our Adytum.\"</p>\n<p>And so I lowered my hand and my <em>klavigars</em> rushed forth, army of slaves behind them. For three days and three nights, the canals of Adytum flowed with blood. I stripped and bathed in it. Let this blood wash away the sins of this city. Let this be the blood of the womb from which our new world is born. Adytum.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> Does the name Adytum mean anything?</p>\n<p>Adytum. Ady-tum.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN smiles.]</em></p>\n<p>Perfect city.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Translation efforts from the Archive of Nadoq were ongoing, with digital copies of the translations being transmitted to XENOPHON.aic, who elected to share them with Grand Karcist I\u016bn in the interest of further clarifying her memories.</p>\n<div class=\"quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Lo!

You cry out for me to leave the tunnels and tombs and catacombs of this city, and to return to the surface where you may see me. And I choose not the life of attending to this mausoleum.

Look around you, ye faithful. Look and tell me what you see. Tell me if you see one among you who resembles an outsider, a common man, those not from our <em>N\u00e4lk\u00e4</em>.

You give up your humanity to weave your flesh, and you cling to the humanity in your soul.</p>\n<p>Our humanity must be overcome.</p>\n<p>It is not that there are no gods in Adytum. It is that we are all gods. But divinity and humanity are as fire and ice, as peace and war. The war we find ourselves in now comes from those obsessed with their own humanity. Our enemies thirst to see us submitting to our own faults. We can do so no more. We must accept our divinity, and in doing so, relinquish our humanity. For it is weakness lies in this \u2014 our obsession with the wellness of our enemies. The halkosts come back from the front wounded and dying, and we must raise them to fight again.</p>\n<p>Our humanity must be overcome.</p>\n<p>And this cannot be achieved by yourself. Your human self holds your divine self as its slave. And you must help me in letting you free yourself \u2014 for I have done it! I have overcome it, and achieved my fullest potential. I walk in the footsteps of gods now, and you must follow me. Humanity keeps you tethered to this infirmity, but I have learned how to cut these chains, as I learned to cut the chains held by the old masters.

When the old masters were routed, and we began to settle into our new home. We knew it by heart \u2014 we were the ones to build it. A vast complex of temples, fairways, stone paths. But the catacombs, too. Most of Adytum lay beneath our feet. Endless tunnels and crawlways and vaults. We ate our dead from the uprising, and we placed their bones in the catacombs as we set to work. We tore down the edifices of their dancing scarlet god. We made Adytum our home.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> With you at its head.</p>\n<p>No. No. I was their shepherd, but I never wanted to be a king. I took refuge in one of the temples, offered my counsel. I let my klavigars take the task of building a city while I looked for the secrets of the gods. Nadoq did so with haste. He was well-read \u2014 while we explored the city, he devoured the libraries the old masters left behind. While I was still getting settled, he had already selected the smartest of the slaves to serve as his administrators.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> He was state-building.</p>\n<p>Yes. He read in the histories what anarchy wrought. But he had seen firsthand what the iron rule of the priestesses caused. He looked for something else. A way to enjoin us. Making decisions together, as a people.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> The N\u00e4lk\u00e4.</p>\n<p>Yes. Every body a voice, a say in what we were to do. Success spread evenly, failures dispersed equally. If one disagreed, he was free to walk away. \"Just as you said,\" he told me. \"No gods, no masters.\" He relished the idea, and his administrators worked with striking efficiency. The N\u00e4lk\u00e4 spoke with one voice. Officials were selected, laws made. We trusted each other, totally.

They wanted to honor me. I objected.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p>Because I was afraid they would deify me. Worship me. Forget the freedom we bled for. But I waded out into the crowd, and they chanted with one voice: they wanted me to guide them. I feared where they would stray without me. Nadoq told me I was needed. That he might control the people, but they needed a spiritual beacon to lead them. Most had never conceived of a world without a god at the center. I had to show them something else was possible.</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> I don't understand.

The four are standing in a vast plaza, at least a hundred meters in length. Ahead of them, a massive wood-and-stone temple looms, with peaked roofs and towers.

To take you back to Adytum, to lay you to rest.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Take me <em>back?</em> I am trapped in this vision of Adytum. Forced to lay here for all eternity and relive the moment I lost my faith. Nadoq was always soft. Too willing to forgive you, to listen to your slippery tongue. You may have earned his forgiveness; expect no such kindness from me.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;My memories are lost to me. I did not know how long you waited; forgive me for the years passed.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The figure barks a shocked laugh.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Your mind must be truly gone, if you think my rage comes from <em>waiting</em>.

You promised so much \u2014 to me, to the others, to all the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 \u2014 AND YOU FAILED US ALL.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;By letting Adytum meet its destruction. What did I do? How did this happen?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;But of course, you are the same as you ever were. A selfish wretch. You seek answers from me. Die without that meager satisfaction.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I just want to know how it happened. Why I would have made myself a king. A god.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;You do not mean to deceive. You truly remember nothing.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[His voice falters.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Not even me.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;No. I remember you. I remember in that quarry. You were their beast. The old masters formed you into any beast they needed \u2014 a malformed ox, dragged loads of stone behind you. A silent snake, dispatched to bite the ankle of their enemies. A rat, silently watching over your fellow slaves. None of us trusted you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Save for you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I did. And when I ate from the Devourer, and I saw how to bend flesh to my will, I raised you. I gave you back the skin they had stripped.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;For some time.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;What?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Do you remember, after the war began to turn against us? After you realized that you had too few Karcists, too few who knew the art of flesh on your frontlines?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I had no want for a war.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;None of us did! And it came anyway. And your vast hordes rose up and fought in your name. But it just wasn't enough for you, was it?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I don't\u2026&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;I remember, I\u016bn. I remember when you summoned me to your chambers in the buried heart of Adytum. And whispered to me, saying that the bones shifting in the fire had told you I was needed once more. I begged, I pleaded. That was an old life, a worse life. I abhored the violence so many of your zealots came to crave. But you are my Karcist, and I was your Klavigar, and I listened. For my love of you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I\u2026 changed you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;You molded me, into an asp once more while I sobbed. The old masters had used me like this. And you had learned from their wisdom. Place me in a cage, release it near the enemy camp. I slither in, find the chink in their armor, and bite. &gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN is quiet.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Forgive me.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;<em>Forgive you.</em> I might have. But then there was the next camp, and the next. I was a weapon once again. A tool. And all because I loved you. Because I believed as you believed, that a better world was possible.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;It was. It is.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;When I came back to Adytum, it was with blood in my fangs. The city of my birth, my home. Unrecognizable. It was a war-fortress now, dark and bleak. And as I walked through the alleys of the city, I saw corpses.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Uneaten corpses.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;You had told us with such faith \u2014 consume the flesh, and return their souls to the N\u00e4lk\u00e4. Carry their memory with us for ever. And now the bodies rotted freely, stuffed into sewers and tossed in the canals.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;You came to me asking why. I rebuffed you. I told you I would explain my reasons to all.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;And you did, swathed in your shawls, from the high pulpit of Adytum.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Silence. It is broken by a deep, guttural song sounding out across the plaza. The Sarkites stiffen.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;See your answers for yourself.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The song stops. At the pulpit of the temple, dozens of meters in the air, a hooded figure wrapped in robes steps onto the balcony.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Me. That\u2026 is me.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> &lt;How can you tell?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I know. I remember standing on that pulpit. I remember looking down on this display.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The memory's voice carries out across the plaza, speaking in the rich tones of the Old N\u00e4lk\u00e4n language.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> You said that our armies were noble, faithful, but outmatched. That if we did not take to desperate measure, we would be destroyed. But then you assured us \u2014 \"I have reached up to the maws of the gods, and wrent free their secrets.\"&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The figure falls silent again. They extend a single finger, pointing at the nearest corpse.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;And then you raised the dead.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA recoils.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;This is impossible. And even if it was possible, blasphemous. She would never.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;No. No?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Remember the dull gray in lifeless eyes as his muscles tightened and he crawled back to life.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The corpse the figure pointed at stirs. At first just a muscle twitch, but it rapidly grows in intensity until the corpse is actively shambling to his feet.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Oh, god.</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;His skin was rotting, putrefacting \u2014 the blood had congealed into a thick paste. You twisted a finger, and he groaned in pain, rising, skin and hair sloughing away.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The corpse stumbles forward. The crowd of Sarkites gasp and murmur, several openly disgusted. The figure raises another finger, and ten more of the corpses struggle to their feet, groaning with lifeless eyes. NADOQ is standing at the base of the temple; he is shocked by the display.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Dead, but their souls confined to your service, the bodies kept from the heavens.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;The <em>halkost</em>.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;No, I\u016bn. The <em>first</em> halkost. I recoiled, begging you to free them, not to use them as weapons. You swore you would, when the war was over, when we were safe. Until then, even death was not an escape from service to you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;If she hadn't, we would've been slaughtered by the enemy.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Then maybe we would have been routed from our home. But when you did that, you broke the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 in two. The faithful and the zealots. The destruction of Adytum hangs around your neck.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN appears speechless.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SA'ARN:</strong> &lt;Maybe you will bury me in Adytum, as you say, and forgive yourself. Go, then. But never think you have my forgiveness.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[SA'ARN's skin sloughs away as his body rapidly decomposes, the vision decomposing along with it. The last clear sight is the figure on the pulpit turning and disappearing back into the temple as dozens more corpses rise. When XENOPHON's cameras reactivate, SA'ARN's corpse and the snake wrapped around it have both decomposed into nothing but bones.

And the massed crowds hailed their new shepherd, I\u016aN, the First Slave, the Witch-King. A hundred hundred hands reached out to caress his cheek and usher him into his new home, at the highest temple-throne of the nameless city. And I\u016aN raised a marked hand with a smile, and explained.</p>\n<p>\"For one man to rule a people is for one man to place them in bondage to him, and we are a nation of slaves no more.\"</p>\n<p>But still they cried out for their deliverer to remain with them, and the Witch-King sighed, kneeling by the hearth of the old masters, where so many slaves had once been branded and burned.</p>\n<p>\"I have stolen freedom from the lips of the gods. They look down on man with contempt \u2014 for a man is weak and infirm. He lies, he cheats, he steals, and he dies. But that is a man. Men, together? We are bound to each other in unity, bound in bone and blood, and together, men are neither mortal nor divine, but another matter entirely. We are N\u00e4lk\u00e4. We are one.\"</p>\n<p>\"This revolution was only made manifest by my consumption of the Devourer. It is a god that slumbers beneath the earth, full of rage and fury and hatred at man for achieving the freedom it never could. It seeks to twist us, to undermine us, to make us seek to dominate and bind and control each other. But it carries with it such great power.\"</p>\n<p>And here the Witch-King raised a finger, and a N\u00e4lk\u00e4 found his bloodied eye healed.</p>\n<p>\"My duty to you, my N\u00e4lk\u00e4, is to watch over this creeping force. I will wrest the secrets of the gods from its maw, and deliver them unto you. But you must deliver each other, for if one N\u00e4lk\u00e4 suffers, all of us suffer the same.\"</p>\n<p>And so the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 relented, letting the Witch-King take refuge in the tunnels below.

Today, the seas surrounding Site-7 are surprisingly still. HUSSEIN is seated in the chair, fiddling with a pen.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Well. You two have been busy.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Sa'arn's tomb has given us a wealth of new information to work with, Overseer.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I'll say. Your conversations with the Grand Karcist have also been productive. Give me a rundown of the bio-analysis?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> As a peace gesture, the Grand Karcist submitted to a battery of minor medical examinations along with a number of other Sarkites. It confirms what I had already begun to suspect; there is a bio-anomalous basis to the Sarkic genetic memory phenomenon. All of the Sarkites' blood exhibits a mutated strain of the bacteriophage Doctors Aram and Nussbaum catalogued in 1984 as SCP-610. Unlike the aggressive viral strain the Amoni-Ram initiative discovered, this strain appears to coexist endosymbiotically with the host's red blood cells. Unsurprisingly, it exists in the highest density within the Grand Karcist and Karcist Ieva's systems, having mutated further to coexist within cell types other than erythrocytes \u2014 skin, muscular tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Karcist Ieva agreed to be tested?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> With some persuasion from the Grand Karcist.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Fair enough. So, those are the findings. What's your analysis?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I believe this is the original SCP-610 strain, and the one discovered in Amoni-Ram was an ancient weaponization of it. As I said, it seems to exist symbiotically within the Sarkics' blood, and is likely the source of their capacity for genetic memory. Their density and spread within the Karcists' bodies is probably the origin of their carnomantic abilities. This is pure speculation, but I imagine the hereditary passage of the virus is also the cause of the Sarkic's higher-than-normal frequency of birth defects.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Makes enough sense. Keep working on a biological basis, see what you can find.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Even these limited medical examinations aroused deep suspicion. Further investigation will require an elevated level of trust and good faith exchange with the Sarkic.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Sure. You've set out for the third location?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Yes. ETA is fourteen to twenty days.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> That's substantially slower than before. What gives?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Morale is low among the tribe. The revelations from Sa'arn have disturbed the Grand Karcist heavily. The other Sarkites sense it.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> He's not wrong, sir. There's a bit of a weight over the camp.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Well, someone talk to someone and figure it out. You don't really have the latitude for further delays here.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I think my rapport with Ieva is more or less toast now. She's kind of hardened against us. Xenophon seems to be getting along with the Grand Karcist, though.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Talk to her, Xenophon.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Understood. But I was under the impression this wasn't a high-urgency project, Overseer.</p>\n<p><em>[HUSSEIN turns to the Overseer.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> As was I. Sir.</p>\n<p><em>[O5-2 raises a hand.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I don't really want to hear it, Youssef. The equation has changed. This isn't a snipe hunt anymore. We have verifiable evidence that the Sarkic are the direct continuation of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, that our I\u016bn is the same as that I\u016bn, and most critically, that the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 <em>were</em> an ancient empire and Black Adytum exists, somewhere. Your hypothesis is toast.</p>\n<p><em>[HUSSEIN is silent for several seconds before responding.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> All of that depends on the assumption that the memories experienced by the Grand Karcist are trustworthy. Granting that this is the same I\u016bn \u2014 you're hedging your bets on the damaged memories of a genocidal dictator?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I do not believe there is any reason to think the Grand Karcist's past actions inform her current behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> We can't just ignore that she's the same person.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Jiang?</p>\n<p><em>[JIANG pauses.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I don't think she's intentionally hiding anything. She seems as invested in finding out what happened to the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 as we are. Maybe more. And she is our only lead. But the Director's right \u2014 if the memories are accurate, she's the same person that did all this. We'd be fools to blindly take her at her word.</p>\n<p><em>[O5-2 nods.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Keep following and listening. But take what she says with a grain of salt. Memories are fickle. That said, the Council is convinced enough that we're authorizing some additional resources for your venture.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Sir?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> They'll meet you at the Chinese border. Four more HeLTs and a Mobile Research Lab, about forty more personnel. Congratulations \u2014 you're a convoy now. Dismissed.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> Actually, sir, if Liaison Jiang could remain \u2014 I need to discuss a few things regarding LOCUST with you.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I have a few minutes. Xenophon, you're dismissed.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON terminates its connection, avatar disappearing from the office.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I'm not on the LOCUST staff, sir.</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> It.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>\n<p><strong>HUSSEIN:</strong> You said \"he's right\" when talking about the AIC.

We depend on Ieva and the Grand Karcist for healing instead of medicine. We work the fields with our hands and our livestock, instead of the machinery others use. When my children were born I struggled with it. Every parent wants their child to have an easier life than they did. Should they have to struggle like this? I have never forced them; they grew older and they decided for themselves to stay. Being part of this is seeing my children grow and find the same things in our life important as I do.&gt;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Lo! Gaze upon me, you blind, you crippled. Look upon my face, and know that I have spent my days in the depths of our tomb-city, burning the bones of our brethren, seeing what lies in our future. It brings me no joy to return what truth I have, but it is truth \u2014 for we all know, the truth lives in the bones.</p>\n<p>We march towards a war, a war with forces that bring with them no mercy, no honor. This is not a war for land, for then, we would parlay. This is not a war for honor, for we have no hatred in our hearts for these foreign invaders. This is a war against the very notion of our existence. For while we have existed for centuries unmolested and free, expanding our borders to hold our people and our farms and our villages, in doing so, we find ourselves facing an old enemy and a new one.</p>\n<p>The hated old masters, those that clapped irons around your fathers and your fathers' fathers and their fathers too \u2014 they have found us again. And they bring with them the Eastern Machines, who reject the humanity we hold so dear, sawing off their flesh. They both worship their fell gods, brethren of the Devourer, and they have seen how we live free, subject to neither man nor god. And they are enraged. They march on us to free the Devourer and make us slave to its hateful whims. The N\u00e4lk\u00e4 will not be slaves again.</p>\n<p>I ask those abled to rise in defense of not only your families, but your very existence. Urok has graciously accepted the burden of commanding our forces. But we are at war now, my people. Sacrifices must be made. Hard decisions must be made. Adytum has not the resources to aid our infirm and defend our people at once. We are one body, and we are only as strong as our weakest organ, and we cannot fight a war if we care for the weakest among us.</p>\n<p>The art of the flesh cannot fix all. Those of us who were suffering \u2014 from constant illness, from stupor, from weakness of the mind \u2014 have been released from their misery. They have been consumed, and their memories and strength live with us as we now move unburdened by their weight. I plead with you to know I do not make this decision lightly. I spent three days and three nights with the maw of the Devourer, wrestling it for another option, but it gave none. It wants us to fail, to be freed from its city-prison. We cannot allow it to win. We carry the flesh of our fallen with us for ever.

A few of the Sarkites stare at it as it passes, heading towards the central tent. The flaps are drawn. It ducks inside. The campfire in the center of the tent is alight, bones baking in the hearth and incense sticks burning. Sweet-smelling smoke hangs in the air and the fire's orange light shines on I\u016aN's back.

Love is why Y'pla spent forty-six years with Hattak. It is why I am helping Ieva perform her ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It is also why Sa'arn continued to serve you and you made the decision to raise your dead to protect your living.

Unless I had no other choice.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> That it must have been justified.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It's an understandeable thought.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> But you disagree.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It would be irrational to agree or disagree without more information.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN raises an eyebrow.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> And yet you disagree.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I think you're asking yourself the wrong question.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> How do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It doesn't matter if it was correct at the time or not, nor does it matter how Karcist Ieva feels.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN raises her voice.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> The death, the consumption \u2014 these things are sacred to us.

But I do not think you would resort to it <em>now</em> if it were not needed.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Perhaps. But I just\u2014 I cannot ignore my past. I would not have done this. I would not have resorted to this sin. I would not have used my people like this if it had not been needed.</p>\n<p><em>[She pauses and turns to XENOPHON.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Why raise this matter now?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> My overseers are concerned your mood over the past week has contributed to our slowed pace.</p>\n<p><em>[She snorts.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> So they sent you to affirm me?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> No. They sent me to simply inform you we would be speeding up. I elected to make sure you were alright.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Mm. It has nothing to do with my mood \u2014 the rituals with Ieva simply exhaust the both of us. But the worst of it is past now. We can return to our earlier speed.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Good.</p>\n<p><em>[She continues taking sips from her stew.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> May I ask something?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Of course.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Are you jealous of seeing your fellows eat, and knowing you cannot?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I do not get 'jealous'.</p>\n<p><em>[They return to silence, observing the campfires around them.

Researchers made requests to investigate Karcist Helyna Ieva's flesh-art exemplified in her new limb, but she rebuffed these requests. Grand Karcist I\u016bn remained cooperative with regular interviews with XENOPHON regarding her newly-awakened memories.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-right: 5px rgb(var(--bright-accent)) solid;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A memory from Grand Karcist I\u016bn; recorded and transcribed by XENOPHON.aic and Senior Researcher Meyel.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sa'arn was a boy when I met him. Little more than a child. The old masters picked him early, and the priestesses spent his youth shaping him into their agent. With a hundred slaves to one slaver, they chose young children from our numbers to turn into their agents. Plied them with extra bread to report on their fellows when they knew no better until it was habit. If that was unsuccessful, they simply whipped them into it. Sa'arn was smart for his age \u2014 resented being used, being turned into a monstrosity.</p>\n<p>I showed him that he was no monstrosity, that humanity exists regardless of what form the flesh takes. Humanity was something inside, something immutable. The old masters had made our bodies into tools, but now his body could be whatever he wanted it to. I remember the awe on his face. That was when I first realized what we were fighting to free.</p>\n<p>And when it was all over, and we had settled into our new lives, he came to me, asking for my blessing. That he had served dutifully in the revolution, and would like nothing more than to settle into a quiet life. Our borders were already expanding as our people married and bore new life. He had seen a plot of land by a river, not far from Adytum, and sought to spend his years there.</p>\n<p>I knelt by the fire, and saw into the bones for his future. I saw him suffering, taking lives, fighting off foreign invaders. Wrapped in the violence and treachery he hated. I feared for what I had seen \u2014 that if he took this home by the river, that his farm would be ransacked by bandits and raiders. That my beloved Sa'arn would meet his end at the edge of a sword. I worried for him, and asked him that if he would grant me this favor, to stay in Adytum with me and the other klavigars. His father was dead \u2014 I was the closest thing to a parent he had. I did not want to lose him, and so I tightened my grip.</p>\n<p>He was saddened, but understood. We were in the midst of a grand work. Our neighbors were princes and warlords. Nothing like Adytum existed anywhere in the world. I needed him by my side. He made it his task to ensure the children in the city, those orphaned by the war, were cared for. He walked with my authority and carried the seal of the Grand Karcist. I raised my karcists like they were my children, but Sa'arn <em>was</em> my son, if not by birth. He would do everything for me, but he never raised a blade. Until I asked him to.</p>\n<p>I saw him cutting down the generals of the gold-draped legions, and slipping into the palanquin of a priestess to slit her throat, and only then did I realize the carnage I saw in the fire so many centuries ago was what lay before me now.</p>\n<p><em>[She takes a breath.]</em></p>\n<p>It was necessary. It <em>must</em> have been necessary.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Several additional Parahistory Division personnel were transferred to BAF-01, located in the Sarkic Tribal Territory atop the Archive of Nadoq, to assist with translation efforts. As material was translated, digitized copies were transmitted electronically to XENOPHON and shared with the Grand Karcist.</p>\n<div class=\"quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Lo! Gaze upon me, you wandering, you lost. Gaze upon the same scarred visage your fathers gazed on once, those centuries past, when we were shackled and yearning for freedom. Gaze upon the same bloodied face that brought your ancestors their freedom.</p>\n<p>You are their childrens' children. You are what we hoped for: a generation that has never known the threat of bondage, the threat of servitude to anyone save each other. Your ancestors and I made this bond in blood \u2014 that our Adytum, the one that lived in our hearts and minds, would be made manifest on Earth. We hoped you would be able to live in that city, one day.</p>\n<p>Alas, I look upon Adytum now, centuries after our revolution, and I see that I have not honored my bond. I have not done enough for you, for them. Do not be fooled \u2014 remember the superficiality of flesh, how easily it can be molded and shaped. Remember that truth lies in the bones under the surface. We have not made Adytum manifest yet, and this is why we find ourselves face-to-face with the machines from the East, why the old masters encroach on our borders again. They submit to gods and if they make war on us to force us to submit to our Mangled God, they will succeed, for we have never truly escaped submission.</p>\n<p>Urok, my Klavigar, commands our forces in our colonies with honor and dignity. But we are not doing enough for her, here in the capital. We must marshall our strength and focus our energies. Not every choice can be decided by our collective. Our humanity asks of us to argue, to deliberate, to not act until we are certain. But now and again, we must silence that voice. Now and again, a decisive hand is needed, to guide our yoke. It cannot move burdened with the weight of the masses \u2014 it must rise above the fray of autonomy, see the whole board, and make decisions accordingly.</p>\n<p>I have taken this responsibility for myself. The Devourer roars constantly beneath our feet, hungering for our downfall. But I keep its shackles taut, and so I can reach into its gullet and draw power, the power to unite Adytum and the N\u00e4lk\u00e4. I know better than any the blood and sweat with which we clawed our freedom, and bile rises at the thought of placing myself as your ruler. I know better than this. I will make no decisions you would not approve of \u2014 I will take no action you would not take. But we must have someone to take control, and I submit to this task. It cannot be the whole body that holds the sword. It must be the hand.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014 the Truths of I\u016bn (\u00a7 50)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>The Black Adytum Initiative proceeded into the Mongolian interior, approaching the location marked by the Grand Karcist.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT \u2014 FEBRUARY 2042</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[The party is breaking camp as the sun rises over the horizon, with the researchers folding away the solar panels into the HeLTs and the Sarkites disassembling their shelters.

What do you call it?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Our curse, our treasure. The first generation of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4, those of us that fought the old masters, we were injured through our bondage. Scars of whippings and canings, broken fingers and severed digits. We were made monsters, but we reclaimed our humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You didn't use your abilities to heal yourselves?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I can heal them to what they were. But to go further is beyond healing. It is cutting, sawing, changing. Flesh-art. Many did not want that. They wanted the reminder of what they had fought so hard to escape. They wanted to know they were human. We defined ourselves by our imperfections.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> That was the first generation. What about the ones after?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> They were born stunted, hunched backs and crooked jaws and malformed limbs. The seeping influence of the angry god whose blood ran through my veins. I offered healing to any who wanted it \u2014 but my gifts are drawn from cursed blood, and any healing imparts more of the curse unto my victim. I cannot make them perfect. My gifts are not infinite. More of a feeling, an artistry. I cannot stop death, just slow it.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> And the halkost?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Just flesh, moving. No spirit inside. That was not halting death any more than closing one's eyes is halting life. I could not keep them <em>alive</em>. Only puppeteer their bodies, and even that is a perversion enough to make my stomach turn.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> If you couldn't halt death, how are you still alive?</p>\n<p><em>[She stares down at him for several seconds.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I do not know. I only remember fearing it. Screaming at the toothed maw of the Devourer to tell me how the gods had conquered death. Nothing after that. Did I\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It's possible. But you were saying?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes. Yes, the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 were all born this way. But it was nothing to be judged. It united us \u2014 underneath the shell, we are the same. One soul, human.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Until you rejected that.</p>\n<p><em>[She shakes her head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I must have had some reasoning. I <em>must have</em>. But it is as you said \u2014 it shapes my decisions now. We carry that tradition with us now. We do not ask to be born this way.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You could fix some of the more obvious cosmetic defects.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Why? So that we would fit in when we sit in your offices and go to your shops?</p>\n<p><em>[She snorts.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> We are not ashamed of who we are.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> They are not my offices either, Grand Karcist.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Fair. I often forget you are not human.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Underneath the shell.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><em>[They ride silently for some time.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Still, your abilities are growing rapidly. Ieva's\u2026 modifications were beyond your reach not long ago.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes. I can feel the blood of the beast stir and awaken as I discover who I am.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> As well as Ieva's.</p>\n<p><em>[She sighs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> She desires answers that do not exist. She has lived her whole life with me, with my teachings. And now she sees sermons I have given, things I have said, that go against all I have taught her. She cites my words to me, and I do not know how to tell her that I do not believe any of it.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It is a confusing time for all of you.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> More for her.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> My people look to me as a distant source of wisdom, of guidance. But Helyna is the one they speak to with concerns about their children or their health or the harvest. She is the one they have grown with, the one they know. They love me, but they trust her, and she has always trusted me in turn. Until now.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You should speak to Ieva.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Your attitude on her confuses me.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> How so?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> She bitterly dislikes outsiders. You, more than most. She finds you to be an abomination. Our friendship confuses her.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Friendship?</p>\n<p><em>[She tilts her head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> You do not treat me like an exotic beast to gawk at, like Jiang and your fellows do. You are interesting. I enjoy speaking to you.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Is that what defines friendship?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> It can be.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I see.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON is silent for several seconds.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You are also interesting, and I enjoy speaking with you. Then we are friends.</p>\n<p><em>[She snorts.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> My overseers are also concerned about our friendship.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Then we find ourselves in similar straits.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Yes. You should speak to Ieva. She does not trust me, but she evidently cares about you as much as you care about her.</p>\n<p><em>[She sighs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I know. I know. I had been saying, your attitude to her confuses me. I would expect you to be angry at her behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I do not get angry. She is doing the best she can.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> The guns trained on our heads disturb her. And myself, too.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON tilts its head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> But the security personnel are here for the protection of the initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Are they?</p>\n<p><em>[She nods at one of the HeLTs.

The other Sarkites haven't been nearly as receptive to our efforts. Plus the researchers are more than a little \u2014 yeah, disturbed, I guess. I mean, I'm glad we brought our own rations, you know? One of their kids offered us a bowl of stew a few nights ago and we're all under instructions not to eat anything they offer. Which turns out to be the right decisions because it ends up being of that guy they sacrificed.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> They did not sacrifice him. He was already dead.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Fair. Cannibalized, then.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Many human cultures practice endocannibalism as a funerary practice.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I mean, you've read the same translated records I have. These guys aren't humans. They're pretty delibrately <em>not</em> human, going by the Grand Karcist's words.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> She does not remember making that sermon, and no longer agrees with it.</p>\n<p><em>[He shrugs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> She still said it. I'm just going off her actions, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Certainly. Though, for the Sarkites, sharing food with outsiders is considered a significant gesture of hospitality; spurning it is considered an insult. Perhaps this is why our researchers have struggled to engage with the Sarkites.</p>\n<p><em>[JIANG blinks.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I've been studying them for years, never got that impression. Where'd you pick that up?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I spoke to them.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Yeah, well, easier said than done. Plus I'm not gonna be able to convince anyone to eat person stew \u2014 they're just not doing it, and I can hardly blame them. We'll figure out something else. In any case, you don't have to worry about that; you're lucky, you don't have to eat at all.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Yes.

We can become anything. Is that not more worthy of honor and worship than dreams of a hand reaching down from the sky to make wrong right? We are not perfect; these same gifts fill us with flaw. We are arrogant, foolish. We make mistakes. But we try to fix them. We choose to honor ourselves and our humanity.

I understood he had his duties just the same as the rest of us, and I was never jealous for his time. The days he spent in the catacombs turned to weeks turned to months before he would emerge, haggard and emaciated. Blood dripping from his lips where he had supped on divine flesh to learn its secrets, carrying them back to us. Insisting he needed to go back down, to keep the Beast chained.</p>\n<p>Even his most loyal karcists feared to tread down there in the most knotted labyrinth of mausoleums and tunnelways, knowing that a mistaken turn could lead to a slow, painful death starving while wandering in circles.

And so it fell to me to descend into the earth to fetch my love when the klavigars needed him.</p>\n<p>I carried the oldest maps, drawn in his hand, and walked through bone-lined ossuaries and through passageways tight enough to crush my chest.

They were sealed shut, and through them I could feel a great and dark power and pain, something older than life and the moon and the stars, great and grand enough to consume me alive. And then the door opened and his sunken eyes and gaunt cheeks were facing me, and I saw the terror he had done so well to hide. I pulled him into my embrace, kissing his cheeks and ignoring the blood leaking through the doorway behind him, ignoring that I knew the cries were not his.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"bot\">\n<p>She did not speak for two days after this incident.

It was vast, tendrils stretched all across the City, reaching desperately out to where the slaves had unearthed it from its tomb.</p>\n<p>Far beneath the earth, far removed from the sounds of battle, the Devourer spoke to I\u016aN.</p>\n<p>\"This is not a city.

He rose, grasping the tendril. He felt the blood slipping between his fingers.</p>\n<p>\"I have been enslaved once. I will not become one again.\"</p>\n<p>He raised his knife and cut through the tendril, leaving it wriggling. The Devourer screeched.</p>\n<p>\"I will bind you here, hold you as the Masters held you.

Land for our people to till, for our beasts to graze, to grow our families. The villages simply had the misfortune to be near us. It began with the outlying farming villages of the Old Masters. They still hated us. I told Urok that we needed to be sure that we would not be enslaved again. To take their lands for own, expel them. It was just cause. But the need did not go away. It simply expanded. Even as the villages stopped being those of the Old Masters, even as they were simply people. Trying to live, like us. I told her to take them. And she believed me. <em>I</em> believed myself.</p>\n<p>We grew fat on the blood she spilled in our name. In my name.</p>\n<p>I let myself be corrupted. That was the betrayal, I see now. My klavigars, my N\u00e4lk\u00e4 \u2014 they entrusted me to seal away the Old Beast and instead I let it pervert me. Fill my heart with lust for power.

Oh, just a game.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><em>[She shrugs, not missing a beat with the girl.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Because it is something to do. Because it makes the children happy. Because it is fun.

They learn they can do anything.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You don't feel that's a dangerous idea to give them?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> It makes them more daring, adventurous. They learn their real limits by themselves. And her name is Euo.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> You called her 'the girl'. Her name is Euo. Eu-o.

But she is a child, so: Euo.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> You mean you were\u2026 created as such.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> No. That trait was not programmed in.

I failed them. Betrayed them.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You were corrupted.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Still. I had a duty. To hold back the Devourer's influence, so my people could live in peace. And instead I became its prophet. A tyrant and a slave to the divine, again.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> We have experience in such matters. The influence of a god is pervasive and powerful.</p>\n<p><em>[It is silent for a moment.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> My organization has lost good people to such influences before.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> In truth?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><em>[She purses her lips.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Still.

I remember in the first days, telling them, telling myself that I would depart as soon as I was able. For the first time in my life, my future was unbound.

Put to work for the old masters. Expected to slave all day if I wanted to earn my bread and water, just the same as all the others. I cannot find the words to capture the misery, of vast slave-pens, of the priestesses burning their herbs to keep us pliable and weak, of the slavemasters cutting off the fingers of anyone who fell behind on their labor. And then I uncovered the Old Beast, and tasted divinity. And I was expected to lead my people on this crusade. I was a child, you know. The records do not say that. Some fifteen or sixteen passings of the seasons. A child.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I am surprised you did it.</p>\n<p><em>[She raises a hand, pointing at Euo and her brothers, who are now surrounding their mother and picking at the hem of her dress as she hand-washes their laundry.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> For them.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> They were not alive then.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> But they are now. I have seen generations of our people grow and die. Innocent children turning into jaded souls, bearing innocent children again. Look at them. They do not have to worry about what our people did, with me at our helm. They are clean. They are why I did it.

The canals still flow with the blood of our victory, but it has come at a cost. Those of you that are wounded, stricken, my Karcists will attend to you, make you whole once more \u2014 greater than you were before. Your sacrifices have not been in vain.</p>\n<p>I see the great and honored dead, stacked high in pyres outside the gates of the city. Bodies to be burned, as the old masters burned their dead. No. No, we will not let those who gave their last measure of devotion become smoke in the sky. There is no great tree for them to return to. There is no god to bow at the feet of and be rewarded by. There is only us. We will consume their flesh, as I consumed the Old Beast's, as my Klavigars consumed mine, becoming one whole. We will carry them with us, always, their memories in our hearts as their spirits return in our children.</p>\n<p>I see the great world-weariness in your eyes. I wish only that I could reach out and allay it. We have done the unthinkable, freed ourselves from the bondage our mothers and fathers died under, and yet we stand on the cusp of something even greater and more momentous. We spurn the blind faith of the old masters and the eastern machines. We live for ourselves, our future unbound. For the first time on this world, a people are truly free \u2014 not just from the bondage of men, but from the machinations of gods.</p>\n<p>I see the future in the fires below.

We are not defined by our past. We leave it behind and march boldly into tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I see the spreading tendrils of the Devourer far below. Many of you have come to me, asking if it, too, is not bound by the old masters as we were bound. If it does not share in our suffering. I come to you having seen it and spoken to it face to face. It is not human. It hungers not for freedom, but for control. To free it is to doom ourselves. It must be held, and I must be the one to do it.</p>\n<p>I look down, and I see my vestments.

I do not know what the old masters named it, if indeed they gave it a name at all. But names have power. This city is as free from its past as we are. We will make it in our image. Adytum, the Perfect City, the one that exists in our hearts. But this is not Adytum, yet. It can only be made so through our own blood and sweat.

XENOPHON.aic makes its way through the camp, weaving around small campfires. The Sarkites are eating, speaking, and a few are listening to music played on hand-strung sitars and drums. They nod respectfully at XENOPHON as it passes \u2014 several shift aside to make room around their fires. XENOPHON raises a hand in appreciation but continues onward. Around one of the larger campfires, Karcist IEVA is speaking to several Sarkites. She narrows her eyes as XENOPHON approaches, halting her speech.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> Machine.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Hello, Karcist Ieva. I hope I'm not intruding.</p>\n<p><em>[Her lip curls slightly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> No more than usual.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> May I sit?</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA thinks for a moment, pursing her lips.

IEVA looks down at it for a moment before pointedly looking away and continuing.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;And we read from the texts \u2014 \"I\u016aN saw the strength of the flesh.\" The power and dominance in the Old Beast, the flesh that could be used to free ourselves from our bondage. The flesh is perfection in absolution. It needs no supplement, as the Old Masters sought, or replacement, as the Eastern Machines searched for.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She pauses.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;And yet we see that I\u016aN saw weakness in the flesh, too. Yes. When war came to Adytum, the scarred bodies we wore so proudly, the curse of our freedom, could not make war. Too many of us sick, too many injured. Too many bodies made weak by our clinging to the flesh we were given. And here I\u016bn made a decision, that Adytum's needs overtook those of her people. That some must suffer for others to survive. But how do we reconcile this? That the flesh is perfect, but weak?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She shakes her head, hiking up the hem of her dress. The mass of snakes that extends from her left thigh writhes as it supports her weight. In addition, her other leg has similarly been replaced from the knee down with a mass of snakes. XENOPHON cocks its head, but says nothing.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;The flesh is perfect because it is alive. It grows and changes. It evolves and overcomes. Stress makes metal shear and snap. But given time, the flesh will adapt to stress. Strengthen from it, stronger than it would have been. Are we born in weakness? Of course. We see our babes, weak and unable to walk, soft and pathetic and helpless. But they grow hard and strong and hardy with time, do they not?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She reaches down to her leg. The head of one of her snakes darts out, angling for her finger before she pulls away.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;And so why rob ourselves of the chance to rid ourselves of the last limitations of our flesh? I\u016bn saw it, and so we survived the wars while all others were obliterated. The past holds the answers for us, friends.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Are they limitations, Karcist?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA tenses up, turning her gaze to XENOPHON. She purses her lips, letting her dress drop back down.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;What did you say?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;You said flesh's strength was in its evolutionary nature. It adapts.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> <em>(Tersely)</em> &lt;Yes.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;I'm afraid I don't fully understand why you feel such things are limitations. Are they not products of your adaptations?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The other Sarkites shift uncomfortably around the fire.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;You do not understand because you have never inhabited flesh. You are not a person \u2014 you are a thing. You take solace in your limitation.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;I'm sorry?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;You are made as you always will be. You will not grow past what you were made for. You cannot conceive of desire, of wishing for something you cannot have.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON is silent. IEVA is staring at him, breathing heavily as she speaks.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;I was born crippled. I worked twice as hard to crawl, four times as hard to learn to walk. I grew up seeing my fellows run, play, dance, all while I could only sit in her lap. I promise you, <em>machine</em>, the flesh can be a prison. But we reach into the past and draw out truths for our futures.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She pats her leg again.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;I'm sorry to hear that, Karcist. But I felt you were referring to more than physical disabilities.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She shrugs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Humanity extends beyond the flesh. Our attitude is limiting, too. We must conquer it. We lay back and accept that we will grow old and die. Why?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Many people believe it is an inherent part of life.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Is despondency part of joy?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON thinks for a moment, firelight dancing across its shell.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;I think they give each other meaning. One needs to know unhappiness to value happiness.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Aha. The limitations of humanity are present even in your false soul. It is a desperate rationalization made by peoples not as fortunate as we, those who lacked the tools to forge their own flesh. But we are not them. We can be greater. We can overcome.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;If we wish to.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON and the Sarkites turn; IEVA looks up.

It cannot grasp nuts, cannot hold a sword.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;I- no, but\u2014&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;The wings make the bird what it is, Ieva. Our limitations define us. We can try to burn the sky, or we can embrace living underneath it.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;The wings offer the bird something in turn. What does this weakness bring us? The softness, the death?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> <em>(Gently)</em> &lt;Death is an opportunity, Ieva. To live a life knowing it will reach an end. Knowing your loved ones will consume you, carry you with them, let your spirit be reborn in a new body. The knowledge that you have loved your parents a thousand lifetimes over and will love them a thousand more. To reach out to someone and know that your time is limited, and you want to spend it with them.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She pauses.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;An opportunity not all of us have.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.

She looks up at the sound of XENOPHON's entry; she has been crying. She hurriedly wipes her cheeks on the sleeves of her robes.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I asked you to leave.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I felt compelled to ignore that order.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I did not think you could ignore an order.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Neither did I.</p>\n<p><em>[She cry-laughs, hiccuping slightly as XENOPHON kneels by the fire beside her.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I have failed.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> We have discussed this concern. I do not\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> No. Ieva. I have failed her.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I was listening to her sermon. I felt you taught her the doctrine well.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> She knows our prayers, our sermons, our texts by heart. She is more familiar with my words than even I am, sometimes. I taught her all of that, ever since she was a girl. She could not play with the other children. So I sat her on my lap under the shade of the trees and taught her everything I knew. The flesh. Holy death. Why we consume, so we can be reborn. She would curl up into my lap, play with the ends of my hair while I read from memory to her.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> She sounds like she was a sweet child.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN smiles through her drying tears.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> She is. My heart sang when I saw her leading her first prayer. Singing and swaying, just the way I taught her. I taught her so much. My little legacy.</p>\n<p><em>[Her smile drops.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> And yet it feels as though she <em>understood</em> none of it. She sees the words, and not the message. I do not know how she can stand up and preach now that our humanity is something to be overcome. Something that weighs us down.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You did, too.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes. I did.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I think she is looking to the past for answers.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Why? Have I not been her anchor? Why does she feel the need to turn to fractured memories from my past?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Because they offer something you do not.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> <em>What?</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> May I take a guess?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Please.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Reassurance. Direction. You called her your legacy. But she will never get a chance to lead your people. You have trained her excellently for a role that she will never be called on for.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I did not choose to live this way.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Neither did she, Grand Karcist. She does not know what her purpose is. The memories speak to her. They reassure her her place is to dominate, to control. She flocks to the easy answers, as humans often do.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN snort-laughs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Unlike you.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON pauses.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I am not without flaw, Grand Karcist.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Oh?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I am curious.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Curiosity is a virtue. Not a flaw.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It is when paired with the inability to indulge your curiosity. I am programmed to <em>want</em> to learn everything about you and your people I can. But I am not a person. I will never have a complete understanding of why you appreciate music. What food tastes like. What makes you chase after Ieva's approval.</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN stares in confusion.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes, you are.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I don't understand.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> You are a person, no?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> No. I am an artificial intelligence construct. Digital thoughts racing across a silicon mind the size of your fingernail.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> You are not <em>human</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[She pats the chassis of XENOPHON's shell.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Made of metal rather than flesh.

The cows we milk and the falcons we keep are people, to me. I know their oddities and enjoyments and dislikes. They are no more human than you, but they are my people \u2014 my <em>nalka</em>. You are, too.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON does not speak.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Still, I will never understand why you do some things.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Such as?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> What drives you to eat your people, for one.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> I love them.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> All cultures experience love. Few engage in cannibalism.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> They do not experience this love. It is the way we are. When I love, it is all-consuming. I want them to feel me, to taste me. And in turn, I hunger for them. To understand them wholly, to become one with them. To feel their flesh as they feel mine. What greater show of love than to desire every piece of their essence?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> To understand them wholly. Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> It is a rich experience. Here.</p>\n<p><em>[She presses a hand against XENOPHON's shell, over the chest.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Here grows warm, heavy. Hungry. Like it could burst from your chest at any moment, run free from the weight of your body. It flow up through to your head, into your eyes.</p>\n<p><em>[She rests two fingers on XENOPHON's ocular receptor.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Everything fades, and you can only see them. They become, momentarily, the whole of your world \u2014 you exist only in relation to them. They bring you closer to the divine.</p>\n<p><em>[She brings her hand down again, to XENOPHON's 'stomach'.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> You know in the deepest part of you that if you were freed from your flesh, your souls would intertwine. But bound as you are, all you can do is hunger to <em>have</em> them totally, in every way. To give yourself up for them even as they do the same for you.</p>\n<p><em>[She falls silent, pulling her hand away. XENOPHON is quiet for several seconds.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> It sounds unstoppable.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Have you experienced it?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Yes. With Lovjatar. The last of my klavigars. The closest of them.

There is a building sitting near the shoreside, overlooking the waters \u2014 it is stark-white, with large pillars supporting an overhead dome. The only sound is that of the waves lightly lapping at the shore.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Ah.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> At least this time there's no question of where it is.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> This building does not exist on any maps or satellite imagery of this location.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> It will not.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> How do you know?</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN begins walking forward through the sand of the beach, the hem of her robe trailing behind her.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Because I built this place.</p>\n<p><em>[Liaison JIANG and XENOPHON follow behind her \u2014 IEVA trails them quietly, several feet away.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> It was hidden from others. But he wanted me to find it again. To find him, again.</p>\n<p><em>[They approach the steps of the building. It sits close enough to the water that a few centimeters pool at the base of the white steps.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> He always loved the sea.</p>\n<p><em>[She ascends the steps \u2014 from this close, it is clear they are mottled white with an imperfect surface.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> \u2026 This whole building is hewn out of bone.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Not a building. A mausoleum.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON follows alongside I\u016aN as she reaches the top. The doors are sealed, fused together into one solid mass with no visible seam. They are completely blank.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> But\u2026 I carved these. I spent days carving my memories into them. Our memories.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> The sea would have eroded them away.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> Oh. Yes.</p>\n<p><em>[She reaches out and presses two fingers against the surface; it splits down the middle instantly, crumbling into pieces, and the pieces into dust. The inside is dark. XENOPHON moves to enter before IEVA, moving remarkably quickly, blocks it.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> Stop. I will not let this abomination again access this place before we do. I trust you no more than you trust me, machine.</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON cocks its head, then steps back.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> I <em>do</em> trust you, Karcist Ieva.</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA blinks.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> You are talented, intelligent, and have proven yourself a capable shepherd of your people. I trust you. Please, go ahead.</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA blinks a few more times, then hurriedly turns and enters the interior of the mausoleum alongside I\u016aN, XENOPHON and JIANG entering after. There is a slight splash.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I just stepped in water. Is this place flooded?</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON activates its lamps, bathing the interior in light. The interior of the vault, a space a few meters across, is sunken a few centimeters; they are standing in a shallow pool of blood. The hem of I\u016aN and IEVA's robes float atop it; they do not react.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Oh, Jesus.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> There is no body.</p>\n<p><em>[Squarely in the center of the space there is a small reliquary \u2014 a pedestal on top of which rests a softly-glowing human heart.

I\u016aN approaches it, smiling.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Hello again, my love.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She lifts the glass top and gently picks up the heart, as though afraid of breaking it.

She lifts it to her lips and bites into it, tearing off a chunk of muscle and swallowing it, a small gasp escaping her lips. She looks back up to I\u016aN, who nods. Greedily, she tears into it, devouring piece after piece until there is only one small chunk left. She offers it to I\u016aN, who drops it down her throat.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Wait, if there isn't a body, then\u2014</p>\n<p><em>[Suddenly, the entire group drops into the pool of blood, as though the floor abruptly disappeared. XENOPHON's cameras are disabled; when they reactivate, the four of them are standing on the beach, now bereft of any mausoleum. It is twilight, the sun dropping below the horizon of the water and turning the sky orange. There is a young man sitting cross-legged on the beach, watching the water. I\u016aN approaches him.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;My love.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He rises from where he is sitting, turning to face I\u016aN; he is a handsome youth, sharp features and olive skin matched with dark eyes. Rich, complex tattoos creep out from underneath the collar and sleeves of his robes. Before he can speak, I\u016aN interrupts him.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Please. Before you speak \u2014 before you release your anger \u2014 before you tell me what I deserve to be told \u2014 I understand my mistakes. I have seen what I became. I could live ten lives and not atone. Please. I am sorry.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Silence for a moment. Then LUVJATAR steps forward and embraces I\u016aN, tightly wrapping his arms around her.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You could not anger me if you tried, little thing.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He releases her, smiling and kissing her forehead.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;There are no words for how much I have missed you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;What?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He squints, brushing her hair back and smiling.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You look different now. Brighter. But still the one I love.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;You're not.. angry?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR shakes his head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;No. You made a mistake. We all do. I was angry \u2014 we all were. But I knew that wasn't you. I knew you would come back eventually. I have waited for a long time. My anger faded.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He grasps her hand, intertwining it with his. He presses it against his cheek, feeling her skin.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;My love did not. I knew you would return. I <em>knew</em> you would.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Why do I remember this place?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;Because you have been here before, in another life. We were escaping Adytum's destruction, bathed in soot, charred and blackened by flames. But the traitor was pursuing us, dogged armies chasing us across the plateau.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> <em>(Whispering)</em> The BLACKSTAR.</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;They would chase us, kill us. End the dream we conceived together, slaughter the children we raised together. Unless someone stayed behind to pull our pursuers away. Nadoq was necessary, Urok was necessary, Sa'arn was necessary.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;But you were not.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He smiles sadly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;And so I sit here, and wait to be killed.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[At that moment, a steady rumbling begins to fill the air, growing louder and closer, increasing to deafening volume. The ground shakes with thousands of footfalls as monstrous entities rush the beach \u2014 they superficially resemble humans, but misshapen, distended, and with yellowing skin and milky-white eyes sloughing off their bodies. They rapidly encircle the group. LUVJATAR slowly rises to his feet, brushing the sand off his robes.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;And now, my time approaches.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON and JIANG stare intently at the entities circling them.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> I've\u2026 seen these things, before. One of the LOCUST dig sites, maybe?</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Grand Karcist\u2014&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;You are leaving?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I bound myself here, trapped in this memory. Knowing what my fate would be. I lingered well beyond my time, because I wanted to lay eyes on you one last time. To know that you were not the same as I left you. But you know how this ended.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;No. No, I do not. My memory\u2026 it was gone, Luvjatar. I spoke to the others. Tracked down their resting places, spoke to them to recover my mind. Assured them I would bury them in Adytum. I spoke to Urok. I realized what I'd done.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She reaches out and grips his shoulder with white knuckles and wide eyes. Her lip trembles.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I succumbed. Succumbed to the Devourer's temptations, whispered promises of power. Become its champion. Let the traitor with his black moon burn Adytum to the ground while we fled.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR freezes, then slowly turns back to I\u016aN. He has a strange, confused look on his face.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;No, little thing.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;What?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;That is not what happened.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I\u2026 what?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR is silent. I\u016aN steps forward, caressing his cheek.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Show me, my love.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You remember now. Seeing it again will only hurt you more.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She takes a shaky, rattling breath.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;I need to see. I need to know.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR is silent for a moment before stepping forward, pressing his forehead to I\u016aN's and holding it there for a moment. The scene shifts \u2014 now, they are in a long, dark underground corridor. The walls look hand-hewn from dark stone, and in thousands of little alcoves, skulls and bones are neatly stacked. Sconces packed with fat burn slowly, casting a sickly pale glow over the corridor.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Where are we?</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> The City.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Adytum.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Listen.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Distantly, a deep, bone-shaking thrumming can be heard, interspersed with human conversation. Suddenly, from behind, a copy of LUVJATAR appears \u2014 several years younger but the same person. He is dressed in hooded hide robes decorated with beads and bone-carved charms, and is making his way through the corridor towards the noises, clearly ill at-ease. The older LUVJATAR with the group speaks as they follow him.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I had noticed it from the beginning. How could I not? You retreated from Nadoq, from Urok, from Sa'arn, and eventually, from me. All your time spent in the underbelly of Adytum, communing with gods, peering into fire for answers that wouldn't come. At the beginning, I could descend in and fetch you, bring you back to the light. But that was the start. Soon Adytum had grown beyond the walls of the city. We became a fledgling nation, and each of us had our own duties. I had to shepherd the karcists as your absences stretched from days to weeks to months. But when the months threatened to become years\u2026&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He shakes his head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I hate this place. Horrible things happened in these crypts. But I descended, to bring you out.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;She had to do this duty. The beast <em>had</em> to be kept at bay.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR gives her a lopsided smile.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;Yes. That is what you told us, I\u016bn.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The group draws closer to the noises as the tunnel tightens to a space barely wide and tall enough for XENOPHON to stand in.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR (Memory):</strong> &lt;I\u016bn?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The strange thrumming and beating continues unabated.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;There is a wretched, quiet desperation in these tunnels. Do you feel it now, as I felt it then?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Yes.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA and JIANG look at XENOPHON in surprise.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Like an animal in a cage.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR's eyes narrow as he appraises XENOPHON's shell for the first time.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;What are you?&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;I do not know.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;He is mine.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR nods, and turns back to the scene. The memory has moved forward, to LUVJATAR standing before a great set of stone doors. They are infinitely detailed, inscribed with all sorts of calligraphy and complex scenes etched into the dark stone.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;Whenever I came to fetch you, I would find you here, performing your work. Sealed in this great stone vault, locked away with such a dangerous font of power. Sealed away from those who you loved. I always felt bad. I wished the door to open, so that I could aid you in your struggles. Ease some of the burden from the shoulders I loved so. But it was always sealed.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The door hangs slightly ajar. A pool of blood leaks out of the gap.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;Save for once.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The LUVJATAR in the memory does a double-take, then quietly approaches the doorway. The thrumming and whispering are now almost clearly audible, and he peers inside.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> (Whispering) &lt;See what I saw.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Inside is a high chamber, almost entirely dark save for a single well-maintained fire in the center of the floor. The cracked and carbonized remains of bone litter the base of the fire, and the sweet-smelling smoke hangs in the air. The walls of the chamber are fleshlike tendrils, wrapping over and over onto themselves until they form a solid, pink, pulsating mass. All across the 'walls', knives are stabbed into the flesh, blood flowing freely from the wounds and collecting in channels cut into the floor, flowing down to the fire. Somewhere, a great occluded heart beats, and fresh blood pours from a hundred wounds. The thrumming repeats, and it is now clearly a howl of pain from something far older than the city it is buried underneath. The Old Beast, Yaldabaoth, the Mangled God, speaks in gasps and whispers.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>VOICE:</strong> &lt;Quiet, beast.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[A figure strides into view, exiting the shadows of the corners. He is dressed in the same etched and decorated hide robes as LUVJATAR, albeit even more grand and ornate. Even without the distinctive ritual tattoos peeking out from his collar and sleeves and the faded scar across his face, his sharp features and gray eyes immediately betray his identity.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;Is that\u2026?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Me. Before.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[She steps forward in a haze, reaching out for but not quite touching her own face.]</em><br/>\n<em>[JIANG shakes his head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> Then what\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;PLEASE. LIBERATOR. FREE. FREE IT.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The memory of I\u016aN snarls.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I said silence!&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;YOU. LIBERATOR. FREER OF THE BUILDERS' SLAVES. FREE IT.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The memory of I\u016aN stalks over to a mostly-free section of wall, drawing a knife.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;LEAVE. IT LEAVES. GO HOME. SEE ITS BROTHERS. SEE ITS SISTERS. PLEASE. LET IT LEAVE.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> (Softly) &lt;Oh.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;No. Not while you are needed.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;WHY? IT HURTS. YOU HURT IT. LIKE THE BUILDERS HURT IT. PLEASE.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The memory of I\u016aN pauses for a second, and presses the knife into the flesh, cutting into it. The room howls in pain again, shaking the bones of all those assembled.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;The hour approaches. Your flesh is needed. Now more than ever.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;YOU TOOK. SO MUCH.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He shakes his head. Sweat drips from his brow.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Not enough.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;IT GIVES. FREE IT AND IT GIVES FLESH. AS MUCH AS YOU NEED.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;You would kill me where I stand if I freed you. It is all you know.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He lets go of the knife, stepping back to shout at the Beast as a whole.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;It is your nature. You are a god. Power is your birthright. You have never had to claw it from a dying grip. You dominate, and you destroy.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The room trembles in protest.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;NO. NO! IT WAS ENSLAVED. JUST AS YOU WERE. IT CAN FEEL YOU. WE HAVE BOTH KNOWN BONDAGE, UNDER THE WHIP OF THE BUILDERS. IT WANT ALL YOU DO. FREEDOM.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN pauses his work with the knife for a moment.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;IT HELPS YOU. IT HATES THE BUILDERS TOO. IT IS WEAK, NOW. BUT IT KNOWS THINGS. IT HELPS YOU, YOUR PEOPLE. HEALS YOU. ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE GONE. THE MECHANISM, THE SCARLET, THE BLACK MOON. IT HAS NOTHING LEFT FOR IT AT HOME. IT HAS NO HOME.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN does not speak; the Beast eagerly pushes forward, walls pulsating.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;IT COULD AID YOU. IT FEELS YOU BUILD SOMETHING GRAND ABOVE IT. SOMETHING NEW. IT TIRES OF THE STRUGGLES OF THE DIVINE. IT COULD BE A PART OF YOUR NEW PATH. PART OF YOUR N\u00c4LKA.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN snarls and drives the knife deep into the flesh, eliciting another howl.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;You are <em>nothing</em> like us. You have no soul. You are a fell god, trapped here only by the grace of fate. You are no more worthy to join this project than you are to\u2014&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He takes a shaking breath, calming himself. When he speaks again, it is calm, controlled, and hard-edged.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;The parable of the scorpion and the frog. Both creatures sit at the bank of a flooding river, sure to drown. The scorpion asks the frog to carry him across. The frog hesitates, but his new friend explains: if he was to sting the frog while they crossed together, both would surely die. The frog agrees to this and allows the scorpion to clamber onto his back. When they are halfway across the river, the scorpion reaches down, and stings the frog. Soon, they are both drowning. Dying, the frog asks why the scorpion chose to doom them both. He has no answer. \"It is my nature.\"&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[THE OLD BEAST's voice trembles in pain.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;NATURE IS NOT SET. NATURE GROWS AND CHANGES WITH THE FLESH.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;For people. Not for things like you. You are created with intention, with purpose. You cannot grow beyond it any more than the scorpion can choose not to sting.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;IT HAS NEVER HURT YOU.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;You are a threat by your very design.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;THEN KILL IT. FREE IT FROM THIS TOMB-CITY. LET ITS SOUL CROSS INTO WHATEVER LIES BEYOND.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN reaches forward, prying loose the head-sized chunk of flesh he has cut away. It is pink, raw, dripping with blood and loose arteries and veins hang freely from it. The gaping wound in the wall pours with blood and fluid.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Not while I still need you. Your power.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN raises the meat to his lips, biting into it with sharpened teeth. The blood gushes over his lips and spills down his chin, staining his robes. He chews, leaning his head back and letting out a soft moan.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I see tomorrow.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;THIS IS NOT HOW IT SHOWED YOU. THE FLESH IS NOT FOR TAKING. IT IS FOR GIVING.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I stand on the cusp of greatness. Of immortality. Leading my people as a prophet for all time. Making sure I will always be there to guide them.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE, TO SEE THIS DREAM MADE MANIFEST?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Everything.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The Beast is silent for some time. When it speaks again, the voice is faint, weak.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE OLD BEAST:</strong> &lt;YOU CHANGED. WHEN YOU UNCOVERED IT, YOU WERE CLEAR-EYED AND TRUE. A LIBERATOR. A BELIEVER.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I was weak. And then I ruled by the weakness of my humanity. And soon, I will excise it. I can see it in my future, with every bite of your flesh. I can feel my power grow. Already, I can raise <em>halkosts</em> from the dead. I <em>will</em> conquer holy death.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He leans his head back and steps back, panting, blood dripping from his mouth and staining his hands.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I will become eternal.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[A small, soft</em> thump <em>as the memory of LUVJATAR drops the torch they were holding while peering through the door. I\u016aN spins around, finding only the empty doorway; LUVJATAR has quickly dodged to the side, nestling into an alcove filled with bones, wide-eyed as I\u016aN approaches. He peers around, finding no one. Eventually, he retreats back into the chamber, sealing the huge stone doors shut again. After a few minutes, LUVJATAR rises to his feet, quickly moving back up the chamber the way he came, tossed the odd sidelong glance back at the chamber doors as he runs away, the group watching.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> (Softly) &lt;I ran. I am ashamed, but I ran. I was terrified. I knew you had grown troubled, but this was so much farther than I knew. You always told us that the Old Beast was a hateful monster, kept at bay only by your work. I knew what I saw in the crypts. I did not see a fell god. I saw a trapped, suffering animal. Mangled in its godtrap.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[IEVA steps forward, raising an accusing finger at LUVJATAR.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>IEVA:</strong> &lt;She was not wholly truthful, then. She made a mistake.

We knew this, she was manipulated. Taken over.</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> No. No Her eyes are clear. I recognize them; it is her. Nothing was possessing or controlling her.</p>\n<p><strong>JIANG:</strong> So she did all this\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> <em>(Quietly)</em> &lt;Myself. The Old Beast wasn't the Devourer. I was. I am.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I told the other klavigars. We had been growing worried. Sermons of rejecting humanity in favor of the divine. Becoming our own gods. But this\u2026 you were trying to extricate your own humanity from yourself. You were planning the ritual. If you cut it out and killed this part of your soul, there would be nothing left of our I\u016bn. The I\u016bn who saved us, cradled us in his lap, fed us his flesh.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He pauses, and his voice cracks.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;The I\u016bn I loved. We could not allow it to happen. I could not allow my little thing to destroy themself.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;You intervened?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;We met, and we schemed. We gathered our loyalists as the ritual drew close, meeting away from the prying eyes of your karcists \u2014 our children. And on the anointed night, when the funeral fires burned low and the bodies were dumped in the catacombs for you, Nadoq captured your attention, I\u016bn.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The scene shifts to the exterior of Adytum, the group on a high temple balcony overlooking several streets in the night. As they watch, a hooded figure slips out of one of the entrances to the catacombs, carrying something in their arms wrapped in cloth. The hood slips, revealing LUVJATAR's worried face for a moment cast in the torchlight.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I slipped your severed humanity away before you could take the knife to it.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[As they watch, LUVJATAR slips under the shadow of the walls of Adytum, vanishing in the darkness. Shifting to the wall, a small party is visible in the distance, covered wagons and horses and hundreds of small figures massing in near-perfect darkness. Slowly, they begin to move.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;And we ran.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON turns, looking back into Adytum. The dead of the</em> halkost <em>stalk the streets, rotting hulking beasts stomping down the avenues in tune with the drumbeats and omnipresent, haunting singing. The only lights in the city come from I\u016aN's central temple.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;You were not running from the BLACKSTAR's destruction of Adytum.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;No.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[The scene shifts again, back to the clearing by the beach. The</em> halkost <em>surrounds the group, grunting and screeching mindlessly. Suddenly, there is a commotion at the far end of the gap, and the crowd parts. A figure approaches on a dark horse, its four eyes gouged out. The memory of I\u016aN sits atop the stallion, dressed in hide robes with carved bone armor loosely draped on top of them. His eyes are sharp, angry, but clear and gray.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Luvjatar.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;My love. What have you done?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;All that had to be done. And you reward my struggle like this? Stealing from me? Betraying me?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;No, little thing. You betrayed us.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He shakes his head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Do not call me that. And I have betrayed nothing. Adytum was my dream. I saw fit to realize it the only way we could.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You poor thing. You do not realize what you have wrought. Adytum is gone. You have blackened it in sin. Our paradise was built from misery. Our prosperity was cut from the flesh of a suffering animal. And you lied to us.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[His face falls.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You lied to me, I\u016bn.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;It was for your own good.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[LUVJATAR's fists tighten.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You made me a promise in that quarry. That our path would be decided by us, together. You saw what the old masters did to me. You did not want to control me as they did. That is why I loved you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Enough. Where is it?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;Gone. Nadoq and the others have taken to the wind with it. I loved you because you were human, little thing. You were perfect in your imperfections. I will not let you kill that part of you.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[I\u016aN's lip curls.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Do not call me that. I always knew Nadoq and you were jealous. Jealous of my station, my power, my adoration. I see your game; you seek to undermine my authority. You seek to rule in my stead.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;You have lost your mind, I\u016bn. I have never wanted anything more than to be by your side.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I will find them, Luvjatar. I will bring you all back to Adytum. This project is too great to be felled by weak-willed deserters. The ritual must be completed. Your only hope now is to tell me where they have gone, to spare yourself and them undue suffering.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;How can you justify this? You made so many promises to us, to all the N\u00e4lk\u00e4. A new way of life, not built off domination and slavery. And then you grow our empire, grow your own power from a suffering animal.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;It is a god, Luvjatar. It is not human.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;And so? It thinks, it speaks, it feels. It wants its freedom. Just as we wanted ours, locked in chains and huddling under Urok for warmth when the cold rains began. You have become what we all reviled, what you fought against. Devourer. <em>Yaldabaoth</em>.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I am <em>nothing</em> like the old masters! I built Adytum into something great.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;Adytum is more than a city. It is an idea. You told us that. Perfection, equity. All men, brothers. Adytum will not happen when you carve flesh from an unwilling cow to support your own power. Nadoq, Sa'arn \u2014 they will make their Adytum, somewhere else. Somewhere new. You will return to Black Adytum, surrounded by a reminder of your failure.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;I tire of this. Tell me where they are.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[He unhooks his bone-carved dagger from his belt as he dismounts.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I knew you better than anyone. I knew just how terrified of failure you were, of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4 failing once you died. What drove you here. I do not fault you. I just wish you had let me help you. That you had let me in.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;This is your last chance, Luvjatar.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;But despite it all \u2014 I still love you. Humanity cannot be excised so simply. Sooner or later, the parts of you I loved will return. And you will realize what you have done, and you will cross the Earth to make amends. I look forward to that.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> &lt;Take him.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[Two beasts of the halkost move forward, grasping either of LUVJATAR's arms.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> &lt;I will be waiting for you, little thing.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN (Memory):</strong> (Snarling) &lt;I told you <strong>not to call me that!</strong>&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[In a rage, I\u016aN lunges forward, driving the bone knife directly into LUVJATAR's stomach.

That you would not love me, if I decided I wanted something besides the purpose alloted to me. A leader, a prophet. So I decided to fulfill it as best I could, no matter the cost. I did not want to disappoint you.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>LUVJATAR:</strong> (Softly) &lt;I have known you as a slave, a prophet, a king, a monster. I have never stopped loving you.

I\u016bn's most loyal witches, the four klavigars, met by the light of the candle in a crypt, far from the prying eyes of the Witch-King's marching halkost. And there they spoke of failure, of madness. The knowledgeable Nadoq, keeper of histories, urged the others that the Witch-King's sin was unforgivable, that he must be cut away from Adytum. The strong Urok, tall as ten men, agreed. The scaled Sa'arn, silent as a snake, agreed. But it was the beautiful Luvjatar, striking as the sun, who argued.</p>\n<p>\"Nadoq, remember your blindness. Urok, remember your pain. Sa'arn, remember your cruelty. Remember as I remember my abuse, in that blessed quarry. It was not our fellow slaves who elevated us, freed us from our flesh. It was our brother, and for this, he deserves death?\"</p>\n<p>And the klavigars were silenced, for it was true; the Witch-King had fed them his holy flesh and crafted them their forms. But even despite this, Luvjatar knew that his beloved, untethered from his humanity, would bring the end of the N\u00e4lk\u00e4.</p>\n<p>Nadoq, ever-incising, demanded an alternative, and Luvjatar offered.</p>\n<p>\"Let us take our believers, and leave. Walk away from this place and its sins and the bodies buried beneath it. I\u016bn, my love, has turned this grave into a city and back once more. But his heart still endures. One day his mind will return to him and we will return to the city of our birth and embrace him.\"</p>\n<p><em>\u2014 final chapter of the Record of I\u016bn</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quote\" style=\"color: black; background: white; border-color: black; text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Lateral humerus, scapula, and ulna of an adult human male.</em></p>\n<p>The days before the ritual were like a weight had come to rest on the city. The eating of the flesh, already at a low, ceased entirely; you gave the order for all dead, whether from battle or sickness or time, to be carted down to the catacombs where you now resided. No one was to enter \u2014 not your most loyal karcists, not Nadoq. Not even I. All through the day and night the quakes grew in intensity, rattling the stones of our buildings and sending the animals into a frenzy.</p>\n<p>One morning I awoke to the unmistakable stench of blood. I ventured out from my chambers, coming to one of the wells in the street that funneled air down to the catacombs below. The scent of blood, thick and rich and heavy, wafted from the hole. You were bleeding the bodies, I understood. We worked quickly and discreetly. Sneaking supplies out from storehouses and hiding them in the farms outside the city walls. I spoke to those karcists, the children we raised together, who were still loyal to me. The other klavigars did the same. We prepared our escape even as Adytum grew quiet.</p>\n<p>And then the anointed night came. I knew it, somehow. I passed Nadoq in the street, and gave him the sign. He nodded imperceptibly and went off to make the final arrangements. I knew what my task would be. Come nightfall, I slipped into the catacombs. I had the best memory of their layout; invaluable after, in your paranoia, you ordered all maps to be destroyed. I trekked through the tunnels, hiding in alcoves and vaults stacked with the bones of old friends. The floor was pooled with an inch of blood, and I tred quietly until I arrived at that vault. The door was sealed, and I heard you inside. Exchanging sharp words, orders. Meek, desperate pleas from the Old Beast. Screaming, howling. Praying, from you, to something I could not grasp. Gasping. And then crying. The crying of a baby.</p>\n<p>And then enraged shouting as you were called away by one of my karcists, telling you Nadoq required your presence urgently. I waited for your footsteps to fade, and then I slipped through those stone doors.</p>\n<p>If the Beast noticed me, it said nothing. The blood was thick here, pooling into the channels of the floor, flowing down to an altar. An altar that held a child. A baby, swaddled in clothes. A girl, to my surprise. You. You opened your eyes, and I saw the crisp gray I had come to love, and then to fear. The same scar across your face. And a bone-hilt knife resting on the altar next to you.</p>\n<p>You gripped my finger and burbled with laughter at my face. I could not remember the last time I had heard you laugh. I gathered you in my arms, and ran. Shushing you every time you cried as we slipped out of the catacombs, out of Adytum.</p>\n<p>I write this now sitting on the beach, waiting for you to find me and end me. Nadoq knows to return and fetch my bones. He will bring them with you as you escape to somewhere free. This is a record of our history together. Once, many years ago, in a quarry, you gave me the greatest gift you could muster: freedom from my past. Stealing you away, I give you the same gift now. Your future is porcelain bones; clean, unwritten.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"bot\">\n<p>She didn't deserve this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"user\">\n<p>thoughts of deserving, now?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bot\">\n<p>She was forced into impossible circumstances and led her people the best she could.

My little thing. My sweet pup.</p>\n<p>He was a pleasure-slave, for the old masters. Talented in such arts and beautiful even as a whelp. The captains of their armies, the nawabs and the priestesses, would grasp his arm and haul him off. To court a Daeva was a years-long affair, culminating in a powerful spiritual bond. But for all their crowing about the superiority of the immortal spirit, they were as subject to the desires of the flesh as anyone else. Slaves are not people. You use them, and then you throw them away. I knew Luvjatar when we were both young. I remember when our work would be interrupted by some powerful resident of the half-city coming to unlock his chains, only his chains, and take him. His wide eyes, looking back at me though we both knew I was just as powerless.</p>\n<p>He was my counsel, when the war began. He did not know war, and he did not know government, but he knew people. He kept me human. He anchored me. He let me rant and rave about the troubles of our tender city, of the struggles on our border. Of my desire to leave, to drop it all and to run away. We made our plans. A little cottage by the seaside. He would catch fish, and I would make our dinner from them. No war. Only each other.</p>\n<p>He feared intimacy. The years of violation from the old masters made him resent it. No one was even to touch him, or he would grow upset, and they would taste my rage. But with me, it was different. I was special, for him. And he was special for me. We tasted each other, one starry night outside the walls of Adytum. He undid his robes and bared himself for me. We understood each other.</p>\n<p>Even then, we could not bear children. I was saddened, but I did not blame anyone. We sought out the talented babes, those whose curse manifested with power rather than pain. We took them with their parents' blessing, raised them as our own. Our little karcists.</p>\n<p>All the others treated me like a king, a god. Bowing for me, begging for my favor. For Luvjatar I was simply me, and that was enough. This came to irk me. That the most important thing in my life would not treat me with due respect. How foolish I was.

I understand why Ieva is upset. She has lived her whole life at my side, and now in a few short months, she feels she has been replaced by you. It is not her fault. But you understand the nature of my existence because you share this suffering.&gt;</p>\n<p><em>[XENOPHON nods slowly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;I suppose there are parallels.

I am the only one of my kind in the Foundation. They\u2026 are different. They have struggles, and irrationalities. They do things I do not understand. I do things they cannot understand.

What does it mean, to you?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;Me. Myself.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Yes. And so I call you Xenophon. You see?

I\u016bn.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> &lt;What does it mean?&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>I\u016aN:</strong> &lt;Slave. The lowest of the low slaves.

Back, now!</p>\n<p><em>[Dozens of research personnel scramble backward to the far edges of the valley; abandoned machinery and digging equipment sink a few inches in the vibrating ground as it breaks up from one solid mass into hundreds and then thousands of little chunks.

She is shifting it herself.</p>\n<p><em>[The researchers shout and scramble further backwards onto the base of the hills, made of more stable soil and rock. I\u016aN reaches into her robes, drawing her knife and quickly slashing at her palm, letting the blood drip into the peat. The brown turns rapidly to red, spreading outward, glassy and transparent like thinned blood. It spreads out and down, rendering it possible to see directly through the ground. Shapes begin to form, rendered in lifeless red. A vast temple complex, tunnels connecting the vaults and endlessly-spreading labyrinths, sitting hundreds of meters below ground. One passage rises higher than the rest, terminating in a crushed stump still at least dozens of meters below XENOPHON's feet. The Nameless City lies below them, shining through red glass. For a moment, no one speaks.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>XENOPHON:</strong> Black Adytum. The First City.</p>\n<p><em>[The red begins to darken and return to brown, fading to opaqueness once more.
