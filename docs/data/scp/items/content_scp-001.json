The first answer is that it <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">is</span> was a placeholder, a theoretical designation for the prime cause, the ultimate reason for all the paranormal crap we deal with on a daily basis. SCP-001 is <strong><em>why</em></strong> we have to deal with omnicidal reptiles, ever expanding rooms, extra-dimensional pools of red goop and consumer products that don\u2019t obey the normal laws of physics. Of course, given that all these things\u2014 as dangerous and deadly and just plain insane as they all are\u2014 are inherently patternless and self-contradictory, most researchers are convinced that there is no possible unifying principle for them all, much less a common source.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re wrong.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s more than one reason that cross-testing is discouraged, and the O5s even look down on excessive cross-<em>referencing</em> of SCPs. The O5s don\u2019t want any one group looking at more than a handful of these things at once, because of what they discovered when the Foundation <em>tried</em> to develop a Grand Unified Theory of SCPs. That research is mostly gone now. Site-001-Alpha was dismantled, scrubbed from the archives, the staff mind-wiped and reassigned. No one left but me, and I wouldn\u2019t know anything if it wasn\u2019t for my habit of not trusting the Foundation servers and having my own hidden personal archive the O5s missed in their panic.</p>\n<p>I was a data analyst at Site-001-Alpha <em>[Note to O5 Command: Don\u2019t bother looking for me, I finished the job you started, the identities of all former staff at Site-001-Alpha have been <strong>completely</strong> scrubbed from the records, you know as much as they do now.]</em> and I participated in the first and only attempt to consolidate all Foundation data on all SCPs. I was in charge of data integrity. And as much of a mess as you might think that was, it was an order of magnitude worse.</p>\n<p>Forget the memetic SCPs, or the ones that modify their own description, or the ones that seem to only inhabit infospace and slip into the database to wreak havoc. That\u2019s all SOP for anyone who works with the Foundation\u2019s network, just a matter of scale. Worse were the completely inexplicable, unexpected <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">changes in data</span></p>\n<p>Sorry, that\u2019s wrong, even though I can\u2019t help thinking of it that way. It isn\u2019t a change in <em>data</em> when <em>reality</em> is shifting to match. I don\u2019t know a lot about the internals of the software we used, but I know that part of it ran outside what we think of as the \u201creal world.\u201d And, at first, everyone thought that the audit trails it produced were some sort of bug. However, it became apparent that the nature of the software, its purposeful isolation from the narrative-affecting SCPs, allowed it to record something far more important.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not visible to you, or the O5s, or even to most of the SCPs we deal with, but the Foundation\u2014 and by extension the entire universe\u2014 is in a state of constant shifting reality flux. SCP files appeared and disappeared from our database with alarming regularity, and the SCPs referred to, to all appearance, appeared and disappeared along with them. Not just SCPs, but personnel, whole sites, and entire decades of the Foundation\u2019s history would be re-written, seemingly at random. And our own memories, and all external research would confirm that \u201cobjective\u201d reality matched the current version in our database.</p>\n<p>One of the researchers told me that it was as if we were seeing the effect of something like SCP-140, only much larger in scale.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Something a <strong>lot</strong> like SCP-140, and <strong>infinitely</strong> larger in scale.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know who did the analysis, and if I did, I wouldn\u2019t say. She\u2019s probably a lot happier not knowing about her own discovery. But she looked at what vanished and what appeared, and what subtly changed in the records, and she found the pattern, the drift toward darkness, toward narrative coherence, toward a plot\u2026</p>\n<p>Everyone who works any length of time at the Foundation knows the universe we live in is a seriously fucked up place. Those of us who still believe in God tend toward serious ambivalence about his handiwork.</p>\n<p>But we found out that there is a God, and it is SCP-001.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s a bunch of horror writers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Emergency Containment Protocol ZK-001-Alpha <strong>O5 Eyes Only</strong></p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Enter\u00a0Decryption\u00a0Key</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Decryption\u00a0Key\u00a0Accepted</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Note: Containment Protocol ZK-001-Alpha carries a non-zero risk of creating a ZK-Class Reality Failure scenario.

Since prior experiments have shown information feedback via the SCP data warehouse, a possible method of attack and or control has been developed.

scrubbed from the archives, the staff mind-wiped and reassigned.\u00a0\u00a0No one left but me, and I wouldn\u2019t know anything if it wasn\u2019t for my habit of not trusting the Foundation servers and having my own hidden personal archive the O5s missed in their panic.\n\n> \n\n> I was a data analyst at Site-001-Alpha //[Note to O5 Command: Don\u2019t bother looking for me, I finished the job you started, the identities of all former staff at Site-001-Alpha have been **completely** scrubbed from the records, you know as much as they do now.]// and I participated in the first and only attempt to consolidate all Foundation data on all SCPs.\u00a0\u00a0I was in charge of data integrity.\u00a0\u00a0And as much of a mess as you might think that was, it was an order of magnitude worse.\n\n> \n\n> Forget the memetic SCPs, or the ones that modify their own description, or the ones that seem to only inhabit infospace and slip into the database to wreak havoc.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s all SOP for anyone who works with the Foundation\u2019s network, just a matter of scale.\u00a0\u00a0Worse were the completely inexplicable, unexpected --changes in data--\n\n> \n\n> Sorry, that\u2019s wrong, even though I can\u2019t help thinking of it that way.\u00a0\u00a0It isn\u2019t a change in //data// when //reality// is shifting to match.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t know a lot about the internals of the software we used, but I know that part of it ran outside what we think of as the \u201creal world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0And, at first, everyone thought that the audit trails it produced were some sort of bug.\u00a0\u00a0However, it became apparent that the nature of the software, its purposeful isolation from the narrative-affecting SCPs, allowed it to record something far more important.\n\n> \n\n> It\u2019s not visible to you, or the O5s, or even to most of the SCPs we deal with, but the Foundation\u2014 and by extension the entire universe\u2014 is in a state of constant shifting reality flux.\u00a0\u00a0SCP files appeared and disappeared from our database with alarming regularity, and the SCPs referred to, to all appearance, appeared and disappeared along with them.\u00a0\u00a0Not just SCPs, but personnel, whole sites, and entire decades of the Foundation\u2019s history would be re-written, seemingly at random.\u00a0\u00a0And our own memories, and all external research would confirm that \u201cobjective\u201d reality matched the current version in our database.\n\n> \n\n> One of the researchers told me that it was as if we were seeing the effect of something like SCP-140, only much larger in scale.\n\n> \n\n> Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0Something a **lot** like SCP-140, and **infinitely** larger in scale.\n\n> \n\n> I don\u2019t know who did the analysis, and if I did, I wouldn\u2019t say.\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019s probably a lot happier not knowing about her own discovery.\u00a0\u00a0But she looked at what vanished and what appeared, and what subtly changed in the records, and she found the pattern, the drift toward darkness, toward narrative coherence, toward a plot. . .\n\n> \n\n> Everyone who works any length of time at the Foundation knows the universe we live in is a seriously fucked up place.\u00a0\u00a0Those of us who still believe in God tend toward serious ambivalence about his handiwork.\n\n> \n\n> But we found out that there is a God, and it is SCP-001.\n\n> \n\n> And it\u2019s a bunch of horror writers.\n\n> \n\n> [[/collapsible]] \n\n> \n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Emergency Containment Protocol ZK-001-Alpha **O5 Eyes Only**\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Enter Decryption Key\" hide=\"Decryption Key Accepted\"]]\n\n\n\nNote: Containment Protocol ZK-001-Alpha carries a non-zero risk of creating a ZK-Class Reality Failure scenario.\u00a0\u00a0Use should only be authorized in an attempt to mitigate an end-of-the-world scenario or the imminent destruction of the Foundation.\n\n\n\nResearch at Site-001-Gamma has conducted narrative analysis on SCP-001's changes to the observable universe.\u00a0\u00a0Conclusions are that SCP-001 consists of multiple entities showing cognitive patterns that are indistinguishable from human, and that these entities are therefore susceptible to memetic effects.\u00a0\u00a0Since prior experiments have shown information feedback via the SCP data warehouse, a possible method of attack and or control has been developed.\u00a0\u00a0Protocol ZK-001-Alpha, when initiated, will cause a software viral insertion of a variety of memetic agents into the SCP database which, through the observed information feedback, should expose SCP-001 to the memetic effects of these agents.\u00a0\u00a0Protocol ZK-001-Alpha consists of three stages:\n\n# Memetic agents inserted to promote calm and/or well-being\n\n# Memetic agents inserted to promote sleep, unconsciousness or catatonia.\n\n# Memetic agents inserted to cause death.\n\nGiven the nature of SCP-001 and our limited interaction with it, it is not possible at this time to safely test\u00a0\u00a0Protocol ZK-001-Alpha, and it is unknown if the universe can continue to exist without interaction with SCP-001.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n[[include <a
