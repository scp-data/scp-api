Under no circumstances are any instances of SCP-001 to be stored at the same site, allowed to interact in any manner, or to be made aware of information regarding other members of the group. Personnel assigned to any single SCP-001 subject are not to be made aware of the other instances of SCP-001 or the connections among them.</p>\n<p>SCP-001 subjects are not to come into direct contact with any other anomalous items outside of approved testing.</p>\n<p>REVISED \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588: O5 SPECIAL ORDER A-1130-X</p>\n<p>In light of the events resultant in SCP-001-05's death, the use of SCP-001 subjects in the neutralization of anomalous objects is hereby prohibited. All care is to be taken to keep SCP-001 subjects alive and unharmed. Recovery and containment of SCP-001 subjects is to be considered highest priority. In the case of a death event, Ouroboros Protocol is to be initiated as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001 is a group of thirty-six individuals, designated SCP-001-01 through SCP-001-036. There is no apparent pattern in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, or religious affiliation amongst SCP-001 subjects.</p>\n<p>SCP-001 subjects display no anomalous properties of their own. However, any anomalous item, entity, or property brought into close proximity with an SCP-001 subject will be greatly modified from its original properties: most often, this will result in a lessening or total nullification of anomalous properties. Those properties not nullified will be changed so as to display consistency between objects of similar properties. All of these effects are instantaneous and will occur without any input from the subject. The area of these effects will expand in when multiple SCP-001 subjects are brought together, as well as the intensity of changes: multiple SCP-001 subjects are capable of nullifying anomalous effects without being aware of the presence of said objects.</p>\n<p>All subjects of SCP-001 seem to be instinctively aware of information regarding other SCP-001 subjects, generally the total number of the group and details of between one and three individuals. This knowledge is vague, making locating uncontained subjects difficult.</p>\n<p>The death of an SCP-001 subject will result in the manifestation of multiple anomalous entities and phenomena in the area. These manifestations will be of such a scope that traditional containment measures are unfeasible, and will result in significant casualties and collateral damage. Contained SCP-001 subjects have claimed that this is a result of the deceased individual's absence \"letting things through\", and that further events will be more severe as time progresses. In addition, contained subjects have claimed that any deceased individuals will be replaced by a newborn bearing the appropriate properties: no such individuals have yet been located.</p>\n<p>See Document 001-EX for a list of notable modifications to items by SCP-001 subjects. A full listing of all nullifications may be found in Document 001-N.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum-01:</strong></p>\n<p>Known members of SCP-001 are as follows:</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Designation</th>\n<th>Ethnicity</th>\n<th>Sex</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Current Status</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SCP-001-01</td>\n<td>Jewish-German</td>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>94</td>\n<td>Contained</td>\n<td>Currently in induced stasis to prevent death.

SCP-001-01 through SCP-001-05 were found in the care of three individuals, classified as POI-1458, POI-1459, and POI-1460. Said individuals possess possible ties to GOI-16 \u201cThe Horizon Initiative\u201d, and may have had a hand in its founding.</p>\n<p>The recovery effort was hindered by factional fighting within the HMFSCP. SCP-001-01 was severely injured in the resulting firefight, but was successfully stabilized and recovered along with the other subjects, and passed into the jurisdiction of the Preservationist faction. The individuals responsible for sheltering the SCP-001 subjects fled during the fighting and were not able to be apprehended.</p>\n<p><strong>Interview Log 001-11-02</strong></p>\n<p>The following interview with SCP-001-05 was recorded on\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You spoke last time of having a specific purpose. Could you please explain?</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: I am here to help set things right.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Go on.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: The world is broken, Doctor, and my brothers and sisters and I are here to heal it, to gather together and prepare the way for what is to come. The process has already been set in motion, though regrettably, there have been some setbacks.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Please explain.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: [SCP-001-01], he was the one who was to gather all the rest. With him now hovering between life and death, that duty falls to us, but we know only glimpses of a few others in our number. It is enough.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You don\u2019t fear for his safety?</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: Death is just another part of what is meant to be. It\u2019s nothing to fear.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: An admirable view of things. How did you learn of your purpose?</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: I had a dream. Portent, prophecy, hallucination, call it what you will. It planted a seed in my head, an intuition you might say. It was the next day I met [SCP-001-01].</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can you describe the dream?</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: There was a man, a man in rich clothing, like a king or emperor. He kept saying \u201cWhere is the tailor? Where is my tailor?\u201d and pacing back and forth. Each time he asked it, another voice would answer \u201cHe is close now, he is close at hand\u201d. But he did not arrive. The man became more and more upset, and as he paced moths came and landed on him, and began to eat away at his clothing. His robes began to fray and rot as more and more moths landed on him, and some even bit his skin. But then, the doors opened and there arrived not one tailor, but dozens, led by the most masterful tailor in the kingdom. The king was overjoyed, for he knew he would be saved from the moths that tried to consume him. I woke up then, and I knew. He found me, and I followed him.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: If you\u2019ll pardon the dramatic phrasing, when all of you come together, the world will end, correct?</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: [Chuckling] Doctor, the world has already ended. This was to be the last war. The world\u2019s time has come and gone, and it is stretching thinner by the day until there will be nothing left but the moths. But, there is still some time left. We can find each other on our own.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And when that happens?</p>\n<p>SCP-001-05: Quiet days, Doctor.

Fifty years ago, we were Elijah, full of bluster and wrath, calling upon our less faithful brothers to rally to the Thirty-Six\u2019s cause, using fear to further our goals. Thirty years ago, we were Isaiah, seeking to strengthen our less courageous brothers that with the conviction that our cause was just, speaking of the greatness of our task, using their new found confidence to build an order on which our goals could stand. Ten years ago, we were Jeremiah, weeping at the doors of the world\u2019s great powers, pleading for them to listen, for we now understood that this task was beyond our power alone.</p>\n<p>And now? Now we are Jonah, and are lost for words. How do we make you understand what is at stake, when the only way you could see is to let everything your organization ever did go for the word of three old men? That is too much to ask even of righteous men, and we are not yet certain you are such. All we can ask is that you listen.</p>\n<p>You have seen what the Thirty-Six can do. You have seen the way the world unravels around them, but you do not understand why. You see them as just another entry in your great book of diseases, a threat to the wholeness of the body you keep- the world. It is not so. The items and phenomena you keep hidden from the world are not diseases, they are symptoms, and you are not keeping the world healthy by masking them when the underlying condition is ignored. The problem is that this condition is chronic. The world is simply old, and the Thirty-Six\u2026 they might make it young again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor them to be able to do so, you will be required to make the ultimate sacrifice- you must relinquish your identity. You were made to secure, and we are asking you to trust in the unproven. You were made to contain, and we are asking you to release. You were meant to protect, and we are asking you to leave the world vulnerable. It is an impossible request, this we know. But you must fulfill it if there is to be any hope for us. Release the Thirty-Six, let them come together. Let them do what needs to be done, and we shall follow.</p>\n<p>Help three old men make the world young again.

Under no circumstances are any instances of SCP-001 to be stored at the same site, allowed to interact in any manner, or to be made aware of information regarding other members of the group. Personnel assigned to any single SCP-001 subject are not to be made aware of the other instances of SCP-001 or the connections among them.\n\n\n\nSCP-001 subjects are not to come into direct contact with any other anomalous items outside of approved testing.\n\n\n\nREVISED \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588: O5 SPECIAL ORDER A-1130-X\n\n\n\nIn light of the events resultant in SCP-001-05's death, the use of SCP-001 subjects in the neutralization of anomalous objects is hereby prohibited. All care is to be taken to keep SCP-001 subjects alive and unharmed. Recovery and containment of SCP-001 subjects is to be considered highest priority. In the case of a death event, Ouroboros Protocol is to be initiated as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is a group of thirty-six individuals, designated SCP-001-01 through SCP-001-036. There is no apparent pattern in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, or religious affiliation amongst SCP-001 subjects. \n\n\n\nSCP-001 subjects display no anomalous properties of their own. However, any anomalous item, entity, or property brought into close proximity with an SCP-001 subject will be greatly modified from its original properties: most often, this will result in a lessening or total nullification of anomalous properties. Those properties not nullified will be changed so as to display consistency between objects of similar properties. All of these effects are instantaneous and will occur without any input from the subject. The area of these effects will expand in when multiple SCP-001 subjects are brought together, as well as the intensity of changes: multiple SCP-001 subjects are capable of nullifying anomalous effects without being aware of the presence of said objects.\n\n\n\nAll subjects of SCP-001 seem to be instinctively aware of information regarding other SCP-001 subjects, generally the total number of the group and details of between one and three individuals. This knowledge is vague, making locating uncontained subjects difficult. \n\n\n\nThe death of an SCP-001 subject will result in the manifestation of multiple anomalous entities and phenomena in the area. These manifestations will be of such a scope that traditional containment measures are unfeasible, and will result in significant casualties and collateral damage. Contained SCP-001 subjects have claimed that this is a result of the deceased individual's absence \"letting things through\", and that further events will be more severe as time progresses. In addition, contained subjects have claimed that any deceased individuals will be replaced by a newborn bearing the appropriate properties: no such individuals have yet been located.\n\n\n\nSee Document 001-EX for a list of notable modifications to items by SCP-001 subjects. A full listing of all nullifications may be found in Document 001-N.\n\n\n\n**Addendum-01:**\n\n\n\nKnown members of SCP-001 are as follows:\n\n\n\n||~ Designation ||~ Ethnicity ||~ Sex ||~ Age ||~ Current Status ||~ Notes ||\n\n|| SCP-001-01 || Jewish-German || Male || 94 || Contained || Currently in induced stasis to prevent death.

SCP-001-01 through SCP-001-05 were found in the care of three individuals, classified as POI-1458, POI-1459, and POI-1460. Said individuals possess possible ties to GOI-16 \u201cThe Horizon Initiative\u201d, and may have had a hand in its founding. \n\n\n\nThe recovery effort was hindered by factional fighting within the HMFSCP. SCP-001-01 was severely injured in the resulting firefight, but was successfully stabilized and recovered along with the other subjects, and passed into the jurisdiction of the Preservationist faction. The individuals responsible for sheltering the SCP-001 subjects fled during the fighting and were not able to be apprehended.\n\n\n\n**Interview Log 001-11-02** \n\n\n\nThe following interview with SCP-001-05 was recorded on\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You spoke last time of having a specific purpose. Could you please explain?\n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: I am here to help set things right.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Go on.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: The world is broken, Doctor, and my brothers and sisters and I are here to heal it, to gather together and prepare the way for what is to come. The process has already been set in motion, though regrettably, there have been some setbacks.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Please explain. \n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: [SCP-001-01], he was the one who was to gather all the rest. With him now hovering between life and death, that duty falls to us, but we know only glimpses of a few others in our number. It is enough.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You don\u2019t fear for his safety? \n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: Death is just another part of what is meant to be. It\u2019s nothing to fear.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: An admirable view of things. How did you learn of your purpose?\n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: I had a dream. Portent, prophecy, hallucination, call it what you will. It planted a seed in my head, an intuition you might say. It was the next day I met [SCP-001-01].\n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can you describe the dream?\n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: There was a man, a man in rich clothing, like a king or emperor. He kept saying \u201cWhere is the tailor? Where is my tailor?\u201d and pacing back and forth. Each time he asked it, another voice would answer \u201cHe is close now, he is close at hand\u201d. But he did not arrive. The man became more and more upset, and as he paced moths came and landed on him, and began to eat away at his clothing. His robes began to fray and rot as more and more moths landed on him, and some even bit his skin. But then, the doors opened and there arrived not one tailor, but dozens, led by the most masterful tailor in the kingdom. The king was overjoyed, for he knew he would be saved from the moths that tried to consume him. I woke up then, and I knew. He found me, and I followed him. \n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: If you\u2019ll pardon the dramatic phrasing, when all of you come together, the world will end, correct?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: [Chuckling] Doctor, the world has already ended. This was to be the last war. The world\u2019s time has come and gone, and it is stretching thinner by the day until there will be nothing left but the moths. But, there is still some time left. We can find each other on our own.\n\n> \n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And when that happens?\n\n> \n\n> SCP-001-05: Quiet days, Doctor. Quiet days and peace. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Incident Report 001-05-EX** \n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\" hide=\"- SECURITY MEMETIC: WHAT SWORD SHALL YOU CHOOSE\"]]\n\n\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n**Location:** Site-128 (Coordinates \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588.\u2588-\u2588\u2588.\u2588)\n\n\n\n**Event Type:** LK (Localized Crisis)\n\n\n\n**Description:** Event occurred upon the death of SCP-001-05 at 22:12, local time.

Said instances were found performing SCP-1348-2.\n\n\n\n* The ritual designated SCP-1348-2 has been altered, likely due to the presence of the aforementioned instances of SCP-1348-1. Performance of the altered SCP-1348-2 by instances of SCP-1348-1 lacks the memetic effect of its previous incarnation.

Fifty years ago, we were Elijah, full of bluster and wrath, calling upon our less faithful brothers to rally to the Thirty-Six\u2019s cause, using fear to further our goals. Thirty years ago, we were Isaiah, seeking to strengthen our less courageous brothers that with the conviction that our cause was just, speaking of the greatness of our task, using their new found confidence to build an order on which our goals could stand. Ten years ago, we were Jeremiah, weeping at the doors of the world\u2019s great powers, pleading for them to listen, for we now understood that this task was beyond our power alone. \n\n> \n\n> And now? Now we are Jonah, and are lost for words. How do we make you understand what is at stake, when the only way you could see is to let everything your organization ever did go for the word of three old men? That is too much to ask even of righteous men, and we are not yet certain you are such. All we can ask is that you listen.\n\n> \n\n> You have seen what the Thirty-Six can do. You have seen the way the world unravels around them, but you do not understand why. You see them as just another entry in your great book of diseases, a threat to the wholeness of the body you keep- the world. It is not so. The items and phenomena you keep hidden from the world are not diseases, they are symptoms, and you are not keeping the world healthy by masking them when the underlying condition is ignored.
