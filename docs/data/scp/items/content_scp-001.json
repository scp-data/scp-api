Therein, say the Scholars, lies the moral Lesson that none, not even God's Prophet, shall be exempt from the Laws of His Covenant.</p>\n<p>But consider the First of these Verses, which is so little Understood. The almighty God, having formed an Intent to kill Moses, attempted to do so and failed. This Episode is the Key to the understanding of the Substance of God.

One of my colleagues proposed the name \"akiva\" as the unit of measurement for this phenomenon, after some long-dead Hebrew martyr. This philosophical and technological breakthrough prompted the initiation of several projects, including a comprehensive mapping of conditions and variations of akiva throughout the globe. This was not to be a mere frippery such as the charting of the source of the Nile or the naming of some inconsequential sea-rock- rather, the thaumographic map will be an invaluable tool in allowing our Order to harness the powers of the Divine Grace.\n<p>\"And so, we organized cartographic teams, each equipped with a thaumometric apparatus, to commence the mapping project, with special concentration on regions of particular interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a particular corner of the Holy Land, Napoleon Bonaparte showed us the way.

Essentially we're going to create another instance of SCP-001. Today\u2019s test will be the culmination of over twenty years of advances in thaumometric engineering and applied theology.

Recent developments, too voluminous to be summarized here, have prompted the Foundation\u2019s senior management to seek a rapprochement with the counterparty, both to facilitate ongoing research and containment efforts, to avoid accelerating a theoeschatalogical catastrophe, and to maintain the efficacy of certain Foundation protocols such as the containment regimen for <a href=\"/scp-1844\">SCP-1844</a>. At senior management\u2019s direction, then, my office undertook negotiations with the counterparty. The points summarized below represent the outcome of these negotiations.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SUMMARY OF POINTS OF UNDERSTANDING</span><br/>\n1. No natural person may physically remain within Facility T for a continuous period in excess of 120 years. This limit applies to members of the O5 Council, other members of the Foundation management and staff, test subjects, and others. The Foundation is expected to enforce this limitation.</p>\n<p>2. Minutes of the proceedings of the Ethics Committee are to be communicated to the counterparty not less frequently than annually.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>3.

Neither the Foundation nor any of its executive-level personnel shall bow down to or worship any divine entity other than the counterparty; for I, the LORD am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>5.

[[footnote]]Stone tablets are expected, but I have asked for a .pdf file as well.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> __BACKGROUND__\n\n>\n\n> The Foundation\u2019s operations at Facility T have for some time been a sticky point vis-\u00e0-vis our relations with the counterparty.\u00a0\u00a0Recent developments, too voluminous to be summarized here, have prompted the Foundation\u2019s senior management to seek a rapprochement with the counterparty, both to facilitate ongoing research and containment efforts, to avoid accelerating a theoeschatalogical catastrophe, and to maintain the efficacy of certain Foundation protocols such as the containment regimen for [[[SCP-1844]]].\u00a0\u00a0At senior management\u2019s direction, then, my office undertook negotiations with the counterparty.\u00a0\u00a0The points summarized below represent the outcome of these negotiations.\n\n> \n\n> __SUMMARY OF POINTS OF UNDERSTANDING__\n\n>\n\n> 1. No natural person may physically remain within Facility T for a continuous period in excess of 120 years.\u00a0\u00a0This limit applies to members of the O5 Council, other members of the Foundation management and staff, test subjects, and others.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation is expected to enforce this limitation.\n\n> \n\n> 2. Minutes of the proceedings of the Ethics Committee are to be communicated to the counterparty not less frequently than annually.[[footnote]]The precise logistics of this communication have not yet been worked out, but I suspect that it will consist of writing them on parchment and then burning them in a brazier located outside of Facility T.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> 3. The counterparty shall not smite, strike down or otherwise exact wrath upon any of the Foundation personnel named on Exhibit A (as amended from time to time by the mutual agreement of the parties) without at least 90 days\u2019 written notice and an opportunity to cure the transgression; provided, however, that this clause shall not be applicable in the case of a tribulation of general applicability. \n\n> \n\n> 4. Neither the Foundation nor any of its executive-level personnel shall bow down to or worship any divine entity other than the counterparty; for I, the LORD am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me. [[footnote]]The counterparty insisted upon this clause.\u00a0\u00a0Because the clause does not actually compel any action but merely forbids it, I applied my discretion to accept this point.\u00a0\u00a0I assume that the first-person draftsmanship will be cleaned up in the final version.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> 5. The Foundation and the counterparty shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with respect to the containment of the adverse entities described on Exhibit B (collectively, the \u201cAngra Mainyu\u201d).[[footnote]]Dr. al-Taqi explained to me that the Office of Tactical Theology can use the help.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> Please contact me to discuss the points of understanding before the formal agreement is completed.\n\n> \n\n> Respectfully,\n\n> \n\n> //Sheldon Katz, Prophet of God @@/s/@@//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/more-by-spike-alt\">:scp-sandbox-3:more-by-spike-alt</a>]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Katharinenkloster_Sinai_BW_2.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Marc Ryckaert\n\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Katharinenkloster_Sinai_BW_2.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** 32486574770_8e0c69a6b1_m.jpg\n\n> **Author:** [[*user spikebrennan]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Otto_Edler_von_Graeve_4786745367_04b089ec26_b.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Bain News Service\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Otto_Edler_von_Graeve_4786745367_04b089ec26_b.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** William_Wynn_Westcott.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Unknown author\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:William_Wynn_Westcott_PNG.png|Wikimedia]]]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-2336", "scp-4336", "scp-1844", "scp-1322", "scp-089", "scp-1012", "scp-2553", "scp-1036", "scp-1512", "scp-1746", "scp-908", "scp-831", "scp-3236", "scp-955", "scp-926", "scp-2236", "scp-920-ex", "scp-2914", "scp-2008-j", "scp-4436", "scp-1060", "sic-transit-gloria-mundi", "spring-cleaning", "transcript-of-meeting-june-2-1972", "transcript-of-telephone-conversation-august-9-1991", "memorandum-dated-6-november-1944", "scroll-fragment-13q29", "stray-katz", "ad-majorem-bonum", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-001", "scp_number": 1, "series": "scp-001", "tags": ["001-proposal", "_cc", "_licensebox", "entropic", "esoteric-class", "ethics-committee", "immobile", "location", "religious", "scp", "sheldon-katz", "tactical-theology", "the-administrator"], "title": "SCP-001", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spikebrennan-s-proposal"}}
