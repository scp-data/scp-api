Wrapped around its exterior, encompassing its equator and both poles, is a complex and layered fractal filigree of gold metal. The gold is sculpted into broad strokes at what is now usually agreed to be the lower or \"south\" pole of the object, but with increasing \"latitude\" the pattern becomes progressively more intricate. Near the \"north\" pole, also called the \"lock\" or \"singularity\" (see acquisition report, below), the pattern complexity progresses beyond the capability of optical or electron-beam microscopes to resolve. Further investigation is pending advances in microscopy technology.</p>\n<p>The gemstone continuously emits a small quantity (~34.5007 to 34.5010\u00a0mW) of thermal radiation in the microwave range.
