The Foundation Community Board (hereafter FCB), a successor organization, has been anomalously designated a legal person of specifically human origin in order to avoid SCP-001\u2019s effects upon it.</p>\n<p>The FCB has collectively decreed that the public mission of the Foundation will shift to mitigating the effects of, and educating the public on, SCP-001. This involves the organization taking immediate control of all world governments, government organizations, financial institutions and instruments, major corporations, and other political entities. The methods used to achieve this without triggering SCP-001 are detailed in Supplementary Document 001-01, an archived list of protocols and containment procedures derived by Foundation thaumaturgists and Narratavistics personnel.</p>\n<p>The FCB\u2019s collected primary procedures for the ongoing containment and mitigation of SCP-001 involve a single primary rule, widely enforced: no one human being on earth may hold more wealth and power than any other.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001 is an unknown force that manifested into existence on November 29th, 2026, and quickly spread across the planet. SCP-001 applies a constant physical pressure to all individuals believed to possess more money and power than another human being, gradually crushing them.</p>\n<p>Persons affected by SCP-001 experience a bodily compression, decreasing their height, increasing their width, and causing a \u201cflattening\u201d effect across the highest point of their topological surfaces. This pressure is in the range of hundreds of megapascals, yet, for the most part, lacks the injurious nature that such a pressure would normally mount on a human being despite being, at its worst, equivalent to that of gravity on a star-sized object. Cells in the body, including bones, nerves, and muscles, all function semi-normally, though not, at the highest levels, without great strain. Individuals affected by SCP-001 describe it as \"somewhat painful.\"</p>\n<p>The speed of the phenomenon\u2019s onset is relative to the amount of capital an individual possesses, as well as the rate of wealth accumulation. A person who gradually gains $1,000,000,000 USD over the course of a year would experience a gradual transformation, but the experience would be extremely rapid for a person with this amount already in their possession. Indeed, individuals possessing extremely high levels of wealth fully collapse under the immense and immediate pressure. Such collapses are so total and utterly violent that the resulting shockwave resembles that of high-yield explosives. The violent explosions resulting from this have already destroyed or reshaped many population centers. Testing has shown the process of detonation to be substantially more painful than the usual process of compression.</p>\n<p>The mechanism by which SCP-001 operates does not correlate to strict financial realities. Instead, it operates, in some unknown fashion, based on social perception. A person in poverty who has inherited a large sum of money, unbeknownst to all including themself, would be exempt from SCP-001 until such time as individuals became aware of their new wealth. Although the process by which SCP-001 accounts for debts, taxes, non-liquid assets, various financial instruments, and so on, is not inconsistent, it is incompatible with all non-anomalous economic theory. Foundation scientists have invented a scale to measure the socio-economic and sociocultural systems by which SCP-001 seems to affect individuals, deemed the Glenn-Cook scale.</p>\n<p>SCP-001 does not affect individuals with a wealth level of 20 on the Glenn-Cook scale, equivalent to those with a either a yearly income of less than $30,000 USD or primarily seen as working a minimum wage retail job. Individuals who work in highly public facing fields, including government, the arts, social work, academia, &amp; journalism, who earn similarly low incomes, are not exempt from SCP-001, and rank anywhere from 25 to 80 on the Glenn-Cook scale, and range in height from 140\u00a0cm to 150\u00a0cm tall. Almost all individuals who identify as professionals in the medical, legal, and law enforcement professions rank above 60, and very few are above 105\u00a0cm in height. All individuals who identify as billionaires rank at 100 on the scale, and nearly all have detonated.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-A\u2014Abbreviated List of Events:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>(T-1) 28/11/26:</strong> Global observatories report a brief but extremely powerful scalar wave burst originating somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn, lasting approximately 2.46 seconds. Foundation counters detect a spike in narrativistic mass, consistent with an informational pressure wave, from the same region. The signal is covered up as a non-anomalous radio wave from a distant quasar in civilian science circles.</p>\n<p><strong>(T=0) 29/11/26:</strong> SCP-001 manifests first in major populations. Many global centers are devastated, including New York City, London, Moscow, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Beijing, S\u00e3o Paulo, Bengaluru, Shenzen, the entire states of California and Florida, et al, due to the concentration of wealthy individuals, and the proportionally large detonations. Global panic is immediate. News media and internet communications are sparse due to the wealthy nature of their management, increasing panic.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+2) 01/12/26</strong>: SCP-001 has spread out from major populated zones, and its effect appear to cover the entirety of the earth as well as various lunar zones and populated dimensional interiors including Eurtec and Three Portlands. Several rural zones are significantly affected, including Jackson Hole and various privately owned islands. The Foundation has decided to intervene following widespread devastation in world government and the GOC. Consequently, the 05 Council are significantly flattened. Several survive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>(T+5) 04/12/26:</strong> Junior Researcher Kimiko Cook announces a thaumaturgical method to hide one\u2019s social power in such a manner that the phenomenon affects the thaumaturgy, not the wealth. The Glenn-Cook scale is subsequently discovered and defined.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+6) 05/12/26:</strong> Cleanup efforts begin. Media access and the internet are restored. Subsequently civilian populations independently discover the relation of wealth to the phenomena before authorities can announce it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(T+7) 06/12/26:</strong> A series of global unofficial jubilees begin, significantly affecting the financial market. Civilians desperate to recover their original height and width take drastic measures to offload their wealth over the next ten days. Financial institutions experience high volumes of withdrawals, while their employees themselves destroy various mortgages and other holdings. It becomes globally common to hand large amounts of cash to random transients and unhoused persons. The housing market sees record low prices, as landowners offload assets for as low as \u00a21. Money orders become increasingly popular, causing significant strain on the already tenuous power and internet systems. Only some of these strategies are successful at restoring height.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+8) 07/12/26:</strong> As a result of one day of this activity, markets worldwide reach record highs, some as high as +70 points, as millions of stockholders offload their wealth by purchasing thousands of shares in various low-ranked companies, the most popular of which is a previously unsuccessful software startup called Wheelr Inc, which manufactured and maintained a range of dating apps for individuals with vehicle kinks. Consequently the owners of Wheelr Inc jumped up to 95 on the Glenn-Cook scale and detonated, wiping out several city blocks in Quebec City.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>(T+16) 15/12/26:</strong> Various surviving government officials and technology executives propose using the vast remaining infrastructure of the artificial intelligence industry in order to create a sapient large-language model that can manage world government and finances, taking the physical strain off human leaders and restoring height. The Foundation agrees. A data center in Grubdale, Indiana is proposed as the headquarters of this model, tentatively named \u201cGoliath\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+17) 16/12/26:</strong> The jubilees end. Financial institutions remain in disarray. The CEO of a company called Global Unified Plastics, which primarily manufactures trash bins for municipal use, becomes the world\u2019s wealthiest surviving man and a major celebrity overnight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"grok_video_real.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com//local--files/collab:dumbcon-001/grok_video_real.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p><strong>Thumbnail for Grok Arnaz's \u201cHow To SHORTMAXX Quick Through Surgery, No Wealth Required.\u201d</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; padding: 0 1em; background-color: #f4f4f4;\">\n<p><strong>(T+19) 18/12/26:</strong> The first YouTube video taking a positive approach to the changes is uploaded.

You know, I do this, because the powerful people out in the world are predators. They like to chew. They gnaw. A reminder that power is still possible, because it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in short, in a world of tall people. They loomed over me.</em></p>\n<p><em>But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. Everyone suddenly became short. Maybe you know someone who became short, or you became short yourself! And now I discovered the tables have turned. Because now how much power you have is actually visible. I found I had a level of power in this world. And then I discovered I had more. Again, it\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about the good life; health, wealth, love, happiness, and good old fashioned clout. And so I wanna tell you something my mentor told me the other day, when I went to visit him in the mountains of Nepal. The Buddhists and the Stoics, they actually had a secret way to gain power over other people. Marcus Aurelius? He found it. He knew the way to extreme power and dominance was through profound self-sacrifice. What will a predator do if its leg is caught in a trap, or some sort of cage? The answer is clear. So if you want to live like me, it\u2019s very simple. All you need is a bandsaw and a bottle of whiskey, and while I recommend Buffalo Trace, any brand of bandsaw will do. Make sure you have gauze handy.

Goliath comes online and begins management for upwards of five minutes. It executes a protocol which switches much of the world's primary reserve currency to a simplified cryptocurrency called USDCoin. This immediately results in server farms across the world become subject to SCP-001 and immediately become wide and flat.

There is a brief incident in the press concerning a malfunction with Roan\u2019s saline tank which affected her ability to dance. Second, the first detonation in 95 days occurs when Radu Pascariu, a high level Romanian mobster involved in rackets including drug production and human trafficking, finishes a large scam which involves embezzling large sums of cash from various Turkish child prostitution rings through a Bulgarian trucking company front. The resulting explosion is minor, wiping out only a block or two of a Bucharest suburb, but is notable for Pascariu\u2019s reported prior \u201clack of care\u201d about his gradual experience of SCP-001.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+104) 10/03/27:</strong> The first Foundation member to have their cover blown is Donna Blyth, a Foundation medical assistant based in York.

The sole exception is Warren Buffett, whose personal astrologer Martine \"The Oracle of Omaha\" Cutcheonson predicted that he needed to offload all of his wealth four months prior to November 2026. Buffett was discovered living as a hermit in a tin shack on the northern coast of Australia. Cutcheonson currently measures 93 on the Glenn-Cook scale and cannot leave her mansion without significant assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+161): 29/04/27:</strong> Site-19 becomes the first Foundation facility to be fully powered by the EGFR. The first participant, Junior Researcher Daniel Mosaku, was compensated for his month spent inside the mechanism in a manner suitable to let him continue his work.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+162) 30/04/27:</strong> The megayacht <em>Ulagalanthan</em> sank off the coast of the Fijian town of Savusavu, killing all passengers on board, after tech billionaire Rodman Parson detonated following a successful quadruple parlay bet. There were over 500 reported deaths. Notable casualties included the actors Hailee Steinfeld, Lewis Pullman, Sam Rockwell, and Juliette Lewis, the comedians Pete Holmes and Jo Brand, former American football quarterback Josh Allen, dermatologist and YouTuber Dr. Sandra Lee, reality television competitor Dorinda Medley, novelist Ocean Vuong, supermodel Maty Fall Diba, drag performer Mon\u00e9t X Change, and businessman Sawyer Hemsley, the co-founder of the Crumbl cookies chain. None measured lower than 83 on the Glenn-Cook scale and many were at risk of detonating themselves in the near future. News of the explosion was quickly covered up by Foundation operatives because of the danger involved in the widespread use of Parson's popular gambling app KnowCash causing further detonations in a chain reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+163) 01/05/27:</strong> Vogue Magazine announces its cover story on \"The Glamorous Lives of the Famous and Short.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; padding: 0 1em; background-color: #f4f4f4;\">\n<p><strong>(T+164) 01/05/27:</strong> The first day of the well-publicized widejak convention in Des Moines is heavily covered by the international press. Many businesspeople, media personalities, and conservative commentators are scheduled to lead panels, although the actor and Fox News pundit Jon Bernthal pulled out on account of issues with his saline tank causing significant health problems. The chief organizer of the conference, Grok Arnaz, gave the following speech at the opening panel.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; padding: 0 1em; background-color: #f4f4f4;\">\n<p><em><strong>(Excerpt from transcript)</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Grok Arnaz:</strong> <em>Many years ago, there was a real kickass movie called Wall Street, and in that movie Michael Douglas plays an awesome character who says this famous line: greed is good. And we're real men here who agree! And women! Some of you also understand, much as I think it makes you all kind of ugly personally, that there is real value in power. There is real value in flaunting one's sacrifice, for the sake of power. So, I want to add one thing that Michael forgot to say. Something I think is real important. Greed is good, and also, height is sin.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>(cheers from the crowd)</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Those who keep their height, who lack the funds needed to show off their power, are weak. They are not fit to live on this earth. They're too cowardly to skirt the edge of danger. Sure, sometimes I need my tank. And sometimes the walker. And sometimes the doors can be a problem!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>(laughter)</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>But I'm more powerful than I've ever been. If you are tall, I own you. If you reach for the stars, I can drag you back down into the dirt with me. It is a violation of the natural order of the universe to be tall, to be weak, to be at the mercy of those lower than you. My girth makes me powerful!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>(The crowd calls out \"yeah!\")</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>I take up space in the room!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>(The crowd calls out \"yeah!\" louder and more forcefully.)</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>I am the victor of this wonderful, WONDERFUL capitalism we got! I am on top of the heap! Say it with me! And it is a mortal sin to let yourself be poor, to let yourself be lesser, to let yourself be stepped on by others. And while I may be flat enough to be a doormat\u2014</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>(Raucous laughter.</em>)</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u2014\u2014I will never be stepped on again!

Everyone who's not like you is a bug, an insect, some idiotic giraffe with a hideous physique. They are nothing. They are less than nothing!! Ah ha ha ha, doesn't it feel good to admit it? To say it? Because the widejaks are here, and we are gonna fulfill our god-given mandate to take the earth and rule it, as is our birthright!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>(Raucous cheering and clapping. Some do the 'widejak salute,' which involves pointing to the ground.</em>)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Yes, thank you, thank you! We're gonna have a great con tonight, let me tell you! Tim Allen is here!

An attendee, revealed by internal investigation to be a low-level archivist working at Site-78, claims his workplace \"gives him the right to be short, and I'm tired of hiding it.\" The individual was amnesticized and reassigned. Similar methods have been taken at all similar affected organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+168) 04/05/27:</strong> Grok Arnaz is revealed by a convention attendee to have substantially faked the earliest stages of his SCP-001 affliction by various methods, including tucking his knees behind him in videos, prosthetics, and DIY surgery, although the substantial financial contributions from various members of the widejak and men's rights communities, as well as speaking fees and payments from various news networks, have since placed him at 84 on the Glenn-Cook scale. His real identity is revealed to be Eugene Moreland, a former grocery store manager from Baton Rouge. This information quickly goes viral online and Moreland is subsequently murdered by various con attendees who had cornered him and sent him large sums via PayPal. The subsequent detonation takes out a significant chunk of the burgeoning widejak movement.</p>\n<p><strong>(T+170) 06/05/27:</strong> News of the sinking of the <em>Ulagalanthan</em> and the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the associated celebrities leak.

Research is needed on further containment methods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-B: FCB Memorandum 25/11/29</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To the public,</p>\n<p>We know that many of the measures used to implement containment of SCP-001 are unpopular. We know that we're in dire circumstances, as a species. These are and have been hard times, the toughest we have faced as a species. But the things we need to do must be done. And you know that.</p>\n<p>You have seen the decay of society, you have seen the detonations. Maybe you know someone who died as a result of one. Maybe you almost did yourself. If you did, you know the tremendous physical toll of flatness, the pressure bearing down on you at all times, crushing your muscles and bones beneath that tremendous weight, the literal burden of wealth and responsibility. You know that this cannot be sustainable in any way, shape, or form.</p>\n<p>Humanity must survive and persist. And it cannot do so in the face of wealth. What has, for some of you, been theoretical, maybe even a bit abstract, now must be manifested as very very real. And it is no hyperobject as with the climate change we <em>all</em> work together now to solve. It is tactile, and obvious, and physical. It requires strictness. And that strictness is necessary to keep you alive. Because, yes, this is unfair. Yes, this is cartoonishly strict in its enforcement of total and utter equality. Some of you who may be familiar (don't admit this and get flatter) with Vonnegut's stories may be having flashbacks to <em>Harrison Bergeron</em>. But we have to promise this is just and fair. We have to. We have to muddle through the way in which this insane thing was forced upon us, where homeowners and nurses and causal day traders were forced by some insane quirk of the universe's fabric into the same well of greed and sin as the richest trillionaires, and the person in the most modest poverty survives.</p>\n<p>We ask you to please stick with this. It's all we can do at this stage, we've given up our secrecy, our mind-altering drugs, our guns, everything that lets us lord over you. So we beg. Learn all your new knowledge and trades. Subsume your identities into the collective. Be in community with those around you. It's the difference between life and death.</p>\n<p>And I know that this sort of maudlin pleading helped no one in the old world, that it was pathetic. But I have to assume enough of you were affected by the enflattening to have a more open heart. That you understand we have got to enter a kinder world. That I have to embody the value of this new world. This is what we have to work with. Please.</p>\n<p>Milo Seevers<br/>\nO5-8, Period 3<br/>\nFoundation Community Board</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-communitys-proposal\">The Community\u2019s Proposal</a>\" by LordStonefish, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The Foundation Community Board (hereafter FCB), a successor organization, has been anomalously designated a legal person of specifically human origin in order to avoid SCP-001\u2019s effects upon it.\n\n\n\nThe FCB has collectively decreed that the public mission of the Foundation will shift to mitigating the effects of, and educating the public on, SCP-001. This involves the organization taking immediate control of all world governments, government organizations, financial institutions and instruments, major corporations, and other political entities. The methods used to achieve this without triggering SCP-001 are detailed in Supplementary Document 001-01, an archived list of protocols and containment procedures derived by Foundation thaumaturgists and Narratavistics personnel.\n\n\n\nThe FCB\u2019s collected primary procedures for the ongoing containment and mitigation of SCP-001 involve a single primary rule, widely enforced: no one human being on earth may hold more wealth and power than any other.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is an unknown force that manifested into existence on November 29th, 2026, and quickly spread across the planet. SCP-001 applies a constant physical pressure to all individuals believed to possess more money and power than another human being, gradually crushing them.\n\n\n\nPersons affected by SCP-001 experience a bodily compression, decreasing their height, increasing their width, and causing a \u201cflattening\u201d effect across the highest point of their topological surfaces. This pressure is in the range of hundreds of megapascals, yet, for the most part, lacks the injurious nature that such a pressure would normally mount on a human being despite being, at its worst, equivalent to that of gravity on a star-sized object. Cells in the body, including bones, nerves, and muscles, all function semi-normally, though not, at the highest levels, without great strain. Individuals affected by SCP-001 describe it as \"somewhat painful.\"\n\n\n\nThe speed of the phenomenon\u2019s onset is relative to the amount of capital an individual possesses, as well as the rate of wealth accumulation. A person who gradually gains $1,000,000,000 USD over the course of a year would experience a gradual transformation, but the experience would be extremely rapid for a person with this amount already in their possession. Indeed, individuals possessing extremely high levels of wealth fully collapse under the immense and immediate pressure. Such collapses are so total and utterly violent that the resulting shockwave resembles that of high-yield explosives. The violent explosions resulting from this have already destroyed or reshaped many population centers. Testing has shown the process of detonation to be substantially more painful than the usual process of compression.\n\n\n\nThe mechanism by which SCP-001 operates does not correlate to strict financial realities. Instead, it operates, in some unknown fashion, based on social perception. A person in poverty who has inherited a large sum of money, unbeknownst to all including themself, would be exempt from SCP-001 until such time as individuals became aware of their new wealth.\u00a0\u00a0Although the process by which SCP-001 accounts for debts, taxes, non-liquid assets, various financial instruments, and so on, is not inconsistent, it is incompatible with all non-anomalous economic theory. Foundation scientists have invented a scale to measure the socio-economic and sociocultural systems by which SCP-001 seems to affect individuals, deemed the Glenn-Cook scale.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSCP-001 does not affect individuals with a wealth level of 20 on the Glenn-Cook scale, equivalent to those with a either a yearly income of less than $30,000 USD or primarily seen as working a minimum wage retail job. Individuals who work in highly public facing fields, including government, the arts, social work, academia, & journalism, who earn similarly low incomes, are not exempt from SCP-001, and rank anywhere from 25 to 80 on the Glenn-Cook scale, and range in height from 140 cm to 150 cm tall. Almost all individuals who identify as professionals in the medical, legal, and law enforcement professions rank above 60, and very few are above 105 cm in height. All individuals who identify as billionaires rank at 100 on the scale, and nearly all have detonated.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-A\u2014Abbreviated List of Events:**\n\n\n\n> **(T-1) 28/11/26:** Global observatories report a brief but extremely powerful scalar wave burst originating somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn, lasting approximately 2.46 seconds. Foundation counters detect a spike in narrativistic mass, consistent with an informational pressure wave, from the same region. The signal is covered up as a non-anomalous radio wave from a distant quasar in civilian science circles.\n\n> \n\n> **(T=0) 29/11/26:** SCP-001 manifests first in major populations. Many global centers are devastated, including New York City, London, Moscow, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Beijing, S\u00e3o Paulo, Bengaluru, Shenzen, the entire states of California and Florida, et al, due to the concentration of wealthy individuals, and the proportionally large detonations. Global panic is immediate. News media and internet communications are sparse due to the wealthy nature of their management, increasing panic.\n\n> \n\n> **(T+2) 01/12/26**: SCP-001 has spread out from major populated zones, and its effect appear to cover the entirety of the earth as well as various lunar zones and populated dimensional interiors including Eurtec and Three Portlands. Several rural zones are significantly affected, including Jackson Hole and various privately owned islands. The Foundation has decided to intervene following widespread devastation in world government and the GOC. Consequently, the 05 Council are significantly flattened.

Civilians desperate to recover their original height and width take drastic measures to offload their wealth over the next ten days. Financial institutions experience high volumes of withdrawals, while their employees themselves destroy various mortgages and other holdings. It becomes globally common to hand large amounts of cash to random transients and unhoused persons. The housing market sees record low prices, as landowners offload assets for as low as \u00a21. Money orders become increasingly popular, causing significant strain on the already tenuous power and internet systems. Only some of these strategies are successful at restoring height.\n\n> \n\n> **(T+8) 07/12/26:** As a result of one day of this activity, markets worldwide reach record highs, some as high as +70 points, as millions of stockholders offload their wealth by purchasing thousands of shares in various low-ranked companies, the most popular of which is a previously unsuccessful software startup called Wheelr Inc, which manufactured and maintained a range of dating apps for individuals with vehicle kinks. Consequently the owners of Wheelr Inc jumped up to 95 on the Glenn-Cook scale and detonated, wiping out several city blocks in Quebec City.\n\n\n\n> **(T+16) 15/12/26:** Various surviving government officials and technology executives propose using the vast remaining infrastructure of the artificial intelligence industry in order to create a sapient large-language model that can manage world government and finances, taking the physical strain off human leaders and restoring height.

You know, I do this, because the powerful people out in the world are predators. They like to chew. They gnaw. A reminder that power is still possible, because it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in short, in a world of tall people. They loomed over me.//\n\n\n\n\u00a0//But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. Everyone suddenly became short. Maybe you know someone who became short, or you became short yourself! And now I discovered the tables have turned. Because now how much power you have is actually visible. I found I had a level of power in this world. And then I discovered I had more. Again, it\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about the good life; health, wealth, love, happiness, and good old fashioned clout. And so I wanna tell you something my mentor told me the other day, when I went to visit him in the mountains of Nepal. The Buddhists and the Stoics, they actually had a secret way to gain power over other people. Marcus Aurelius? He found it. He knew the way to extreme power and dominance was through profound self-sacrifice. What will a predator do if its leg is caught in a trap, or some sort of cage? The answer is clear. So if you want to live like me, it\u2019s very simple. All you need is a bandsaw and a bottle of whiskey, and while I recommend Buffalo Trace, any brand of bandsaw will do. Make sure you have gauze handy.

The Glenn-Cook scale is publicized.\n\n\n\n\n\n> **(T+410) 28/12/27:** 1400 detonations occur following the abolition of currency after social clout in online communities becomes the primary method of obtaining wealth. In the absence of social media, the userbases of websites dedicated to fiction are primarily affected. The FCB agrees to shut down global internet access to limit SCP-001 occurrences.\n\n\n\n> **(T+1100) 26/11/29:** Village Ficus is established on the former site of Jakarta. The FCB's first round of job placements are handed out to colonists. Fourteen complaints are leveled for various reasons, including the dissolution of surnames and the placements in the job rotation, including the monthly stint in the EGFR and Keter Containment Duty at the nearby Foundation facility. They are withdrawn once all complainants immediately rise 10 points on the Glenn-Cook scale despite having identical FCB-allotted net worths.\n\n\n\n\n\n> **(T+2331) 02/11/33:** Global citizenry measure at 49 on the Contentness Scale. Oatmeal allotments have stabilized. The FCB successfully decides that a 10% increase in net worth should be insufficient to trigger SCP-001.\n\n> \n\n> **(T+2332) 03/11/33:** Maury B, a resident of Village Oak assigned that month to work as a mechanic, was on a walk through the village orchard and, following a brief windstorm, gathered more than his allotment of apples, owning fourteen more than anyone else in the region. The detonation, which took out a portion of Village Oak, became the first in five years. Research is needed on further containment methods.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-B: FCB Memorandum 25/11/29**\n\n\n\n> To the public,\n\n> \n\n> We know that many of the measures used to implement containment of SCP-001 are unpopular. We know that we're in dire circumstances, as a species. These are and have been hard times, the toughest we have faced as a species. But the things we need to do must be done. And you know that.\n\n> \n\n> You have seen the decay of society, you have seen the detonations. Maybe you know someone who died as a result of one. Maybe you almost did yourself. If you did, you know the tremendous physical toll of flatness, the pressure bearing down on you at all times, crushing your muscles and bones beneath that tremendous weight, the literal burden of wealth and responsibility. You know that this cannot be sustainable in any way, shape, or form.\n\n> \n\n> Humanity must survive and persist. And it cannot do so in the face of wealth. What has, for some of you, been theoretical, maybe even a bit abstract, now must be manifested as very very real. And it is no hyperobject as with the climate change we //all// work together now to solve. It is tactile, and obvious, and physical. It requires strictness. And that strictness is necessary to keep you alive. Because, yes, this is unfair. Yes, this is cartoonishly strict in its enforcement of total and utter equality. Some of you who may be familiar (don't admit this and get flatter) with Vonnegut's stories may be having flashbacks to //Harrison Bergeron//. But we have to promise this is just and fair. We have to. We have to muddle through the way in which this insane thing was forced upon us, where homeowners and nurses and causal day traders were forced by some insane quirk of the universe's fabric into the same well of greed and sin as the richest trillionaires, and the person in the most modest poverty survives.\n\n> \n\n> We ask you to please stick with this. It's all we can do at this stage, we've given up our secrecy, our mind-altering drugs, our guns, everything that lets us lord over you. So we beg. Learn all your new knowledge and trades. Subsume your identities into the collective. Be in community with those around you. It's the difference between life and death.\n\n> \n\n> And I know that this sort of maudlin pleading helped no one in the old world, that it was pathetic. But I have to assume enough of you were affected by the enflattening to have a more open heart. That you understand we have got to enter a kinder world. That I have to embody the value of this new world. This is what we have to work with. Please.\n\n> \n\n> Milo Seevers\n\n> O5-8, Period 3\n\n> Foundation Community Board\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** president.png\n\n> **Author:** United States Department of Transportation, edited by [[*user ch00bakka]]\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Secretary_of_Transportation_Sean_Duffy_Official_Portrait.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["anorrack-s-author-page", "lord-stonefish", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-001", "scp_number": 1, "series": "scp-001", "tags": ["001-proposal", "absurdism", "black-comedy", "currency", "doctor-clef", "dumbcon2026-unofficial", "ectoentropic", "exchange", "extraterrestrial", "gamers-against-weed", "k-class-scenario", "keter", "ritual", "scp", "transfiguration", "uncontained"], "title": "SCP-001", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-communitys-proposal"}}
