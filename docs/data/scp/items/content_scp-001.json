The door is ajar.</p>\n<p>It smells here. It smells like <em>them</em>. Hopefully, they've moved on. You've come so far already. You can't turn back now.</p>\n<p>There is a slick trail that leads from the cave entrance and into the depths of the site. If it's blood or shit - or something that smeared off one of those <em>things</em>, you cannot tell. You make a point to avoid it.</p>\n<p>You're still receiving the distress signal. It only started broadcasting yesterday. Whoever it is - you pray they're still alive.</p>\n<p>Your footsteps echo throughout empty corridors. Each footfall sounds for all the world like a dozen, as if you're not treading through the dark alone.</p>\n<p>Elevator is down - so you take the stairs, ending on floor B5: Keter Holding. You pass several empty containment chambers. The horrors they once held are long gone.</p>\n<p>If you're lucky.</p>\n<p>The trail takes you to an office branching off the main hall - the source of the signal. The door is cracked open, but stuck. You plant your feet, push with all your might.</p>\n<p>Something skitters out of one of the rooms to your left and around the corner before you can get a good look at it. Your first thought is 'dog'.</p>\n<p>It was on the ceiling, though.</p>\n<p>You take refuge in the room, slam the door behind you. It's dark here. You're safe. You take off your jacket and head wrap. It'd be a damn shame to die from something like hyperthermia after all that's happened.</p>\n<p>The sole operating emergency light rotates in its casing - casting a pale orange glow across the room every other second.</p>\n<p>As if the room itself had a pulse.</p>\n<p>There's shelving haphazardly placed behind the door - a barricade. You scan the room. Soiled clothes, half eaten food. Despite the presence of an adjoining restroom, there is excrement in a bucket in the corner. A pneumatic chamber on the Northern wall would have been delivering consumables to the occupant.</p>\n<p>The trail terminates in the corner of the room, forming a sick puddle. You spot three pharmacy bottles - further inspection reveals them to be various opioids. They're all empty.</p>\n<p>There's a desk with a computer atop it. Approaching the terminal, you can clearly see the blinking light of the power button.</p>\n<p>You take a seat.

Travel by foot should be limited as much as possible. Cities - and man-made structures in general - provide the greatest protection. Formerly-wooded areas should be circumvented. Travel by air is preferable above all other methods.</p>\n<p>Personnel exposed to SCP-001 are to be considered lost. Compromised personnel are to be abandoned.

Conductive electrical weapons have proven partially effective at immobilizing instances, and may be used for self-defense. Incendiary weapons work as well. Cryonic munitions are the most effective thus far.</p>\n<p>Testing has revealed that SCP-001-A is relatively safe to consume. This is only to be considered as a last resort in the absence of other options. As SCP-001-A may reconstitute within the digestive system, only small portions should be consumed at a time to prevent blockage.</p>\n<p>Personnel stationed at Site-19 are to pursue research concerning off-world colonization.

Contact SysAdmin.</em></span> resulting in ~6.8 billion casualties within the first twenty-four hours. This event has been categorized as an XK-\u0394-Class \"Solar Singularity\" Scenario.</p>\n<p>The SCP-001 effect does not seem to result from exposure to ultraviolet rays, but rather light in the visual spectrum (~390 to 700 nm). The effect is similarly present in moonlight.</p>\n<p>Upon contact with visible light produced by the sun, living organisms liquefy at the point of contact, with the effect spreading until the entire organism is converted. Visually, this is reminiscent of melting wax. The time this takes is largely dependent on the level of exposure and size of the organism. Despite this restructuring, at no point do living organisms perish.</p>\n<p>Upon completion, these organisms (SCP-001-A) take on a gelatinous consistency. Motile organisms will attempt to orient themselves in a fashion reminiscent of their previous form, to varying degrees of success.</p>\n<p>Flora typically remain physically inert, yet are still capable of photosynthesis, and still produce oxygen. Organisms capable of flight lose the capability to do so. Fauna remain sentient, and display behavior that parallels their non-anomalous counterparts when not absorbed into a collective instance. Humans retain a modicum of sapience and memory.</p>\n<p>Biological anomalies exposed to SCP-001 are affected in the same manner. It seems that exposure nullifies any previously expressed anomalous characteristics.</p>\n<p>Due to their composition, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another may combine and blend at the molecular level. This does not seem to cause any pain or distress to the instances, though the resulting bulk can inhibit movement. Since the SCP-001 event, most instances have congregated into such collectives, which seem to possess no maximum volume.</p>\n<p>The resulting biomass is amorphous and chaotic. The component organisms will shift between a full-to-semi-liquid state - limbs and bodies will rise periodically from within the mass for a short duration, before deteriorating and being subsumed by another life-form.</p>\n<p>Collective instances will locomote by using their appendages in tandem to carry their mass. Larger instances will form a pseudopod from their constituent life-forms, and drag themselves about in a manner similar to amoeba.<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff5512\">+ Open attached file: Audio Log</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff5512\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">...</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff5512\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">...</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff5512\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">...</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff5512\">Access granted.</span></p>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A harsh static lashes out of the speakers when you open the file.

Photographer unknown.|width=300px]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-001\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Apollyon\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, SCP-001 cannot be contained. Survivors of the SCP-001 event stationed within secure facilities are to remain in contact with one another. Personnel are encouraged to attempt to reach --Site-5--[[footnote]]Personnel are to be reminded that there is no [[[scp err0r|Site-5]]].[[/footnote]] Site-19 by any means at their disposal. Personnel with knowledge as to the whereabouts of the O5 Council are to relay this information to the Administrator.\n\n\n\nSurvivors attempting to travel outdoors must fully cover their bodies in protective clothing; preferably several layers. Travel by foot should be limited as much as possible. Cities - and man-made structures in general - provide the greatest protection. Formerly-wooded areas should be circumvented. Travel by air is preferable above all other methods.\n\n\n\nPersonnel exposed to SCP-001 are to be considered lost. Compromised personnel are to be abandoned. Euthanization is not to be attempted.\n\n\n\nCollective instances of SCP-001-A that are of formidable size are to be avoided at all costs.\u00a0\u00a0Conductive electrical weapons have proven partially effective at immobilizing instances, and may be used for self-defense. Incendiary weapons work as well. Cryonic munitions are the most effective thus far.\n\n\n\nTesting has revealed that SCP-001-A is relatively safe to consume. This is only to be considered as a last resort in the absence of other options. As SCP-001-A may reconstitute within the digestive system, only small portions should be consumed at a time to prevent blockage.\n\n\n\nPersonnel stationed at Site-19 are to pursue research concerning off-world colonization. Shuttles must be constructed as to not allow light to penetrate the interior.\n\n> [[size 115%]]To those of you with families, or God forbid, children - I'm deeply, deeply sorry, you must push on. Do not let their deaths be in vain. We do still have time.\n\n> \n\n> Humanity may still have a future. Come to Site-19. We need all the hands we can get.\n\n> [[image logo.png style=\"width:4em;margin:1em 1em 0 3em;float:left;filter:invert(95%)\"]]\n\n> **Learn to embrace the darkness, friends. Fear the light.**\n\n> [[>]]\n\n> //- The Administrator//[[/size]][[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is the designation given to the Sun, after an event on {{[SYSTEM ERROR]}} [[size 85%]]//Data lost: ec172. Contact SysAdmin.//[[/size]] resulting in ~6.8 billion casualties within the first twenty-four hours. This event has been categorized as an XK-\u0394-Class \"Solar Singularity\" Scenario.\n\n\n\nThe SCP-001 effect does not seem to result from exposure to ultraviolet rays, but rather light in the visual spectrum (~390 to 700 nm). The effect is similarly present in moonlight.\n\n\n\nUpon contact with visible light produced by the sun, living organisms liquefy at the point of contact, with the effect spreading until the entire organism is converted. Visually, this is reminiscent of melting wax. The time this takes is largely dependent on the level of exposure and size of the organism. Despite this restructuring, at no point do living organisms perish.\n\n\n\nUpon completion, these organisms (SCP-001-A) take on a gelatinous consistency. Motile organisms will attempt to orient themselves in a fashion reminiscent of their previous form, to varying degrees of success.\n\n\n\nFlora typically remain physically inert, yet are still capable of photosynthesis, and still produce oxygen. Organisms capable of flight lose the capability to do so. Fauna remain sentient, and display behavior that parallels their non-anomalous counterparts when not absorbed into a collective instance. Humans retain a modicum of sapience and memory.\n\n\n\nBiological anomalies exposed to SCP-001 are affected in the same manner. It seems that exposure nullifies any previously expressed anomalous characteristics.\n\n\n\nDue to their composition, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another may combine and blend at the molecular level. This does not seem to cause any pain or distress to the instances, though the resulting bulk can inhibit movement. Since the SCP-001 event, most instances have congregated into such collectives, which seem to possess no maximum volume.\n\n\n\nThe resulting biomass is amorphous and chaotic. The component organisms will shift between a full-to-semi-liquid state - limbs and bodies will rise periodically from within the mass for a short duration, before deteriorating and being subsumed by another life-form.\n\n\n\nCollective instances will locomote by using their appendages in tandem to carry their mass. Larger instances will form a pseudopod from their constituent life-forms, and drag themselves about in a manner similar to amoeba.\n\n[[=]]\n\n##ff5512|+ Open attached file: Audio Log##\n\n##ff5512|@@...@@##\n\n##ff5512|@@...@@##\n\n##ff5512|@@...@@##\n\n##ff5512|Access granted.##[[/=]]\n\n> A harsh static lashes out of the speakers when you open the file.

A large, wet, red-black blotch has formed on her breast-pocket.\n\n> \n\n>\u00a0\u00a0She draws a shuddering breath, parts her lips as if to speak, and stops herself. She bows her head, and cries silently. After a minute, she manages to choke out:\n\n||\"I-I-w-we - the t-tunnel. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\nFlowed in through the, through the ceiling, dragging, dragging them into the, the l-light and ripping off their, their clothes a-a-and@@...@@\"||\n\n> She reaches into her breast pocket, and withdraws a finger. The glint of a wedding ring is visible above the severed portion. She holds it close, in cupped hands, and runs a thumb across the glimmering band.\n\n> \n\n> She sits like this for an eternity, whispering apology after apology, begging forgiveness, lost in the moment. She looks up after some time. There's a look of realization when she sees she's still recording; before she places the digit back in her pocket. She leans forward, as if to turn off the camera, when a radio crackles to life.\n\n> \n\n> It broadcasts white noise for a few seconds, and then, a voice that sets you on edge.\n\n||\"Logan?\"||\n\n> It's Ari, almost. Her voice has taken on the disgusting, gurgling tone characteristic of the affected. Logan's jaw drops, what little color that was left in her face drains. It speaks out again.\n\n||\"Where are you? Why can't I get back inside? _\n\n\u00a0_\n\nAre you there?\"||\n\n> Logan rummages beneath the desk for a moment, and produces a hand-held radio. Her hands are shaking. The thing implores her; its inhuman speech curdles your stomach.\n\n||\"Babe, it's alright. //I'm// alright, really. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\nIt's a bright, sunny day and you're just wasting away down there.\"||\n\n> Logan is in tears, her finger hovering just above the call-button. The Ari-thing draws a deep, wet, breath and speaks.\n\n||\"Such a beautiful, clear blue sky - just like that day. Do you remember, babe?||\n\n> Logan withdraws a cigarette with her free hand, followed by a pack of matches. Her shaking thwarts the first two attempts to light it. She swears silently. Third time's the charm, and she inhales a quarter of it in a single drag. The Ari-thing continues:\n\n||\"It was so perfect. Everything was how I'd always dreamt it would be. You planned exquisitely. I'd never felt so in love. _\n\n\u00a0_\n\nYou even had the band play our song@@...@@\"||\n\n> It starts singing.\n\n||\"//Golden days// _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//In the sunshine of a happy youth//\"||\n\n> Logan begins rocking back and forth in her chair.\n\n||\"//Golden days// _\n\n\u00a0_\n\n//In the sunshine of a happy youth//\"||\n\n> Logan hurls the radio across the room. It smashes somewhere off-camera. It's still somewhat operational - you can still hear the thing singing. More voices join in chorus as the radio slowly loses life. A few, a dozen, then more.\n\n||\"//Golden days,// _\n\n//In our hearts we remember them all else above// _\n\n\u00a0_\n\nDays of youth and love\"||\n\n> They continue singing until the radio mercifully dies.
