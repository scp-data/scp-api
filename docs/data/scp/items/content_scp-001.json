Their dance was one of fury and hatred and destruction, and in the place of Stars they twirled and shook and gyrated, bringing down the wrath to the song of Creation itself. The Metal, the Flesh, the Scarlet and the Wretch wrestled in the maw of Eternity and moved like streams, with the force of floods, and broke.</p>\n<p>And when it was over, when the divine Fluid had been spilt onto the wet Soil, the quarter came crashing down to the Material Plane, broken and torn, landing in the far corners and crevasses of the One land, there to lay for ages and ages passed before an eye was lain upon them. The Scarlet lay, and in the millenia life sprung up in the Material Plane, from lichen to fish to trees and then finally, Man arose in the far east, south, and west on the backs of their new gods.</p>\n<p>But the Scarlet had already created life, unbeknownst to its brother and sisters. As the Gods slumbered in their ersatz tombs, the Scarlet reached out with the gift of life, striking a seed on the Astral Plane that sprouted, growing wildly and with abandon, unobserved and unlimited, existing only in the gaps and roots and vines of the Jungle. Uncountable cycles before Man took his first steps on Asia, the Spirits, the Daeva expanded from a single thought of a dreaming God to a people, a culture and a civilization on the unobserved Astral Plane, as they danced and hunted and killed and warred and mated around the great tree of life in worship to the Scarlet.</p>\n<p>And the God, the Scarlet, pinned underneath the ever-growing weight of the jungle as the Men moved in and built their huts and their farms and killed and died, yet more victims of the brutal circle of life, reached up and dug its fingers in, plucking its eye from its socket and pushing it up just as the First Man sought refuge under a tree. The gem, swaddled in the same roots sprung from the mouth of the beast, sung out for a champion, for a warrior who would raise his sword in the name of the first, truest magic, and march forth under the banner of the first, truest of the four gods \u2014 to strike a bargain with the Daeva, Children of the Scarlet House, and become their chakravarti.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scale EN-base Safe\">\n<div class=\"class1\">\n<div class=\"level-text\"><span class=\"base false EN\">3/001</span> LEVEL <span class=\"base false EN\">3/001</span></div>\n<div class=\"class-text\">CLASSIFIED</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item1 EN\">\n<div class=\"itemnum EN\">Item #: SCP-001</div>\n<div class=\"objclass EN\">\n<div class=\"obj Safe\">\n<div class=\"obj-text\">Safe</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"JadeHeader2k.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/rounderhouse-jade-proposal/JadeHeader2k.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\">\n<p>Mamjul, taken by MTF Gamma-6.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-left\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Brain.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/rounderhouse-jade-proposal/Brain.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>LSAP Cadmus-Aram Deep-Brain Oneiric Parietal Stimulation Array.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> SCP-001 is currently contained through Special Containment Protocol <span class=\"label\">HERODOTUS</span>, instituted on July 14th, 2003 by majority vote of the O5 Council. See Addendum 001.9 for full details.</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-001 refers to the ruins of Mamjul, an ancient pre-First Occult War city-state located approximately 734km off the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Evidence suggests that Mamjul was constructed and located at or above sea level; how it came to rest at its current position 3.6 kilometers underwater is unknown.</p>\n<p>SCP-001 was discovered by the Foundation on August 24th, 2002. At first, it was believed to be a mundane archaeological ruin, and its location was recorded to disseminate to the global archaeological community in the near future. However, closer inspection revealed that the city was remarkably preserved and structurally near-pristine, despite having spent well over three millennia underwater; carbon-dating placed the interior ruins to 2,400 BCE.</p>\n<p>Further investigation by COYOTE divers unearthed the full extent of SCP-001. Initially thought to be the ruins of a small Bronze Age settlement, the full city is comprised of several hundred buildings, most buried under large amounts of silt and sand but structurally intact.

Lemuria was a hypothetical 'sunken continent' first proposed by Philip Sclater in the 19th century as an explanation for the presence of lemur fossils in Madagascar and India but not in landmasses separating the two.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Lemuria was quickly co-opted by a large movement of Tamil revivalists in 19th and 20th century India as a potential birthplace of human civilization; they altered the idea to fit with cultural legends of an ancient Bronze Age Tamil civilization south of modern Tamil Nadu, one that would eventually form the basis for Indian civilization before being suddenly and violently swallowed by the sea.</p>\n<p>The Lemuria hypothesis was eventually rendered obsolete by plate tectonics theory, and no mundane historical or archaeological record exists to support the existence of the Kumari Kandam landmass or a Bronze Age Tamil civilization predating the Chera, Chola, and Pandya cultures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>Parahistory</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Kumari Kandam</strong> has been the subject of considerable debate in the occult community, long after the Lemuria hypothesis was discarded by mundane science. Several expeditions, funded by various anomalous organizations, ventured into the Indian Ocean throughout the 20th century in an attempt to find any records of the sunken continent \u2014 of these, only one bore any results. PoI-0108, Viswamitra Thakkar (alias Captain Nemo), claimed to have discovered 'Atlantean ruins' in the region during a 1925 self-funded expedition, but his records were never released and disappeared along with him in 1939.</p>\n<p>The six <strong>Aegean Tablets</strong> recovered from the Sea of Crete by the French Crown's <em>estate Noir</em> prior to the Revolution were the first discovered mentions of Bronze Age advanced human civilizations. The onset of the Napoleonic Wars and the concurrent Second Occult War led to the destruction of any French translations of the tablets, save for one Greek-to-French-to-English translation of the first tablet by <a href=\"/scp-1867\">SCP-1867</a>, detailed in the <a href=\"/rounderhouse-gold-proposal\">SCP-001-GOLD</a> file.</p>\n<p>The relevant portion is attached:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mamjul and Korar, two dark fortresses resting in the jungles of the subcontinent. The magicians and sorcerer-nawabs allied themselves against the horrors of the jungle, and crossed a pact with something ancient. The Covenant of the Daeva was born, using the first magic gifted to Man - the magic of life and death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Foundation efforts at translating the remaining tablets, extracted from British custody in 1983, have been ongoing but extremely slow due to environmental damage and the relative lack of context to work from. Regardless, by 1999, the second and fourth tablets had been fully translated. The fourth described the Mekhanite Empire and Amoni-Ram in greater detail and is not attached in this document, while the second covered Mamjul, Korar, and the forerunner civilization of the Daevic Covenant:</p>\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT - FEBRUARY 1999</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Root.</strong> Blood. Steel.\n<p>Once, men huddled for warmth and dryness under the broad leaves of the jungle titans. Once, fire was a weak dream, drowned under the weight of endless flood and rain. Once, the land was blanketed so densely with untamed forest that the spirits of the trees themselves walked past the coast and into the sea. Once, man was weak and frail, battered from the constant war to survive with the jungle.</p>\n<p>Once, a man curled into the base of a tree, sheltering from a torrent. His fingers discovered a scarlet jewel, jammed between the knotted roots. It shone into his eyes, with depth like an ocean of blood. He pulled it from its nest, and put it to his ear. The Endless Scarlet sang to him. It offered a deal: should he lay down his own mind and soul in service to the spirits, they would gift him their boons. He would ascend to the realm of the gods - and in return, they would assure not just his people's survival, but their power. His children and his children's children would be sorcerers. The boons of the Daeva would be at their fingertips, and he would be a once and future king.</p>\n<p>The Covenant was struck. The Daeva themselves descended from the realm of the spirits and the gods. They met the people, and bonded with them - every body contains two spirits, and the power to bend the forest to their will. The first magic was used to raise the city in the depths of the jungle. The people toiled for a year and one day, laying the massive stones and bracing the walls with vine and root, crafting the city that would be the seat of an empire. Mamjul was built under the watchful slumber of the Scarlet and its prophet.</p>\n<p>And once the Daevic Cities were assured, and the Record was writ, the Covenant marched north under the banner of the Scarlet Maharaja.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The word <em>daeva</em> originally refers to supernatural entities and spirits, almost universally malevolent, within the canon of Zoroastrianism. Variations such as <em>deva</em>, <em>div</em>, etc appear throughout several different Asian religions and mythologies, suggesting the <em>daeva</em> mentioned in the Tablets are a common source. This is supported by the tablet's claims that the Daevic Covenant spread their culture and beliefs throughout Asia.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc4\"><span>Section 001.2</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc5\"><span><tt>INITIAL DISCOVERY</tt></span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Following the Amoni-Ram Incident, locating Mamjul and Korar was elevated to Global Priority Level Alpha to gain a material advantage over GoI-004 ('The Church of the Broken God').

After a few seconds, O5-1 raises his voice.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> All of you. <strong>Stop.</strong></p>\n<p><em>[The conversation dwindles to a halt.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Please. Let's let Researcher Galanis explain themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Th-thank you.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS clears their throat.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Two days ago, on August 24th, the Foundation Research Ship <em>Lillihammer</em>, crewed by 32, was conducting routine diving operations on potential sites of interest in the Laccadive Sea, about three-hundred kilometers south of Sri Lanka, when we-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> What was the <em>Lillihammer</em>'s stated mission?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Uh, broadly speaking, to investigate any potential undersea anomalies in the region.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Understood. Continue.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yes. We had received orders from Indo-Pacific Regional Command to scout out PUS-519. The Atreus Array had detected an anomaly there. So, we positioned the ship over the site, and sent down two divers in personal submersible suits. After descending about three and a half kilometers, the divers encountered what we've new determined are the ruins of a large city, centered around an immense calcified arbo-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> A massive tree stump.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Er, yes. Carved out into what we think is some sort of citadel.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Did your divers get anything else?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We, uh, that is to say <em>I</em>, pulled them out as soon as I received a match. But they saw structures far below the top of the\u2026 stump. The rest of the city, at least the size of Amoni-Ram. Maybe larger.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Motherfucker.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> This is\u2026 extremely troubling.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> It's a <em>little more than troubling</em>. This could be worse than Amoni-Ram. We should get rid of it.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Get <em>rid</em> of it?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> That's insane. How do you plan to get rid of an entire underwater metropolis \u2014 and, speaking of which, how and why is this place underwater?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We currently believe-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Underwater tactical nuke. Blow it to kingdom come.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> You're insane.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> <em>I'm</em> insane? You guys want to run right back into the gauntlet, now that the fallout has finally abated somewhat. I mean, fuck. Eleven's seat is still empty.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Eleven didn't die because he got kicked around in Amoni-Ram. He had telekill alloy inserted into his goddamn cranium, the tumours would've done him in even without the mnestic o\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> The backlash from <em>what</em>, exactly? Hm?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> None of that matters.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Then what does?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> The fact that we've just been served an advantage on a silver platter.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Need I remind you what happened the last time-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> No, you very well do not. But don't be an idiot, either. In 1987 the playing field was not the same as it is now.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> People, let's not\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> We now have a material incentive to intervening. We are at a disadvantage against Bumaro, waiting for him to strike. The Daeva dealt a lethal blow to Amoni-Ram \u2014 it is worth at the very least investigating their methods.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> We haven't heard anything from the Mekhanites in a decade. Maybe they wiped themselves out.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Surely you don't really-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> We should wait for the Administr-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> We don't even know if he's <em>alive!</em> It's been years-</p>\n<p><em>[Over the din, GALANIS raises their voice.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Excuse me! EXCUSE ME!</p>\n<p><em>[The attendees turn to look at them.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I\u2026 know that this wasn't supposed to happen.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> What're you-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Let them speak, .</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The maps in Amoni-Ram pointed us at India, but no one expected it to be in the sea. Project TRIAD's efforts have been focused into mainland India. Everyone knows \u2014 <em>I</em> know why I got put on this detail. I can't speak to what happened in 1987, because I wasn't in the city. But this isn't the same organization it was then. We don't allow cybernetics anymore, we have the CRV system. We've changed to avoid those mistakes.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Those are\u2026 certainly points, but that doesn't change the fact that the <em>risk</em> posed by investing resources in another venture like this\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, we're not the only ones who know about it.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> What did you say?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We were working off what we managed to get out of SCP-001 before\u2026 everything happened. Bumaro has had access to the city for a decade since. Think about what he unlocked in a year. Now imagine what he could do in ten. And what he could do if he takes Mamjul and Korar.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> As far as we know, the Daevic Covenant are half the reason the Mekhanites fell. We need their deterrent.</p>\n<p><em>[The Overseers begin to discuss among themselves in low voices.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Not a bad argument. But we're gonna need more concrete assurances than happy feelings and declarations of trust.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I- Of cour-</p>\n<p><em>[O5-1 stands.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> And we can continue to discuss that in private. Thank you for your cooperation, Researcher Galanis.

And this is Ajay Desai.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Hello, Captain. I'm the lead diver on the <em>Lillihammer</em>. Nice to finally put faces to names.</p>\n<p><strong>HICKMAN:</strong> The feeling is very mutual. This has all been very sudden \u2014 not your fault, of course, but I'm just used to having orders months in advance. Not being turned around with less than 48 hours of warning.</p>\n<p><em>[HICKMAN laughs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>HICKMAN:</strong> No matter in the end, right? This is far more exciting stuff than watching polar bears fuck on ice floats.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Tell me about it.

This is Lieutenant Lucian Greaves, head of the\u2026 security detail for your project, I believe. We picked him and his unit up about two days ago.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> That's right. Apologies, Doctor \u2014 it's surprisingly easy to forget you've never really met someone when you've been reading their dossiers for a week.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm\u2026 sure, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> You're with which Mobile Task Force again, Lieutenant?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Alpha-1.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> <em>Ah.</em></p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Right, you're our babysitters.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Ajay\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> It's alright.

Like my unit's presence. The Council has a long memory, and Amoni-Ram is still a fresh wound.

I can't blame them for being suspicious. I told the Council that we had moved past what Nussbaum and Aram or Bumaro or whatever he's called, did. And we have, I think. But\u2026 it's not an unreasonable suspicion. I'm okay with a little scrutiny on my work if it means I get to study the Daevic Covenant like I've always wanted.</p>\n<p><strong>HICKMAN:</strong> A respectable mindset.

At their emperor's behest and now able to take form on the Material Plane, the Daeva of the Scarlet rode down from the trees on their six-winged thousand-legged beasts of burden and joined in celebrations with the tribe of their new suzerain, in hymnal and orgiastic worship to the great red power.</p>\n<p>Then the Daeva, with their many arms, grasped the stones and built a fortress to protect themselves, for now the Daeva and the Men were one in the eyes of the trees. They worked tirelessly and without cease for three nights and three days while Mamjul, city for Men, rose from the earth around the Great Tree of Life. Then they climed the trunk and branches of the tree, scaling it up to the heavens and back into the Astral Plane whereupon they again began to work, constructing another city of starstuff and soul-spirits given up to the cosmos after death. The leaves and fruits and flowers of the Great Tree formed the canopy for this Korar, city for Daeva, great beacon through the empty wandering wastes of the heavens, a perfect mirror of its sister below with the Scarlet Maharaja resting in his dream, sustaining the empire, in the grand temple of the Tree.</p>\n<p>The magic of the Daeva was now Man's to commend, and the battlemages and sorcerer-nawabs marched out under their scarlet banner to conquer fertile lands and the godless cities in the name of their king, assisted by the spirits lengths tall and able to tear a man in two with only a strike. The red wave swept across Asia from the south, demolishing all in its path, consuming the spirit of the enemy, taking prisoner-slave and loot back back to Mamjul on the back of the great beasts of the Covenant. Cities would lay down arms and accept the Scarlet Maharaja as their chakravarti as his beasts and creatures brought down their walls and the magicians would lay waste to their palaces and temples.</p>\n<p>The Scarlet Maharaja's bride, the Rajmata, would sit and rule in his stead, matriarch of the Covenant as he slept in the branches of the Great Tree. Long-lived and beautiful and awesome, the lineage of queens would defend the city against all threats. And the city swelled with treasures and fine linens and foodstuffs across the vast Daevic Covenant, and the poets and artists and dancers and people of thought filled its buildings with the culture of the Covenant. And when they died, their spirits would dance the dance of the cosmos, rising up the Tree into Korar to live the eternal song of the Daeva. And the Daeva would reside in their kingdom above, watching over the Men they loved so.

Command for the mission is Opr. Ajay Desai and Dr. Pandora Galanis, with Lt. Lucian Greaves of MTF-A1 observing.</p>\n<p><strong>T-00:03 \u2014 T-00:00:</strong> KALLA-1 is craned out above the sea and released, dropping 7m into the water. All systems green, mission commenced.</p>\n<p><strong>T+00:01 \u2014 T+00:22:</strong> Command orders KALLA-1 to begin descending into the ocean. Over the next 22 minutes, the submersible drops a total of 3.6km into the depths of the Laccadive Sea. Sunlight quickly diminishes, and the floodlights aboard KALLA-1 are activated. The submersible slows its descent after the peak of the citadel encountered by KHAN comes into view.</p>\n<p><strong>T+00:23 \u2014 T+00:51:</strong> With the additional light from the floodlights, it is apparent that the section KHAN explored was only a small part of the megastructure. The total structure is nearly 400m in height, and roughly cylindrical with a top circumference of 70m. From a distance, it is clear that the structure is indeed reminiscent of a tree stump. The base is too far to be seen by the sub's cameras, but the citadel slopes upward and grows thinner as it ascends, before abruptly cutting off. KALLA-1 approaches closer to the exterior of the citadel; as KHAN saw, the entire surface is covered in extensive carvings and reliefs depicting a variety of scenes and figures, some life-sized, including a depiction of the tree itself, which also recursively contains reliefs of the tree and scenes.</p>\n<p><strong>T+00:52 \u2014 T+01:09:</strong> KALLA-1 revolves around the citadel for some time, taking digital images of the various carvings spreading across the rock-like surface and surrounding the embrasures. The carvings, particularly of the figures and animals, are remarkably realistic for being carved from wood. Many figures are clearly human, but many also display distinctly nonhuman qualities ranging from horns to animal snouts and limbs. Two figures recur frequently, and are depicted as nearly three or four times the height of the rest. One is a long-bearded man with an elaborate headdress, shown carrying long spears across his back and typically with eyes closed. The other is a gigantic androgynous entity with an obscured face, inset with gleaming red gemstones. They are almost always depicted together.</p>\n<p><strong>T+01:10 \u2014 T+01:21:</strong> At Dr. Galanis' command, KALLA-1 extends one arm with a laser torch implement, and cuts off a small, 4cm by 4cm cube of the tree material before placing it inside itself. The process takes nearly ten minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>T+01:21 \u2014 T+01:32:</strong> KALLA-1 breaks off from the exterior, and ascends to the top of the citadel. After confirming the entrance hole revealed by KHAN is spacious enough for the submersible to fit through, KALLA-1 descends into the belly of the structure and activates its remaining floodlights. The camera reveals that the interior of the structure is intricately constructed \u2014 landings, corridors, and doorways line the walls, presumably leading off to smaller rooms. The interior walls also contain carvings, but a smaller amount compared to the blanketing array on the exterior. The rubble of a spiral staircase can be seen far below through holes in various floors, confirming KHAN's analysis that the spiral staircase collapsed and the falling debris smashed a vertical passage through the citadel.</p>\n<p><strong>T+01:32 \u2014 T+01:37:</strong> Opr. Desai complains of someone whispering in the command room. Lt. Greaves attest that he hears it as well, but no other parties in the command room are speaking or report hearing any speaking. Dr. Galanis orders the mission to continue, noting down the anomaly and acquiescing to Lt.

While large, this section is still too small for the submersible to safely maneuver through. High ceilings are inlaid with a winding root-and-vine pattern. The far end of the room contains some kind of pedestal with a long object on it, but the visibility is poor. Beside it appears to be some kind of wooden throne.</p>\n<p><strong>T+01:54 \u2014 T+02:01:</strong> KALLA-1 slowly turns towards the opposite direction. A large vomitorium extends out, light at the end signalling an exit. Slowly, the submersible turns and proceeds out through this long passage. Cameras along KALLA-1 take snapshots of the walls of the passage and the carvings they depict.</p>\n<p><strong>T+02:02 \u2014 T+02:06:</strong> KALLA-1 exits the archway of the citadel, the sudden light momentarily dampening the cameras. When visuals are recovered, the submersible is in the center of a large, wide avenue lined on all sides by large, stonecut buildings and fortifications. The architecture of the buildings is heavily reminiscent of ancient South Asian architecture, with stacked terraced roofs and battlements of heavy stone. The street forks ahead, spreading out. From its angle, KALLA-1 can see an entire section of the city of Mamjul, collapsed under the weight of the ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>T+02:07 \u2014 T+02:46:</strong> The submersible drifts through the streets of Mamjul, slowly mapping the area. The avenues are wide and broad, and the doorways and buildings throughout the city are strangely disproportionate to the average human body. The architecture throughout the city continues to resemble that of ancient Southeast Asian cultures, with towering shrines of stone and buildings with terraced temple-roofs. However, the farther from the citadel, the less intact the buildings are. Many show signs of extreme disrepair and stress, particularly around the outer edges of the city's walls where they are practically piles of rubble.</p>\n<p><strong>T+02:47 \u2014 T+02:59:</strong> KALLA-1 ascends and deploys a sonar mapper overhead to formulate a three-dimensional map of the city. From this height, it is clear that the city is contained within three triangular walls forming high ramparts, similar to Amoni-Ram's circular great wall. However, Mamjul is significantly larger in area than Amoni-Ram was.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Green01Overlay.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/rounderhouse-jade-proposal/Green01Overlay.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Ext08</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>T+03:00 \u2014 T+03:27:</strong> KALLA-1 returns to the base of Mamjul. Operators point out sites of stress and battle; while a large amount of buildings appear crushed by the intense pressure, there are scorch marks, explosion craters, and bleached skeletons littering the streets of large portions of the city. The amount of skeletons is particularly notable \u2014 certain sections of the city are quite literally layered in dead bodies, many of which suggest a non-human skeleton structure. Samples of these bones are taken.</p>\n<p><strong>T+03:28 \u2014 T+03:36:</strong> KALLA-1 passes a large building that appears relatively intact, and with an entrance large enough to maneuver the submersible through. Opr. Desai assumes manual control and pilots it through. The interior of the building is filled with toppled shelves and scattered skeletal remains, but one corner of the building contains a cache of ceramic chests and jars that appear to be water-sealed. A number of the smaller jars are recovered, but Dr. Galanis orders the larger ones be left behind for later recovery by COYOTE divers.</p>\n<p><strong>T+03:37 \u2014 T+03:57:</strong> KALLA-1 reverses out of the structure, exiting back into the streets of the city. The submersible continues its exploration of the outer edges of the city, confirming the triangular shape of Mamjul.</p>\n<p><strong>T+03:57 \u2014 T+03:58:</strong> Opr. Desai notes to Dr. Galanis that KALLA-1's power reserves are at 32%. At his suggestion, Dr. Galanis orders KALLA-1 to return to the <em>Lillihammer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>T+03:59 \u2014 T+04:28:</strong> The submersible ascends to the <em>Lillihammer</em>, reaching the surface without incident. It is safely craned out of the water.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abEND LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Following the arrival of KALLA-1 and the analysis of onboard data, anomalies were detected in the audio recorded by the submersible's underwater microphones. The audio tracks were isolated and amplified, revealing a low-frequency buzzing of unknown origin from T+02:02 to when KALLA-1 exited the ruins of Mamjul. Tests of the microphones revealed no malfunction.</p>\n<p>Lt. Greaves and Operator Desai both submitted to Hartwell-Pugh evaluations following the conclusion of the dive mission and passed with adequate scores, indicating no present cognitohazardous influence.</p>\n<p>The samples recovered from the dive were analyzed on-site in the clean labs aboard the <em>Phantom</em> before being transported to MKF-02 by helicopter for long-term study and, if necessary, containment. The large piece of the citadel structure lasered off by KALLA-1 confirmed that the substance comprising the structure is organic, similar in appearance to teak wood but heavily hardened and mineralized through a process resembling fossilization. The final product is a dark, knotted wood that is incredibly dense and hard, comparable to stone, while being entirely organically grown; the size and proportions of the 435m stump suggest that the full tree would have been nearly a kilometer high.</p>\n<p>The jars recovered by KALLA-1 were, as suspected, sealed and made watertight through application of a thick, gum-like substance. Upon removal and opening of the jars, stone and clay tablets were discovered inside. However, the tablets were all completely featureless, lacking any kind of writing or marking. The significance of these tablets is as of yet unknown.</p>\n<p>The digital images recorded of the various carvings on the citadel and throughout the city were disseminated for analysis among the research team. On September 12th, the research team had the first of several leadership meetings among the various research sectors.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT - SEPTEMBER 2002</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Good morning, everyone \u2014 is that everyone, actually?</p>\n<p><em>[Murmurs of assent from the assembled committee.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Excellent! I've already met most of you, but I do see some new faces. About a third of you are from my research team, and the rest of you have been flown out especially for this project. Some of you are the best in your fields, and some of you are young and hungry. Either way, I personally appreciate you coming, and hope that we can really work well together. This is the project of a lifetime for me \u2014 I guess I'm rambling, aren't I?</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS laughs, smoothing out their labcoat and placing the clipboard down on the table.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, I'm Doctor Pandora V. Galanis, Project Lead. If all of you could introduce yourself as you speak, it certainly wouldn't go unappreciated! Hard time with attaching names to faces. This, of course, is my second-in-command, Operator Ajay Desai.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Hello, all.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Levi Sheridan, head of Archaeology. Pleasure to be working with you, ma'am.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Nice to meet you, Levi, but not a ma'am.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> \u2026Ah. Right. I'm sorry-</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You're fine. Glad to have you aboard.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> Senior Researcher Xing Yijun, I'm heading the Linguistic Analysis Team \u2014 I just wanted to ask, ah\u2026 are we\u2026 in danger?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><em>[YIJUN points to the corner of the room.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh. No, nothing like that. No, Lieutenant Greaves and his unit are just here as observers.</p>\n<p><em>[GREAVES raises a hand.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Pretend I'm not even here.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Right\u2026 well, no sense in wasting any more time. It's been a few days since the KALLA-1 dive, and since then we've confirmed that we're not getting any expressly anomalous readings from the city itself or any of the recovered material. The samples recovered are definitely odd and of significant interest to the project, but Hume levels are normal, HP evaluations after the dive were normal, pretty much all readings are normal.</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> Doctor Karl Aberer, Anthropology. Sorry \u2014 but we've barely explored the city yet, no? The submersible was only able to move through the largest, least-damaged portions of the city.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> There's so much still down there.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's true! KALLA-1 isn't able to get into the nooks and crannies of Mamjul's buildings, or extensively explore the interior of the space. But\u2026 after conferring with the Council - and Lieutenant Greaves - we have authorization to begin entering the city!</p>\n<p><em>[A small cheer rings out through the conference room from those assembled.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> That's amazing. I mean, it's amazing, but we're sure it's safe?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Vijay, right? From Parahistory. Yes, there's no reason to think that there's anything spooky down there, but I'd like everyone to be cautious regardless, you know? Even without anything anomalous, exploring those old degraded ruins can be dangerous at the best of times. I mean, look what happened to Dr. Nuss-</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Yes. Like Doctor Galanis said, there's nothing expressly anomalous but it would do everyone well to be cautious. And keep in mind the context we're working with here.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> \u2026Thank you, Lieutenant. Well, all that said, I'd like to quickly go over our current pool of knowledge and get everyone on the same page. Just a quick refresher of where we're at right now in terms of knowledge on the Daevic Covenant. These will be sent out in paper memos, of course! Just, you know, I find things easier explained if they're verbalized. I hope nobody minds?</p>\n<p><em>[Murmurs of assent from the group.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Okay! I'll start us off: prior to discovering \u2014 stumbling across, really \u2014 Mamjul, all our knowledge on the Daevic Covenant, even the name itself, came from either the Aegean Tablets or records recovered from the Amoni-Ram Initiative. The image they give is of some kind of caste-based proto-Tamil Indian civilization, one that made exceptionally heavy use of 'life magic'. The Ancient Mekhanites wrote far less about the Daevic Covenant than they did about the N\u00e4lka, but we did determine that they were hostile to one another. Mekhanite dogma was transhumanist, and the way they spoke of and referenced the Covenant suggests their religion and 'magic', which seem to be more concerned with the spirit and soul, conflicted easily.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Certainly true, but I must remind everyone that we are unfortunately limited in scope by the nature and context of our sources. As mentioned, the Daevic Covenant, the Mekhanite Empire, and the N\u00e4lka peoples were at war with one another almost as soon as they become aware of one another when colonizing Central Asia. It is entirely possible \u2014 likely, even, that much of the writings of the period were more intended as religious propaganda than historical record. I would not take anything as gospel.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Absolutely. The only other record we have is the Aegean Tablets. Mr. Sheridan?</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Yeah. Um, yes. The section of the Aegean Tablets we've translated so far, the one describing the Covenant, shares some broad strokes with the Mekhanite portrayal. Precursor to Tamil Indian empires in the same way the Mekhanites would later influence pre-Islamic Arabian empires. They go into detail about the magic 'of life' referenced in the first tablet. Right now we're inclined to think it's some kind of thaumaturgy focusing on living tissue \u2014 particularly plant matter, but also probably other organic stuff. Anyway, you're all familiar with the creation myth relayed, but to sum it up: the first human tribes in India apparently were farther south, during a recession of the Indian Ocean. The leader of one of these tribes made some kind of deal with a spirit, a Daeva, to ally their societies into one. The titular Daevic Covenant.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUAN (LING):</strong> That's quite similar to the Mekhanite myth, isn't it? A god offering boons to a human society in exchange for service and worship?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It is. And, to their credit, both seem to agree that these gods were\u2026 somehow related.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUAN (LING):</strong> Part of a pantheon, most likely.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> From there, it's more murky. It describes the construction of Mamjul, but no idea what Korar even is, if anything. It breaks from the Mekhanite dogma, referencing four gods at the start instead of three. Something called 'the Wretch'. I don't even know what the Daeva are exactly, how they managed to bring down Amoni-Ram, or how they relate to the Abominate.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> There's a lot more questions than answers. I was hoping the city would clarify some of them, but\u2026 so far, all we've found are blank tablets and bones. Something bad happened here, but we don't know what. But, I think our time is just about done, so unless anyone has anything else-</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Pardon me.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Ajay? What's up?</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> You know \u2014 I'm no scientist. I'm sure you guys know what you're doing. But\u2026 I can't help but think you guys are kind of missing the forest for the trees, a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Is no one else gonna say it?</p>\n<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> What kind of power does it take to sink an entire fucking continent?</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I guess it's our job to find out, isn't it?

Angkor Wat, a gigantic Buddhist temple complex all wrought from the same stone. Every wall covered and layered in intricate carvings of myths and legends. It feels like that. This place is drenched in religion, you can feel it in every crevice.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> But\u2026 this place predates Angkor Wat by three thousand years.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Yup.</p>\n<p><em>[The team continues exploring the surrounding buildings. As KHAN-1 described, all buildings are reminiscent of Cambodia and general Southeast Asian architecture. Many of the buildings resemble temples in structure and form.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Anyone find anything?</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-3:</strong> Empty.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> This doesn't make sense. These would've been the largest and most impressive buildings, by proximity to the temple. Right?</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-3:</strong> They should be.

They travel as a group in a diamond formation. They encounter several large pits in the place of buildings, carved with steps in the sides leading down. These pits contain water significantly darker than their surroundings.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> It looks like a stepwell.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-4:</strong> A what?</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> A kind of ancient Indian reservoir. Basically a huge pit dug into the ground that would collect rainwater, then you'd walk down the steps to get it. No idea what's in there now, though.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-3:</strong> Geothermal activity?</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Unlikely in this part of the ocean. Take a sample, we'll analyze it.</p>\n<p><em>[The team continues back out to the streets. In the southern third of the city, they float over large pathways leading to the citadel that are layered with bones.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> Jesus Christ, that's a lot of skeletons.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-3:</strong> Not all human.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-4:</strong> He's right, look at them.

The large cranium fans out into two horn-like protrusions, with a wide crest behind them. There are three eye sockets spread horizontally.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> That doesn't look human in the slightest. A lot of these look more like\u2026 cattle, then people.

A lot of these\u2026 there's no signs of breaking, trauma, they're hardly even damaged. So clearly a lot of these didn't die in battle. Whatever, something for the researchers to figure out.

Keep an eye on each other.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> Frankly\u2026 I don't think there's anything here for us to find, command.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Agreed. We've been scouring this place for hours now, working our way down. There's nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-4:</strong> At least we were right about the name, it's a citadel. A cross between a fortress, a palace, and a temple. We've hit like six different battlements on our way and we're not even halfway down yet.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> There's an extensive system of rooms, but without furniture it's basically impossible to tell what they're intended for. They could be bedrooms or dungeons, there's just no way to know. But we've taken samples of the plant life \u2014 and I think that's all we can really do.</p>\n<p><strong>COMMAND:</strong> KHAN-1?</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> I'd like to check out the base floor. Then we can leave.</p>\n<p><strong>COMMAND:</strong> Affirmative. Let us know what you find.</p>\n<p><em>[KHAN team descends the remaining distance through the central passage to the ground floor of the citadel. Carefully manuevering around the heaps of broken rubble, they turn on floodlamps, illuminating the space. It is dominated by two massive statues resting on a dais with an altar in the center of the space. They resemble the two largest figures on the carvings outside \u2014 one male in a headdress and armor, and an androgynous spirit inlaid with red jewels. They appear to be dancing. In front of them, a throne sits almost two meters off the ground, carved from what appears to be a single root of the tree. Several other statues with cupped hands decorate the space.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Woah.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-4:</strong> That is some spooky bullshit.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> Well, at least now we're sure it was a palace.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> And a temple. Look at the floor.</p>\n<p><em>[The wood floor underneath them contains a similarly intricate series of wood symbols and lettering, spreading out in concentric circles from the altar.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Wait. What is that?</p>\n<p><em>[KHAN-1 descends, approaching the altar, into which is embedded a dark object. On approach, it is clearly a knife of some kind. He pulls it from the wood, and it tumbles free.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> A ritual dagger. Look at the markings.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-4:</strong> Yeah that's\u2026 fuck that.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> I'll bag it. The rest of you, take some photos. Then let's get the fuck out of here.</p>\n<p><em>[The other team members float through the throne room, taking video.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-2:</strong> Not seeing a whole lot. Most of these carvings have been rubbed away by the water.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-3:</strong> No other relics lying around, anyway. Upper floors were similarly empty.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> So the creepy dagger is the only thing of worth down here. Nice.</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-4:</strong> Should we keep looking, Ajay?</p>\n<p><strong>KHAN-1:</strong> Nah, let's head up.

Nobody could've predicted stuff like this, that the city would be nigh-empty or that we'd be working from scraps. But it's still frustrating regardless. This was supposed to be my big break \u2014 I've enjoyed spending my time on the <em>Lillihammer</em>'s crew, but I think everyone knew why I was there instead of climbing the ladder back at a real Site. Relegated to the dustbin of history for something I didn't even <em>do.</em> I mean, I'm not stupid, I get it. They can't know for certain I had nothing to do with what happened in Amoni-Ram. But it's still unfair.</p>\n<p>And then of all the ships in the world, I happen to be on the one that stumbles across Mamjul. It's gotta be fate, I tell myself, and promise that I'll do the best I can to show them all that I'm not Bumaro or Doctor Nussbaum. And now I have to go, tail between my legs, and tell the Council that I don't have anything. Not even anything good, but <em>nothing</em>. Maybe they were right to keep me away from the real projects. I know it's not true, but goddamn if it doesn't feel like it right now.</p>\n<p>It just doesn't make sense, though. Nothing about this makes sense. Amoni-Ram was a technological marvel \u2014 they were doing cold fusion in 1500 BCE. The only thing remotely anomalous about the Daevic Covenant so far is the fact that they had strange plants. How was this war at all evenly matched? What did the Daeva have that made the Ancient Mekhanites so terrified of them? What is Korar? What the hell <em>happened</em> here?</p>\n<p>We might even be able to answer that if we had anything left of records, writings, materials, artifacts, relics, <em>anything</em>. But there's nothing. It's as if the Daeva have been\u2026 wiped from history. It's infuriating. The research teams are demoralized. The divers are sick of going down to root around in old ruins and find nothing. The fact that their every move is constantly watched by armed men doesn't exactly help. I've had people coming to me and Ajay for weeks with complaints of the MTF guys making it impossible for them to get any work done. But there's not much I can do without them thinking I've gone native.</p>\n<p>It's funny how many of my problems lead back to Bumaro despite never even meeting him.</p>\n<p>I don't know what to do. There's just so many questions that haven't been answered. All we know right now is a facsimile, a half-dreamt image of the Daevic culture. A rich history of architecture, art, and dance that you can still see influences of in Indian and Cambodian culture. An almost religious reverence for nature, androgyny, and dreams. But also indications of cannibalism, ritual sacrifice, brutal slavery. And these are all just from what we've observed in the city. No one really <em>knows</em> anything about the Daeva. If we just had some kind of guide\u2026</p>\n<p>Try as I might not to, I keep returning to Bumaro and Nussbaum, what they would've done. Though they did it for an abominable purpose, they were the only ones in the situation I'm in now. They were blockaded in their research until they found the Preserver to help them understand. Conventional methods stopped working, so they looked for a guide, and found one. Except there aren't any guides left here.</p>\n<p>Or maybe I just need to broaden my horizons.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A meeting between the project lead and O5-1 was scheduled for October 4th, using the Secure Leyspace Communicator, to update the Council on the Initiative's progress.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT \u2014 OCTOBER 2002</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ley connection to Sanctum One established.

I'm not very technical myself but my understanding is that the Communicator sends an encrypted signal through the Earth's latent Ley lines. Fast, doesn't need any infrastructure, and it's practically impossible to intercept unless you catch the signal as it's coming in. But it's magic, and it tends to respond to the moods and minds of the users.</p>\n<p><em>[He gestures around.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> And Amoni-Ram has been weighing on my mind quite heavily as of late.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I figure it doesn't help that Buma- Aram built this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It doesn't, though he built a vast array of things, many of which we still use. And you can call him Bumaro. It's what we've been doing ever since we last heard from him. He was no longer the man we hired, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe not a man at all.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> When was that?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Nearly ten years ago, now. Our searches in the anomalous Nexuses for any sign of the Church of the Broken God's location paid off. But things\u2026 went poorly. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge too many details. I'm sure you understand.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yeah, I get it, don't worry. Though, it's kind of hard not to, imagining someone that unhinged running around with that kind of power. One of the biggest threats we're facing.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I disagree.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Wait, what? The Council seemed-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I am not the Council. My colleagues agree that Bumaro is an existential danger to the Foundation, and so do I. But not for one second have I fallen under the delusion that he is insane or the biggest threat we face. Just the most present one.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You think he's\u2026 what, doing this for power? As a calculated move?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I think that\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[O5-1 sighs, and begins to walk down the broadway. GALANIS follows.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> How old do you think I am, Doctor Galanis?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I\u2026 don't really know.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS laughs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It's kind of an open secret that you guys are long-lived. And you've been around for pretty much as long as anyone I've talked to can remember. But I get the sense that's not exactly what you were asking, right?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> At once sobering and unsurprising. And correct.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Then I'd say you look like a very good 80. Or a really bad 60.</p>\n<p><em>[O5-1 stops in the street by a large power pole, looking upward.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I was born in a Roma camp in Wales in 1880. I was at Verdun, and Gallipoli, and the Somme. I lived through the War to End All Wars, and another after that, not to mention the countless other conflicts scattered across Europe. I witnessed their hidden underbelly, the Occult Wars with their carnage left unseen and unknown by the world at large. Dying angels in no man's land, accursed weaponry and soldiers roused from the dead. I saw Robert Bumaro in the last message he ever left for the Foundation, and his was not a face of Machiavellian scheming. His was a face I am unfortunately familiar with seeing and wearing: a man terrified, able to see the world sliding into another Occult War, powerless to stop it.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh.</p>\n<p><em>[The pair resume walking down the street, passing sandstone buildings interlaced with fuladh. Minarets and spires jut out from the larger buildings, and the palace is visible in the distance.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Apologies. I prefer to keep my thoughts on the matter to myself. But yes. I think that Bumaro discovered something about the Abominate, whatever it is, that shook him to his core. I've seen too many men die not to say that, as a young man, if I had known what I know now\u2026 I would have done anything to protect the ones I love. I simply disagree with him about the means; I think the Foundation remains the best, the <em>only</em> vanguard against such a threat. But I am sure the threat is coming.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2026 a lot to take in. Fuck. Sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Quite alright. But now you see why we've taken this risk on the project, on you. Whatever the secrets of the Daeva are, we need them now more than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I know. But it's just\u2026 worrying?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Worrying?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It's a lot of pressure. I'm not\u2026 the kind of person built for leadership, honestly. I can't help but wonder if you're not better off choosing someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Perhaps. But it doesn't really matter.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Because you're who we chose, for better or for worse. You'll either live up to the task, or you won't. For what it's worth, I think you're doing fine. Though your face tells me you come to me with bad news.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I\u2026 yes, I do. The project is stalled, for lack of a better word. I'm sorry, I know this must be disappointing but-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You don't have to apologize to me, Dr. Galanis. I like you, and I do not consider your worth contingent on the success or failure of this mission as you seem to.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh! Um. Thank you. That's\u2026 very kind of you. I appreciate that a lot, actually.</p>\n<p><em>[O5-1 nods.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We're both historians. You remind me quite a lot of myself in younger years, in fact. Before I saw all the horrid depravity the world has to offer. You have the bright eyes of an optimist. Don't lose them. We shall need idealists in the Foundation in the times to come. But I digress. Apologies. Why is the project at a halt?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We just don't have anything to work from. There's almost no historical record, no analogous societies, no writings or sources. The most we've been able to do is work on analyzing the architecture and carvings throughout the city, but even that's limited because it's in far worse condition than\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS looks around at the recreation of Amoni-Ram.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> This.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I see. Do you have any idea what or where Korar is so far? If they <em>were</em> sister cities, perhaps the other is better preserved, contains something we can actually use.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm\u2026 afraid not, sir. I'm honestly not even sure it's a city at this point. We have ships scouring the other parts of the Indian Ocean on this sunken plateau, but..</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Unfortunate. Well, tell me what you have learned.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Daevic Covenant were\u2026 paradoxical. Like I said, about the only thing we can do is analyzing the murals, so that's what we've spent most of our time on. What we have is confusing. These people had an intense focus on the metaphysical and spiritual. Unsurprisingly, it seems like they were theocratic, given that the central citadel is both the temple and the palace, worshipping some\u2026 entity or greater power called the Scarlet.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I've never heard of such a thing.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That makes two of us. At first I thought it would be a blood god, and that's what a lot of the research committee still thinks.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> But you're not so sure.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Nope. I mean, it makes sense. They had a place for ritual human sacrifice in their society, they've got altars and obsidian knives and all kinds of carvings of people being split open to appease the Daeva spirits. But the depictions are\u2026 different than I've seen in other Asian and Mesoamerican societies. It's a joyful affair, and the sacrifices seem almost as pleased as the Daeva are to welcome them.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I suppose it's hardly reasonable to think all societies would view death as final, especially given the exposure to necromancy the Aegean Tablets suggest.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's true, but\u2026 I don't know. The depictions of the Scarlet are softer, more magnanimously indifferent than vengeful and demanding. Their art is complex, gentle and almost sensual. Their cities are magnificiently constructed. But at the same time, we know from the Mekhanites that they had a vast slave system enforced by magic, and that their anomalies were at least in part fueled by sacrifices. The committee is a bit split on it, frankly.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Interesting. Very interesting. But no indications as to what that magic was, exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Beyond something relating to horticulture, no. And similarly a lack of indications about their history as a society, including what happened to land them two miles underwater. The team doesn't know what to do. I feel like I've failed.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Oh, I wouldn't say that. You've done admirably, given the circumstances. It's just a difficult set of cards.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, thank you, sir. But still, I feel like I've exhausted all our conventional options.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Then do what the Foundation has always done in times of adversity: turn to the unconventional.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I thought about that. And I think I have an idea \u2014 but it's kind of\u2026 out there.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I spent my 30s and 40s advising the various paranormal organizations in Europe how to arm themselves using their countries' horrible, forgotten monsters and mythologies. \"Out there\" doesn't begin to faze me. What's your idea?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm going to need someone transferred to MKF-01.

I had the pleasure of witnessing the <em>Nautilus</em> surface once.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> His submarine.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Aye, a technological marvel the likes of which the world may never see again. The submarine was longer than many ships, and seemed natural, appearing as though carved from a single titanic block of junglewood but filled with engines, armor, and livery.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2026 oddly familiar. Did you ever go inside?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> If only. I should have liked to take tea with the good captain one evening to pick his mind, but he would have none of it.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> He had a deep-seated resentment in his heart for all Englishmen. I have never been particularly attached to my homeland, finding more solace in Darkest Peru than I do in Durham. But Nemo was of Indian descent, and held a chip in his shoulder over the Crown's dominion over his land. He felt that every well-born individual who had benefitted from the plundering of his homeland deserved nothing but scorn at the best. Which is why my polite offers to accompany his vessel to these purported Atlantean ruins were met with stony silence.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yeah, it says you were unable to go \u2014 but that you knew some who had gone, and heard word months later.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> That I did! My few contacts aboard the ship were unable to provide me much, fearing Nemo's rage. But I was told that they had found <em>something</em> far south of India on the seabed.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That lines up with what we know, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> The specifics were\u2026 murky at best, but through the grapevine it was whispered to me that some of the many spiritually-inclined men under Nemo's command had returned from the expedition shaken and disturbed. To a normal man, this may have meant nothing. But having studied with the Castor Monastery on the slopes of Makalu, it was clear to me that Nemo had them doing the art of projection.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm sorry, the art of what?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> With intense practice, meditation, and no small amount of psychotropic assistance, it is possible to enter into a fugue of sorts, during which the soul may depart the body and enter into the astral plane. The Castor Monks have spent centuries studying the existence of the astral plane and the vast mysteries contained therein, and have ascertained that it is a manner of reality blanketing our own, invisible to the naked eye but interweaving with all parts of daily life. Inhabited by\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Spirits?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Quite right! Sharp one, you are. I like you.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Appreciated. But I don't understand the relevance of this to Tha- I'm sorry, Captain Nemo's expedition.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> The nature of the astral plane is such that it is at once a reflection and a cause of our own material plane. Significant people, events, and even places can leave impacts and connections that persist long after the destruction of the physical form. The presence of poltergeists and djinns are a common example. But I digress: my theory is that Nemo, possessing no gift for the metaphysical arts himself but being the cunning fox that he was, attempted to use his crew to astral-project and discover the secrets of the Atlanteans. Of course his crew, being largely unrefined brutes, lacked the necessary finesse.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> And you elected to step in?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> I would have, and even began building a crew for the voyage! But only a month after this news came to my ears, another delectable piece of information caught my eye: Vladimyr Zolat had initiated a call to arms, for a Common Vampyre had been sighted east of the Ural mountains for the first time in more than three centuries. I could not miss out on the opportunity and Atlantis, like so many projects, fell to the wayside. I always intended to pick it back up, but somehow I can no longer muster the energy.</p>\n<p><em>[SCP-1867 wriggles.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's a real shame. I bet you would like to see it, hm?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Quite! To see if the legends are true of monumental towers powered by light and glass, of great sea-beasts bound into service, of bare-breasted tribal queens ruling with an iron fist, of-</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that the Foundation has an interest in Atlantis. Though you should probably know now that its proper name is Mamjul. We've located the ruins, but there's not much to see. After being stalled for a few months, I recently went over the records of the first person to discover Amoni-Ram, and noticed the references to some kind of psychic detachment. If you're prepared to share your knowledge of astral projection\u2026 I could probably convince my superiors to allow you to be on the first team.</p>\n<p><em>[SCP-1867 is silent for several seconds, apparently contemplating.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Very well. I, Lord Thomas Theodore Blackwood, Earl of Northumbria, will assist you in your endeavour. Together, we shall unlock the mysteries of Atlantis.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Mamjul.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Yes, that. Join me, we shall toast.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> \u2026 Appreciated, but I don't drink. My people will come collect you in the morning, Lord Blackwood.

The <em>Haffkine</em> docked with the <em>Phantom</em> and <em>Lillihammer</em> as part of MKF-01 on October 12th, and Psychotronics Division personnel quickly set up an ad-hoc lab and working center under the direction of Dr. Galanis and Senior Researcher Ada Crowley, with input from SCP-1867. Over the following month, almost every member of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative was subjected to a gauntlet of tests to determine their psychic potential. Those with the highest scores and sufficiently high Cognitohazard Resistance Values were inducted into a provisional Applied Task Force: Omicron Rho (\"Dream Team\").</p>\n<p>By mid-November, of the eighty-seven members of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, nine had been inducted into ATF Omicron Rho, including Lieutenant Lucian Greaves, Operator Ajay Desai, and Doctor Pandora Galanis. Foundation research into extrasensory perception had exploded since 1944 with the founding of the Psychotronics Division, and provided several advances (such as low telepathy, scrying, and limited divination) that were routinely used in various sectors of Foundation operations by 1971, though true astral projection remained out of reach. With the assistance of SCP-1867's expertise on the matter, Psychotronics Division personnel were able to train members of ATF Omicron Rho into being able to induce a fugue state that SCP-1867 affirmed would result in successful astral projection if performed under the influence of mnestic drugs.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Brain.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/rounderhouse-jade-proposal/Brain.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>LSAP Cadmus-Aram Deep-Brain Oneiric Parietal Stimulation Array.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Additionally, O5-1 requisitioned the LSAP Cadmus-Aram Deep-Brain Oneiric Parietal Stimulation and Recording Array, a one-of-a-kind prototype mechanism constructed by Dr. Hadley Cadmus and Dr. Robert Aram, when the latter was still employed by the Foundation for the Paratechnology Department. The device consisted of two separate portions: a medical implant of several electrodes inserted into brain tissue, leading out to a wire through the nape of the neck, and a computerized system to which the wire would be connected. The implant would stimulate brain tissue to produce a heightened state of awareness during dreams, and the computer would record sensations and visuals to produce as text.

The blood-mad N\u00e4lka of Black Aditum, the great dark necropolis borne of Mamjul's own sin and rent from the body of the High Slave, took arms against the Daeva in their zealotry to extinguish the life from the Flesh. And the Mekhanites of Amoni-Ram, in their arrogance and disdain for the natural laws of the world, took arms agains the Daeva in their zealotry to make themselves more than human. And in the hopes of saving their people, the Covenant took the magic of the jungle against their aggressors and waged whole war, war in every aspect, war in every element.</p>\n<p>Mamjul and Korar turned from peaceful metropoli to cities of war, and the Children of the Scarlet rushed out into the land, sorcerer-nawabs leading vast legions of Daeva and warriors and slave-soldiers into the cruelest faces of humanity. Of the north of the Daeva, once lay a dozen cities \u2014 now reduced to naught but ash and rubble over the course of the First War. The Zealots of Metal saw and learned the power of fire and lime, wielded freely against innocents, entire forests burned into cinders to deny the Daeva their home. Cities laid siege to, men bled, fuladh melted down into the very spears that would be driven through the bodies of the Mekhanites and into the wall of Mamjul, as a warning.</p>\n<p>And of the N\u00e4lka was an even more violent confrontation, for their Lord Iun was a hateful beast, and his mindless forces ran amok, stretching wildly from the east and raising those who died in war back again, denying their souls their eternal rest in Korar. Their massacres were devoid of purpose, killing for the sake of killing, with no artistry to their butchery, no respect for the inborn soul, only a simpleminded desire for the purity of rent flesh, empty vessels. The cities of the N\u00e4lka were torn from the ground by the great vines of the sorcerer-nawabs, sundering walls, laying waste to all who dared to interrupt the dance of the soul.</p>\n<p>And through all this, the three Cities lay unaware of the Wretch of the West, of its horde coming together, of the <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong> rising from the obscurity of a farming village to the head of the army of the damned. In our arrogance, we saw only each other \u2014 we dismissed the Fourth, who had been silently scheming for a thousand years, a vengeant eye watching the horizon, watching the rise of Amoni-Ram and Mamjul and Korar and Black Aditum, and casting a spectre of devastation upon the land as it made the slow, agonizing march to the great golden walls of the Gate of the West with only one thought in the mind of its prophet: death.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc10\"><span>Section 001.5</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc11\"><span><tt>KORAR RESEARCH</tt></span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT \u2014 JANUARY 2003</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abIN ATTENDANCE\u00bb</strong></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> D.

At ease, Lieutenant Greaves.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Hello! Hello, everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Sir.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Pandora. It's been a minute, hasn't it?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yes, and so much has happened\u2026 Can I ask where the rest of the Council is? I was, um, hoping to brief all of you at once.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It's rare for all of us to be able to attend a meeting; last time was an anomaly, if you'll excuse the pun. Don't worry. We'll make sure the others are updated.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Well, let's get on with it.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Yes. Not to rush you, Doctor Galanis, but the floor is yours.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Thank you. As you all know, approximately three weeks ago we conducted the first astral projection test as part of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative. We weren't really aiming for anything in particular \u2014 but like we ended up stumbling into Mamjul, we stumbled right into Korar. An entire city on the astral plane. Mamjul is dead, but Korar is more than alive, it's thriving.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Yes, yes, you told us this when asking for permission for a return trip. Get to the point, child.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Right. Well, the subsequent return trips have panned out <em>very</em> well. We've been in repeated contact with the Daeva, and have made some frankly astonishing inroads into developing an understanding of their culture. Our linguists have even constructed a preliminary model of the Daevic language \u2014 not that we desperately need it, we seem perfectly able to communicate on the astral plane. Our anthropologists are burning the candle at both ends interviewing and compiling the research.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> And you're on good terms with their\u2026 queen?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Rajmata, yes. I've been leading all the return trips and getting the other personnel acquainted with the process of projection, with the help of SCP-1867. Obviously we've had to suddenly expand the roster of the Dream Team\u2014 sorry, of Omicron Rho.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> <em>[Chuckles]</em> Dream Team. That's clever.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> The idea that the entire race has continued to exist for three thousand years isolated in\u2026 whatever this is. It boggles the mind.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The astral plane. A reality constructed entirely of dreaming minds. We haven't really been able to construct a scientific basis for it yet.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> All a bit mumbo-jumbo for me, frankly.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We've seen stranger things, Jean. What's your take on the situation so far, Doctor?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2026 a hard question to answer, sir. But we have things now that we didn't before: direction, and a primary source to get more knowledge from. The Rajmata has been really helpful with our researchers \u2014 mapping out the districts of Korar, explaining parts of her people's culture and how the Daeva <em>think</em>. Honestly, I think this is a breakthrough. On the same scale as the discovery of the Preserver entity in Amoni-Ram, if not bigger.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> And how well that went.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm not saying there aren't risks. I'm just \u2014 I'm saying that they're risks worth taking. We're all agreed in that we need what the Daeva have, right? There's an entire culture waiting for us to learn about them! History, anthropology, music, literature, and that's just the mundane aspects; we still don't know the kind of thaumuturgy they're capable of.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> We should be more focused on the latter. The humanities are important, but we're in Korar for one reason.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You can't\u2014 <em>[Sighing]</em> You can't try to understand what they're capable of without understanding what kind of a culture leads to that! It's like trying to understand American military technology without knowing anything about the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> True as that may be, I notice you haven't made much progress with determining the ultimate fate of the city.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Daeva are\u2026 hesitant to share that. I'm still trying to find out why.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I'll be frank with both of you. We've read the reports over the past few weeks, and heard your testimonies. And, of course, we have Alpha-1 reporting back to us. But this project has entered into a realm Amoni-Ram never did, quite literally. Our only exposure to Korar, to the Daeva still existing, to any of this is through the device inside your brain, Lieutenant Greaves.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> I can assure you that I saw everything with my own eyes\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I believe you, Lieutenant. That's not my point. My point is that you are now fully in uncharted territory. There are now dangers we likely don't even know about yet. There has been a not-insignificant push to have the Initiative cancelled, all personnel amnesticized, and the records sealed.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You \u2014 you can't do that!</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I think you know I can, Doctor. But I'm not going to. I told you, I'm a historian too. I still think that Mamjul and Korar hold incredible possibilities for the Foundation and for humanity, knowledge we need now more than ever. So we're not just letting the research continue, we're going to be offering new resources. More personnel, more support.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What's the catch?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Smart kid.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Going forward, Overwatch Command is going to be more involved in the Initiative. You'll still handle the day-to-day running, but Lieutenant Greaves acts with our authority, and is empowered to make executive decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I\u2014 But\u2014 <em>[Stuttering]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Is there a problem, Doctor?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> May I speak to you privately, Overseer?</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You're dismissed for now, Lieutenant.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Sir, if I could\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Dismissed, Lieutenant.</p>\n<p><em>[GREAVES steps off the Leyspace Communicator; his avatar dissolves into cloudy static before vanishing.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You don't trust Lieutenant Greaves?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It's not that! It's just\u2026 I don't know how useful more oversight is going to be. It's a little stifling, honestly. The researchers keep coming to me with complaints about the Alpha-1 operators impeding their work and it's bad for morale and it's just\u2026 I don't think the Lieutenant has the best interests of the Initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I suggest you speak to him to see if the security can be integrated into your workflow better. Remember that we chose you to be in charge of this project, Doctor \u2014 you're within your rights to speak to Lieutenant Greaves if you think there's an issue, you're not a hostage here. His team is there for your own protection. But Lieutenant Greaves has been working for us for 12 years. In that time I've never known him to be anything less than perfectly reasonable and deeply loyal. You've been given a chance; you should extend the same courtesy to others.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I know. I know. You're probably right. I'll try.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> That's all I ask. I'll see you next week to discuss requisition reports. And Doctor?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Sir?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Aktus was being crude, but he's right; we trusted the Preserver, and that ruined us. Keep a close eye on the Rajmata.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Understood, sir.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Good. You're dismissed for now.</p>\n<p><em>[Leyspace connection to: <tt>SITE-01</tt> terminated.]</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abEND LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The realization that the Daevic Covenant was not an extinct civilization caused a sudden shock to Mamjul-Korar Initiative personnel and leadership. Authorization was immediately sought from Overwatch Command to establish preliminary diplomatic relations with the Covenant, and granted on December 17th, 2002. In the three weeks following Projection #01, 16 return trips were made by MTF Omicron Rho personnel, which had been expanded from its original roster of nine to thirty-five. This was largely due to the Psychotronics Division successfully producing RL-023, an animatropic drug that considerably lessened the preparation and training needed for a successful astral projection while also allowing for perfect recall after awakening, for transcription. Prior to this, RL-023 had only existed theoretically in Dr. Hadley Cadmus' research notes.</p>\n<p>MTF Omicron-Rho's Projections #02 through #17 included personnel from every Division of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, and were focused on a number of immediate goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I) ascertain the anomalous capabilities of the extant Daevic Empire and their current nature of existence;</li>\n<li>II) establish diplomatic relations, if possible;</li>\n<li>III) arrive at a clearer understanding of the culture of the Daevic Covenant;</li>\n<li>IV) build a unified timeline of the Empire's fall, and establish the identity of the entity/group/party known as the Abominate;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat, the current ruling monarch of the Daeva, proved exceptionally receptive to diplomatic efforts and accomodating to Foundation personnel in Korar. An extensive Culture Briefing was compiled by the Anthropology Division with the assistance of the Rajmata and multiple visits to Korar.</p>\n<div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"toc12\"><span>Culture Briefing Excerpt</span></h4>\n<hr/>\n<h5 id=\"toc13\"><span><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><em>Societal Structure</em></span></span></h5>\n<p>The Daevic Covenant society is extremely rigidly caste-based, with roles in society occupied by dozens of complex interrelated castes. Broadly, they can be grouped into four categories. As with many ancient cultures, slaves occupy the bottommost rung of society, and are afforded few rights or luxuries. The Daevic Empire made extensive use of slaves in almost every line of work that could not be done through their arboromancy, from construction to agriculture to bureaucracy; we estimate that the Empire contained three slaves for every free citizen. This system was brutally enforced through both anomalous and mundane control methods and violence. Testimonies from the Daeva indicate that the mass-killing of slaves was regarded as a kindness, as it freed their immortal souls to join the population in Korar.</p>\n<p>Beyond the slaves, the castes were less rigidly separated. Freed laborers were afforded only a handful of rights above slaves. Merchants and artisans were in similar higher rungs of society, and soldier-nobles and sorcerers occupied the rung above them, being the landed aristrocrats. The topmost rung of society consisted of the matriarchs, or 'Scarlet brides', religious priestesses central to the Daevic religion (see \u00a7 State Religion). These matriarchs dictated almost every matter of society by interpreting the will of their god. In a break from most ancient cultures, one of these brides, the Rajmata, was the sovereign monarch of the Empire, rather than a male member of the landed gentry; she was considered married to the Scarlet Maharaja while it slept in Korar, and the embodiment of its will in Mamjul and on Earth, empowered to make all theocratic, military, and societal decisions for the Covenant.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - JANUARY 2003</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>SOURCE:</strong> Doctor Pandora Galanis\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[Following ingestion of RL-023 in the Psychotronics Lab aboard the</em> FCS Haffkine, <em>Doctor Galanis entered the fugue state associated with projection.

What are your methods of research?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Er, it can be many things. Primary sources \u2014 that is, someone who was there at the time \u2014 are the best, but aren't exactly easy to find in civilizations that are thousands of years old.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I see. Other than that?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Artifacts and text records are the next best thing. Stone tablets, writings, carvings, anything that gives us insight into how a people thought.

But that's quite alright. We have our limitations as well.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What are those?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> We cannot touch the material plane without acting through intermediaries. Through our chosen people. Once, this was the People of the Jungle. Now they are gone, and we are isolated to our home, waiting for someone to find us. But, returning to the point, Korar is a living, breathing city. But you have explored Mamjul, yes?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What little remains of it.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. Verily, a tragedy. You'll have noticed a distinct lack of the sources you mentioned.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, we didn't find any tablets, any writings, nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Why do you think that is?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The city's been two miles underwater for three thousand years, I assumed they'd all been destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Destroyed, yes. But not by nature. By man. And not just in Mamjul \u2014 in Korar, and in every other city. Once, we had libraries filled with chronicles of our histories. Now, as they were destroyed in Mamjul, so too have they been destroyed here. There are no longer any writings, anything <em>concrete</em> that proves we existed.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Wait, what? You've been\u2026 written out of time?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. This is the tragedy of the Daeva.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> How is that even <em>possible</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> To answer this would be to explain to you what happened in the First War. I do not trust you with that part of my people yet.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I\u2026 see. But that's insane. No offense, your grace. But the idea that there's no longer any record of your people, vibrant as it is\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS looks around Korar.

That's\u2026 I feel like I've heard this before.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> The Song of the Daeva. A musical arrangement that chronicles our entire history, from our conjoining with my Master, our God to the fall of Mamjul and the breaking of the Empire. Hundreds of verses, kept alive in our memories.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It's not written down anywhere?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It was, long ago. A great library in Mamjul once held a stone tablet transcribed with each verse. Scholars and sorcerers from across the Empire would undertake pigrimages to Korar to seek the wisdom of the Song.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> \u2026I think we found that library.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You found nothing more than blank slates and dead men. Now you see our shame. And why I hesitate to share it with you.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> This is all you have left.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. It is not just our history \u2014 it is our religion, our creation, our laws, our culture. It is the Daeva. Sharing it with outsiders is the purest baring of our soul as a people.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Wow. No, yeah, I understand.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> But you have something we desire as well. Knowledge of the world since Mamjul fell.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, we would be willing to share that if you were willing to return the favor.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Hm. I see.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's all I ask. You've been incredibly generous already. I feel bad asking.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Do not. You are far too skilled for the suffering you are undergoing.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What? I'm sorry?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You are a troubled soul, Galanis-hiyar. I did not become Empress Consort for my appearances alone.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I\u2014 yeah, I know. I've got a lot going on. There's a lot riding on this being successful. On me being successful.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You worry far too much for your age. Were all humans as you are\u2026 regardless, your offer is suitable, I think. But only for you.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Your fellows are intelligent, but they lack a certain level of wisdom and deftness that the Song demands. I will not allow them to take and pervert our history. I will translate it and share its meanings, but only with you.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Okay.

Even the most primary of primary sources face issues: translation problems, damaged or incomplete records, wholesale fiction being portrayed as fact to make long-dead kings look good.\n<p>I think I'm the first historian to actually have that wish granted.</p>\n<p>Even the Preserver in Amoni-Ram wasn't able to give Nussbaum much in terms of testimony \u2014 its mind was too fragmented. Most of their knowledge came from the Fuladh Throne. But now I have a living, if not breathing, record of the Daevic Empire. The Rajmata and I sat down three times over the past week for her to explain the beginning verses of the Song for me. It's amazing. It's incredibly complex. Imagine every symphony you've ever heard overlayed with an unspeakably complex poem hundreds of verses long. It's a perfect representation of their culture \u2014 I mean, I literally can't even make some of the sounds necessary, since it's crafted for Daeva vocal cords!</p>\n<p>The content is illuminating, too. We're still on the beginning verses, unfortunately \u2014 haven't been able to progress as quickly as I'd like. RL-023 aided projection has a pretty long cooldown time, about twice as long as the projection itself. And time passes <em>differently</em> in astral space, so it's hard to even tell whether the short conversation you had took eight minutes or eight hours. Every projection I've made has been followed by hours in recovery with the Psychotronics guys pumping me full of electrolytes and fluids. But god, the hours I do spend in the city.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I was saying, the beginning verses really just corroborate what we already knew. The creation myth mirrors that of Amoni-Ram quite closely \u2014 some kind of war or conflict between a pantheon of gods that resulted in all of them grievously wounding the others, and causing all of them to 'fall' to Earth. Though there is something notable: the Daeva reference <em>four</em> of these original gods, while the Mekhanites only acknowledge the existence of three. It has to have some connection to the Abominate. I just know it.</p>\n<p>I'm unspeakably excited, but I know I need to be careful. The Rajmata seems\u2026 friendly, but I'm not taking chances \u2014 getting my CRV checked every single day and limiting my projections. She knows more than she's letting on, I can tell that much. She hasn't explained why she greeted us into the city with 'welcome back', or what the hell she meant when she said she'd only share it with me. I don't trust her. Not yet. But I have to keep moving forward.</p>\n<p>I'm not letting this fall apart. Not again.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"toc16\"><span>Culture Briefing Excerpt</span></h4>\n<hr/>\n<h5 id=\"toc17\"><span><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><em>State Religion</em></span></span></h5>\n<p>The Daevic Empire was a strict theocracy with a strong focus on animism. The Daeva were considered nature spirits and immutable evidence of the validity of the Daevic religion, but they were not the central objects of worship by citizens of the Empire. Instead, this role was occupied by an entity-concept known by many names \u2014 the Slumbering God, the Scarlet Maharaja, the Khan of the Scarlet House, or simply the Scarlet. The consistencies are self-evident; all representations of the god are strong in nature, primal instinct, natural order, violent survival of the fittest.</p>\n<p>This entity, called the Scarlet here for simplicity's sake, was one of the gods cast down to the Earth when a war split the pantheon, landing in what is now the middle of the Indian Ocean but at the time was a lush jungle subcontinent. It became the king and sworn god of the nature spirits, and eventually connected these spirits with the fledgling tribal humans living on the subcontinent, by taking a human 'avatar' and forming the Daevic Covenant. This avatar is suggested to be an unspeakably powerful sorcerer, with abilities suggesting at least a Type-4 Class Blue entity \u2014 but is asleep, with their dreams forming the foundations for Korar's continued existence and the Empire's successful conquests. Put simply, the Scarlet is the cosmic representation of the concepts of brutal primality, and the Scarlet Maharaja is its prophet in human form.</p>\n<p>The religion of the Daevic Empire was one of unwavering, zealous commitment to the Scarlet Maharaja, as their dreams allowed for the continuation of the Empire. The systematic manifestion of this were the Scarlet Brides, an imperial cult of handmaidens, attendants, and priestesses (though many were also male or androgynous) that were considered literally wedded to the Scarlet Maharaja. Their favored wife among the Brides was the Rajmata, the queen ruling in their stead until the Maharaja awoke from his dream when the Daeva had conquered the entirety of Asia for them.</p>\n<p>Hymns, magic, and sacrifices formed the basis of Daevic worship. Hymns and associated dances occupied a central place in Daevic culture and complex dances were a way to honor their god, and use of the magic gifted to humans by the Scarlet was a holy act in and of itself, with sorcerers akin to religious preachers. Human sacrifice was a core part of Daevic worship \u2014 it is estimated that over the thousand years of the Empire's existence, well over forty million people were sacrificed, most with religious intent in specially-constructed pits and many being children.. This was not seen as a cruelty by the Empire, as killing a human member of the Empire was believed to allow them to reincarnate as a Daeva in Korar, a more fulfilling and eternal life \u2014 but the fact is that the Empire practiced a level of brutal human sacrifice and slavery on a scale completely unprecedented in ancient history.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Over the following weeks, Doctor Galanis continued to sit in private sessions with Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat. Through these, several assumptions that Nussbaum Model had made regarding the parahistorical element to the Bronze Age Collapse were challenged and clarified.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - FEBRUARY 2003</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>SOURCE:</strong> Doctor Pandora Galanis\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[GALANIS re-enters the dream, after an hour spent on an electrolyte IV in the Psychotronics lab.

The latent noises of Korar's hustle and bustle far below seem to melt away, leaving only the slight shifting of the leaves. Then the RAJMATA begins to sing.

Instead of the abstract starry void of the astral plane, the tree now looks out over a city on Earth, with lush green farmland stretching into the jungle beyond the gigantic stone walls. It is a mirror image of Korar's triangular shape. The open-air markets that make up the northern portion of the city are still present, but now they contain both humans and Daeva living and interacting side-by-side and filling the streets. Huge multi-legged beasts of burden move throughout the city, mounted by both humans and Daeva in elaborate robes and headdresses.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Is this time\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. The astral plane is a land of dreams, formed of the mind of the Sleeping Scarlet \u2014 my master.

I was the last Rajmata of the Daevic Covenant, and this is how I choose to remember my city and the Daeva.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> But those are humans down there, not just Daeva. You lived side by side.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> 'Daeva' is simply a word \u2014 in your tongue, the best meaning would be 'chosen people'. The Scarlet named us this when she became our king-of-kings. In turn, we named the tribes of the land this when we chose to become one with them under the Covenant. The people, the spirits, the Empire, the magic \u2014 all are Daeva, all are the Children of the Scarlet, all are one.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Look out, and see Mamjul at its summit. The peak of a civilization, the jewel of an empire that spanned the length of Asia. Food, knowledge, history, art. And of course, magic. All of it passed through Mamjul and from Mamjul, Korar. All are one.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS watches the activity below. A team of Daeva and humans work to repair a fallen building. A man dressed in red-green robes slams a staff against the ground, and vines erupt out, lifting gigantic blocks of hand-carved stone from out of the hands of a contingent of human slaves.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> This doesn't look at all like a city at war.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It is not. This is nearly seven hundred years before the sorcerers on the distant reaches of the Empire first informed us of the dreaded Golden Wave.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Golden\u2014 <em>Ah.</em> The Mekhanites.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> If that is what you choose to call them, then yes. The Mekhanites. A chauvinistic people from the Western desert, zealots of Mekkan, the Sister of the Scarlet.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Then this has to be over a thousand years before you were Queen. How can this be your memory?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It is not my memory; it is my <em>dream</em>. A dream inspired by the soul of the previous Rajmatas, whom I carried with me then and carry even now. I hear, see, speak to them.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> They had something like this in Amoni-Ram. A throne that would allow anyone to see in the eyes of a previous Emperor of the Bumaro Dynasty.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Hmph. Artifice, borne out of a misguided obsession with improving oneself. All of Amoni-Ram's vast treasures were rubble and lost memories by the end of my reign. <em>[Sigh]</em> But for that matter, so were Mamjul's.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> So what's so important about this day, this memory?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Look. Look to the gate.</p>\n<p><em>[At the far gate of the city, a large party is assembled. Hundreds of horses and other unknown beasts packed with supplies and wagons wait beyond the gates, and several humans and Daeva are saying goodbye to others inside. Many more slaves are assembled alongside them, naked and bare in the sun.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Our first attempt at establishing a colony far beyond the bounds of the Empire, another eye from whence our Scarlet Maharaja might see and arise to take stock of the world that was Theirs. Two thousand beasts and men, and twice as many slaves to carry the honor of the Children of the Scarlet. The expedition, prepared for years. The leaders assembled, with great artisans, merchants, general, sorcerers, nawabs, all walks of life, and sent out into the far emptiness of the East, towards the Endless Sea. They leave today.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> There was another city of the Daeva?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. After they left the bounds of the Empire, we never hear from them again. Not for eight hundred years.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Wait. Wait, the Aegean Tablets mention this. Black Aditum, the city of the N\u00e4lka, was originally a slave colony. This\u2026 this is them?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. Today, you witness the birth of our blood enemies. Among those two-thousand slaves, one is a mere boy who will take the name I\u016bn and lead an insurrection. He will become the Scourge of the Coast, High Lord of the N\u00e4lka, Yaldabaoth's Prophet. He is a slave, and his parents were slaves. His hatred for us is inborn, and will cause millions to perish.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Good god.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Nothing is alone. Everything is of two sides. The greatest peaks of our Empire are counterbalanced by the creation of the Red Death. All is one.

People like me exist.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> They do. They are a rarity, but they do. I suppose we shall see. I will allow this intrusion.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Thank you, your Grace.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It is time to see the truth.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Are we entering the dream again?</p>\n<p><em>[Rather than answer, the RAJMATA bows her head and begins to sing, with her handmaidens joining in the chorus. The song is slow and grand, deep sweeping notes and movements in an impossibly deep tone. Gradually, the surroundings of Korar melt away, the Daeva replaced with busy markets of humans and Daeva shoulder-to-shoulder.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> I see what you mean.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Woah.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We're not going to the top this time?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. There is something you must understand before you continue forward blindly. You tell me you went to Amoni-Ram, that you spoke with a surviving automaton of theirs.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yeah.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> Well, not me personally, but the Foundation did.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> And what did it tell you about the Gods?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That there were three. Mekhane, your Brother Scarlet, and an unnamed deity that the N\u00e4lka worshipped.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It lied to you. There are four. There have always been four corners to balance the world.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> The Abominate.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It has many names. We refer to it as the Wretch. I believe the N\u00e4lka called it the First Apostate, in their infinite arrogance. Its true name cannot be spoken, but we accept its existence. The Mekhanites did not until it was upon their borders, and by then, it was far too late.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What <em>is</em> it?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> What I can say is limited. But I will tell you what I know. I. Now, look.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA turns and enters the tunnel leading into the Citadel. The group follows. The interior of the tunnel is lighted with small fires lit at the tips of darkened vines. The firelight reveals a complex carving engraved into the walls of the tunnel. The nearest portion is similar to the one first observed on the exterior of the Citadel in Mamjul \u2014 a large glyph of a tree, with many figures now recognizable as Daeva and humans dancing and interacting around it, under the watchful eyes of a large red-painted androgynous entity.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Scarlet.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. I have already told you of this, of how the Covenant came to be with the hopes of one day arousing our Sleeping God after we had delivered the world to him as a gift. Of how the Red Maharaja was selected by the Scarlet as her champion after he fell from the Heavens.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Right, yes. That actually leads into a question I wanted to ask\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Speak.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, the Scarlet is the primal concept of nature, and the Maharaja is its chosen prophet. But the Scarlet is\u2026 a spirit, right? Just an incredibly powerful one, a god.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I guess my question is where the Scarlet is. Where the Scarlet Maharaja is. Physically.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA stops and looks at GALANIS strangely.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> The Scarlet is present all around us.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Right, I know, but like\u2026 Amoni-Ram was constructed on the back of Mekhane, made of her parts, physically.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I think I understand what you are asking. Whether there is a place you can speak to my master.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I guess so, yeah.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA places a hand against the tree.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Such a place exists, but the reliquary of my master must be protected. It is his dream that allows Korar to exist. To open him to an outsider would be\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I am sorry, but I cannot allow it. For your sake as well as his. It would be like placing sand in a raging river. The sand is obliterated, and the river tainted.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yeah, okay. I understand.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> But as you mention Amoni-Ram being built off the back of their goddess\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[The Rajmata stepped forward, pointing to a new portion of the carving. This one depicted a large, infinitely complex feminine entity partially buried under sand dunes, looked on by a man the fraction of her size.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> <em>Mekhane</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> And the first Bumaro.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. This was the pattern. Four gods, four prophets, four corners to the earth, four empires. One war. All is one. Our Gods are grand creatures, but they demand vessels for their power.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS moves to the other side of the tunnel. This carving is substantially less detailed, and looks almost haphazard. It might depict some form of four-legged creature laying face down in a gargantuan grave or pit, surrounded by onlookers.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> This one\u2026 is this Iun?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Our best approximation. We know very little about what exactly Iun discovered when he founded Black Aditum. He was a secretive, vindictive animal. We understand it was a god of flesh, but that it did not choose him as its avatar. Not willingly.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What does that mean?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I wish I knew, Galanis-hiyar. These are renderings of rumours of legends of myths. The truth may have been nothing like this.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> History in a nutshell.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Then\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[The group moves to the last of the four large carvings near the entrance. In stark contrast to the others, this one shows only a single smooth, featureless circle on the wood wall.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> The Wretch. As I said, what I can say is\u2026 limited.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I am powerful, but I am not a god. There is binding magic that surpasses even ours.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Someone sealed your ability to talk about it?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> It's not unheard of. There are anomalous contracts, geases, that take away your ability to talk about something. But something on this scale\u2026 I can't imagine the kind of power it would take.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I imagine who and why are also bound.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Unfortunately. What I can say is that the Wretch was once a god, just the same as Mekkan and the Sleeping Scarlet and whatever Iun found. But it was cast out long, long before the First War. Thrown deep into the seas of the West, beyond the edge of the world, to drown forevermore.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> What did it do?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> The First Sin. I don't know what it is. But it was the introduction of disorder into a perfectly balanced universe. The first vestiges of chaos.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Jesus.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Okay, so \u2014 wait. The Mekhanites didn't recognize the legitimacy of the Wretch or the Abominate or whatever, <em>or</em> your gods. They rationalized Mekhane as the only legitimate deity. But you guys\u2026 do?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> We don't pledge our allegiance to the Sleeping Scarlet because they are innately supreme over their brethren. We do it because they have protected us, uplifted us, provided for us. We swear fealty because we choose to. It is a partnership.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> A covenant.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You see now. All is one.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> But the others don't follow that belief.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. Which is why the First War was inevitable. Look.</p>\n<p><em>[The scene changes. The group and the RAJMATA are now standing on the battlements of the northern wall. Outside the gates, a gargantuan group has been assembled \u2014 at least hundreds of thousands of Covenant, both human and Daeva, gathered into camps. They are heavily armored with wood similar to the one the Citadel is formed from, and are supported by cavalry forces of thousands of four-legged beasts. Elaborately dressed sorcerers command each regiment as they begin to organize and march.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Another expedition?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> No. This is an army. Armies, even.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> Look up.</p>\n<p><em>[In the far distance, over the thick treeline and expansive jungle, several thick plumes of smoke are visible rising into the sky.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You will see the war as I saw it.</p>\n<p><em>[The scene changes rapidly. A desert battlefield, littered with the corpses of hundreds of Mekhanites, their metal limbs torn from their bodies by Daeva scouring the field. A large Daevic city set alight by Mekhanite napalm, burning to the ground in a raging inferno as women run screaming and carrying their children. The corpses of Daeva and Mekhanites being puppeteered across a strait by N\u00e4lka necromancers, forming a living body of bridges to allow their abominations to cross over to the crippled Daeva force on the other side.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> <em>[Under his breath]</em> Jesus fucking Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> This is\u2026 carnage.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> It's war.</p>\n<p><em>[The scenes continue rapidly shifting. Daevic sorcerers raising vines to tear through N\u00e4lkan infantry, reducing them to bloody tatters of rotten flesh. Prisoners of war being massacred on altars as human sacrifices. Mass graves and killing fields.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Please. Stop.</p>\n<p><em>[The scenes abruptly stop and melt away. The group are once again at the top of the Tree. DESAI and GALANIS are holding their heads. GREAVES is not.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You see now. Has any war of yours held a candle to the carnage?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Maybe a couple. We have a saying. War is hell.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> War is hell. Apt. And one must consider that it was all pointless.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI:</strong> All that was for <em>nothing?</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> While we waged this brutal, continent-spanning war, the Wretch was coming. We had no idea it had built up its forces in the Far West, after dragging itself out of the sea. A horde that dwarfed our armies, led by an undying general-prophet \u2014 the <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong>. And it was dragging itself across the face of Africa, bathed in blood and worship and chaos, to Amoni-Ram, the Gate of the West. For vengeance.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abEND LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"toc18\"><span>Culture Briefing Excerpt</span></h4>\n<hr/>\n<h5 id=\"toc19\"><span><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><em>Thaumaturgy &amp; Magic</em></span></span></h5>\n<p>Without active practitioners of the Daeva school of magic, it's difficult to make confident statements about its nature, especially in the framework of modern thaumaturgy which relies heavily on objective, metaphysical measurement. However, through Doctor Galanis' sessions with the Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat and 141 interviews conducted on Daeva by members of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, much information has been assembled.</p>\n<p>The first, and perhaps most important point, is that the magic the Daeva used was <em>not</em> simply herbomancy (the magic of manipulating plant life). More broadly, the Daeva practiced animancy, in line with their philosophies that everything in the world had a soul, the only difference being whether it was on the astral or the material plane. The Daeva are self-identified spirits of nature, which is why the vast majority of Daeva magic focuses on plants and wildlife, but this is a choice, not a limitation.</p>\n<p>Several Daeva have attested to more esoteric uses of their magic than conjuring aggressive, hostile plant life and the encouragement of agriculture. Mamjul was once host to a university of <em>kallya</em>, scholars we would now liken to alchemists, chiefly concerned with encouraging the development of life to serve the Daeva. The most visible examples of this are the exotic many-legged beasts of burden observed in Korar and in Mamjul by Doctor Galanis \u2014 but this university also produced what we would now call bioweapons, highly-aggressive viral infections that could cause both anomalous and mundane damage on organic tissue. These infections would be loaded into glass vessels and catapulted into besieged cities.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>As with most forms of animancy, the 'magic' was in fact a contract of exchange between the spirit and the caster. Given the close bond that most spirits (the Daeva) and the casters (the humans they were bonded with) had, there was no incentive to outsmart and/or betray the caster as with djinns. Instead, the price was paid through the ritual blood sacrifice of a third-party \u2014 usually a slave or later, prisoner of war. Magic was used in nearly every aspect of Covenant society, from the management and control of slaves (pheromone-based hypnotics) to construction and expansion (accelerated tree growth into the desired structures) to war (physical bonding of Daeva to Covenant soldiers).</p>\n<p>As the Daeva supplying the spiritual power clearly still exist, there are no physical barriers preventing adequately-trained thaumaturges from studying and using Daeva magic.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MARCH 2003</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>SOURCE:</strong> Lieutenant Lucian Greaves, MTF Alpha-1\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As this transcript was originally produced by the subject's thoughts, certain sections may be nonclinical.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[GREAVES opens his eyes.

The memories I wish to show you\u2026 they occupy a wounded space in my mind. They hurt to think of, much less display to others. And I have not felt such strong emotion in a very, very long time.

I shouldn't have pulled something out without confirming either. This is obviously a sensitive topic for you, understandably.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I imagine that what the automaton told you was what the Mekhanites had written as the walls of Amoni-Ram toppled. The maddened, desperate rationalizations of how the most advanced people in the world had fallen. Surely it could only be if their worst enemies had banded together despite the centuries of conflict and bitter hatred, for then they could paint themselves as martyrs.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> History is just a matter of perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Another wise platitude. The flawed perspective of the Broken Empire was the one you were fed. Nothing more than revisionism, intended to make themselves noble in their own histories. Even with the walls of their greatest city sundered and the enemy at the gates, they expected their empire to live on in the other Rams. Pure hubris.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Then tell us what actually happened. Give us your side of the story.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA lowers her head and begins her chant. Once again, the branches of the tree melt away, swirling into colors, forming a new scene. The brown and green become beige and golden yellow. Over the chanting, the image solidifies: the group is on a sand dune overlooking a huge war encampment. Tens of thousands of Daevic soldiers and beasts of war, gathered around bonfires and tents. In the distance, Amoni-Ram burns. Its walls lie nearly cracked open, the huge gates sheared. Fires of all kinds and sizes dot the skyscrapers and minarets, and a thick plume of smoke hovers over the city. Another army, this one too far to make out, crowds the eastern gate.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh, man.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> There was never any alliance between us and the N\u00e4lka. I know not why they came to Amoni-Ram that day \u2014 but I sense it was for the same reason as I. We saw the signals; I heard a whisper, one of the sought-after signs from the Sleeping Scarlet of something he sees in his dream. A portent of things to come, and it told me that Amoni-Ram would fall not to me, not to Iun, but to a face not seen in a thousand thousand years, and it would fall on this night. I ordered the armies to march posthaste. I expect Iun received a similar portent, through whatever unholy magic he practices, of bone and fortune.</p>\n<p><em>[She sighs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It was already fallen when we arrived.</p>\n<p><em>[GREAVES turns to the RAJMATA.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> You sound\u2026 sad. I thought you and the Mekhanites were blood enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> We were. But it was a conflict that we knew, and that we understood. We were evenly matched \u2014 horns locked, none of us could destroy the other, and none of us would betray our allegiances with the notion of a truce.</p>\n<p><em>[She sighs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Do not misunderstand me: the Mekhanites were as much of a warlike blight to us as the N\u00e4lka. But I am not too proud to admit that Amoni-Ram was a center of learning, knowledge, and progress that rivalled even Mamjul. The razing of the city did not just put your people back a thousand years. It directly led to the fall of my own. For that, I must lament.</p>\n<p><em>[They all look back at the city. With a slow shearing noise audible even from their distance, one of the huge skyscrapers splits and collapses.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> My scouts corroborated that there was a huge force of N\u00e4lka on the other side, and we assumed Iun had devised some black magic that could take the city. Fools that we were, we thought that the third army was the dead, raised by the N\u00e4lka. We knew that the treasures of Amoni-Ram would be a great boon to whoever seized them, and we <em>could not</em> allow the N\u00e4lka to seize them. My generals made the decision: once the gates fell, we would march in and loot the city.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh, god.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> So we did. By morning, the walls fell, and our armies moved in. We expected resistance but this\u2026. this was chaos.</p>\n<p><em>[The scene cuts to a rooftop in Amoni-Ram. The streets are littered with corpses, and fires burn in every direction.

The N\u00e4lka necromancers move through the streets, raising dead civilians to join the fray.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> A massacre. And do you see who benefitted from it? Why the Three-Prong Army didn't try to occupy the city after bringing down the walls?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> The Wretch. It was letting you tear each other apart. Leave yourselves wounded and open for the killing blow.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> We walked right into it. I'm sure Iun thought the exact same thing, that I had brought down the walls and was going to seize the city. We massacred each other, all while the <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong> watched.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You keep mentioning that name \u2014 what is that? Why does it <em>sound</em> like that?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Names have power. Some more so than others. The <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong> was the Wretch's chosen \u2014 as Bumaro was with the Metal, as Iun was with the Flesh, as my master was with the Scarlet. To lead its armies, to destroy the world in its name. He was a man in flesh, but a monster in soul. He could shape reality like sand in his fingertips; a demon amongst men. His atrocities <em>only began</em> with the rape of Amoni-Ram. Hark.</p>\n<p><em>[The scene shifts once again to a distance away from Amoni-Ram. Half the Daevic army is still at the encampment. Suddenly, a low-pitched drone fills the air, growing steadily louder. The soldiers quickly get to their feet, pulling their weapons and looking around. The droning grows louder and louder, and just as it hits its crescendo, the towers and spires of Amoni-Ram vanish.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Ah. There it is. Mekhane's Grace.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You say you've visited Amoni-Ram. What happened to it? Why did it disappear, taking half my army and crippling my forces?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It was a superweapon. The last-ditch efforts of the Mekhanites, meant to transport the entire city away in the blink of an eye if it were ever besieged.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> What? Transported where? Are they alive?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It didn't work, not how it was supposed to. It moved the city into a pocket dimension and killed everyone and everything inside. Amoni-Ram was utterly ruined.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Oh. I\u2026 I see.</p>\n<p><em>[She leans back lowering her head and whispering.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> What're you doing?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Offering a quick prayer for the departed, to my master. A part of me always held out hope\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> We understand.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We're sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It is not your crime to apologize for. But you see now.</p>\n<p><em>[They look at the empty spot where Amoni-Ram once was.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I was crippled. <em>We</em> were crippled. We hobbled the long march home, disorganized and routed. But what weighed heaviest on my mind was not my lost soldiers or the fate of the city. It was that the Wretch, hated enemy of the gods, demon of demons, had returned.

And in this it was victorious; for it had slaughtered the Grand Armies at Amoni-Ram, routing the men and spirits of the Daeva from the battlefield, sending them into a desperate retreat through the thickets and undergrowth, to Mamjul, to salvation.</p>\n<p>And so it was that the armies of the Daeva were forced to abandon their peoples, their sacred charge and those of their children, as they formed a great mass, marching ceaselessly towards their stronghold, the ancestral home of the Daeva, where they could mount a defense. But as with all things, such decisions are rooted in sacrifices of blood, of honor, of duty. And the ultimate sacrifice was made a hundred times over. Loyal soldiers left to their devices against the chaos of the horde, knowing their deaths inevitable, taking solace in the fact that their deaths might preserve their afterlifes.</p>\n<p>Because it was understood that were the <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong> to lead his armies across the isthmus and into Mamjul, he would lay siege to the city, and break it just as he had broken Amoni-Ram. The slaughter would be wholesale and complete, and not only of the material plane. For were the Three-Prong Army to bring down the walls of Mamjul, to seize the Tree, they would tear apart the roots seeking the original gift of the Scarlet, the source of the Maharaja's power. And should they take it from his sleeping corpse, he would crumble away to nothingness, robbed of his immortality. And as he crumbled, so too would the dream he dreamt, and Korar with it.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc20\"><span>Section 001.7</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toc21\"><span><tt>LATER RESEARCH</tt></span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>On April 11th, following several months of cooperative research from all teams of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, the first revision of the Daevic Empire Cultural Briefing was finalized.

Don't leave us in suspense!</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS smiles.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Mhm. After six months, several hundred interviews with the Daeva, and thousands of hours of research and cultural study by every member of the Initiative\u2026 I've transmitted the final draft of the Cultural Briefing, all nine-hundred-fifty-four pages of it, to Overwatch Command as of 8:02 this morning.</p>\n<p><em>[The room bursts into cheers and claps.

You guys did an amazing job \u2014 none of us knew what we were getting into when we made the first dive into Mamjul, but you've all handled the impossible job with an exceptional air of professionalism and duty. It's you guys that made this possible.

The Briefing is a pretty exhaustive look at the culture and anthropology of the Daeva, but our historians still have a lot of work ahead of us. Additionally, I was informed by the Council that we'll be seeing some new faces within the week \u2014 a crew of researchers from the Applied Thaumaturgy Division are being flown out.</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI (DIVE):</strong> We're getting wizards?</p>\n<p><em>[A polite chuckle rings out.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I think they're technically mages, but yeah.

I mean, hell, we wrote it! The Daeva aren't exactly a squeaky-clean culture.</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> Such a thing doesn't exist.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> Sure, but like\u2026 you guys didn't find it weird or creepy when these huge creatures started talking about sacrificing their slaves?</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> It was not <em>enjoyable</em> but one needs to keep an open mind about such things. They are from three thousand years ago; slavery and sacrifice being taboo are modern luxuries.</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> Such things were ubiquitous in the ancient world.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Yeah, but we're not <em>in</em> the ancient world, are we?</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> The Daeva are.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> You guys seriously don't see anything fucked up about this? I <em>wrote</em> the section where we talk about finding the sacrifice pits in Mamjul. They were a brutal, militaristic culture.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> Yeah. Just because they existed back then doesn't mean they're exempt from judgement.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Four hundred thousand people died in the construction of the Great Wall of China. Countless thousands of slaves in the construction of the Pyramids. We cannot apply our modern moral axioms to the actions of kings from a thousand years before democracy was even thought of.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Even if that was true, you still have to face the fact that they did awful things. Like, boss, the Rajmata showed you the atrocities during the war.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I mean, yes, but those were mutual atrocities. The First War was rife with them from all sides.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> That doesn't mean that they're not guilty of doing terrible things.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> As though we're any different? Consider how many people die in pointless resource wars or terrorism or senseless acts of violence every day.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Dude, are you serious? Yeah, I think our culture is a little better than the people sacrificing kids to the blood god.</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> Are you <em>trying</em> to be reductive?</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> I don't totally agree with Levi, but like, you guys do recognize what you're excusing, right? Their morals haven't changed \u2014 I bet if you went in and asked any one of them right now, they'd still tell you that yeah, enslaving 'lesser creatures' is okay.</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> We're approaching this from an anthropological perspective. Just because I find some things morally reprehensible doesn't mean I get to cast judgement over an entire culture. That's no basis for scholarly research.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS raises their hands.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Okay, look, everyone, I think we may have gotten a little too close to the subject of the research here-</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> I do not believe getting close to the subject is always bad. Your close relationship with the Rajmata is the only way we have learned so much about the Daeva to begin with.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2014 I mean, yeah, you're right, but like, our work requires a little distance to be able to remain impartial.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> The Daevic language has forty different words for 'religious torture'. We've spent the better part of a year studying these things. Are you really telling me the image you've gotten isn't one of a brutal theocracy? How can you be impartial about that?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Look, I'm not saying that either. I think this has gotten a little heated\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>ABERER (ANTH):</strong> Then what <em>are</em> you saying, Doctor?</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Whose side are you even on?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I- I-</p>\n<p><strong>DESAI (DIVE):</strong> Back the fuck off.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>DESAI (DIVE):</strong> I'm serious.

You guys are all only here because Pan stuck up for you to the Council, or all of your asses would've been behind desks months ago. Show a little goddamn respect.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS raises a hand.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It's alright. It's an emotional day, people are high-strung. It's okay. You guys are dismissed. You'll get your research directives on your terminals.</p>\n<p><em>[The team leads quietly file out of the room, avoiding eye contact with each other.

It's jarring. I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, Karl and Vijay are right. The one thing they hammer into you throughout your undergrad, graduate school, doctoral work, your career, is that trying to apply modern moral conceptions to ancient cultures is foolish. That's how ethnocentrism starts. Our modern morals are a product of an exceptionally high quality of life, wealth, and lifespan. The Daeva didn't have that. Like almost all ancient empires, their culture was built off the back of a gargantuan apparatus of slavery, imperialism, and state violence.</p>\n<p>But at the same time\u2026 it's a unique situation, right? The Daeva aren't ancient. Well, they are, but they're not <em>extinct</em>. It's not like you're talking about the Egyptian slavery system, where everyone involved has been dead for thousands of years. The Daeva still exist, and Yijun is right. They still hold these beliefs. The Rajmata certainly does.</p>\n<p>Everything is a matter of perspective. Whether the Daeva are a product of their time or a warlike empire\u2026 maybe both. It's more complicated than that. It's so complicated. I think we might have gotten a little close to the subject of research here. We had to immerse ourselves in the culture to learn what we did, but I'm not sure we've learned what immersing ourselves has done to our own perspectives.</p>\n<p>Not to mention the fact that we still need to figure out what happened to the Covenant after Amoni-Ram fell. This new stuff about the Three-Prong Army and the Abominate/Wretch and the Blackstar\u2026 I'm looking through all our databases and plenty of mundane academic ones. I've come up entirely dry.</p>\n<p>Except for one thing. Vijay caught it: the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. The basis for the mythology of the Sea Peoples. An unidentified culture group that sweeped through and laid waste to Asia Minor, Egypt, and the rest of the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age Collapse. We have no records of who they were or how they managed to annihilate a slew of powerful military states, just some Egyptian writings that prove their presence in the region.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Shardana.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/jade/Shardana.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>An engraving of the Sea People from the mortuary temple.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>But the Rajmata mentioned the Wretch had 'crawled out of the sea' and quietly built an army that proceeded to steamroll over every other culture on its way to Amoni-Ram. Writings in Amoni-Ram and the Rajmata's testimony indicate that the Three-Prong Army came out of North Africa, and the Sea Peoples would have had to push through Egypt if they wanted to get to Amoni-Ram. It's not perfect, and the evidence is circumstantial, but it's something.</p>\n<p>Though it raises two more questions that have been nagging at me. The first: what happened to the historical records of the Wretch? If a culture really did sweep through North Africa and then obliterate half of Asia, there <em>has</em> to be some kind of archaeological record of it! It doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p>And the second: why would Robert Bumaro be so terrified of something from three thousand years ago?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Despite the finalization of the Culture Briefing, the primary goal of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative remained to construct an accurate timeline leading to the fall of the anomalous empires and identify the Abominate/Wretch.

What was their deal?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> They scorned our magic. Not just that of the Daeva; all of ours. The N\u00e4lka, the Mekhanites as well.

They were too powerful for me to split my forces.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> You recalled the armies to Mamjul?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. Not to Mamjul. To Thijam, a smaller city on a narrow isthmus, forming the link between our peninsula and the mainland.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> A choke point.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. The Three-Prong Army was far larger than mine. I had to reduce their numbers, so I elected to trap them at Thijam. But that took several months of full retreat. Our armies scavenging the land for sustenance while running, tails tucked between their legs, from Amoni-Ram back to the homeland. But if we didn't offer any resistance, the faster and lighter armies of the Wretch would catch up. With no supply trains, no civilians, nothing weighing them down\u2026 they would catch up, and they would massacre us.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Oh, no.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What is it? I don't understand?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> It was a feigned retreat. But she had to leave behind just enough soldiers to put up resistance and prevent the pursuing force from catching up. No chance of victory, just buying time and hoping the main force escapes.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Abandoning entire armies to the wolves.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> They were sacrifices. They knew this. Thousands of soldiers, left behind in abandoned settlements as pockets of resistance. They were little more than bumps in the road. The Wretch washed through from the desert, pushing through the last vestiges of the Mekhanite territory before smashing into our own.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA sighs, and looks at the carnage occurring past the tree line.

It switches to a similar scene in a more temperate jungle that is aflame. The Covenant and the Three-Prong Army clash amidst thick foliage and underbrush set on a rapidly-spreading fire. Charred bodies litter the ground, and a number of Daeva are covered in fire eating away at them. It switches to a wide, flat desert plain, with a number of Covenant soldiers forming a defensive line of thick shields. A huge force of Wretch cavalry on massive black horses crash into the waiting phalanx and shatter it, routing the army. The Abominate's forces lay siege engines against the walls of a settlement, leaping over the battlements while artillery barrages the defenses. Dozens of scenes like this play out.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> He destroyed my Empire long before he took Mamjul. We abandoned cities, people, spirits, everything to the horde.

Slaves would man vessels from sunup to sundown, bringing in their catch to be sold. There was an annual festival, wherein the catch would be slaughtered along with a number of slaves, their blood mixing and pouring into the sea, making the surf run red with blessings. This tiny strip of land connected us to the mainland, allowed us to trade with the fledgling city-states of your people.</p>\n<p><em>[In fast-forward, a large, disorganized party of Daevic soldiers arrive from the north and make camp on the southern side of the isthmus. They are followed in quick succession by more forces \u2014 bloody armies arriving in retreat from the north under scarlet banners, fresh reinforcements from the south, beasts of war, siege engines. More and more soldiers arrive, the encampment swelling to at least a hundred thousand troops, stretching far into the south, until they stop.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> What, then? Just lying in wait for them to come and kill you?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Quite the opposite.</p>\n<p><em>[A line of finely-dressed sorcerers stretches down the width of the isthmus, at least twenty-five kilometres. They dig their hands into the ground and, with an inhuman effort, raise the beginnings of a wall, made of intertwined stone and sand and root and vine, petrified and hardened. It slowly rises out of the ground, inch by inch, until the sorcerers collapse, many of them clearly exsanguinated of all the blood in their body. Soldiers rush forward with tools, fortifying and expanding the structure, even as the dead sorcerers are replaced, their blood spilt into the foundations of the wall, and replaced. The cycle continues as the sun sets and rises and sets and rises, until the wall is dozens of meters high and as thick as a building. Staircases and ladders let soldiers man the high battlements.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That has to be as tall as the Great Wall of China. No, taller. By a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Thicker, too. How did you manage this without\u2026 architects, construction machines, anything?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Do you see the gateway?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> \u2026No. There isn't one.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. Anyone on the other side of that wall was going to be killed. This was our last stand. That is what drove us. What drove me. The understanding that I must do what I have to do for my people to survive. Because if I didn't, we wouldn't.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> But your people didn't survive, did they? Mamjul is still at the bottom of the ocean, and the Covenant is dead.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. I failed.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> We need to know what this thing is. We need to know how it broke you.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> This method of showing you my memories is\u2026 a loophole in the laws that I have been bound to. That the Daeva have been bound to. You are seeing more than any living creature in three thousand years has.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I appreciate that, but it's <em>not enough</em>. If this Blackstar still lives, if the god he serves <em>still exists</em>, we need to understand them to be able to defend ourselves.</p>\n<p><em>[GALANIS swallows nervously.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I have to again pose the idea that I be allowed to commune with\u2026 your master.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> You wish to speak to the Scarlet?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Yes. It's a god, right? It knows the Abominate or the Wretch or whatever. It cast it out to sea. It's the easiest way to learn what we need to know.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Communing with the Scarlet is a dangerous task, Galanis-<em>hiyar</em>. I have been wedded to it for centuries, and I have only done so a handful of times. To commune is to invite another presence into your mind. To invite a god into your mind\u2026 like packing the seas of the world into a pot. The pressure would annihilate you from the inside-out.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> But if you have a strong enough pot. A strong enough vessel.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Perhaps then. But the last time when a man had such fortitude was the founding of our Covenant. I appreciate your struggle, but it is not a possibility.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Fine, okay.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA clutches her forehead and the dream around the group shimmers.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Are you okay?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. Yes. Projecting the dream is just\u2026 intensive. I am not as young as I once was. I must rest.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That sounds like a good idea.</p>\n<p><em>[The projection dematerializes, melting into puddles of nothingness that drip off the boughs of the tree. They are still in the canopy of the tree, shaded by the branches.

About your willingness to do anything if it meant your people would live to see another day.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> What of it?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> You failed. But we haven't yet. We might still have a shot at surviving.</p>\n<p><em>[GREAVES points at the RAJMATA.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> We're willing to do whatever it takes. If you deny us access to what we need to save ourselves\u2026 it won't just be your own blood on your hands.

Karl and Ajay couldn't join us today, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p><em>[A low murmur of greeting runs throughout.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> I'd\u2026 like to apologize for my behaviour in the last meeting, Dr. Galanis. It was inappropriate, and rude, and I should've voiced my concerns more professionally.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2026 thank you, Dr. Sheridan.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> I still retain my concerns, and I think that we've gotten a little biased in our analysis, but\u2026 you know.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Of course. If we're all comfortable with moving on now, we have a new face. Welcome, Dr. Carrick.</p>\n<p><strong>CARRICK (THAU):</strong> Thank you! Happy to be here.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Is your team settled in?</p>\n<p><strong>CARRICK (THAU):</strong> As settled-in as one can be aboard a floating tin-can, yes.</p>\n<p><em>[She laughs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>CARRICK (THAU):</strong> No offense to any of you, of course. It's just that we're not a very nautical bunch.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> None of us were when the project started. Except Lucian, maybe. I'm pretty sure he was born in the Marines.</p>\n<p><em>[They nudge him, and GREAVES smiles slightly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Are you finding our analysis sufficient?</p>\n<p><strong>CARRICK (THAU):</strong> Not quite, I'm afraid. It's a very solid start, especially for people who aren't thaumaturges, but all thaumaturgy really is is a framework for understanding magic. To understand what drove the Daeva's magic, and how we can utilize and recreate that, would require my team to converse directly with them.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That can be arranged. You should sit down with Crowley from Psychotronics, and arrange tests for your\u2026 apprentices? See which ones will have the easiest time getting into Korar.</p>\n<p><strong>CARRICK (THAU):</strong> Researchers is fine. And that'll definitely help, but the problem is moreso that\u2026 we don't really feel comfortable tapping into spirits for our thaumaturgy yet without a greater understanding of the processes at play. What we'll be able to do without the Daeva is\u2026 limited. I'm just trying to set a realistic expectation for you \u2014 we're simply not going to be able to do the miracles they were, at least not at first.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's fine, so long as there's progress.</p>\n<p><strong>YIJUN (LING):</strong> Oh, that reminds me \u2014 Researcher Crowley asked me to pass along a message to you, Doctor. She noticed that the equipment they use in Psychotronics to stabilize and support the astral projections were seeing increased power draw. Something about needing to work harder to keep the projection stable. I don't know what it means, but..</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2026 odd. I'll get into it, thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Speaking of progress, I have looked into the Sea Peoples, as you asked me to.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Find anything?</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Almost nothing. The old files from Amoni-Ram indicate the Middle Kingdom pharaohs were at least aware of the anomalous empires, which might help explain why only a temple in Egypt has any record of their existence. But Amoni-Ram was also conspicously lacking in contemporary sources, and it existed fine.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Gut feeling?</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> I do not believe in coincidences, Dr. Galanis. The surviving Mekhanites spread their culture and technology throughout the Middle East and North Africa, but lacked any contemporary source. They only appeared in the Quran as Iram. The Daeva appear to have done the same for Indian culture, taking the role of Kumari Kandam. It stands to reason that this\u2026 Three-Prong Army are the kernel of truth behind the myth of the Sea People. They certainly would have had to push through the region on their way to Mamjul and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> I should mention the only thing the mundane archaeological community has ever found related to the Sea People were bronze weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> I do not understand the relevance.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Rajmata mentions the Blackstar's forces looted Amoni-Ram. And scuffed fuladh looks an awful lot like bronze. It just makes too much sense. Keep looking into it.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Of course.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> What's up with that name, by the way? Three Prong Army, does that mean anything for the Daeva?</p>\n<p><strong>XIJUN (LING):</strong> I had the same thought. I looked through the preliminary translation dictionary we've compiled of the oral language \u2014 obviously a written one is impossible \u2014 and as far as I can tell\u2026 nothing. It quite literally just means 'three points'.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Maybe a descriptor of their military strategy? A three-pronged attack.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Could be referring to a trident.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That would certainly fit with the Sea People theory. Remind me to ask the Rajmata next time.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Also on the docket: Thijam. Based on your description of her memories, it seems like it would be an isthmus connection the landmass of \u2014 well, I guess we're calling it Kumari Kandam now, to mainland India.</p>\n<p><strong>RAMASWAMY (HIST):</strong> Isthmuses have historically been of great importance in ancient cultures. Constantinople monopolized trade between the East and West by residing on one. I do not need to tell you how critical the Suez is. It makes sense they would make their choke point there.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Yeah, but the problem is that we can't find it. We don't even have a very good understanding of what the continent looked like back then, just maps from Amoni-Ram we know are altered and maps from Blackwood's journals that are as likely to be right as they are wrong. The narrowest point of the isthmus could be a kilometre south of the tip of India, a hundred, or even inland. There's just no way to know.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'll see what information I can get, but keep working on it.</p>\n<p><em>[He sighs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Is there something else?</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Permission to speak freely?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm not your commanding officer, Levi. Say what's on your mind.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> It feels like we're at a point where we've run out of knowledge to collect. And we're not any closer to finding out our answers.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's not true, we've learned a lot about the Daeva. What they were, what happened to the world after Amoni-Ram fell.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> I'm an archaeologist, Doctor. I know first-hand what it means to search after knowledge most people will never appreciate, for the sake of nothing but the knowledge itself. But if this Blackstar stuff is still an existential threat\u2026 we need knowledge we can apply. And we're not getting that here.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Dr. Carrick is making a great start on applying Daeva magic. That's not applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> Yeah, but\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> As the representative from the Council, they're quite pleased with how the project is progressing under Dr. Galanis.</p>\n<p><em>[Everyone turns to look at GREAVES. He remains silent.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHERIDAN (ARCH):</strong> I'm not questioning your leadership, Doctor.

Yeah, I've killed people. But I'm not one of those Kilgore nutjobs. I don't take any pleasure in it, and at least for the Foundation, I know it serves a greater purpose than some\u2026 political game.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> How's that?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Shooting at rice farmers with AKs to stop the Red Menace isn't doing anything for anyone.

I'm still not.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> You seem to be doing fine. O5-1 certainly thinks so.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I'm being pulled in about thirty different directions at once.

It floats on the water for a moment before sinking out of sight.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> You don't think we should use what we've learned from them to defend ourselves?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I think that we have an ethical responsibility to both respect the Daeva's culture, and to make sure they don't get any power. Because the last time they did, they enslaved a solid chunk of the population of Asia. And I think that the last time we tried to weaponize the powers of one of these cultures\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> I don't see how researching their magic to apply ourselves is inherently evil. There's risks, for sure \u2014 I've heard about Project London Bridge, but that was thirty years ago.

This should answer some outstanding questions. Any reason we're waiting?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Psychotronics team is fiddling with the machinery. There have been some issues with people randomly dropping out of the projection, like a bad phone connection. Not sure what to make of it yet, but hopefully it's just an equipment issue.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Hopefully.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Hey, Lucian \u2014 you have a higher clearance than me, right?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> That's not really how clearance works, but sure.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Hm.

Interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Not in the way you would think of it. The physical body is\u2026 irrelevant. All our souls rest in Korar, and the form one takes in Mamjul in between reincarnations should not dictate their lot in life. Surely they have experienced enough lives in enough forms to make any such determination irrelevant. People are what they wished to be. No more.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Interesting.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence for a moment, as the party looks out before the wasteland beyond the walls.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> So are we\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><em>[Distantly, the chanting of the city takes on a different tone. Less wildly harmonious, and more into a somber register. A slower melody, the words so long and deep as to be incomprehensible. At the same time, the view changes. Grass sprouts out of nowhere far below and spreads, trees forming out of nonexistence. The sky goes from star-studded blackness to a deep blue, the sun hanging overhead. Korar melts away behind them, replaced by vast plains, and countless figures crawl out of the dust.]</em></p>\n<p><em>[In a few moments, they are standing atop the battlement at the Wall of Thijum. In front of them lies a vast, unspeakably large army. Formed into tight regiments, they mass around the base of the wall with siege engines that are not even half the height of the gargantuan barrier. At this height, each soldier is the size of an ant, and the swarm spreads far, far into the foggy distance.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> That has to be\u2026 half a million men. Good <em>god.</em> Twice the size of the largest army ever fielded.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Not just them. Turn around, Luce.</p>\n<p><em>[GREAVES turns. On the other side of the wall lies another massive force \u2014 not as unfathomably large as the Three-Prong Army, but the Daevic Covenant occupy the vast kilometers of beach between them and the jungle line. They are organized into massive lines, polearms extended to meet a charge. From this height, far to the south, beyond the Daevic Covenant, the huge boughs of the Citadel tree are visible. The wall is the only thing that separates the two forces.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> This has to be that largest battle ever fought. At least a million men, on one battlefield. The mother of all chokepoints.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Such was my belief. That the sheer size of the wall and the army would demoralize them. I was, needless to say, fatally incorrect.</p>\n<p><em>[In fast-forward, the sun sets and drops below the horizon. A scattering of huge bonfires form on both sides of the wall, soldiers gathering around them. The siege engines have been disassembled \u2014 the attempts at scaling the wall are obviously pointless. Instead, they are reassembled into a collection of trebuchets, catapults, and ballistas, all aimed at the top of the wall. With large, heavy booms, their payloads of huge stone boulders and explosive tar collide with the battlements. Daeva soldiers huddle behind the stone barriers as the wall shakes with every impact. Shakes, but holds firm, hour after hour, night after night, as they return fire with their own weapons of war and sorcerers.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I underestimated the interminable nature of human persistence. I thought they would realize the wall was impenetrable. Not just physically \u2014 I sealed it myself, with a ward wrought in blood.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Blood sacrifices are common in your magical school. What's so special about this one?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> They are. But the more powerful the sacrifice, the stronger the magic. <em>[Pause]</em> I rest comfortable in the knowledge that my children would have been slaughtered regardless of whether the horde broke through.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You\u2026 killed your <em>children</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Seven bodies, seven wards, seven chains to protect the Scarlet Maharaja from those that would seek to destroy him. Their souls belonged to Korar, to him. I simply did what he commanded, and released their physical form with the same dagger I was anointed with.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The black dagger KHAN team found in the throne room. That's why it survived when nothing else did.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Their flesh, so sweet, so innocent. The ultimate sacrifice for the ultimate protection.</p>\n<p><em>[Suddenly, she turns and spits on the stone wall.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> And look now.</p>\n<p><em>[The scene continues to fast-forward. The sun rises, and sets, and rises, and sets. The siege carries on for a week, then two weeks, then a month, then two months, then six. The wall continues to be battered, and stand firm. The vines and toxic clouds and poisoners falling from the walls collide below, thinning out the Blackstar's forces, before they are immediately crowded out and replaced. The defenders are killed and replaced by more reserves from the amassed army. Sorcerers raise water spirits to destroy any attempt to cross from the sea.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> They're not going away. Laying siege to it, just like how they did to Amoni-Ram. But\u2026 Mamjul is protected, far to the south. You're clearly holding out. What happened?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Their master arrived.</p>\n<p><em>[A ravine forms in the vast army as soldiers separate, standing a respectful distance away from one figure. He appears to be a regular man, but his very presence is larger than life \u2014 the battlefield bows toward him as he makes his way to the encampment, flanked by his guard. A full moon hangs overhead in the smoky sky. He disappears into a tent.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> What the <em>hell</em> is that thing? Every time I look at him\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> It feels like my brain is boiling.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Yeah. Like he can <em>see</em> me.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Most magicians in this world are simply that \u2014 magicians. Sorcerers, warlocks. People who have a particular leaning towards the esoteric arts and have studied years to apply them to perform even the slightest magic. He\u2026 is something else. The world itself shapes around him.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh, <em>shit.</em> A reality bender.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> Has to be Class 4, at least. Maybe Class 5.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's theoretical.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> They're all theoretical, Pan. We haven't seen anything above Class 2 in decades.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I do not understand. Explain.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> They're called ontokinetics. Reality benders, more informally. People who can mold the world to whatever they want. This is the most powerful we've seen in a long, long time.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Hm. I see. Such is the blessing of a god.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What did he do? I honestly don't know how reality-bending would interact with\u2026 the magic you did. It's an unexplored field.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> He stayed, in that tent, for seven days and seven nights. And for all that time, the Abominate, the Wretch, his god hung overhead, lending him power.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What do you \u2014 the <em>moon?</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Look.</p>\n<p><em>[Ahead, the bright whiteness of the full moon over the battlefield is fading as it blackens. It sinks low, a dark star in the sky, blackened and scorched, surrounded by a corona of white light, burning like the eye of a great dead god. After some time, the sun rises, but the moon remains locked in place, hovering over the horde. The tides of the sea malform, twisting and turning, rising and falling in different directions.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Do you feel it?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I feel\u2026 sick to my stomach. Like I'm going to vomit.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. This is the Wretch. Primarch of chaos, lord of disorder. Where it goes, the natural laws that govern us fail. Once, the Mekhanites accused us of being wild people. In a sense they were right, but even in the most untamed wilds, a natural harmony emerges. Survival of the fittest, domination of the meek, the cycle of life. That is what the Scarlet embodies.</p>\n<p><em>[She looks out towards the battlefield as the waters rise even higher and turn into rough, raging seas, inching up the beach, constricting the Daevic forces into tighter columns.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> And on the eighth day, he emerged, bathed in the blood of my people.</p>\n<p><em>[A figure exits the tent. The army separates around him, flowing like water, as he marches, alone, to the base of the wall. The defenders sling vines and casks and magic, and all disintegrate before ever reaching him. A storm has gathered overhead \u2014 dark clouds, hard sheets of cold rain slamming into the muddy ground and the stone walls. Lightning spiderwebs across the sky and the seas slam into the land as the black moon watches its prophet make his way to the base of the wall, and kneel, brow dripping sweat, hands dripping blood.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> And he raised his hands, and\u2014</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>[CONNECTION SEVERED]</strong></p>\n<p><em>[The projection dematerializes.

The projection lost connection, and several pieces of equipment were heavily damaged. Doctor Galanis awoke unharmed, but for unknown reasons, Lieutenant Greaves remained unconscious and in the fugue state; an hour later, he slipped into a coma.</p>\n<p>The immediate assessment by Psychotronics Division personnel and medical personnel aboard the <em>Phantom</em> was that the LSAP Array embedded in Lt. Greaves' brain resulted in some kind of adverse reaction to the psychic backlash, or was in fact the cause thereof. Before any decision could be reached on moving him to the infirmary, or extracting the Array from his brain, the Array reactivated despite no longer being attached to any discernable power source. The transcript printer it was attached to begin printing a large amount of nonsense text with no clear meaning or purpose, and extremely faint delta waves were detected from Lt. Greaves in an EKG.</p>\n<p>Per Dr. Galanis' orders, the <em>Haffkine</em> was temporarily quarantined. Reentry into Korar was not possible until replacement components for the damaged equipment were rush-ordered from the nearby MKF-02 and delivered via helicopter to the ships. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the project, typical Foundation practices to obscure logistical transportation were ignored. The components were installed on May 25th, and, two days after contact was lost, Dr. Galanis reentered the astral projection with the directive of assessing Lt. Greaves' status and, if possible, recovering him.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MAY 2003</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>SOURCE:</strong> Doctor Pandora Galanis\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong> Remember, Doctor.

The army looks to their sides and again tightens, only for the waves to grow even higher. The forces at the rear begin a retreat, one that quickly turns to a rout.

Finally, they stop at a birds-eye view of the entire region: the continent is a large freehanging peninsula extending forth from the tip of the Indian subcontinent. Thijum lies at the thinnest point, and Mamjul lies near the center of the peninsula. As they watch, the entire landmass grows incrementally, marginally smaller. The moon draws yet closer, pulling the water, sinking Kumari Kandam beneath the waves. The coastal areas disappear in a frothing mass of blue as the waters make their way inland in raging floods and violent rain.

Mothers carry their babies, or are forced to leave them behind by the shoving of the crowd. Sorcerers rush to the battlements but find their abilities useless against the raging sea. Some citizens even raise their swords to slit their own throats, secure in their future in Korar. Throughout all this the dream is strange, fragmented. It sounds and looks as through passed through a thousand filters, breaking apart the image and putting it back together again. In front of the group lies a grand, marble-panelled building.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> This is the library. The dilapidated one we found in Mamjul, filled with blank tablets.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Destroying us was not enough for the Blackstar.

He had to annihilate us.</p>\n<p><em>[Scholars run through the halls of the huge Library, Daeva and human. They carry huge armfuls of scrolls and tablets, plinths and statuettes, all carved with complex, swimming writing and pictographs, rushing to get them out of the way of the flood. But even as they do so, the tablets fade, as though rubbed clean of their etchings. The ink on the scrolls melts away. The statuettes and plinths lose all features and writing, and the carved etchings throughout the rest of the hall are rubbed just as clean.

It's the Mekhanites.</p>\n<p><em>[A number fly low and grab hold of security personnel, lifting them into the air and dropping them into the sea or onto the metal deck, where their bones shatter on impact. Chain guns swing around and lay suppressing fire onto the cloud of Mekhanites.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>WILCOX:</strong> Get down, get the fuck down! They're dive-bombing!</p>\n<p><strong>FRANKLIN:</strong> Nine o'clock, <em>fire!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[One of the huge guns swivels on its base, following the largest cluster of Mekhanites through the air, before firing. The shell collides with one of the armored figures before exploding on impact, dispersing the cluster and sending them sailing through the air. As the smoke clears, the figure it impacts sails through the air and slams into the deck of the Haffkine.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>FRANKLIN:</strong> Scratch one!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[The deck of the ship shakes slightly, the waters around the Phantom growing rough and frothing. For a moment, the cloud of Mekhanites hangs back.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>MCNAMARA:</strong> What the fuck is that?!</p>\n<p><strong>BENOIT:</strong> <em>Get away from the hull!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[With an explosion of spray and foam, two dozen large bronze-armored figures rocket out of the water, slamming their swords into the sides of the ship. They began to crawl up the hull. Security personnel move to the gunwale, leaning their weapons over the sides and firing straight down. One or two Mekhanites' skulls shatter under the hail of gunfire and fall back into the sea, blood spreading into the water. The bullets harmlessly bounce off most of them as they continue to inch their way up the sides of the ship.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>RODRIQUEZ:</strong> Shit is <em>not</em> working, switch to AP!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[The security personnel on the sides cover each other while they swap out to armor-piercing rounds. At the same time, the aerial contingent of Mekhanites turn and make another pass over the decks of the ships, this time pulling out fuladh spears and driving them through the chests of security personnel.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>PHANTOM:</strong> OVCOM, there's a terrestrial group of them. Attempting to board and take the vessel. Requesting air support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Several of the flying Mekhanites land on the deck of the</em> Haffkine, <em>engaging personnel directly with close-quarters polearms and swords. Personnel turn the chain guns on them, hammering them with rounds from close proximity. Their advance is halted, but the bullets fail to pierce their fuladh armor.</em></p>\n<p><em>[On the Phantom, the situation worsens as the boarding party begin to reach the top deck and pull themselves over. They are distinctly humanoid, but tall, and heavily augmented with Mekhanite prosthetics and implants. What little of their skin is visible under the armor bulges with subdermal cables and wiring. They are armed with what appear to be primitive long rifles, which they turn on the security personnel and begin firing.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>PATEL:</strong> Bridge, put up the barricades!</p>\n<p><strong>PHANTOM:</strong> Roger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Several sections of the deck of the Phantom rise up and out, forming makeshift cover. Security personnel dash behind them, leaning out to fire their rifles. The large-caliber rounds from the Mekhanite weapons slam into the barricades at high velocity, a few tearing completely through personnel, who collapse onto the ground, bleeding out.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>OVCOM:</strong> Additional reinforcements have been scrambled. An Indian Navy patrol group has been requisitioned, and is en route to your location. Fixed-wing aircraft have already been launched and are en-route.</p>\n<p><strong>PHANTOM:</strong> But\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>OVCOM:</strong> We can amnesticize them after. Under no circumstances can the Mekhanites be allowed to take MKF-01. You need to survive until the support arrives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[With the close-quarters combat occuring on both decks, the remaining aerial Mekhanites can no longer effectively dive-bomb, and slam into the decks of the ships, drawing their weapons and making another advance. Under heavy machine-gun fire, a handful drop to the ground, but most continue advancing.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ALLARD:</strong> We're getting fucking massacred out here!</p>\n<p><strong>POLRYS:</strong> Bridge, we need reinforcements <em>now!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Through one of the doors, a group of hooded and armored personnel exit, shoulderpads emblazoned with the sigil of the Thaumaturgy Division. They form a small phalanx, one drawing a sigil in the air that expands into a moving, translucent barrier. They press forward onto the deck where the firefight is occuring \u2014 the barrier trembles under the assault, but holds.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>LIAN:</strong> <em>Are those the fucking wizards!?</em></p>\n<p><strong>CARRICK:</strong> Cover us!

CARRICK holds the barrier while the others brace themselves against the ground and whisper. A few moments later, green, expanding vines creep out through the cracks in the deck and wrap around the ankles of one of the Mekhanites, causing him to crash into the ground. An Alpha-1 operative leans around the cover and empties a magazine into his unprotected nape.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>VERNE:</strong> Shit, that worked!

We just don't have the power!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[The phalanx is temporarily pushed back by one of the Mekhanites charging them. On the Haffkine, Alpha-1 personnel also flood out of the doors to the bridge and lay down suppressing fire from their weaponry. These weapons cause slightly more visible damage, but still fail to stop the advance towards the bridge.]</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>PHANTOM:</strong> All personnel, <em>hold the line</em>.

Your mind is.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> We have been meeting for a year, and not once in that time have I ever shown the power to trap you into the projection. Only your mind can do such a thing. Your current state was caused entirely by what your doctors thought: the object in your brain.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> How the hell do you know about that?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> I'm\u2026 dead?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. But both of you are in a torpor, from which you are unlikely to awaken. Certainly not before the Mekhanites kill your men, make it to the lower deck, and slit your throat along with those of everyone else on board. And I know this because the Scarlet whispered it to the Maharaja, and he to me. Your future is written in the trees, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> No. No. This can't be right. There has to be something we can do.</p>\n<p><em>[On the decks, the firefight continues, as the personnel are worn down and pushed back.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> There is.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What?

But were it that the Scarlet could select a new host\u2026 not only would the Daeva survive, but you witnessed the power of the Blackstar when he had his God's favor. Turning the tide of this battle would be trivial.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> You told me humans would be destroyed if we tried to commune with the Scarlet!</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Most. But I have been watching you, Greaves-<em>jirras</em>. The Scarlet has told me your people, your Foundation, are sliding towards a war none of you can prevent. You are a soldier, a warrior-king. You are strong. You wish to protect your people.</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Strike a new Covenant.

Something bigger than the Mekhanites, than any of us. The Foundation needs to survive.</p>\n<p><em>[The vision crackles and sags, like film put to a match.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> We are out of time.</p>\n<p><em>[She claps her hands, and the vision melts away. The group is standing in the antechamber of the Citadel \u2014 not in Korar, but in the ruined throne room in Mamjul. Behind the throne, in front of the epicenter of the massive floor carving that spreads across the building. The RAJMATA claps her hands again, and the wooden floor splits apart, curling back to reveal a hollow space. Inside lies the desiccated, mummified corpse of a man, skin stretched taut, a black headdress resting on his brow. A single red jewel is embedded into the headdress, shining like an ocean of blood.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Our Maharaja. My master. Take it, as he took the jewel from the roots of the trees so many centuries ago.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Luce. Please. Don't do it. You don't know what you're unleashing.</p>\n<p><em>[GREAVES reaches in and grips the stone firmly, pulling. It resists, but then gives way, tearing out of the Maharaja's headdress, leaving a gaping hole. As he watches, the Maharaja's body falls in on itself, drying even further, turning to dust, fading. The stone whispers to him: promises of salvation, of divination, of victory against the enemy.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Now place the stone where it belongs.</p>\n<p><em>[The far wall contains the engraving of the tree of life, of the Daeva and the humans dancing around it, of the Scarlet watching over them. GREAVES walks over, as if in a trance, and raises the stone. The wall falls away, peeling back and receding, splintering into nothing, revealing its secret. Behind the space lies an infinite scarlet ocean, a miasma of shifting and spiralling redness, stretching far into a horizon that cannot possibly exist. It speaks with the voice of a hundred thousand souls sacrificed in its name, as a great and terrible idea. A god.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE SCARLET:</strong> WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO SACRIFICE?</p>\n<p><strong>GREAVES:</strong> <em>[Slight pause]</em> Everything.</p>\n<p><em>[It does not respond; it does not need to. The red beckons forth, and I step forward, across the threshold, into everything. It is around me, in me.

Standing well over 3m tall and with large horns on its head, its skin is inscribed with symbols and markings that pulse to an inaudible rhythm.

While they will not be given physical form, interviews with Daeva and the Rajmata indicate that the presence of a physical, written record of the Daeva's history will significantly stabilize Korar and begin restoring the vast historical records in Mamjul and across the Indian subcontinent that were obliterated by the Blackstar's <em>damnatio memoriae</em>.</p>\n<p>As their presence in baseline reality retroactively increases, so will the thaumaturgic power they can supply to the Foundation.

Before they were extracted, Doctor Galanis was observed to enter the Psychotronics Lab aboard the <em>Haffkine</em> for a period of forty-five minutes. The event was only noticed by security staff after Galanis had been escorted by MTF Alpha-1 operatives into the helicopter and departed the <em>Phantom</em>; however, the recording device associated with Lieutenant Greaves' LSAP Array was still active.</p>\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT \u2014 JUNE 2003</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[GALANIS opens their eyes. They are in the throne room of the Citadel. Once again, the city is in an orgiastic sway \u2014 drumbeats ring throughout, but with new, joyous words. A new verse of the Song of the Daeva is being written. The RAJMATA is seated on the throne, draped in luxurious shawls and silks, layered with jewelry hanging around her arms and horns. She looks up at GALANIS.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Galanis. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Spare me. I've resigned; you're not gonna be seeing any more of me.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> That is truly a shame. For all your faults, I thought you were\u2026 a remarkably innocent soul. Unfortunately, wars are not kind to the innocent.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I would say so, seeing what it did to your children.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA's expression does not shift.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> What have you come here for?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> An answer.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Just one? I'm sure you have many questions.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Honestly, no, not really. Everything I'm wondering has been just about cleared up. No thanks to you.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I am not going to apologize for doing what I did to ensure the survival of my people, Galanis-<em>hiyar</em>. Yours would have done the same.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> They did.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes. Yes, they did. You cannot fault me for this; the beauty of the Covenant is that it is made with the consent of all parties. I did not force Greaves-<em>jirras</em> or your Overseers into anything they did not want to do. They simply saw the truth.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> What's that?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> That the only way we are going to weather the coming storm is together. My entire nation drowned after falling under the sea. And standing from where I am, I can once again see the tides are rising.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> A new Occult War.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> No. The same Occult War, the First War. It never ended. This was merely a three-thousand-year-old ceasefire that expired the moment you unleashed Amoni-Ram from its sandy tomb.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Council, Greaves, you. You're all sure that the Blackstar and his god are still out there, biding their time.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I am.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> I know because my master whispered it through the cosmos. I imagine your Overseers had a similar experience. And the <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong> is not the true threat. His god is. The Black Moon.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> The Black Moon. Where have I heard that before? That's\u2026 that's a fucking Foundation passphrase! The Overseers were lying, they <em>do</em> know something!</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> This, I cannot comment upon.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Well, none of this will matter in a bit anyway. I'm sure the Foundation'll amnesticize me before I so much as step foot on land.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Then take this time to ask anything else you were left wondering about.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence for a moment, then GALANIS laughs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Nothing. It's just that\u2026 it's the most trivial thing, but I promised one of my researchers that I'd ask you why the Three-Prong Army was called that. We couldn't figure it out.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> A promise is a covenant. It must be kept. They are named as such because of their insignia.</p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> I didn't see any heraldry in your memories.</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> It was as powerful a symbol as <strong>BLACKSTAR</strong> is a name. Not to be used lightly. But it has been a long, long time since that era.</p>\n<p><em>[The RAJMATA claps her hands. An attendant approaches, carrying a curved black dagger, reflecting the light around it. It is sharp to a point. The attendant offers the dagger to the RAJMATA, who grasps it, and begins taking off their robes, their back to the RAJMATA. She leans down and, with a firm hand, carves a symbol into the tender flesh of their back.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> Oh dear God.</p>\n<p><em>[The attendant turns, showing their bleeding back to GALANIS. Their flesh is marred by a wide circle, jutting into which at equidistant points are three lines with sharp tips facing inward.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>GALANIS:</strong> That's\u2026 that's the Founda\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>RAJMATA:</strong> Goodbye, Doctor Galanis.

And in this it was victorious; for it had slaughtered the Grand Armies at Amoni-Ram, routing the men and spirits of the Daeva from the battlefield, sending them into a desperate retreat through the thickets and undergrowth, to Mamjul, to salvation.\n\n\n\nAnd so it was that the armies of the Daeva were forced to abandon their peoples, their sacred charge and those of their children, as they formed a great mass, marching ceaselessly towards their stronghold, the ancestral home of the Daeva, where they could mount a defense. But as with all things, such decisions are rooted in sacrifices of blood, of honor, of duty. And the ultimate sacrifice was made a hundred times over. Loyal soldiers left to their devices against the chaos of the horde, knowing their deaths inevitable, taking solace in the fact that their deaths might preserve their afterlifes.\n\n\n\nBecause it was understood that were the **BLACKSTAR** to lead his armies across the isthmus and into Mamjul, he would lay siege to the city, and break it just as he had broken Amoni-Ram. The slaughter would be wholesale and complete, and not only of the material plane. For were the Three-Prong Army to bring down the walls of Mamjul, to seize the Tree, they would tear apart the roots seeking the original gift of the Scarlet, the source of the Maharaja's power. And should they take it from his sleeping corpse, he would crumble away to nothingness, robbed of his immortality. And as he crumbled, so too would the dream he dreamt, and Korar with it.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Section 001.7\n\n+++ {{LATER RESEARCH}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nOn April 11th, following several months of cooperative research from all teams of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, the first revision of the Daevic Empire Cultural Briefing was finalized. The report covered nearly every aspect of cultural knowledge that the Daeva had been willing to share with Foundation personnel, and represented likely the first written record of the Daeva's existence in centuries, perhaps millennia. A meeting of the Anthropology Committee was called to discuss forward action.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT - APRIL 2003\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= **<<IN ATTENDANCE>>**\n\n**Doctor Pandora Galanis** --\u00a0\u00a0Project Lead (LEAD)\n\n**Operator Ajay Desai** -- Dive Team Lead (DIVE)\n\n**Sr. Researcher Levi Sheridan** -- Archaeology Team Lead (ARCH)\n\n**Sr. Researcher Xing Yijun** -- Linguistic Analysis Team Lead (LING)\n\n**Doctor Karl Aberer** -- Anthropology Team Lead (ANTH)\n\n**Sr. Researcher Vijay Ramaswamy** --\u00a0\u00a0Parahistory Team Lead (HIST)\n\n----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n//[GALANIS and DESAI enter the conference room aboard the// Phantom//.

Big day today, huh?\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Morning, boss. \n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** Well? Don't leave us in suspense!\n\n\n\n//[GALANIS smiles.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Mhm. After six months, several hundred interviews with the Daeva, and thousands of hours of research and cultural study by every member of the Initiative... I've transmitted the final draft of the Cultural Briefing, all nine-hundred-fifty-four pages of it, to Overwatch Command as of 8:02 this morning.\n\n\n\n//[The room bursts into cheers and claps. Several researchers high-five, hug or simply whistle. The celebration carries on for the better part of a minute, until GALANIS raises their hand and it dies down.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I know not everyone's here, but for those of you that are, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. You guys did an amazing job -- none of us knew what we were getting into when we made the first dive into Mamjul, but you've all handled the impossible job with an exceptional air of professionalism and duty. It's you guys that made this possible. Give yourselves a pat on the back.\n\n\n\n//[Another, more reserved round of applause rings out from the researchers lined up around the room.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** This is a huge milestone, but our work isn't over yet. The Briefing is a pretty exhaustive look at the culture and anthropology of the Daeva, but our historians still have a lot of work ahead of us. Additionally, I was informed by the Council that we'll be seeing some new faces within the week -- a crew of researchers from the Applied Thaumaturgy Division are being flown out.\n\n\n\n**DESAI (DIVE):** We're getting wizards?\n\n\n\n//[A polite chuckle rings out.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I think they're technically mages, but yeah. The Council has a lot of interest in seeing the applications of Daevic thaumaturgy, so that's a new avenue of research. But the rest of us also have a lot to do -- especially our Parahistory Team. You'll all get briefings from your team leads with your new research directives by the end of the day. For now, you're dismissed, everyone. Enjoy the day off.\n\n\n\n//[The researchers cheer one last time before trickling out of the conference room. Eventually, just the Team Leads and GALANIS are left. SHERIDAN takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.]//\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Can't believe it's really finished. \n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** Feels a bit like seeing your kid off to college, haha.\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** I'm relieved, honestly.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Yeah? How so?\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** If I never talk to a Daeva again it'll be too soon.\n\n\n\n//[GALANIS looks at her askance.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** I mean, you know what she's talking about.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I really don't.\n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** Neither do I.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Come on, you guys read the same Culture Briefing I did. I mean, hell, we wrote it! The Daeva aren't exactly a squeaky-clean culture.\n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** Such a thing doesn't exist.\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** Sure, but like... you guys didn't find it weird or creepy when these huge creatures started talking about sacrificing their slaves?\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** It was not //enjoyable// but one needs to keep an open mind about such things. They are from three thousand years ago; slavery and sacrifice being taboo are modern luxuries. \n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** Such things were ubiquitous in the ancient world.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Yeah, but we're not //in// the ancient world, are we?\n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** The Daeva are. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** You guys seriously don't see anything fucked up about this? I //wrote// the section where we talk about finding the sacrifice pits in Mamjul. They were a brutal, militaristic culture.\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** Yeah. Just because they existed back then doesn't mean they're exempt from judgement.\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** Four hundred thousand people died in the construction of the Great Wall of China. Countless thousands of slaves in the construction of the Pyramids. We cannot apply our modern moral axioms to the actions of kings from a thousand years before democracy was even thought of. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Even if that was true, you still have to face the fact that they did awful things. Like, boss, the Rajmata showed you the atrocities during the war.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I mean, yes, but those were mutual atrocities. The First War was rife with them from all sides.\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** That doesn't mean that they're not guilty of doing terrible things.\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** As though we're any different? Consider how many people die in pointless resource wars or terrorism or senseless acts of violence every day. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Dude, are you serious? Yeah, I think our culture is a little better than the people sacrificing kids to the blood god.\n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** Are you //trying// to be reductive?\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** I don't totally agree with Levi, but like, you guys do recognize what you're excusing, right? Their morals haven't changed -- I bet if you went in and asked any one of them right now, they'd still tell you that yeah, enslaving 'lesser creatures' is okay.\n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** We're approaching this from an anthropological perspective. Just because I find some things morally reprehensible doesn't mean I get to cast judgement over an entire culture. That's no basis for scholarly research.\n\n\n\n//[GALANIS raises their hands.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Okay, look, everyone, I think we may have gotten a little too close to the subject of the research here-\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** I do not believe getting close to the subject is always bad. Your close relationship with the Rajmata is the only way we have learned so much about the Daeva to begin with.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's-- I mean, yeah, you're right, but like, our work requires a little distance to be able to remain impartial.\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** The Daevic language has forty different words for 'religious torture'. We've spent the better part of a year studying these things. Are you really telling me the image you've gotten isn't one of a brutal theocracy? How can you be impartial about that?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Look, I'm not saying that either. I think this has gotten a little heated--\n\n\n\n**ABERER (ANTH):** Then what //are// you saying, Doctor?\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Whose side are you even on?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I- I-\n\n\n\n**DESAI (DIVE):** Back the fuck off.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**DESAI (DIVE):** I'm serious. Talk like that to them again and I'll break your nose.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** //[Quietly]// Sorry, boss.\n\n\n\n**DESAI (DIVE):** That's what I thought. You guys are all only here because Pan stuck up for you to the Council, or all of your asses would've been behind desks months ago. Show a little goddamn respect.\n\n\n\n//[GALANIS raises a hand.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** It's alright. It's an emotional day, people are high-strung. It's okay. You guys are dismissed. You'll get your research directives on your terminals. \n\n\n\n//[The team leads quietly file out of the room, avoiding eye contact with each other. DESAI and GALANIS are left.]//\n\n\n\n**DESAI (DIVE):** You okay?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Yeah.\n\n\n\n//[They sigh.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** No. Not really.\n\n----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT -- APRIL 2003\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n**FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR PANDORA GALANIS**\n\n[[size 80%]]MAMJUL-KORAR INITIATIVE[[/size]]\n\n----\n\n[[size 110%]]//Personal thoughts on research progress//[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nWell, today was shitty.\n\n\n\nI didn't realize there was this kind of an ideological split among the leads. It's jarring. I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, Karl and Vijay are right. The one thing they hammer into you throughout your undergrad, graduate school, doctoral work, your career, is that trying to apply modern moral conceptions to ancient cultures is foolish. That's how ethnocentrism starts. Our modern morals are a product of an exceptionally high quality of life, wealth, and lifespan. The Daeva didn't have that. Like almost all ancient empires, their culture was built off the back of a gargantuan apparatus of slavery, imperialism, and state violence.\n\n\n\nBut at the same time... it's a unique situation, right? The Daeva aren't ancient. Well, they are, but they're not //extinct//. It's not like you're talking about the Egyptian slavery system, where everyone involved has been dead for thousands of years. The Daeva still exist, and Yijun is right. They still hold these beliefs. The Rajmata certainly does. \n\n\n\nEverything is a matter of perspective. Whether the Daeva are a product of their time or a warlike empire... maybe both. It's more complicated than that. It's so complicated. I think we might have gotten a little close to the subject of research here. We had to immerse ourselves in the culture to learn what we did, but I'm not sure we've learned what immersing ourselves has done to our own perspectives.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the fact that we still need to figure out what happened to the Covenant after Amoni-Ram fell. This new stuff about the Three-Prong Army and the Abominate/Wretch and the Blackstar... I'm looking through all our databases and plenty of mundane academic ones. I've come up entirely dry.\n\n\n\nExcept for one thing. Vijay caught it: the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. The basis for the mythology of the Sea Peoples. An unidentified culture group that sweeped through and laid waste to Asia Minor, Egypt, and the rest of the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age Collapse. We have no records of who they were or how they managed to annihilate a slew of powerful military states, just some Egyptian writings that prove their presence in the region. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/jade/Shardana.jpg|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=An engraving of the Sea People from the mortuary temple.|\n\n]]\n\n\n\nBut the Rajmata mentioned the Wretch had 'crawled out of the sea' and quietly built an army that proceeded to steamroll over every other culture on its way to Amoni-Ram. Writings in Amoni-Ram and the Rajmata's testimony indicate that the Three-Prong Army came out of North Africa, and the Sea Peoples would have had to push through Egypt if they wanted to get to Amoni-Ram. It's not perfect, and the evidence is circumstantial, but it's something. \n\n\n\nThough it raises two more questions that have been nagging at me. The first: what happened to the historical records of the Wretch? If a culture really did sweep through North Africa and then obliterate half of Asia, there //has// to be some kind of archaeological record of it! It doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\nAnd the second: why would Robert Bumaro be so terrified of something from three thousand years ago?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nDespite the finalization of the Culture Briefing, the primary goal of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative remained to construct an accurate timeline leading to the fall of the anomalous empires and identify the Abominate/Wretch. Dr. Galanis' sessions with the Rajmata had reached the Fall of Amoni-Ram in approximately 1200 BCE, which is where the historical model constructed by Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum ended. At this crucial precipice, the Council unanimously agreed to permit further sessions.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - APRIL 2003 \n\n[[/div]]\n\n**SOURCE:** Doctor Pandora Galanis\n\n----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n//[GALANIS and GREAVES are standing in a a lush verdant rainforest. Ahead of them, the trees grow thinner, eventually turning into a wide clearing in which sits a large village. Several dozen large stone buildings and many smaller wooden huts form the low, flat settlement; the architecture is consistent with many of the constructions in Mamjul and Korar. Aside from the pair, there is no one else visible.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What the hell? Where are we?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** This is a dream. But I don't know where.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Where is everybody? The Rajmata isn't here. //Nobody's// here.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Wait.\n\n\n\n//[He pauses. His hand unconsciously goes to his side.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Something's wrong.

Sorry. You startled me.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** My apologies. But I had to gauge something.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Whether you were able to recognize an ambush. Look.\n\n\n\n//[She waves a hand out towards the empty clearing.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** There's nobody there.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Yes there is. They're everywhere. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Very good.\n\n\n\n//[An shimmer passes over the field of view. The incandescent silhouettes of hundreds of Daeva are briefly visible, crouching on the floor or standing in formation, armed with all manner of weaponry. They face the far end of the clearing.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Remarkable. They're invisible?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** A brief spell by one of the sorcerers. Simply a temporary measure.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What for?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** For this.\n\n\n\n//[Distant, a horn sounds, growing closer. For a minute, nothing happens. Then a massive, black horde rushes out of the trees, charging the Daeva line.\u00a0\u00a0The Daeva flanks rush forward, crashing into the enemy. Shouting, yelling, and screaming immediately fill the air, punctuated by the horn and the steady beats of war drums.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Those aren't the N\u00e4lka. They're... human.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** The **BLACKSTAR**'s horde, the Three-Prong Army.\n\n\n\n//[They watch as the soldiers charge out of the treeline. They are human warriors, dressed in dark armors and leathers, tanned skin visible underneath. The generals and leaders are clothed entirely in suits of plated armor. They don't appear to use any specific kinds of magic or anomalies -- just simple bronze weapons and wooden siege engines, their sheer numbers and ferocity enough to force the Daeva backwards.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** They just look like any old painting of ancient soldiers. What was their deal? \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** They scorned our magic. Not just that of the Daeva; all of ours. The N\u00e4lka, the Mekhanites as well. They had no qualms using it against us, but they were not believers. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** They must have had some kind of advantage, if they were able to take Amoni-Ram and give you a fair right. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** They did. But their advantage was not in the weapons they used -- in this sense, they were utterly human. Their advantage was in their leader. After Amoni-Ram fell, I recalled our armies from the eastern front. Half of our largest force had vanis-\n\n\n\n\u00a0//[She catches herself.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Had been killed. We were going to be marched on by the Three-Prong Army. They were too powerful for me to split my forces. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You recalled the armies to Mamjul?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No. Not to Mamjul. To Thijam, a smaller city on a narrow isthmus, forming the link between our peninsula and the mainland. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** A choke point.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Yes. The Three-Prong Army was far larger than mine. I had to reduce their numbers, so I elected to trap them at Thijam. But that took several months of full retreat. Our armies scavenging the land for sustenance while running, tails tucked between their legs, from Amoni-Ram back to the homeland. But if we didn't offer any resistance, the faster and lighter armies of the Wretch would catch up. With no supply trains, no civilians, nothing weighing them down... they would catch up, and they would massacre us.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Oh, no.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What is it? I don't understand?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** It was a feigned retreat. But she had to leave behind just enough soldiers to put up resistance and prevent the pursuing force from catching up. No chance of victory, just buying time and hoping the main force escapes.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Abandoning entire armies to the wolves.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** They were sacrifices. They knew this. Thousands of soldiers, left behind in abandoned settlements as pockets of resistance. They were little more than bumps in the road. The Wretch washed through from the desert, pushing through the last vestiges of the Mekhanite territory before smashing into our own. \n\n\n\n//[The RAJMATA sighs, and looks at the carnage occurring past the tree line. The Three-Prong Army is massive -- endless soldiers dressed in black metal armor and armed with long pikes, lances, and saw swords continue to pour out of the trees.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** So many lost.\n\n\n\n//[The scene begins to cycle. It switches to a similar scene in a more temperate jungle that is aflame. The Covenant and the Three-Prong Army clash amidst thick foliage and underbrush set on a rapidly-spreading fire. Charred bodies litter the ground, and a number of Daeva are covered in fire eating away at them. It switches to a wide, flat desert plain, with a number of Covenant soldiers forming a defensive line of thick shields. A huge force of Wretch cavalry on massive black horses crash into the waiting phalanx and shatter it, routing the army. The Abominate's forces lay siege engines against the walls of a settlement, leaping over the battlements while artillery barrages the defenses. Dozens of scenes like this play out.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** He destroyed my Empire long before he took Mamjul. We abandoned cities, people, spirits, everything to the horde. We were walking dead.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Who?\n\n\n\n//[The RAJMATA points a long hand forward. In every scene, a figure is visible. Dressed in the intricately-formed black armor of the Three-Prong Army, his head is obscured by a large, spiked metal crown. His shoulders are draped in a long, dark cape. Unlike the rest of the soldiers, his only weapon is a single sword hanging by his side. Rather than charging headlong into the fray, he remains on the front lines but in a rearward position. His expression is obscured.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** He must be their commander.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** The Blackstar.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Yes. The blood of nations drenches him. One of the most powerful beings to ever walk the face of this planet.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** He just looks like... a regular person.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** He is not a human. But he was, once. That is what makes him so dangerous. Why we could not face him directly on an open field, why I had to abandon my men to the wolves while I bought time..\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What were you buying time //for?//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I recalled the home guards of our smaller cities to the Isthmus of Thijam. \n\n\n\n//[The scene shifts to a view of a small, largely-empty narrow strip of land with seas on either side. A ramshackle village of straw huts and roots is visible near one of the beaches.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** It was once a quiet fishing village. Slaves would man vessels from sunup to sundown, bringing in their catch to be sold. There was an annual festival, wherein the catch would be slaughtered along with a number of slaves, their blood mixing and pouring into the sea, making the surf run red with blessings. This tiny strip of land connected us to the mainland, allowed us to trade with the fledgling city-states of your people. \n\n\n\n//[In fast-forward, a large, disorganized party of Daevic soldiers arrive from the north and make camp on the southern side of the isthmus. They are followed in quick succession by more forces -- bloody armies arriving in retreat from the north under scarlet banners, fresh reinforcements from the south, beasts of war, siege engines. More and more soldiers arrive, the encampment swelling to at least a hundred thousand troops, stretching far into the south, until they stop.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What, then? Just lying in wait for them to come and kill you?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Quite the opposite.\n\n\n\n//[A line of finely-dressed sorcerers stretches down the width of the isthmus, at least twenty-five kilometres. They dig their hands into the ground and, with an inhuman effort, raise the beginnings of a wall, made of intertwined stone and sand and root and vine, petrified and hardened. It slowly rises out of the ground, inch by inch, until the sorcerers collapse, many of them clearly exsanguinated of all the blood in their body. Soldiers rush forward with tools, fortifying and expanding the structure, even as the dead sorcerers are replaced, their blood spilt into the foundations of the wall, and replaced. The cycle continues as the sun sets and rises and sets and rises, until the wall is dozens of meters high and as thick as a building. Staircases and ladders let soldiers man the high battlements.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That has to be as tall as the Great Wall of China. No, taller. By a lot.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Thicker, too. How did you manage this without... architects, construction machines, anything?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Do you see the gateway?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** ...No. There isn't one.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Yes. Anyone on the other side of that wall was going to be killed. This was our last stand. That is what drove us. What drove me. The understanding that I must do what I have to do for my people to survive. Because if I didn't, we wouldn't.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** But your people didn't survive, did they? Mamjul is still at the bottom of the ocean, and the Covenant is dead. \n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No. I failed.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** We need to know what this thing is. We need to know how it broke you.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** This method of showing you my memories is... a loophole in the laws that I have been bound to. That the Daeva have been bound to. You are seeing more than any living creature in three thousand years has.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I appreciate that, but it's //not enough//. If this Blackstar still lives, if the god he serves //still exists//, we need to understand them to be able to defend ourselves. \n\n\n\n//[GALANIS swallows nervously.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I have to again pose the idea that I be allowed to commune with... your master.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** You wish to speak to the Scarlet?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Yes. It's a god, right? It knows the Abominate or the Wretch or whatever. It cast it out to sea. It's the easiest way to learn what we need to know.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Communing with the Scarlet is a dangerous task, Galanis-//hiyar//. I have been wedded to it for centuries, and I have only done so a handful of times. To commune is to invite another presence into your mind. To invite a god into your mind... like packing the seas of the world into a pot. The pressure would annihilate you from the inside-out.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** But if you have a strong enough pot. A strong enough vessel.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Perhaps then. But the last time when a man had such fortitude was the founding of our Covenant. I appreciate your struggle, but it is not a possibility.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Fine, okay.\n\n\n\n//[The RAJMATA clutches her forehead and the dream around the group shimmers.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Are you okay?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Yes. Yes. Projecting the dream is just... intensive. I am not as young as I once was. I must rest.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That sounds like a good idea. \n\n\n\n//[The projection dematerializes, melting into puddles of nothingness that drip off the boughs of the tree. They are still in the canopy of the tree, shaded by the branches. The RAJMATA is supported by a flock of the masked Brides, their horns draped in veils.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Goodbye, Greaves-//jirras// and Galanis-//hiyar//.\n\n\n\n//[GALANIS dematerializes out of the astral projection, fading into a cloud of glimmering noise. Lt. GREAVES lingers, staring at the RAJMATA.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Greaves-//jirras//?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What do you think we're doing here?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You just told me and the doctor about your sacrifice. About your willingness to do anything if it meant your people would live to see another day. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** What of it?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You failed. But we haven't yet. We might still have a shot at surviving. \n\n\n\n//[GREAVES points at the RAJMATA.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** We're willing to do whatever it takes. If you deny us access to what we need to save ourselves... it won't just be your own blood on your hands. It'll be ours too. \n\n\n\n//[GREAVES dematerializes and ends the projection.]//\n\n-----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nOn May 3rd, the first group of researchers from the Thaumaturgy Division arrived at MKF-01 via helicopter.

The research committee is already assembled and waiting. The leads are seated around the conference table, without any aides. SHERIDAN is standing.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Hello, everyone. Karl and Ajay couldn't join us today, I'm afraid. \n\n\n\n//[A low murmur of greeting runs throughout.]//\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** I'd... like to apologize for my behaviour in the last meeting, Dr. Galanis. It was inappropriate, and rude, and I should've voiced my concerns more professionally.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's... thank you, Dr. Sheridan. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** I still retain my concerns, and I think that we've gotten a little biased in our analysis, but... you know. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Of course. If we're all comfortable with moving on now, we have a new face. Welcome, Dr. Carrick.\n\n\n\n**CARRICK (THAU):** Thank you! Happy to be here. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Is your team settled in?\n\n\n\n**CARRICK (THAU):** As settled-in as one can be aboard a floating tin-can, yes.\n\n\n\n//[She laughs.]//\n\n\n\n**CARRICK (THAU):** No offense to any of you, of course. It's just that we're not a very nautical bunch. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** None of us were when the project started. Except Lucian, maybe. I'm pretty sure he was born in the Marines.\n\n\n\n//[They nudge him, and GREAVES smiles slightly.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Are you finding our analysis sufficient?\n\n\n\n**CARRICK (THAU):** Not quite, I'm afraid. It's a very solid start, especially for people who aren't thaumaturges, but all thaumaturgy really is is a framework for understanding magic. To understand what drove the Daeva's magic, and how we can utilize and recreate that, would require my team to converse directly with them. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That can be arranged. You should sit down with Crowley from Psychotronics, and arrange tests for your... apprentices? See which ones will have the easiest time getting into Korar. \n\n\n\n**CARRICK (THAU):** Researchers is fine. And that'll definitely help, but the problem is moreso that... we don't really feel comfortable tapping into spirits for our thaumaturgy yet without a greater understanding of the processes at play. What we'll be able to do without the Daeva is... limited. I'm just trying to set a realistic expectation for you -- we're simply not going to be able to do the miracles they were, at least not at first.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's fine, so long as there's progress.\n\n\n\n**YIJUN (LING):** Oh, that reminds me -- Researcher Crowley asked me to pass along a message to you, Doctor. She noticed that the equipment they use in Psychotronics to stabilize and support the astral projections were seeing increased power draw. Something about needing to work harder to keep the projection stable. I don't know what it means, but..\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's... odd. I'll get into it, thanks.\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** Speaking of progress, I have looked into the Sea Peoples, as you asked me to.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Find anything?\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** Almost nothing. The old files from Amoni-Ram indicate the Middle Kingdom pharaohs were at least aware of the anomalous empires, which might help explain why only a temple in Egypt has any record of their existence. But Amoni-Ram was also conspicously lacking in contemporary sources, and it existed fine.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Gut feeling?\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** I do not believe in coincidences, Dr. Galanis. The surviving Mekhanites spread their culture and technology throughout the Middle East and North Africa, but lacked any contemporary source. They only appeared in the Quran as Iram. The Daeva appear to have done the same for Indian culture, taking the role of Kumari Kandam. It stands to reason that this... Three-Prong Army are the kernel of truth behind the myth of the Sea People. They certainly would have had to push through the region on their way to Mamjul and beyond. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** I should mention the only thing the mundane archaeological community has ever found related to the Sea People were bronze weapons. \n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** I do not understand the relevance.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** The Rajmata mentions the Blackstar's forces looted Amoni-Ram. And scuffed fuladh looks an awful lot like bronze. It just makes too much sense. Keep looking into it.\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** Of course.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** What's up with that name, by the way? Three Prong Army, does that mean anything for the Daeva?\n\n\n\n**XIJUN (LING):** I had the same thought. I looked through the preliminary translation dictionary we've compiled of the oral language -- obviously a written one is impossible -- and as far as I can tell... nothing. It quite literally just means 'three points'.\n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** Maybe a descriptor of their military strategy? A three-pronged attack.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Could be referring to a trident. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That would certainly fit with the Sea People theory. Remind me to ask the Rajmata next time. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Also on the docket: Thijam. Based on your description of her memories, it seems like it would be an isthmus connection the landmass of -- well, I guess we're calling it Kumari Kandam now, to mainland India. \n\n\n\n**RAMASWAMY (HIST):** Isthmuses have historically been of great importance in ancient cultures. Constantinople monopolized trade between the East and West by residing on one. I do not need to tell you how critical the Suez is. It makes sense they would make their choke point there.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Yeah, but the problem is that we can't find it. We don't even have a very good understanding of what the continent looked like back then, just maps from Amoni-Ram we know are altered and maps from Blackwood's journals that are as likely to be right as they are wrong. The narrowest point of the isthmus could be a kilometre south of the tip of India, a hundred, or even inland. There's just no way to know. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I'll see what information I can get, but keep working on it.\n\n\n\n//[He sighs.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Is there something else?\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Permission to speak freely?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I'm not your commanding officer, Levi. Say what's on your mind.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** It feels like we're at a point where we've run out of knowledge to collect. And we're not any closer to finding out our answers.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's not true, we've learned a lot about the Daeva. What they were, what happened to the world after Amoni-Ram fell. \n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** I'm an archaeologist, Doctor. I know first-hand what it means to search after knowledge most people will never appreciate, for the sake of nothing but the knowledge itself. But if this Blackstar stuff is still an existential threat... we need knowledge we can apply. And we're not getting that here.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Dr. Carrick is making a great start on applying Daeva magic. That's not applicable.\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** Yeah, but--\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** As the representative from the Council, they're quite pleased with how the project is progressing under Dr. Galanis.\n\n\n\n//[Everyone turns to look at GREAVES. He remains silent.]//\n\n\n\n**SHERIDAN (ARCH):** I'm not questioning your leadership, Doctor. I'm just saying that I think it's time to go to the source of the knowledge.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Well, I'll take that into account. You guys know what you're working on.

I appreciate it.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I was telling the truth. \n\n\n\n//[He shrugs his rifle out of the way, removes a lighter from his vest pocket, and lights a cigarette before lifting it to his lips and taking a drag.]//\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Still. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I've worked in the Foundation very nearly all my life. Our academics tend to get... myopic. Sometimes they need a reminder of who's signing their paychecks. No offense.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** None taken. You're hardly wrong -- though it's also not a problem confined to the Foundation.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I'm sure. It's just all I know.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You've really been working for them -- for us your whole life?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I was twenty-one when Vietnam ended. No college, no prospects. Had a friend who said he knew a government agency that was willing to hire veterans who didn't ask questions. Did a year in Site Security, then worked in all sorts of Mobile Task Forces. Nu-7, Zeta-9, Eta-5, until I got handpicked for the big one. \n\n\n\n//[Silence as GREAVES takes another drag.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** So you've killed people, then.\n\n\n\n//[He looks at them askance.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Sorry.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You're alright. Yeah, I've killed people. But I'm not one of those Kilgore nutjobs. I don't take any pleasure in it, and at least for the Foundation, I know it serves a greater purpose than some... political game.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** How's that?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Shooting at rice farmers with AKs to stop the Red Menace isn't doing anything for anyone. Shooting at someone who plans to release and re-capture the lizard to use in his Nazi PMC? Yeah, I feel pretty comfortable doing that. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Still, I mean... it can't be easy, right? Killing someone.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Oh, no. \n\n\n\n//[He shakes his head.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Killing someone is the easiest thing in the world. It's what comes after that's the hard part.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** How do you deal with it?\n\n\n\n//[GREAVES takes another drag from the cigarette,]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I have a kid. She's 13. Plays the clarinet. These people, the Mekhanites and Serpent's Hand and whoever, would have her live in a world filled with danger, where science and human society can't survive, where wizards and terrifying monsters are a real possibility. I ask myself what I would do to ensure that she has a future to look forward to.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** The answer?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Pretty much anything.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Explains the loyalty.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Foundation's the only thing holding this world together. Yeah, I take orders to kill for them, because it's my role to play. \n\n\n\n//[He offers the cigarette to GALANIS, who waves their hand.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I was never any good at taking orders. I'm still not.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You seem to be doing fine. O5-1 certainly thinks so.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I'm being pulled in about thirty different directions at once. The half of the research committee that thinks we've all gone off the deep end, the half of the research committee that thinks the others are being ethnocentric troglodytes, the Council, O5-1, the Rajmata, not to mention the Initiative itself... \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Conflicting orders are a bitch. That's for certain.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** It's a lot of pressure.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You'll get it done.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Why does everyone seem so //sure// of that? \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Because you're a leader, kid. Leaders rise to the occasion. They do what has to be done.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I don't //feel// like a leader. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** That's usually the first sign you'll make a good one.\n\n\n\n//[They stand in silence for some time, watching the waves. It is late afternoon, and the cloudless sky seems to stretch on forever.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Awfully calm.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's what it looks like.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Not to you?\n\n\n\n//[They shake their head.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** No. And no one seems to realize it. Well, except for you.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Me?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You've sat in on all the meetings with the Rajmata. We're about to learn how the Wretch destroyed Mamjul. And once we have that... show's over. The Council has what it wants, and we transition fully to trying to weaponize the knowledge we've worked so hard to collect.\n\n\n\n//[GREAVES flicks the cigarette butt into the sea. It floats on the water for a moment before sinking out of sight.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You don't think we should use what we've learned from them to defend ourselves?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I think that we have an ethical responsibility to both respect the Daeva's culture, and to make sure they don't get any power. Because the last time they did, they enslaved a solid chunk of the population of Asia. And I think that the last time we tried to weaponize the powers of one of these cultures...\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I don't see how researching their magic to apply ourselves is inherently evil. There's risks, for sure -- I've heard about Project London Bridge, but that was thirty years ago. We're better at this sort of thing now.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Honestly, I don't think it's evil either. But... it's complicated. It's also not what I signed up for. I'm a historian, and I came here to study history no one had ever seen before. Not this. I feel like...\n\n\n\n//[They sigh.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Like we're standing on a precipice, and no one realizes it except for me.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Nobody you can talk to?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** The only other person who's ever been in this position is currently a fugitive from Foundation custody, so...\n\n\n\n//[They both chuckle.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Fair enough. Well, if you ever do need an ear...\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Thanks. Really. We have a session with the Rajmata tomorrow night, by the way. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I remember. This should answer some outstanding questions. Any reason we're waiting?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** The Psychotronics team is fiddling with the machinery. There have been some issues with people randomly dropping out of the projection, like a bad phone connection. Not sure what to make of it yet, but hopefully it's just an equipment issue. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Hopefully.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Hey, Lucian -- you have a higher clearance than me, right?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** That's not really how clearance works, but sure.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Hm. That... weird effect when the Rajmata said Blackstar, Got me thinking so I ran a few queries against the Memetics Division database, keep running into blockers. Redactions, expungements, clearance checks.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** With MEMDIV, they're probably there for good reason. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Still, I think it could be of use. Would you mind bringing it up to the Council, next time you check in? Just, you know, pass along the request.\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Sure, kid. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Thanks.

Lightning strikes aimlessly in the distance, spiderwebbing acoss the dark sky before fizzling out.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Greetings, your Grace.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Look. What do you see?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** The astral plane. Emptiness.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** What //is// it, though? What is the essence of the astral plane?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** It's... another layer to reality, right? Superimposed on top of our own.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Not incorrect, but at once not what I was hoping to hear.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** It's a dream.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Ah. He understands.\n\n\n\n//[She waves a long, slender hand out.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** All this was once supported by the minds of everyone in our sister city, when they dreamt. Our existence depended on them, and theirs on us. Now, there is no Mamjul to rely on. Korar rests entirely on the dream of the Scarlet Maharaja. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Your husband.\n\n\n\n//[She pauses.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I suppose. We have no particular word for a male spouse -- every relationship in the world is formed of the dominant and the subservient elements. Master, and slave. I am master to my people, and the Maharaja is master to me.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You don't have a conception of gender, then. Interesting.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Not in the way you would think of it. The physical body is... irrelevant. All our souls rest in Korar, and the form one takes in Mamjul in between reincarnations should not dictate their lot in life. Surely they have experienced enough lives in enough forms to make any such determination irrelevant. People are what they wished to be. No more.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Interesting. \n\n\n\n//[Silence for a moment, as the party looks out before the wasteland beyond the walls.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** So are we--\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Yes.\n\n\n\n//[Distantly, the chanting of the city takes on a different tone. Less wildly harmonious, and more into a somber register. A slower melody, the words so long and deep as to be incomprehensible. At the same time, the view changes. Grass sprouts out of nowhere far below and spreads, trees forming out of nonexistence. The sky goes from star-studded blackness to a deep blue, the sun hanging overhead. Korar melts away behind them, replaced by vast plains, and countless figures crawl out of the dust.]//\n\n\n\n//[In a few moments, they are standing atop the battlement at the Wall of Thijum. In front of them lies a vast, unspeakably large army. Formed into tight regiments, they mass around the base of the wall with siege engines that are not even half the height of the gargantuan barrier. At this height, each soldier is the size of an ant, and the swarm spreads far, far into the foggy distance.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** That has to be... half a million men.

On the other side of the wall lies another massive force -- not as unfathomably large as the Three-Prong Army, but the Daevic Covenant occupy the vast kilometers of beach between them and the jungle line. They are organized into massive lines, polearms extended to meet a charge. From this height, far to the south, beyond the Daevic Covenant, the huge boughs of the Citadel tree are visible. The wall is the only thing that separates the two forces.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** This has to be that largest battle ever fought. At least a million men, on one battlefield. The mother of all chokepoints. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Such was my belief. That the sheer size of the wall and the army would demoralize them. I was, needless to say, fatally incorrect.\n\n\n\n//[In fast-forward, the sun sets and drops below the horizon. A scattering of huge bonfires form on both sides of the wall, soldiers gathering around them. The siege engines have been disassembled -- the attempts at scaling the wall are obviously pointless. Instead, they are reassembled into a collection of trebuchets, catapults, and ballistas, all aimed at the top of the wall. With large, heavy booms, their payloads of huge stone boulders and explosive tar collide with the battlements. Daeva soldiers huddle behind the stone barriers as the wall shakes with every impact. Shakes, but holds firm, hour after hour, night after night, as they return fire with their own weapons of war and sorcerers.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I underestimated the interminable nature of human persistence. I thought they would realize the wall was impenetrable. Not just physically -- I sealed it myself, with a ward wrought in blood. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Blood sacrifices are common in your magical school. What's so special about this one?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** They are. But the more powerful the sacrifice, the stronger the magic. //[Pause]// I rest comfortable in the knowledge that my children would have been slaughtered regardless of whether the horde broke through. \n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You... killed your //children//?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Seven bodies, seven wards, seven chains to protect the Scarlet Maharaja from those that would seek to destroy him. Their souls belonged to Korar, to him. I simply did what he commanded, and released their physical form with the same dagger I was anointed with.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** The black dagger KHAN team found in the throne room. That's why it survived when nothing else did.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Their flesh, so sweet, so innocent. The ultimate sacrifice for the ultimate protection.\n\n\n\n//[Suddenly, she turns and spits on the stone wall.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** And look now.\n\n\n\n//[The scene continues to fast-forward. The sun rises, and sets, and rises, and sets. The siege carries on for a week, then two weeks, then a month, then two months, then six. The wall continues to be battered, and stand firm. The vines and toxic clouds and poisoners falling from the walls collide below, thinning out the Blackstar's forces, before they are immediately crowded out and replaced. The defenders are killed and replaced by more reserves from the amassed army. Sorcerers raise water spirits to destroy any attempt to cross from the sea.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** They're not going away. Laying siege to it, just like how they did to Amoni-Ram. But... Mamjul is protected, far to the south. You're clearly holding out. What happened?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Their master arrived.\n\n\n\n//[A ravine forms in the vast army as soldiers separate, standing a respectful distance away from one figure. He appears to be a regular man, but his very presence is larger than life -- the battlefield bows toward him as he makes his way to the encampment, flanked by his guard. A full moon hangs overhead in the smoky sky. He disappears into a tent.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What the //hell// is that thing? Every time I look at him--\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** It feels like my brain is boiling. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Yeah. Like he can //see// me. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Most magicians in this world are simply that -- magicians. Sorcerers, warlocks. People who have a particular leaning towards the esoteric arts and have studied years to apply them to perform even the slightest magic. He... is something else. The world itself shapes around him.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Oh, //shit.// A reality bender. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Has to be Class 4, at least. Maybe Class 5.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That's theoretical.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** They're all theoretical, Pan. We haven't seen anything above Class 2 in decades.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I do not understand. Explain.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** They're called ontokinetics. Reality benders, more informally. People who can mold the world to whatever they want. This is the most powerful we've seen in a long, long time.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Hm. I see. Such is the blessing of a god.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What did he do? I honestly don't know how reality-bending would interact with... the magic you did. It's an unexplored field.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** He stayed, in that tent, for seven days and seven nights. And for all that time, the Abominate, the Wretch, his god hung overhead, lending him power.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What do you -- the //moon?//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Look.\n\n\n\n//[Ahead, the bright whiteness of the full moon over the battlefield is fading as it blackens. It sinks low, a dark star in the sky, blackened and scorched, surrounded by a corona of white light, burning like the eye of a great dead god. After some time, the sun rises, but the moon remains locked in place, hovering over the horde. The tides of the sea malform, twisting and turning, rising and falling in different directions.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Do you feel it?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I feel... sick to my stomach. Like I'm going to vomit.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Yes. This is the Wretch. Primarch of chaos, lord of disorder. Where it goes, the natural laws that govern us fail. Once, the Mekhanites accused us of being wild people. In a sense they were right, but even in the most untamed wilds, a natural harmony emerges. Survival of the fittest, domination of the meek, the cycle of life. That is what the Scarlet embodies.\n\n\n\n//[She looks out towards the battlefield as the waters rise even higher and turn into rough, raging seas, inching up the beach, constricting the Daevic forces into tighter columns.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** And on the eighth day, he emerged, bathed in the blood of my people.\n\n\n\n//[A figure exits the tent. The army separates around him, flowing like water, as he marches, alone, to the base of the wall. The defenders sling vines and casks and magic, and all disintegrate before ever reaching him. A storm has gathered overhead -- dark clouds, hard sheets of cold rain slamming into the muddy ground and the stone walls. Lightning spiderwebs across the sky and the seas slam into the land as the black moon watches its prophet make his way to the base of the wall, and kneel, brow dripping sweat, hands dripping blood.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** And he raised his hands, and--\n\n\n\n= **[CONNECTION SEVERED]**\n\n\n\n//[The projection dematerializes. Dr. GALANIS reawakens aboard the// Haffkine//, gasping for air and clutching their head.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What the fuck just happened?\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** ...Luce?\n\n-----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the astral projection, a sudden and unprecedented\u00a0\u00a0equipment failure occurred in the Psychotronics Lab aboard the //Haffkine//. The projection lost connection, and several pieces of equipment were heavily damaged. Doctor Galanis awoke unharmed, but for unknown reasons, Lieutenant Greaves remained unconscious and in the fugue state; an hour later, he slipped into a coma. \n\n\n\nThe immediate assessment by Psychotronics Division personnel and medical personnel aboard the //Phantom// was that the LSAP Array embedded in Lt. Greaves' brain resulted in some kind of adverse reaction to the psychic backlash, or was in fact the cause thereof. Before any decision could be reached on moving him to the infirmary, or extracting the Array from his brain, the Array reactivated despite no longer being attached to any discernable power source. The transcript printer it was attached to begin printing a large amount of nonsense text with no clear meaning or purpose, and extremely faint delta waves were detected from Lt. Greaves in an EKG.\n\n\n\nPer Dr. Galanis' orders, the //Haffkine// was temporarily quarantined. Reentry into Korar was not possible until replacement components for the damaged equipment were rush-ordered from the nearby MKF-02 and delivered via helicopter to the ships. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the project, typical Foundation practices to obscure logistical transportation were ignored. The components were installed on May 25th, and, two days after contact was lost, Dr. Galanis reentered the astral projection with the directive of assessing Lt. Greaves' status and, if possible, recovering him.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MAY 2003\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**SOURCE:** Doctor Pandora Galanis\n\n----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n**CROWLEY:** Remember, Doctor.

Yeah, okay. \n\n\n\n//[CROWLEY hands GALANIS a small plastic cup with two RL-023 pills. They down them with a cup of water, and lean back in their seat, closing their eyes. They drift away, leaving their body, settling through space. Then they open their eyes.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Luce!\n\n\n\n//[They are standing where they had been before the projection dematerialized: on the wall of Thijum, overlooking the vaste horde of the Three-Prong Army. But time is frozen -- the sheets of rain hang in the air, trembling. The surf of the rough waves is frozen in mid-splash. But despite the stillness, it is not silent -- drums beat through the air, far, far louder than ever before. The voices making up the chorus are high and strong, reaching a loud peak as they sing out from every direction. The RAJMATA and GREAVES stand overlooking the tableau. He turns.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Pandora!\n\n\n\n//[They run to greet each other.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What happened? You just vanished. It's been hours.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Lucian, it's been... three days. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I don't understand.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** There was an accident. An equipment failure in the lab. It pulled us out of the projection but... you didn't wake up. You slipped into a coma. And the Array kept outputting nonsense text, stuff about dreams and waves and the sea. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I'm in a //coma?//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** It's okay. Calm down. We're gonna wake you up.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Not yet.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Fuck that. We're leaving.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Listen around you. Listen to the dreams, the growth of the words, spreading across, covering all. The Song of the Daeva has arrived at its final verses, the crescendo. Crafted by us even as the waves bore down, so that we would always remember who wrent us.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Sure, but I don't see how--\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** **Listen.** You cannot leave now. You have come so far. We have both come so far. You must listen to our Song. You must be our chronicler. \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** We can come back, we'll--\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** You will not be able to come back.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** We always have in the past. The equipment's been repaired, we'll return once Lucian's been treated.\n\n\n\n//[The RAJMATA sighs, holding her head. The world around them shudders and glimmers for a moment.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Did you see that?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** The failure of the projection was not a failure of your equipment, Galanis-//hiyar//. The dream... //Korar// has been splitting apart, failing, fraying at the edges of our great tapestry. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What does that mean? This is the Maharaja's dream, isn't it? \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** And he was able to support us, quietly worshipping him, for three thousand years. We had a balance -- a harmony formed of primal violence. And your arrival has upset it. Upset him.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Well, we didn't mean--\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Your intentions do not matter now, I'm afraid. The dream is collapsing. Leave now, and there will be no Korar for you to return to. The secrets of the Daeva will go with us to whatever lies beyond paradise.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You'll all be destroyed, you mean.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** There is no body willing to take the interminable burden of being the Maharaja, the Dreamer. A Daeva cannot do it -- we need one of the Covenant. A human. The Maharaja's physical body has long since rotted into dust, at the bottom of the sea. There is no one.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** We'll find a different way. Lucian--\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** No. We have to listen.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Are you insane? We already have no idea how much time has passed--\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** This is it. This is the home stretch. If we don't take it home now, it'll all have been for nothing.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** But--\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I have an obligation. I'm staying.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Fine! \n\n\n\n//[They turn to the RAJMATA.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Hurry.\n\n\n\n//[With a deep groan from the RAJMATA, the dream suddenly continues. The rain slams down, the waves crash, the Blackstar slams his palms against the ground, and the ground begins to shake as the moon hangs yet lower. Against the crescendo of drums, the Daevic army tightens its grip on its weapons and braces itself for a charge that will never come.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** He knew he could not take the wall. So he broadened his scope. Like the animal that sees he cannot drag home the carcass, and resolves to consume it all then. His god was thrown into the sea, and spent a thousand years crawling back up to land. Only to turn around and do the same to us.\n\n\n\n//[The waves on either side of the Isthmus crash again, this time substantially higher. The army looks to their sides and again tightens, only for the waves to grow even higher. The forces at the rear begin a retreat, one that quickly turns to a rout. The army rushes back even as the water rushes forth from either side, drowning the base of the wall. The ground shudders again, and the soldiers in the center of the mass realize what is happening. The sea is not rising. They are sinking.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Look.\n\n\n\n//[They float off the top of the wall, rising into the air higher and higher, climbing well into the sky, past the clouds until the miniscule soldiers disappear completely. Finally, they stop at a birds-eye view of the entire region: the continent is a large freehanging peninsula extending forth from the tip of the Indian subcontinent. Thijum lies at the thinnest point, and Mamjul lies near the center of the peninsula. As they watch, the entire landmass grows incrementally, marginally smaller. The moon draws yet closer, pulling the water, sinking Kumari Kandam beneath the waves. The coastal areas disappear in a frothing mass of blue as the waters make their way inland in raging floods and violent rain. Bit by bit, the entire continent drops below the sea, until only the highest point, a small patch of land containing Mamjul, remains.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** The deluge. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** He... sank an entire continent, alone. That was millions of people, at least.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No. By himself, he could have flooded the plain, routed my army. The wall would still prevent him from crossing south and taking Mamjul. But by invoking his god, who lent him its power? Yes, he could sink a continent as easily as slitting a throat.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** That was it. The annihilation of the Daeva. Wiped out in a matter of hours.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No, Galanis-//hiyar//. That was not the annihilation of the Daeva. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What could possibly be worse than that?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Witness the final hours of Mamjul.\n\n\n\n//[The scene shifts to the streets of the city. Terrified, confused screaming fills the air as civilians, slaves, and soldiers run in every direction, attempting to escape to higher ground that does not exist. Mothers carry their babies, or are forced to leave them behind by the shoving of the crowd. Sorcerers rush to the battlements but find their abilities useless against the raging sea. Some citizens even raise their swords to slit their own throats, secure in their future in Korar. Throughout all this the dream is strange, fragmented. It sounds and looks as through passed through a thousand filters, breaking apart the image and putting it back together again. In front of the group lies a grand, marble-panelled building.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** This is the library. The dilapidated one we found in Mamjul, filled with blank tablets.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Destroying us was not enough for the Blackstar. No, where the Mekhanites had ignored him until it was too late, we fought back. We held back the horde. For this affront, for daring to stand against him, he was not content to destroy us. He had to annihilate us. \n\n\n\n//[Scholars run through the halls of the huge Library, Daeva and human. They carry huge armfuls of scrolls and tablets, plinths and statuettes, all carved with complex, swimming writing and pictographs, rushing to get them out of the way of the flood. But even as they do so, the tablets fade, as though rubbed clean of their etchings. The ink on the scrolls melts away. The statuettes and plinths lose all features and writing, and the carved etchings throughout the rest of the hall are rubbed just as clean. The scholars stare at their objects in wide-eyed shock, even as cold water begins to seep in from under the door.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** He... wiped you from the historical record. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** The Daevic Empire, once the pride of scholars and artists the world over, now reduced to nothing. No evidence of our existence. No writings, no monuments, no great chronicles to survive us.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** //Damnatio memoriae//. Condemnation of memory. The ancient practice of scrubbing undesirable figures from official histories. But something on this scale... \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** He was breaking your spirit. \n\n\n\n//[The memory again flickers, twitching and melting in places.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** The Maharaja's dream is collapsing. We must hurry.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What does that //mean?!//\n\n\n\n//[They rise again into the sky, to a birds-eye view of Mamjul. The raging waters around it build up against the triangular walls of the city, forming a thin barrier as the water rises, until it spills over. Buildings collapse, citizens drown under the deluge, forming a living wall of bloated bodies bearing down on others. They watch as, over the course of minutes, Mamjul sinks into the ocean, exterminated of all life, a dead city sinking to its watery grave. The boughs of the Citadel tree are the last to disappear under the waves.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Now you see. We were destroyed. Totally and utterly, and the Song of the Daeva our only record of ourselves. I apologize for the deception, but I needed you to understand. To remember us, when there is no longer a dying king's dream to support us.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** But why didn't you just--\n\n\n\n//[A loud, resounding explosion sounds from above, ringing through the heavens.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Is that the dream falling apart?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No. That was not from the dream.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Section 001.8\n\n+++ {{INCIDENT HIEROPHANT}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n2 hours and 44 minutes into Dr. Galanis' projection, the various sonar equipment placed in Mamjul's ruins by the Diving Team also began reporting localized underwater disturbances.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, several covert monitoring buoys that had been spread in concentric circles around the location of SCP-001 began pinging the bridge of the //Phantom// reporting multiple unknown objects detected in the vicinity.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MAY 2003\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n= **<<RADIO CHATTER -- PHANTOM BRIDGE TO OVERWATCH COMMAND>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n**PHANTOM:** Overwatch Command, this is FMS //Phantom//, do you copy?\n\n\n\n**OVCOM:** We have your signal locked.

The research staff stare at each other worriedly, as the alarms continue to sound.]//\n\n\n\n//[In the Psychotronics Lab, several MTF Alpha-1 personnel move in, sealing the door behind them, and take up defensive positions around the bodies of Dr. Galanis and Lt.

The large-caliber rounds from the Mekhanite weapons slam into the barricades at high velocity, a few tearing completely through personnel, who collapse onto the ground, bleeding out.]//\n\n\n\n> **OVCOM:** Additional reinforcements have been scrambled. An Indian Navy patrol group\u00a0\u00a0has been requisitioned, and is en route to your location. Fixed-wing aircraft have already been launched and are en-route.\n\n> \n\n> **PHANTOM:** But--\n\n> \n\n> **OVCOM:** We can amnesticize them after. Under no circumstances can the Mekhanites be allowed to take MKF-01. You need to survive until the support arrives.\n\n\n\n//[With the close-quarters combat occuring on both decks, the remaining aerial Mekhanites can no longer effectively dive-bomb, and slam into the decks of the ships, drawing their weapons and making another advance. Under heavy machine-gun fire, a handful drop to the ground, but most continue advancing.]//\n\n\n\n> **ALLARD:** We're getting fucking massacred out here!\n\n> \n\n> **POLRYS:** Bridge, we need reinforcements //now!//\n\n\n\n//[Through one of the doors, a group of hooded and armored personnel exit, shoulderpads emblazoned with the sigil of the Thaumaturgy Division. They form a small phalanx, one drawing a sigil in the air that expands into a moving, translucent barrier. They press forward onto the deck where the firefight is occuring -- the barrier trembles under the assault, but holds.]//\n\n\n\n> **LIAN:** //Are those the fucking wizards!?//\n\n> \n\n> **CARRICK:** Cover us! We're going to try to disable them!\n\n> \n\n> **OKONKWO:** Move starboard, keep the lane clear for them!\n\n\n\n//[The thaumaturges move forward, coming into within a few meters of the Mekhanites. CARRICK holds the barrier while the others brace themselves against the ground and whisper. A few moments later, green, expanding vines creep out through the cracks in the deck and wrap around the ankles of one of the Mekhanites, causing him to crash into the ground. An Alpha-1 operative leans around the cover and empties a magazine into his unprotected nape.]//\n\n\n\n> **VERNE:** Shit, that worked! Keep going!\n\n> \n\n> **CARRICK:** It's too energy-intensive, we can only get one at a time! We just don't have the power!\n\n\n\n//[The phalanx is temporarily pushed back by one of the Mekhanites charging them. On the Haffkine, Alpha-1 personnel also flood out of the doors to the bridge and lay down suppressing fire from their weaponry. These weapons cause slightly more visible damage, but still fail to stop the advance towards the bridge.]//\n\n\n\n> **PHANTOM:** All personnel, //hold the line//. Reinforcements are on their way.\n\n> \n\n> **JEFFREY:** They're not going to get here in time!

Dead personnel and Mekhanites litter the decks, and the gunfire is deafening. From a bird's-eye view, it is clear that the Mekhanite advance is slow but steady, moving inch after inch towards the bridge and the access to the lower decks.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What the hell is this?!\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** What is currently occurring in the material plane above Mamjul.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Wait, this is //happening?!// \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** It's the fucking Mekhanites. How the hell did they find us?\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** They must've caught the emergency equipment transfer. Shit. //SHIT!//\n\n\n\n//[GREAVES turns to the RAJMATA.]//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** You need to let me out of here. Right fucking now. \n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Look at it. It is a massacre. Your weaponry, even your primitive understanding of our magic, cannot hold a candle to the Mekhanites in their prime. And they have advanced quite--\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I don't care. Let me out.\n\n\n\n//[The RAJMATA cocks her head.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** You would walk into certain death?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Those are //my men// getting slaughtered out there. We'll find a way to turn the tide.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** You will not.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Then the least I can do is die alongside them.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You can't keep us here.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I cannot. And you have what you wanted from me. And I from you.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Then //let me go//.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I am not keeping you here, Greaves-//jirras//. Your mind is.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What are you talking about?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** We have been meeting for a year, and not once in that time have I ever shown the power to trap you into the projection. Only your mind can do such a thing. Your current state was caused entirely by what your doctors thought: the object in your brain.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** How the hell do you know about that?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I'm... dead?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No. But both of you are in a torpor, from which you are unlikely to awaken. Certainly not before the Mekhanites kill your men, make it to the lower deck, and slit your throat along with those of everyone else on board. And I know this because the Scarlet whispered it to the Maharaja, and he to me. Your future is written in the trees, I'm afraid.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** No. No. This can't be right. There has to be something we can do.\n\n\n\n//[On the decks, the firefight continues, as the personnel are worn down and pushed back.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** There is.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What? Tell me.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** I have told you of how Korar is collapsing. How the strain has sucked out the last vestiges of the Maharaja's energy, sapped into nothing after almost a thousand years.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** I thought you were supposed to be the Eternal City!\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** A lie. The astral projection was never meant to be an afterlife. It was only a matter of time. And you accelerated our time.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Get to the point.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** The Maharaja is dead. Korar is dying. But were it that the Scarlet could select a new host... not only would the Daeva survive, but you witnessed the power of the Blackstar when he had his God's favor. Turning the tide of this battle would be trivial.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** You told me humans would be destroyed if we tried to commune with the Scarlet!\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Most. But I have been watching you, Greaves-//jirras//. The Scarlet has told me your people, your Foundation, are sliding towards a war none of you can prevent. You are a soldier, a warrior-king. You are strong. You wish to protect your people.\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** What are you talking about?\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Strike a new Covenant. Become our Maharaja, our king in slumber. And destroy your enemies.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** This is insane. This is completely insane. We're not going to--\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I'll do it.\n\n\n\n//[GALANIS turns to GREAVES.]//\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** //What?!//\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** Whatever this is. Accept the Scarlet. Just give me the power to stop this.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Lucian, are you out of your mind?! \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** I said I'd do anything, kid. \n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** We'll //find another way!// You saw the reports, we can't let the Daeva return to power. This is just one battle! \n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** No. No, she's not talking about just this.\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** No.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** What are you two talking about?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** There's a storm coming, Pandora. Something bigger than the Mekhanites, than any of us. The Foundation needs to survive.\n\n\n\n//[The vision crackles and sags, like film put to a match.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** We are out of time. \n\n\n\n//[She claps her hands, and the vision melts away. The group is standing in the antechamber of the Citadel -- not in Korar, but in the ruined throne room in Mamjul. Behind the throne, in front of the epicenter of the massive floor carving that spreads across the building. The RAJMATA claps her hands again, and the wooden floor splits apart, curling back to reveal a hollow space. Inside lies the desiccated, mummified corpse of a man, skin stretched taut, a black headdress resting on his brow. A single red jewel is embedded into the headdress, shining like an ocean of blood.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Our Maharaja. My master. Take it, as he took the jewel from the roots of the trees so many centuries ago.\n\n\n\n**GALANIS:** Luce. Please. Don't do it. You don't know what you're unleashing.\n\n\n\n//[GREAVES reaches in and grips the stone firmly, pulling. It resists, but then gives way, tearing out of the Maharaja's headdress, leaving a gaping hole. As he watches, the Maharaja's body falls in on itself, drying even further, turning to dust, fading. The stone whispers to him: promises of salvation, of divination, of victory against the enemy.]//\n\n\n\n**RAJMATA:** Now place the stone where it belongs.\n\n\n\n//[The far wall contains the engraving of the tree of life, of the Daeva and the humans dancing around it, of the Scarlet watching over them. GREAVES walks over, as if in a trance, and raises the stone. The wall falls away, peeling back and receding, splintering into nothing, revealing its secret. Behind the space lies an infinite scarlet ocean, a miasma of shifting and spiralling redness, stretching far into a horizon that cannot possibly exist. It speaks with the voice of a hundred thousand souls sacrificed in its name, as a great and terrible idea. A god.]//\n\n\n\n**THE SCARLET:** WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO SACRIFICE?\n\n\n\n**GREAVES:** //[Slight pause]// Everything.\n\n\n\n//[It does not respond; it does not need to. The red beckons forth, and I step forward, across the threshold, into everything. It is around me, in me. The primal knowledge of what was before and what will be, the natural law written millions of years before any life existed. It is infinitely complex, and at once deeply simple. I see everything.

For a moment, the Mekhanites pause their advance. In the center of the three ships, a circle of red light begins to form in the water, perhaps 10m across. It steadily increases in brightness and intensity.]//\n\n\n\n> **PHANTOM:** What //is that?//\n\n\n\n//[A single figure, wreathed in fire, breaks through the surface of the sea, immediately boiling the water around it to vapor that sprays outward. It rises into the air, a blur of red shooting up to twice the height of the// Phantom //and moving until it is hovering over the deck.]//\n\n\n\n> **PHANTOM:** Visual contact. A red-skinned nude figure, flying above the ship.\n\n> \n\n> **OVCOM:** Mekhanite?\n\n> \n\n> **PHANTOM:** No. No, it doesn't appear to be. It's not wearing any armor -- or anything, actually, and I don't see any augments. It's glowing, though. A corona of red light. The Mekhanites stopped -- they're just staring at it. \n\n\n\n//[The figure reaches one hand out of the corona of light, waving it across the dozens of Mekhanites on the deck of the// Phantom//. The vines left abandoned by the Thaumuturgy Division suddenly engorge with thorns and violently outstretch, far more aggressive than they were. They wrap around the torsos of a slew of the Mekhanites, pulling them to the ground, burrowing through their eye sockets and mouths into their bodies, tearing them apart from the inside, leaving pools of viscera and blood-soaked augments.]//\n\n\n\n//[The remaining Mekhanites turn their weapons on the floating figure, barraging it with spears, rifles, and conventional firearms. Several of the flying units take to the air, making a run at it. It lazily waves another hand. They stop in midair, clutching at their implants. The bare skin where their augments are attached turns yellow, then green, then black, rotting in real time. It oozes with pus and disintegrates, the dead tissue tearing away from the living, their implants going with it, and their limbless torsos fall screaming into the sea.]//\n\n\n\n//[It turns its attention to the handful of remaining hostiles. They are preparing a retreat, about to leap over the edge of the ship and back into the sea. Some even make it, but they do not survive the fall -- their bodies split apart, vines and roots forming from inside them and tearing through their skin and flesh as they force an exit. Many are simply bisected, their bloody halves falling into the sea and sinking, turning the water red with blood as it pools around the ships. The battle is over; in the course of 40 seconds, the figure has eviscerated over a hundred Mekhanites.]//\n\n\n\n> **PHANTOM:** It just... killed them. \n\n> \n\n> **OVCOM:** //Sitrep, please.//\n\n> \n\n> **PHANTOM:** It massacred them.

It just brutalized them.\n\n> \n\n> **OVCOM:** Treat as hostile, Phantom.\n\n\n\n//[The figure begins to descend from its hovering position. It becomes clear that it is essentially a disembodied nervous system wrapped in a translucent red layer. As it descends, it begins to take firm shape -- bones grow, muscles knit themselves into place, though the figure never grows skin. Standing well over 3m tall and with large horns on its head, its skin is inscribed with symbols and markings that pulse to an inaudible rhythm. As it reaches the deck of the Phantom, MTF Alpha-1 operatives fan out from behind cover, supported by security personnel. They surround the figure in a circle, guns drawn and all pointed directly at its head. It does not react.]//\n\n\n\n> **PHANTOM:** Wait.\n\n> \n\n> **OVCOM:** What?\n\n\n\n//[The figure looks up, raising a hand in greeting.]//\n\n\n\n> **WILCOX:** ...Lieutenant Greaves?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe figure, temporarily designated SCP-001-KING, surrendered to security forces and was detained in a secure holding cell aboard the //Phantom//.

This Covenant is contingent on several factors, and may be broken off if either party feels it has been wronged or betrayed.\n\n\n\n* The Daevic Empire will surrender knowledge on thaumaturgy that is capable of being utilized against hostile threats.\n\n* The Daevic Empire will remain in the astral plane, and make no attempts to forcibly breach through to the material plane.\n\n* The Daevic Empire will not intentionally expose their existence, the Foundation's, or the anomalous to non-Veil societies.\n\n\n\nIn return:\n\n\n\n* The Foundation will act as the human arm of the Covenant, affecting the material plane in the stead of GoI-019.\n\n* A small number of personnel will be permitted to become temporary hosts of Daeva, thereby significantly escalating their thaumaturgic ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, as the Daevic Empire has been ontologically scrubbed from baseline reality by the Blackstar, the Foundation will take a leading role in restoring them. While they will not be given physical form, interviews with Daeva and the Rajmata indicate that the presence of a physical, written record of the Daeva's history will significantly stabilize Korar and begin restoring the vast historical records in Mamjul and across the Indian subcontinent that were obliterated by the Blackstar's //damnatio memoriae//. \n\n\n\nAs their presence in baseline reality retroactively increases, so will the thaumaturgic power they can supply to the Foundation. This effect will apply retroactively -- as the document is extended and completed, more ancient artifacts and ruins of the Daeva will be unearthed. \n\n\n\nThis anomalous effect has been classified as SCP-140, and applied to the current most complete record of the history of the Daeva: this document. Under containment protocol [[span class=\"label\"]]HERODOTUS[[/span]], SCP-001-JADE has been separated into 5 \"acts\", each covering, in parallel, a broad period of the Daeva's history from the Song of the Daeva, and the events leading to their rediscovery, and the file has been designated the primary vector of SCP-140. It is recommended for perusal in its redacted forms by all cleared Foundation personnel; as more personnel go through this document, the more the Foundation's thaumaturgic capacity increases. \n\n\n\nAs the Mamjul-Korar Initiative shifts into its new goals of training thaumaturges in Daeva magic, global Foundation priorities are to be shifted towards the investigation and approval of Thaumiel-class anomalies, particularly those effective in combat applications. Project OLYMPIA has been expedited. \n\n\n\nGlobal Threat Level has once again been elevated to Keneq-5. Project FORERUNNER TRIAD is to dedicate all possible resources to identifying, locating, and securing the final remaining city: the N\u00e4lka city of Black Adytum. \n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Section 001.10\n\n+++ {{CONCLUSION}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n= [[span class=\"label\"]]WARNING[[/span]]\n\n= **The following sections of document {{SCP-001-JADE}} are restricted to Clearance Level 5/001-JADE.
