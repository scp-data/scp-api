I closed my eyes.\n\n\n\nWhen I opened them, I was dry. I was well. I was in bed. At the door, a shining figure, a radiant light, hovered. It spoke to me with a voice that echoed in my mind, only. It said I had greater things to do.\n\n\n\nI never saw It again. But I kept going. I believed that God descended and saved me. And, joining the Foundation, how could I //not// believe? What else could explain the fact that we were still here, still marvelously, desperately, screamingly alive? How else could the fabric of our world, our Everything, withstand such things that we behold every day? Something was protecting us. I prayed to it every night for guidance. I never heard its voice again.\n\n\n\nI had been touched by God once, and that was a lifetime of fortune in one moment.\n\n\n\nBut when I changed the color of the nameplate on my desk just by hitting \"save\" on a text file, I realized something. The fabric of all things was open to me. I could put this power away, show you, conceal it. But...\n\n\n\nWhat if this was what saved me? What if this was what saves us all, every day, from the abyssal terrors that rip and rend at our world's fragile stability? What if me hitting \"Save\" on a text file was the birth of God?\n\n\n\nIf it's not, then I tried. If it is, then I am watching. I will try to steer things right. It will take time.\n\n\n\nWish me luck.\n\n\n\n//- MN//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Kate McTiriss]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** mctiriss.header.png\n\n> **Name:** mctiriss.header.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user Kate McTiriss]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kate-mctiriss-s-proposal\n\n\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-001", "scp_number": 1, "series": "scp-001", "tags": ["001-proposal", "_cc", "_licensebox", "foundation-made", "k-class-scenario", "media", "religious", "scp", "thaumiel"], "title": "SCP-001", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kate-mctiriss-s-proposal"}}
