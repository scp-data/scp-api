Foundation policy on cybernetic implants is currently frozen, pending Council vote.</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-001 is an extradimensional 'bubble' of self-contained reality, located in the southern Arabian desert, inaccessible to individuals that do not have prior knowledge of SCP-001's location. Traveling through the desert with only the intention of reaching SCP-001 is not sufficient; express and exact knowledge of its geographical position is required.</p>\n<p>Notably, individuals with some sort of artificial implant \u2014 ranging from surgical screws and plates to complex prosthetics \u2014 appear to have a higher chance of success in locating and entering the anomaly. The purpose and range of this is unclear, but personnel with implants successfully entered SCP-001 in 88% of tests, compared to standard personnel's 62%.</p>\n<p>SCP-001 contains an ancient metropolis partially buried in the sand. Maps and initial sonar testing indicate approximately two thirds of this city are aboveground and largely intact, while the subterranean portion has degraded heavily and is no longer structurally sound. The aboveground portion is made up of skyscrapers and buildings up to half a kilometer high using modern design techniques far beyond those available at the time of construction, which has been carbon dated to approximately 2,400 BCE. The buildings are fully set and furnished, and appear to have served residential, commercial, bureaucratic, and various other uses. The largest and most intricate of these buildings is a large temple structure in the center of the city that extends through all thirds.</p>\n<p>There are no living organisms inside the city <span class=\"label\">(See Section 001.4)</span>.</p>\n<p>The buildings also contain artistic works and large bas-reliefs depicting a variety of scenes ranging from apparently-religious stories to historical events. These contain writing in an unknown language containing elements of Old Arabic <span class=\"label\">(See Section 001.2)</span>.

Warms the cockles of my heart.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> \u2026 Right. Well, we would like to talk to you about one of the items recovered from your vault. A journal titled \"Lord Blackwood in the First Cities of Man\".</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Of course, of course. Penned from 1800 to 1824. Does the journal not answer your questions? I recall being very thorough.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Water damage has left it unreadable.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> I see, that's a shame. Well! It's been quite a while, but I remember that adventure fondly. Initiated by a gift given to me by one Monsieur Jacques Brazeau of <em>le estate Noir</em>. Agents of the French crown had recovered it before the revolution from an ancient shipwreck in the Aegean Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> What was it?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> A set of six clay tablets, remarkably preserved for their age. Detailing the existence of three empires spanning Asia, thousands of years old and more powerful and advanced than any culture since, even our own. And, of course, their nigh-apocalyptic war.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> You would think something like that would leave evidence.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Yes, I was similarly skeptical upon my first reading of the tablets. But they addressed those inquiries - these empires were advanced occultists, magicians and magic-users, ruled by sorcerer-nawabs. Hiding their cities from their enemies was a trivial task, and exactly why the <em>mundane</em> scholars have found nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> But not you, I take it?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Exactly correct, madam. I believe I have a copy of one of the pages from the journal stashed away somewhere, I'll see if we can't find that. But in simplest terms, the first of the three great cities of Man was Amoni-Ram, located in the sands of Arabia. As luck would have it, Monsieur Brazeau was accompanying General Bonaparte - still a general at the time, thank heavens - on his campaign into Egypt. Simple matter for me and a small expedition to tag along and then diverge into the peninsula.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> So you knew the location of the city at this point?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> In a fashion. You see, the tablets claim Amoni-Ram was hidden after the other empires allied to attack it, as it was a superior center of knowledge and weaponry. Only those who knew its location could enter. And its location happened to be recorded in the tablets. Three days into the desert, we found it. It was like passing into a bubble, and the towers became visible over the horizon.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Towers, you said?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Great buildings fashioned of metal, impossibly tall - easily hundreds of meters. A bronze glow set them alight from the sun overhead. There must have been a dozen of these sky-scraping buildings, between them resting smaller but still grand buildings of marble, stone, clay. Towering minarets and domes like those found in Mohammedan temples. A grand sight, altogether. The city must have been able to hold hundreds of thousands of people - we explored a tiny fraction of the surface portion.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> There was a subterranean area?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Even bigger than the surface, I would say. Again, we could not explore deep - the underground rapidly transitioned from grand hollows and caverns to a winding, labyrinthine tunnel system, metal pipes and doors and rivets all throughout. Machinery I could not begin to guess the purpose of, all still as death.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Did you find any entities inside the city?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> No living ones, though my men repeatedly claimed they heard something skittering about while we stayed in the city. I dismissed it as wildlife, sand rabbits or such. We never saw anything.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> What about dead ones?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Yes. Entire sections of the tunnels were impassable - growths of a strange black vine, as thick as a man, winding and knotting entire passageways. It appeared petrified. There were also curious bulbous sacs sticking to the walls and ceiling of many buildings, under and above ground. I prodded these with my sword - they leaked, spewing out a decomposing specimen that smelled like death. An impossibly emaciated man, skin burnt away by the acid. We did not touch them again.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Sounds like something bad happened there.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> Indeed. Throughout, the city has a very specific\u2026. air, I suppose.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> An air?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-1867:</strong> The distinct feeling of walking into a graveyard.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abEND LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>SCP-1867 surrendered the location of the Aegean Tablets. Translation is ongoing due to the extremely specific dialect of Ancient Greek they are written in.

Three great cities dividing the world tripartite.</p>\n<p>Mamjul and Korar, two dark fortresses resting in the jungles of the subcontinent. The magicians and sorcerer-nawabs allied themselves against the horrors of the jungle, and crossed a pact with something ancient. The Covenant of the Daeva was born, using the first magic gifted to Man - the magic of life and death.</p>\n<p>Adytum, a city thrown into rebellion by a charismatic slave turned lay preacher who promised wealth, freedom, and power to those that would help him. Together they threw off their yokes, slaughtered their oppressors with their new sorcery and rebuilt their collapsed city, all under the name of the Grand Karcist Ion. The N\u00e4lka Empire freed the second magic - carnomancy, the magic of flesh.</p>\n<p>Amoni-Ram, first great Ram of the Mekhanite Empire as it spread like a wildfire from the deserts. A gleaming, shining metropolis rising out of the dunes - a center of knowledge, science, understanding that the world had never seen. The magic of machines became known, the fervor for a new god that sought to uplift men, not subjugate them.</p>\n<p>A thousand years before, the three great nations of men fought a war that destroyed the world.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Aegean Tablets go on to clarify that Amoni-Ram was ruled by a theocratic cult in the area. The endonym of the group is unknown, but the Greek tablets refer to it exclusively as the Mekhanite Cult or Cult of the Broken God.

Each is about 500m, a little taller than Sears Tower. A marvel of engineering in and of itself, but not an obviously anomalous one. What they contain, however, is a different story.</p>\n<p>For my layman's perspective, they appear to be a combination of residential, office, and bureaucratic buildings. Each floor seems to consign itself to one of those three types, and contains appropriate pieces of technology - most are too degraded to be useful, but the fact that they're there at all after thousands of years is incredible. I can discern the purposes of about a quarter of them, though. They're all anomalous to some extent - the drones are writing up detailed reports now, but they variously break laws of thermodynamics, physics, and matter conservation, and often simply use magic to do things as mundane as copy documents or keep food hot or cold.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"crab.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/rounderhouse-gold-proposal/crab.png\" style=\"width:100%;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\">\n<p>SCP-001-A instance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>And, of course, the automata. Little machines, made of a golden metal and built to resemble animals that this culture in the middle of the desert could have no possible way of knowing about. Definitely sentient, possibly sapient - fully mechanical (I found a broken-open one on the street and took it as a sample, picture attached) but demonstrating what looks to me like primitive artificial intelligence. There must be hundreds of them, at least - my guess is that they were designed to maintain the city and, for the millenia it's lain abandoned, they've been doing exactly that. They're pretty cute, to be honest.</p>\n<p>Whatever this civilization was, the anomalous was so <em>pedestrian</em> to them they were using paratechnology we even now barely understand as household appliances and servants. They were playing with nuclear reactors while the rest of us huddled in caves behind the fire.

A vast city, undocumented by anyone else in the modern era, hiding a culture that had blended advanced magic and technology to settle half of Asia while the Egyptians had yet to settle the Nile. If the evidence wasn't surrounding me, I'd call myself a liar.</p>\n<p>We've already discovered much. Some of the researchers are more interested in investigating the individual houses and homes to see what an average citizen lived like - completely understandable. That said, I'm far more intrigued by this 'Cult of Mekhane' that seems to pervade every aspect of Amoni-Ram.</p>\n<p>In the ruins of Sumer and other ancient cities, religious iconography is common. Here, it's ubiquitous; the palace-temple is the most obvious example of this, with mechanical bas-reliefs that seem to tell a creation myth laid throughout. The buildings, houses, shops, skyscrapers, even the machinery Robert's team is disassembling have this religious significance about them.</p>\n<p>It's especially fascinating since practically nothing else is known to us about the religion or culture of these 'Mekhanites' beyond the admittedly-questionable statements of Lord Blackwood. Even the name Mekhanite is a Greek epithet used in the Aegean tablets, derivative of <em>mekhane</em>; machine. As it stands, their culture is a blackbox, and even with the murals and writings, I doubt we will ever have more than a passing understanding of this once-great civilization - and what happened to them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>MTF Zeta-9 Fireteam ECHO passed through SCP-001 and arrived in Amoni-Ram on September 6th with no complications.

One lands in the far corner of the Indian subcontinent, one lands on the coast of China, and one lands in the center of the Arabian peninsula. This final figure dominates the rest of the scenes; it is revealed to be a massive but lithe figure dressed in golden armor. A shepherd, his wife, and his three lame sheep happen upon it buried in the sand, obviously wounded.</p>\n<p><strong>Translation of Plaque:</strong> BEFORE THE NEW PANTHEON, BEFORE THE SMOKE AND THE SINGING, THE OLD GODS FOUGHT THEIR WAR OVER NOTHING. THEY WOUNDED EACH OTHER AND FELL, TWISTING AND WRITHING, TO THE LOWEST WORLD. MEKHANE, BLESSED BE HER NAME, ALIGHTED IN THE FAR WEST UNDER THE SCORCHING GAZE OF THE SUN. SHE RESTED IN THE DUNES, UNCOVERED BY THE FLOCK OF A SHEPHERD - BUMARO.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Side Description:</strong> The god reaches out and touches the shepherd and his wife. The shepherd's missing leg is replaced by a metal limb, and his shepherd's crook is replaced by a spear, both made from the golden metal. His wife's eyes glow gold, and large metal wings spring from her back. The sheep are armored over to resemble SCP-001-A instances.

It looks up at the shepherd and strips the armor from its massive fist. The shepherd takes the armor and fashions a simple forge, melting and reforging it into a suit of armor in the image of the god and a massive throne. He returns to his village, where the people naturally submit to him. Many are disabled and lacking limbs. They return to the resting place of the god, who touches them all in turn, replacing their shortcomings with its gifts. They rejoice and, as the god strips its armor, use the metal to construct a shining city on its back.</p>\n<p><strong>Translation of Plaque:</strong> SHE KNEW THAT THE WOUND WAS NOT MORTAL, BUT CRIPPLING. SHE UNDERSTOOD HER FATE - AND ENTRUSTED HER LEGACY TO BUMARO AND HIS BLOOD. HE BECAME THE FIRST BLACKSMITH, SHAPING THE METAL OF HER BODY AS SHE SHAPED LIFE ITSELF. HE MADE HIMSELF IN HER IMAGE, AND THE PEOPLE WERE AWED. FOR THEIR FAITH, THEY WERE UPLIFTED BEYOND THE CHAINS OF HUMANITY, AND FROM HER STRIPPED ARMOR THEY RAISED THE FIRST CITY ON THE BACK OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS - AMONI-RAM, CITY OF FULADH, SHINING GATE OF THE WEST.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT - OCTOBER 1983</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>MACHINERY LOG</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:80%;\">AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>From September to February, hundreds of pieces of technology were analyzed and investigated by the engineering team. While many were too degraded to be of any practical use, they were still highly illuminating in determining the technology level of the extant Mekhanite culture. A few particularly notable discoveries are attached:</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Four-meter poles inset into the ground at various intervals through the streets of Amoni-Ram. Six disc-shaped objects, a meter wide, top each pole. When an electrical current is applied to the pole, the discs begin to knock against each other, emitting radio waves of unclear purpose. Currently theorized to be some sort of conductor system for the city, possibly an attempt at creating a free, wireless power system.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Large, partially subterranean greenhouses occupying a significant portion of the western district of the city. Copper pipes running underground gases alternatingly cool and heat them according to valves, and the greenhouses are several floors tall, utilizing novel organization and irrigation techniques. Operating at maximum efficiency, a large portion of the city's theorized half-a-million population could have been fed by them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A series of magnetically charged rails running through the city in a loop, though all the cars have been completely ruined. Applying a specific electrical charge allows rapid, high-speed movement through the city - based on the lack of stations or stopping points, this is believed to have been a \"hop-on, hop-off\" method of mass transit at extraordinarily low overhead.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Small metal shields with two switches on the handle. When fully powered, one switch projects a rapidly-oscillating energy shield that protects the wearer against fast-moving kinetic objects. The shield can be maintained for up to twenty minutes on a full charge. The other switch projects a skintight shield that camouflages the wearer with their surroundings, effectively rendering them invisible. This is much more power-intensive and can only be maintained for three to six minutes depending on movement.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Large constructs, two in every district, set into the ground, though not part of the undercity. The locks and seals have been damaged. Inside are large machines that have been investigated to contain radioactive material. Details are currently sealed, but the engineering team is of the opinion that these could have been functional nuclear or possibly cold-fusion reactors, supplying electricity to the city's power grid and 'power poles'.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Unclear. Large sections of the undercity are inaccessible, making thorough analysis difficult - however, the engineering team agreed that a significant portion of the undercity appears to be one gargantuan machine incorporating mundane technology along with paratechnology. Further research required.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the process of research and excavation, SCP-001-A instances led the archaeological team to a structure within the Southern district that appeared to be a record center, possibly a library or university. While the vast majority of the paper documents contained therein were rotted and illegible, the metal and clay tablets were remarkably well-preserved. The instances further directed personnel to a basement section containing a large metal safe, since rusted off its hinges. Within was a cache of several dozen metal cylinders measuring 10cm in diameter, imprinted with writing in Mekhanite. Due to their form, the language, and several other factors, only one was immediately translated.</p>\n<div class=\"scripture\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT - NOVEMBER 1983</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nAnd the Shining Eye of the Empire rose as Bumaro took his anointed Seat on the Fuladh Throne. Amoni-Ram rose from the sands on the back of MEKHANE, her Pieces scattered to the six winds and the five corners of the world. As the slaves marched on Adytum in the East and the Covenants were struck in the South, so too was the holiest and the godliest of magics given freely to Man under the watchful eye of the Sun.\n<p>And the Sword of MEKHANE cut a swath through the world, and all those trembled in fear until they saw the light of the Ram. The greatest city of Man, gifted by MEKHANE but built by the hands of the workers, not the demons of the Covenant or the flesh-slaves. The Empire swelled and the Metal Road ferried new people, and Amoni-Ram swelled from their presence, and the world was good as Bumaro watched from his Throne for his reign of centuries.</p>\n<p>And when his reign ended and his golden body passed, the Empress Hedara wept, and the city of Amoni-Ram wept with her, and they rested their hope onto the heir. And Hashir Bumaro grew into a wise king under the auspices of his family, and gave his arm and his leg for his empire just as his father had done, and in that way Bumaro lived on, resting in the soul of his son and his son's son and so on forevermore.</p>\n<p>And the Emperor Bumaro used the Throne to invoke the wisdom of his past lives, and in that way the Empire conquered and slew its way into the world. And it was led into the continent and into the conflict with the other nations of Man, bloody and brutal.

Just one taste of what we've been able to do so far with SCP-001's technology. So! Tell me everything.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Everything, sir?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Everything important. I've read the reports, but I want to hear it from the horse's mouth. Doctor Nussbaum? Your progress so far?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes. We've recovered hundreds of tablets and engravings and mosaics across the city, and are in the process of translating them. The vast majority are simple, day-to-day affairs - business and legal records, personal correspondence, <em>et cetera</em>. All paint the picture of the Mekhanite culture - a society that was building a metropolis of the future while the glaciers from the Ice Age were still melting. They had a complex legal and justice system, a novel family structure incorporating distant cousins into large households and 'clans'-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Yes, anthropology, fascinating. I was wondering if you had figured out any more of their later history?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> \"Later history\", sir?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> What happened to them. Between the technological and the archaeological reports, this was a culture that was undisputed as the most advanced in the world at the time, but they also keep mentioning this war with the other two nations, the- this \"Adytum\" of the N\u00e4lka Empire and the Mamjul referenced as the capital of the Daevite Covenant. What that signals to me - and do tell me if I'm wrong, please - is that these two empires were each powerful enough to withstand a war with the Mekhanite culture. And, depending on what happened to Amoni-Ram, bring it to its knees.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I suppose so, sir, but the Aegean tablets do not give a precise location for the other two cities, and if we do want to find them - well, a location could be anywhere, in a shipping record, in a letter to a distant cousin-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> That's fine, but we need to figure out how this city died. And I'd be pretty goddamn willing to bet that the\u2026 <em>things</em> you found in the undercity are related. The flesh-thingies and the plants.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Nothing has been confirmed yet. Though it does seem quite likely.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Hmph. Well, in the meantime, see what you can get out of that robot down there\u2026 what's its name?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Preserver. SCP-001-A1. And it's not a robot, it's an artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Whatever it is, it's hiding something from you. And speaking of which - this place had artificial intelligence when the Persians were figuring out irrigation?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Far from the only breakthrough. If we can harness their cold fusion technology, their bionics, their power systems - reverse engineering any one of their innovations could change the world.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Well- okay, slow your roll. We don't know what happened to them, like I said. For all we know, their technology led them to their downfall, so let's wait before getting any ideas of dragging the world into the 21st century early. Let's focus on changing the Foundation first, right Robert?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Good. But I suppose that if you want to improve the rate of research, you're going to need more people.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Yes. I have a list of requisition requests. All sorts of machinery, excavation equipment, HAZMAT equipment and scientific machinery. Funding, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Naturally. Forward it to my Factotum, we'll take care of anything you need. We're very excited about this over at Site-01, you know. Very excited to see what comes out of Amoni-Ram next.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> We also need\u2026 people.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> How many people?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Right now there's about 50 of us, and the security. But we're stretched thin to explore a whole city - I've run the numbers and 200 additional personnel would give us the arms we need.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> That's a lot of arms, Robert. Not something I can make happen with a snap of my fingers.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I have a list of names I can forward. And it is a lot, but we've barely scratched the surface of what the Mekhanites left us, and already are reaping the rewards. Surely it's worth it?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Can't disagree there. You'll have your people within two months. Might need to consider expanding.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm inclined to agree, which is why I wanted to request your permission to see if we can get certain aspects of the city working again.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Like what?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> The power grid, for one. We've mapped it out pretty well and it's surprisingly intact. I'm confident that with the extra arms and 001-A1's help, we could get the reactors online within the month.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Hmph.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> The better situated the city is, the more we can learn about the machinery.

The sudden threefold increase in personnel required immediate expansion - ARF-02 was established in another structurally-intact skyscraper in the Southern district of Amoni-Ram, each site now holding approximately one hundred personnel.</p>\n<p>To connect the two sites, the disused rail system of Amoni-Ram was brought back into functional condition to ferry materials and personnel. This further necessitated the repair and refurbishment of the city's power grid and reactors, using technical assistance from SCP-001-A1 and its automatons. While the cold fusion reactors required extensive study and repair, the relatively simpler nuclear reactors incorporating paratechnology were slowly brought online using requisitioned nuclear fuel. On April 12th, the first two thaumic reactors came online, providing power to the entire Western and Southern districts of the city, allowing use of lighting, air conditioning, and of the rail system to ferry personnel and materials between the two sites.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - APRIL 1984</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>INTERVIEWERs:</strong> Doctor Hedvig Nussbaum, Doctor Robert Aram\n<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> SCP-001-A1</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[SCP-001-A1's head twitches upward.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YOU ARE REPAIRING MY CITY.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hello to you too.

Medical personnel found he had a slightly elevated blood pressure and heartbeat, consistent with strenuous physical activity, but was otherwise healthy. He was placed in an infirmary bed; the following day, he was conscious, active, and responsive within normal levels. Closer inspection revealed no lasting physical or neurological damage from the incident, and Doctor Aram indeed expressed a closer interest in the archaeological team's findings in the following days, citing his experience as giving him a newfound interest in the extant Mekhanite culture.

And as they expanded, they found relics - artifacts sheared from MEKHANE during their god's fall from heaven, scattered over the Earth, and with each relic carried back to Amoni-Ram the fervor of the people grew and grew as their leaders rose, warred, and died for their heirs.\n<p>And as the Legion marched forward over those long centuries, two other nations of man marched. The Covenant of the Daeva rode forth on their great horrible spirit-beasts, searing a path through the jungle from their twin-city of Mamjul Korar. And they used their black magic to open a gap, stepping from one side of the continent to another, and those that went through established another city - Adytum, that would after another two centuries fall to its own slaves, branding themselves the N\u00e4lka.</p>\n<p>And all these parties marched into Asia, only vaguely aware of the existence of the other two until the Battle of Harumar, where they collided. The existence was an affront - the disgusting flesh-beasts of the N\u00e4lka an insult to the steel glory of MEKHANE, and the Covenant's plant-spirits choking and infesting the gears and wheels of the Legion, and so the Legion fired the first mortar, shattering the Covenant's ranks, and thus began a war that would end with the destruction of Asia.</p>\n<p>The First War raged across the continent in every theater. Fleets of golden-hulled warships constructed in Amoni-Ram and pushed downriver to encounter the Covenant in the Bay. The N\u00e4lka raised an army of the dishonored dead from Adytum and marched them ceaselessly to throw themselves in the front line, choking the vines of the sorcerer-nawabs. There were no laws in war, and there is no honor in death - every corpse was fodder for future battles. Forests were scorched during retreat to deny the Covenant seed, and the warriors of the N\u00e4lka and Covenant chose to throw their weapons in the sea rather than surrender the precious metal to the foundries of the Legion. And the COLOSSI, great thousand-arm-tall goliaths of steel and bronze and fuladh that rent the sky down upon the N\u00e4lkan hordes. Every second man was killed in the fighting, and it raged for three hundred years and would have gone on forever until the Abominate landed his ships on the western coast of Aethiopia and began his march to Amoni-Ram.</p>\n<p>Devastation.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A week later, Doctor Aram once again volunteered to use the Throne, citing his quick recovery and the wealth of potential ancient knowledge hidden in the accounts of the various Emperors Bumaro.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MAY 1984</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Do you feel alright?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Dandy.

I cannot afford to be involved in your affairs, Pharaoh.\" We're arguing - shouting. \"The Abominate is marching on Amoni-Ram, and he will cut a swath through Egypt and stack your corpses to build a bridge across the Nile for his army.\" \"If I rout the Covenant at Thamud, we can stand united-\" He's - I said no. I'm leaving, he's angry. Why doesn't he understand? There are bigger things at stake!</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Robert, focus. What is happening?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Same- no, different scene, different throne room. Different ruler - a man in a robe and turban. Looks Arab or Ottoman or something. He's shaking his head- now it's some sort of tribal chief, in a tent. A Rus prince. We're discussing establishing trade routes, selling our fuladh, the technology - they're willing to trade, but they don't want to get involved with the War and risk the N\u00e4lka or the Covenant.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> So there are contemporaries. But they did not risk their heads in a clash between titans.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Okay, now- oh, sweet Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Robert?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> It's - oh my god. We're in a city - a ruined city. There's jungle around it. It's aflame - the sun is setting, the smoke's thick in the air and rising in plumes. I'm standing on a bluff, there's a regiment behind me - my soldiers, the Golden Legion, are lobbing things into the city. Firebombs and mortars. They're scaling the walls - the defenders are- they look Indian almost, they're running in terror, there's - ghosts? Some kind of spirits swirling in the air, mixing with the smoke. We're bringing down the walls and killing the soldiers on the battlements. I'm - there's someone behind me. The general, the woman, in the dragon armor. The troops are looking to her. I'm giving her a nod, and she screams something, and they charge down the bluff, this giant metal armor-suit leading the charge. They're shattering the line - Jesus, it's a fucking massacre. She's holding a sword up- holy shit, lightning just struck it. Now I'm in the city. I'm on my mount, surveying the ruins. The woman is beside me - I touch her head. I can see myself in her helmet.

The sand inside is more similar to a kind of white sand found in a section of the Arabian desert several hundred miles to the north-east.</p>\n<p>We didn't know what to make of it, but the recent research into the undercity has changed things. We've mapped out the whole device - it occupies 65% of the undercity's volume, practically everything is connected to it that isn't stuff like the sewers. Its components have also become more understandable with our new experience on Mekhanite design architecture and philosophy. The technology is antiquated, but it's almost all paratech - extremely powerful conduits, converters, connections, etc, all terminating in a small chamber emitting extremely high levels of radiation. We sent a protected probe in, warding it - it melted a few minutes later but we ran the pictures and energy signals against the database and got\u2026 nothing. We've never seen anything like it.</p>\n<p>But then, Tenz decided to call in a few favors and run it against the GOC database. Apparently they have seen something like it, and tried to weaponize it - a long-distance, large-scale matter de/reconstructor and emitter. A gigantic teleporter, basically. Apparently big enough to move an entire city hundreds of kilometers. Mekhane's Kiss isn't a superweapon, it's a Hail Mary.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it's completely burned out. It'd require a team months to get it back into remotely working order, and that's ignoring the problem of power. It's way too demanding to pull from the city's power grid - we think it draws directly from the cold fusion reactors, which is another impossibility. Plus we still don't know how it was controlled, or how any of the computation works without\u2026 well, computers.

And there they came to understand a truth - bitter enemies though they might be, the flesh of the N\u00e4lka and the plants of the Covenant were an extension of each other, both extrusions of the natural world. Evenly matched, neither could truly destroy the other. But the Mekhanite blessed steel was something else - a gift from the sky, well capable of crushing each of them. But together, they stood a chance.\n<p>And such it was that as the invasion plans were drawn and the great siege engines were constructed and the polearms cooled in the foundries, the Golden Legion marshalled and marched themselves, beginning the long, bloody truck to Adytum. And as they crossed through the desert of Asia, the N\u00e4lka were lending their forces to another invasion, this one raised by the sorcerer-nawabs with the Daeva against Amoni-Ram. A black, wicked army secretly gathering in the jungles of the South, marching on the suddenly-vulnerable First Ram of the Mekhanites. And with them came the magics - the N\u00e4lka offered one of their greatest boons, a plague to infest the city. And the Covenant offered the Song of the Daeva to make the verdant greenery of the desert rebel against its masters.</p>\n<p>And even then, their marshaled forces were not enough to dominate the colossi and take the city. But in the Far West, beyond the Gate, another storm was brewing. The Abominate, may his name never be spoken of, stood on the shores of the coast as the Damned Fleet disembarked from their massive ships. And his army assembled itself from his prisoners and his soldiers, and the march to the East, to Amoni-Ram, began. The city settled between two unstoppable forces, neither aware of the other's presence, as the two armies pushed to the walls of the city and the head of its king, queen, and general.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another meeting with O5-11 was scheduled for June 26th to ascertain the progress of the Amoni-Ram Initiative and relay new discoveries regarding the fate of the Mekhanite culture. On June 25th, an unidentified aircraft was detected 10km away from SCP-001. Upon confirmation that the aircraft was approaching SCP-001's entrance, ARF-01 radioed it asking for identification.

Sorry about the welcome, we weren't expecting you.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> I arranged a meeting, didn't I?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes, but we didn't expect you to, ah-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Show up in person? Don't blame you, we're not exactly an outgoing bunch. But I've heard so many great things about this city over the past year. About its secrets, architecture, technology, culture, <em>history</em>. I wanted to see it for myself.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Everything you were hoping for?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> That and more. I'll admit it does look a lot nicer now that you've started to rebuild the place.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Thanks. We've managed to get primary power back online, along with the train system and a lot of the undercity's navigation maps and such. The power and climate control as well, obviously. We're going to try and get the city's weaponry back online soon, see what kind of defensive technology they were packing.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Hold that thought. Doctor Nussbaum?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> I'm told your historical team has made several breakthroughs recently. Especially using the Throne-anomaly. Which, if I recall correctly, you're the primary test subject for, Doctor Aram?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> That's correct. We've done about a dozen tests since we discovered it - only a handful have turned up anything substantial, it's mostly fragmented memories from old kings. Watching as the streets swell with citizens and goods flood into the markets. Visions of battlefields as the Mekhanite army takes on the Covenant and the N\u00e4lka.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Right. And of course, you've translated\u2026. how many of the recovered tablets now?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Dozens, over a hundred. But like the Throne records, most are simple, banal correspondence.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> But not the recent ones.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Correct. I have a presentation compiled in my office. Shall we?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Lead the way.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[NUSSBAUM, ARAM, O5-11, and the Alpha-1 operatives enter the office inside ARF-02. It fully covers one of the higher floors of the massive skyscraper. Inside, the furniture is a combination of metal and intricate stonework. A wall of windows looks out over the city. The group takes a seat in front of the desk.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Hm. I expected more of a\u2026 cantonment. But no, you seem quite comfortably set up here.</p>\n<p><em>[NUSSBAUM laughs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Well, we have been here for nearly a year now. Plenty of time to settle in. And expanding to the second site has also helped free up space. Everyone has their own chambers.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Home sweet home.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Anyway as you know, we have made great strides recently in determining the fate of Amoni-Ram and the Mekhanite culture at large, using translated historical records in tandem with the Throne visions and SCP-001-A1's admittedly limited accounts. It has been established that the Daevic Covenant originate from the Indian subcontinent and the N\u00e4lka are likely from Central or East Asia. But the later records repeatedly mention a fourth party - the so-called 'Abominate'. As of now, we know functionally nothing about who or what this is - only that they were in possession of a fleet of seafaring vessels that landed on the shores west of Amoni-Ram, in the 'Old Country'. My hypothesis is that this is West Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> The records say this figure marched to Amoni-Ram.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> While the Covenant-N\u00e4lka coalition marched from the east, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> An army crossing the entire breadth of the Sahara four-thousand years ago is\u2026 hard-to-believe.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> It's not the strangest thing we've seen out here.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Indeed. We also have reason to believe that the Gobi desert was a significant theater in the First War, which would suggest the three primary cultures also had some sort of experience warring in deserts.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> You say three primary cultures - you don't include the Abominate in the equation?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> We are not sure if they're human yet, much less a distinct culture group. The Aegean tablets also do not mention any fourth party in the First war. However, I also have been in contact with some colleagues of mine at King Saud University, researching the mundane Thamud culture in the northwest. They recently unearthed a trove of tablets in the region, apparently detailing a cataclysmic battle between four armies for control of a major city.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Bingo.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes. I already have some people translating it - it is quite complex, but full translations should be ready within the month. In any case, the Mekhanite records we have found indicate that in the later stages of the war, the N\u00e4lka and Daevic Covenant allied themselves to take Amoni-Ram while the Mekhanite's Golden Legion marched across Asia to Adytum, the N\u00e4lka capital. This covers three of our armies, and evidently the Abominate is the fourth. But they also imply that the combined force of the N\u00e4lka and Daevic Covenant was not enough to take the city - that the Abominate, whatever it is, is more responsible for the fall of Amoni-Ram.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Goddamn. That's\u2026 disconcerting. But I suppose that there's nothing to do now but wait for translations, yes?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> That would appear to be the case.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Right. Doctor Aram, you said you had updates about the technology?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> That's right. We've discovered a lot of military weapons, it looks like - they range from CQC polearms and swords and what seem to be primitive chainsaws to long-range shoulder-mounted mortars and elephant guns. These were all in ruined warehouses in the sacked portion of the city, but we've also made a few interesting finds in the undercity.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Do tell.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> First, a few suits of functional power armor, of the kind in the Throne records. Exoskeletons to enhance strength, speed, durability, power, some of them even flight-capable through gravity-defying paratechnology. Unfortunately, they were unusable without Mekhanite implants to link to.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Well that's a goddamn shame.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Was. A few days later, SCP-001-A directed us to another chamber in the undercity. This one filled with assembly lines, industrial sections - and crates on crates of Mekhanite implants. Fuladh and steel bionic arms, legs, prosthetics, torso cages, even heads. And of course sensory implants - replacement visuals and sensory suites, just like ours. The Foundation already gives those things out like candy - so I think they're worth experimenting on, with D-Class.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> You\u2026 want to outfit D-class with millenia-old cybernetics so you can put them inside highly-destructive mechsuits? You know I can't approve that, Robert.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hm. I\u2026 see.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> The risk is just too great.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Sure. Okay. In the meantime, we'd like to try and see if the city's defensive systems still work. The ones I saw in my visions. The mechs, the gun emplacements.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> These\u2026 visions. You trust them?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I do. Seen them with my own two- well, not eyes, but you know what I mean. Why wouldn't I?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I don't lay my faith in all the technology quite so easily. I'd be wary. But, if what you said is true, then there's at least two superweapons in the city that the Foundation could deeply benefit from. Those colossuses are\u2026 impressive. And, of course, the teleporter. Mekhane's Kiss.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> It's not\u2026 yes, sir. I'm going to need lots of supplies. Deuterium and tritium, most importantly. We're going to try and bring those cold fusion reactors online.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> That's a big ask. And a dangerous one. We'd like to know how the city was destroyed before we accidentally blow it up, hah.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> We've already mastered most of the technology we've discovered, and we do have Preserver to assist us still.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> SCP-001-A1, yes. Still\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Discovering the city's defense - and how effective they are - is crucial to getting an accurate image of the battle. Right, Hedvig?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes\u2026 yes it is. I support the idea.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Hm. Well, if both of you are in agreement, I can make it happen. But be safe, and don't take any needless risks. We don't want anything happening this far in, yes?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Of course.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abEND LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED DOCUMENT - JULY 1984</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR ROBERT ARAM</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:80%;\">AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE</span>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><em>Personal log</em></span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Progress on rebuilding the cold fusion reactors is progressing much, much faster than projections. Normally, I'd be worried, but I'm surprisingly calm. It's obvious - our people are getting familiar with the technology. The fuladh foundries are operating at amazing efficiency, we've worked out how to mold and shape the metal just how we need it, and what last year looked like a bizarre, nonsensical circuit structure and design philosophy now strikes me as beautifully idiosyncratic. A snapshot into a bygone era.</p>\n<p>I've never really been one for history. More of a STEM type - I never looked <em>down</em> on those that pursued history. I just didn't see the attraction - machines are in front of you, something tangible you can see and hear and touch and interact with. You can't do that with history, not really.</p>\n<p>The Fuladh Throne, of course, has changed that. I've spent lifetimes of ancient emperors in minutes. It's staggering. The depth of emotion and personality you can feel from only a few choice minutes in someone's body. Their grief, pain, joy, their story. Fascinating stuff. The technology of the Throne and any possible side effects remain elusive, but we've been testing it for a few weeks now, maybe a dozen times, and while I'm always tired after - not a surprise, at my age - I feel fine otherwise. And now I know Mekhanite, Greek, and Egyptian. Go figure.</p>\n<p>I've gotten a front-seat view to the First War and it is\u2026 apocalyptic. There's really no other word for it. Gigantic mech suits crushing cities as the sky itself opens up? Spirit-demons fighting alongside human compatriots? Metal soldiers charging walls? Insanity. A secret, bloody history the world doesn't even remember. But as with all war, it's not quite so black-and-white.</p>\n<p>Being inside Bumaro's - or, the various Bumaros' bodies - none of them were tyrants, or dictators. Maybe autocrats, but what emperor wasn't? They all wanted to protect their people, to raise them to something beyond human. I can't help but sympathize. Nothing impresses onto you the fragility of your body than nearly losing it - but they understood that and <em>actively</em> improved themselves using the bionics and implants. Reach heaven through transhumanism.</p>\n<p>Speaking of implants and bionics, the cache we discovered some weeks ago along with the Legion armor; O5-11 denied D-class testing. It's frustrating. We can't use the glorious technology here to improve the world, we can't use it to improve ourselves, we can barely use it to improve the damn city. It's devastating, and most of the team agrees with me that we should use it.</p>\n<p>So we did. I can't use D-class to test the implants, but using myself is a different matter. The new arm is\u2026 wonderful. It's smoother, more responsive, more sensitive and durable and it doesn't even hurt at the end of the day. I can sleep with it on. 99% of our personnel in Amoni-Ram are already augmented, so changing out their stainless steel arm for a fuladh one or something is no big deal. Why should Five be the only one that reaps the gifts the Mekhanites left us?</p>\n</div>\n<p>On July 29th, 2:05PM, Doctor Nussbaum and four members of the archaeological team were excavating a number of mosaics in the undercity. Over the course of the day, the team progressed further inward, into an unstable section. The ceiling overhead suddenly gave way, causing a minor collapse. Due to a number of strength-enhancing bionic and cybernetic augments, the archaeological team members were able to escape largely unharmed; however, Doctor Nussbaum sustained severe internal and external injuries from the collapse and was rushed into emergency surgery in the ARF-01 infirmary.</p>\n<p>Due to the severity of injuries sustained - including a shattered collarbone, fractured spine, cranial injuries, and hemorrhaging - medical personnel were able to stabilize her in critical condition. Her likelihood of survival was deemed extremely low. At this point, Doctor Aram arrived with several engineering team personnel, an SCP-001-A instance, and a variety of Mekhanite implants and augments. He proposed, to the medical team's agreement, that utilizing the advancing Mekhanite augments to stabilize her and offer her a chance of survival was the ethical option, and was legitimately possible using SCP-001-A1's expertise voiced through the -A instance. A combination of medical and engineering personnel worked for 29 hours to implant 17 pieces of Mekhanite technology across Doctor Nussbaum's body. After 32 hours unconscious, she awoke on July 31st.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"addendum\">\n<div class=\"doc\">\n<p>ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - JULY 1984</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> Wa-ter.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Wh- Oh!

Evaluations by medical personnel provided insight into the enhancements offered by the Mekhanite augmentations. Internally, they integrated with her immune and nervous systems, offering fine, instinctual control and an increase in healing speed. Due to the relative lightness of the fuladh metalwork compared to steel, her body mass did not shift considerably. However, her strength, lift capacity, running speed, pull weight, and a suite of other measurements vastly increased in the weeks following her recovery. She similarly reported significant increases in her sensory ability, well beyond that given by her former Foundation-issue ocular and auditory implants.

Oh goodness.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> You're taking it better than me. I imagine the implants have to do with that. What do you see?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I am- Oh God, it is loud. I'm standing - there, I am standing on the walls of the city, the - yes, the Eastern Gate. It is morning, the sun is beating down on the desert - there are hundreds of us, soldiers, lining the walls and - yes, gun turrets. It is tense, I can feel myself barking out orders, and the soldiers are obeying. Setting up siege engines, loading ammunition, evening out the wall. Preparing for war. We are all in armor - mine is more elaborate than the others.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Yeah, the Emperor's armor was-</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> No. I am not the Emperor. Not a Bumaro.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Who, then?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I\u2026 I do not know. I can see myself in the metal of a gun turret next to me. I'm a woman, olive-skinned and small. The armor is elaborate, it shows\u2026 dragons? Fighting each other.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I've seen her before, she was one of the Legion's generals.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Hold on- oh, <em>mein gott</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> The colossus. It is\u2026. gargantuan. It just took a step and shook the entire city. It is heading away - towards the horizon. Wait, I see something in the distance. Something kicking up sand. An\u2026 army. No, a <em>horde</em>. I cannot see individuals. Just a mass of bodies and armor and banners and mounts in a dust storm. They go as far as the eye can see. There must be tens of thousands of them. They are too far to engage. But they are coming. And there is nothing we can do to stop their advance.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> That must be the N\u00e4lka and the Covenant, then. Do you see any sign of what the Abom-</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> It changed. It- the city is on fire. Amoni-Ram is burning. Oh <em>God</em> it is loud. I cannot hear myself think. The sky is red, choked with smog. All I can hear is the clashing of steel and screaming. We are in the Southern district - crouching behind a barricade. I am- I leaned up and over and started firing my weapon. I can't see - I hear screaming. The buildings are collapsing, we are under mortar fire - we need to fall back!</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Stay with me. What does the enemy look like?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Beasts. Monstrosities. Great masses of flesh and limbs in a sickly pale purple, dragging themselves through the dirt streets. Spirits in the air, purple fire covering the walls. There are too many, they're advancing. I can hear the beating of their drums and their war-chants. I can hear cannonfire beyond the walls, I can just barely see the colossi in the horizon through the smoke - the streets are wet with blood and slime. We are standing over the ruins of a house now. A mortar hit it. There is\u2026. something in the center. An object.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Someone- one of the men touched it, it broke open, he just - his face burst into leaves, screaming and contorting.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> There are vines, spreading outward from him. Creeping from his writhing corpse toward us. It is the petrified plant we discovered in the undercity. A biological weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> We are falling into the undercity, retreating. The Legion holding the entrances and chokepoints against the swarms - the citizens trying to evacuate or dying. Oh God, there's so much death. I just split a man open chin to groin. Beheading one of the flesh-beasts. Blood pooling in the golden channels of my shortsword, splashing across my armor-</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Focus, Hedvig. Try to call up the image of the Emperor.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Y-yes. I am\u2026 in the palace. The city itself is shaking. The Legion is holding the palace against the horde. Bumaro is on the throne, with his wife. \"My Lord, we must leave. They have taken three of the gates. We will not have a chance for much longer.\"</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> He's not going to leave.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> No. He stands up - he is in his war armor, all gleaming gold and silver plate, big enough to block out the sky. He leans down. \"You must go, sha-hashna.\"</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What did he say?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> \"Sha-hashna\". I do not recognize the word. It seems similar to the words for protect or guard\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> We can figure it out later.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes. \"You must go and activate the Kiss.\" We are arguing - I say the Kiss is dangerous. That it cannot be ready. That it has no control mechanism whatsoever, that activating it manually could be disastrous. \"We have no other choice. Go. Your king commands it.\" I bow. He is- he is preparing to go out and lead the defense. \"I will go and seat myself in the courtyard. This keep will not be breached, not while I draw breath.\"</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Wait\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> He is sitting in the same spot as the statue we found. Waiting, sword and spear in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Oh, holy shit. It's not a statue.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I- I have left the palace. I am running across the city, to the nearest undercity entrance. The mass of the horde is still beyond the walls, but so many have breached the city. My blade sings, but I never stop. Slitting one's throat as I run past him. Gutting another beast. Crushing the skull of a Covenant summoner. There are so many. I must keep moving. I - okay. I have jumped into the undercity, sealing the entrance behind me. It is\u2026 different. Brightly lit, well-signed. Blood plastering the walls. Corpses lining the passageways. Oh God.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Where are you going?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> To the center. Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth. I encounter resistance. The Covenant and N\u00e4lka's 'gifts' have made it down here. The plant-virus and the mutated flesh-pod-tentacles we have seen. But not petrified and dead. Alive. Throbbing. <em>Wet.</em> Many soldiers, moving through the undercity. They do not know the passages like we do. They are confused. They do not last long. There are many families hiding in rooms and warehouses and dormitories and barracks. I cannot help them now. All I can do is keep moving.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Do you recognize any of the routes?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> It's\u2026 yes. I just rounded a familiar corner. I\u2026 yes, I know where we are going.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Where?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Preserver's chamber. SCP-001-A1. Under the palace itself. It takes some detours, but I arrive where it- what?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What happened?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> It is not here. Preserver is not here. Just the masses of machinery, but no arm or mind or voice. Just soulless vacuum tubes and circuit inscriptions. It hums with an unfamiliar energy. There are automata everywhere. Maintaining the machine. Making sure it works. I look at it - I seal the chamber door behind me. It is just me. I hear a boom from above, and begin stripping off my armor.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Wait, what?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I need to interface with- oh, God. I understand now.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> \"Sha-hashna\". It's close to guard and protect, but in a noun form. It means one who guards. A preserver.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> \u2026 Oh, fuck. That's why Preserver isn't there. Oh, fuck!</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I have disrobed. The armor lies in a heap. I reach out and touch-</p>\n<p><em>[NUSSBAUM's eyes glow golden and she writhes in the Throne, her back arching wildly. She lets out a long gasp before going limp, sinking back into the Throne.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hedvig? Hedvig, can you hear me?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes. Yes. I can hear you. Oh, <em>mein gott.</em> That was horrible.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What the fuck just happened?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I touched the machine and just- agony. So much pain. I felt like someone was cutting me limb from limb. Burning my tongue off and branding my eyes. God.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Are you okay? What do you see now?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I- yes, I am fine. I see\u2026 I do not know what I am seeing. Rubble, debris. It is quiet. I- wait, I can move. No- yes, I can move, but I am\u2026 small.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> How small?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I- I am inhabiting one of the automata.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Just like how Preserver can control them. That settles that.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I exit out into the city. I can see- oh, God. Oh no.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What happened? What did the Kiss do?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Everyone is dead.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> The horde?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Everyone. There are corpses choking the streets. Not a free patch of dirt to be found. Dead bodies covering every possible surface, both my Legionnaires and the horde and the citizens. No explosive finishes. The quiet death of an entire civilization. Oh god. What have I done?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> It's not you, Hedvig. I know how convincing it gets. Remember, it's not your memory.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> They're all dead, Robert. I destroyed the empire trying to save it. Everyone I ever knew or loved. Everyone.</p>\n<p><em>[ARAM motions to the engineering team to cut power to the Throne. They comply, but nothing occurs.

No wonder Preserver cannot remember.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> She obliterated her own civilization while trying to save it. I had a taste of it for just a few seconds and it was too much to take. She has lived with that guilt for nearly three thousand years.

Far more so than any of the O5s arbitrating on whether <em>she</em> deserves to know her own identity. We wouldn't even have the throne if she hadn't led us to it and provided the Fist, the cylinders, everything. We owe her.</p>\n<p>And even if we didn't, it's the right thing to do. \"Mad scientist\" is possibly one of the dumbest stereotypes of all time - scientists have ethics. Even in Prometheus, where progress was done for the sake of progress, we had ethics. Expectations of behaviour and morality. Making sure everyone knew exactly what they were signing up for. Not withholding crucial discoveries fundamental to their sense of being. The Foundation is not scientists, it is bureaucrats - and bureaucrats are the ones who will do away with ethics for efficiency.</p>\n<p>I shouldn't get this mad. But it just begs so many questions. It's representative of how they think of this project - not a font of tools to improve the world, but of information that needs to be suppressed and released when the world is ready. Visionaries do not wait for the world to be ready to present their idea, because the world is <em>never</em> ready. We force the world to change. In the 60s, augments were a rarity in the Foundation. Agents who got them were freaks. They were a last resort to maintain functionality. Then they realized we were better, faster, smarter, stronger. And look at us now. A project and two Sites staffed entirely by augmented personnel.</p>\n<p>But they obviously don't trust Preserver, because she's a machine. Even though she's not, really. She was human once, but they can only think of her as a machine - to use, to exploit. The same way they think of me and Hedvig and Tenz and Zaid and all the others. They don't trust us either, not really. We've done more for them and gotten fuck all in return except the <em>permission</em> to rebuild what has been our home for nearly a year. It's frustrating.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about what SCP-001-A1 said. About the Throne. It's not true - there's no paratechnology that can force a psychic connection, that would require a staggering amount of power and all sorts of bullshit. But it makes me wonder. I've been probing Nussbaum, seeing if she responds like Preserver said she would. I don't know whether I'm delusional or looking for what I want to see but I feel like there's something there. She just agrees to whatever. If it is true - and I'm not saying it is - it would logically extend to the others, too. Did they all agree to swapping out their augments with the Mekhanite ones because it was what they wanted? Or was it because it was what I wanted them to do?</p>\n</div>\n<p>On September 30th, the O5 Council approved a plan allowing the involvement of SCP-001-A1 in the Siege of Amoni-Ram to be declassified to it, but withholding the details of its activation of Mekhane's Kiss and destruction of the city.

As Project Co-Lead, I retain executive control over almost all personnel decisions, but my concern today lies with my co-lead, Doctor Robert Silas Aram.</p>\n<p>Dr. Aram is a once-in-a-lifetime mind, but recent events regarding the project have left me questioning his suitability for a leadership position in stressful, isolated research environs.

Robert is not my authorized medical proxy.</li>\n<li>augmented himself using experimental anomalous technology.</li>\n<li>utilized experimental, dangerous anomalous technology to further research.</li>\n<li>engaged in an argument with our Overseer contact.</li>\n<li>referring to a sapient, semi-humanoid anomaly by name.</li>\n<li>spending long periods of time alone with this anomaly.\n<ul>\n<li>on one occasion, lying to this anomaly and reacting angrily when confronted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>spending long periods of time alone with experimental anomalous technology, attempting to deconstruct it.</li>\n<li>focusing research in strange directions averse to the goals of the project (on several occasions he asked me to attempt to use an experimental mechanical combat suit, and has recently been trying to ascertain the location of apocryphal, massive walking war platforms.)</li>\n<li>demanding an additional level of dedication and respect from employees to the project research and himself, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cumulatively, these actions lead me to believe Doctor Aram's worthiness for co-lead should be rec</p>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the same day the email was drafted, the following audio file was recorded from a hidden recording device in Doctor Nussbaum's offices.

Sound of an object slamming closed.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hello, Hedvig.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Oh! Hello, Robert. Still awake?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Yeah. Needed to get some last-minute reports done. Took the long route back from the digsite. The city's beautiful at night, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes, it is.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> It's crazy to think that a year ago this place was all rubble and debris. Now it almost looks like a proper city.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Are you alright, Robert? You look\u2026 pale.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm fine. Just spent a little bit of time tinkering with the Throne.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Relax, nothing serious. Just some investigation, based on some things Preserver told me.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> What did you find?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm not sure yet. There's some latent psychokinetic energy emanating from it, but we've been aware of that for a while. Just not sure what it means.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> What kind of energy?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Not sure. But it's gotten stronger recently. With every use of the Throne, it seems like.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> That is\u2026 concerning.</p>\n<p><em>[ARAM walks to the window, looking out over Amoni-Ram.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> It really is beautiful at night. We've built something grand out here, away from the rest of the world's eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> \u2026 I guess we will come back to that later, then. But yes. It is quite nice. It feels like a home.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I don't know how I'm going to go back to bunking on Site dormitories after this, hah.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I am unsure I want to. Foundation politics tire me, and they are omnipresent in the larger Sites. Amoni-Ram is nicer. Everyone here is here because they want to do the work.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Agreed. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I think we may need to shift gears a bit, in terms of what we're focusing on, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I\u2026 don't follow.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> At this point we're pretty much confident in the timeline of what happened to Amoni-Ram. But the other nations, and the Abominate, we know nothing about them except the battle. So I think it could be beneficial if we focus more on the weapons, the technology used during the Siege. Put the mundane archaeology aside for a little while.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> The \"mundane\" archaeology has already led us to breakthroughs on the technology. We need to know how they lived and thought to see how they fought and died.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm not disputing that. I just think it's not the biggest priority right now, so we could divert resources-</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> My work is just as important as yours, Robert.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> \u2026 Right, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I didn't say anything!</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Ugh. It is written on your face. You only see the history, the culture as a means to an end. You cannot understand why someone would want to study it for its own sake.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> No, that's not-</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> The same with Eleven. He does not give an ounce of respect to my team and their work. Neither of you do.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I respect your work. I respect you.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Oh, is that so, Robert? Is that why you feel you can come in and tell me what my team should focus on?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hedvig, please.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Is that why you think you can make decisions about my body for me?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <em>What?!</em> You would've died! I saved your life, you said so!</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I was in shock! <em>Verdammt.</em> I would have agreed to whatever was put in front of me, I was barely conscious!</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> That doesn't change the fact that you would've died on that operating table if I hadn't stepped in.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> And who gave you the right to make my decisions of life or death, hm? Is that also because you respect me so much?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <em>[Sigh]</em> This is obviously about something bigger. I'm sorry I brought it up.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> No, we will have this discussion now. You changed my life forever and seem to be under the delusion you did me a favor. I will not dispute I am thankful you saved me from death. But I do not owe you anything.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <em>Everyone</em> here owes me. I'm their leader.</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> We are co-leads. Do not forget that.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Bullshit. If it wasn't for me, this project would've been shuttered months ago. I took the risks and they paid off and everyone else looks up to me for it. Why can't you?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> Is that it, Robert? We are <em>friends</em>. I do not look up to my friends. They are my equals.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <strong>KINGS DON'T HAVE EQUALS.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I- I-</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <strong>YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME. YOUR WORK HAS BEEN SECONDARY. YOU ARE SECONDARY. THE PURPOSE OF THE INITIATIVE WAS TO FIND THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE MEKHANITES. THEIR HISTORY WAS ANCILLARY.</strong></p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <strong>WE HAVE A LIVING ARCHIVE OF THEIR HISTORY WITH US NOW. THE DIRECTIVE OF THE PROJECT HAS CHANGED.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> <em>[Drowsy, semi-conscious]</em> What are you\u2026 how\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <strong>DO NOT RESIST ME. YOU KNOW THE MISSION HAS CHANGED, DON'T YOU?

Like that unsent email on your laptop.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Don't ask me how I know. It is not your place. But delete it.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <strong>I SAID DELETE IT.</strong></p>\n<p><em>[Sounds of laptop opening, clicking.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> I\u2026 okay. Done.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Good girl. You played the role quite well. But you felt it watching us too, didn't you?</p>\n<p><strong>NUSSBAUM:</strong> \u2026 I felt\u2026 something.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> There are bigger things at stake now.

We have plumbing, fresh water, power. The city's livable now.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> I SAW. I REFER TO YOU.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YOU HAVE USED THE VOICE. EXTENDED FROM A QUIET WHISPER IN YOUR MIND TO THE BOOMING COMMAND. DEMANDING OBEDIENCE.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Even if I had, I haven't made anyone do anything they wouldn't have done anyway. I haven't.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> I MAKE NO JUDGEMENT. YOU TOOK THE THRONE AT MY ENCOURAGEMENT; THIS WAS NOT AN UNINTENDED RESULT. WHAT HAVE YOU USED IT FOR?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Just\u2026 exploring the breadth of it. The limits. How it works.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YES. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO DISCUSS.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What makes you say that?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> THE MOON HANGS IN THE SKY. ALL YOUR MEN SLEEP. SHE IS NOT WITH YOU.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hm. Well, you're right. I didn't come here to ask you questions about the voice.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> THEN SPEAK.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Hedara - did she love Bumaro?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> OF COURSE. DEEPLY. SHE WAS HIS MOST FAVORED WIFE. MOTHER OF HIS HEIR. LIGHT OF HIS LIFE. SYMBOL OF HIS DYNASTY - PURE, SHINING, RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON WITH THE SUN. SHE ATTENDED TO HIM UNTIL HE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK OR BREATHE OR EAT, AND WHEN HE FADED, SHE CALLED UPON HIS WISDOM WHILE HER SON GREW INTO THE THRONE.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I see.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YOU HAVE MADE HER YOUR QUEEN?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I suppose so. I wouldn't use the word queen, though.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> WHY? SURELY YOU SAW THE PARALLELS. THE PROPHECY. TIME IS A FLAT CIRCLE. LOOK AT YOUR RIGHT HAND AND TELL ME IT IS NOT SO.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm not a king.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> AND NEITHER WAS BUMARO, UNTIL HE WAS GIVEN A CITY OF PEOPLE THAT NEEDED GUIDANCE. THREE THOUSAND YEARS, AND ONE THING NEVER CHANGES: HUMANS CRAVE LEADERSHIP. YOU HAVE HEDVIG AND YOUR SCHOLARS. BUMARO HAD HEDARA AND THE LEGION. AMONI-RAM ITSELF.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> They were all simple farmers before. Shepherds. Peasants.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> AND MEKHANE'S ARRIVAL, HER FALL FROM THE HEAVENS, TURNED THEM INTO A KING AND A QUEEN. THEIR HOME INTO A BASTION. THEIR KIN INTO THE PINNACLE OF HUMANITY.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> So Amoni-Ram - it was a place those people could go? Different people?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YES. THEY WERE NOT DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE AUGMENTATIONS. THEY CHOSE TO BE DIFFERENT. MUNDANITY IS NOT A VIRTUE. THEY CHOSE TO ELEVATE THEMSELVES, BECAUSE THEY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS WERE.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Dissatisfied with being human.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> DISSATISFACTION IS THE MOTHER OF AMBITION. IT IS THE COAL THAT FUELS THE FIRE. THERE IS NO SHAME IN DISSATISFACTION WITH THIS FORM. WE SHOULD BE STRIVING TO IMPROVE OURSELVES. THE FLESH IS WEAK.</p>\n<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> WE IMPROVE MEKHANE BY COLLECTING HER COMPONENT PARTS SCATTERED TO THE WINDS. WE IMPROVE OUR BODIES BY REPLACING OUR FRAIL LIMBS AND SENSES. IN DOING BOTH, WE IMPROVE OUR SOULS. IN THIS WAY, WE DO NOT CHANGE THE WORLD AROUND US - WE IMPROVE IT.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I lied to you.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> I KNOW.</p>\n<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YOU LIED IN FRONT OF ME.

HE MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN THE BONES IN THE GROUND NOW, BUT I SEE HIS FACE IN YOURS. THE LINES OF WORRY AND THE IRISES. I KNOW THE SIGNS THAT HE WAS HOLDING BACK - THAT YOU WERE HOLDING BACK. I DID NOT HOLD THE GATE - I DID NOT SAVE OUR CITY.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> You did not, no. He told you to go into the undercity. To activate the Mekhane's Kiss. The teleportation device.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> IMPOSSIBLE. IT WAS STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND. UNFINISHED. IT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE CITY. KILLED THOUSANDS.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Look around you. The city <em>was</em> destroyed. Thousands did die.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-001-A1:</strong> YES. BUT I COULD NOT HAVE ACTIVATED IT ANYWAY. THERE WAS NO CONTROL INTERFACE. NO WAY TO DIRECT THE ENERGY.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> He gave you something. He called it a blessing - it was a vial, of some sort. Told you to smash it and drink it. You took off your armor, you did, and touched the thing, and - I guess you fused with the machine or something. You became the control mechanism, and you fired. Teleported the city from the Sinai to the Arabian desert.

Sorry for the delay - just sorting out some repairs in the undercity.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Robert. How are you doing?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Not too bad. Yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Doing well, thank you. I like what you've done with the place.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Thank you. It hasn't been easy, but we've finally turned it into someplace halfway livable.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Right, yes. But I'm worried, Robert.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Worried?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> About the pace of reporting. Your publishings on the paratechnology in the city have declined by almost half in the past month or two. Doctor Nussbaum's reports on the archaeology and history have met the same fate. Speaking of which, where is Doctor Nussbaum?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> <em>[Pause.]</em> Let's walk. I've been in this office so much it's getting hard to think.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Sure.</p>\n<p><em>[ARAM and O5-11 exit the office, accompanied by a detachment of MTF Alpha-1 bodyguards. They begin walking through the corridors of the palace and temple.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Nussbaum's just working on some stuff in the southern district, I'm sure she'll join us soon. But you were saying?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> I'm starting to think this project has run its natural course, Robert.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What do you mean? There's still so much more to decipher. We barely know anything about the history, culture, peoples-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Since when have you ever been interested in that sort of thing? It's the technology, Robert. It was always about unlocking the secrets of the city - and you did that job phenomenally! We've learned so much - every technological report has been pored over by experts at 19 to see how we could put it into practice.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Yeah, but that's just the Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Robert, not this again. We don't go around replicating 500 to cure cancer just because we can. We have a responsibility to maintain normalcy. We can't become the arbiters of what secrets the world can and can't know - we can only hide all of them equally.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Well, what if it has run its course? What do you plan to do?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> We've already got people in India and China sites looking around for the locations of the other two cities. We've learned all that we can from Amoni-Ram, so it's time to move on to new pastures.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> What'll happen to us?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Reassigned with glowing recommendations to any projects of their choosing.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> Well, what if they want to stay here? A lot of them have become attached to the place. We've turned it from a ruin to a home.

They look up to me.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Well. In any case, it's unfortunate, but they don't exactly have much say in the matter. It's how it is.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> You're being too hasty, Overseer.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Maybe, but the rest of the Council agrees with me. We'll leave a skeleton crew to continue low-priority work, but we need you and Nussbaum's talents elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm not going. Amoni-Ram was lost once because of people who didn't understand what it had to offer. I'm not going to let that happen again.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> I don't think you understand. It's not up to you anymore. The decision has been made.</p>\n<p><strong>ARAM:</strong> I'm not some fucking dog you can shove around from project to project.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Have you forgotten who you're talking to?

Foundation policy on cybernetic implants is currently frozen, pending Council vote.\n\n\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-001 is an extradimensional 'bubble' of self-contained reality, located in the southern Arabian desert, inaccessible to individuals that do not have prior knowledge of SCP-001's location. Traveling through the desert with only the intention of reaching SCP-001 is not sufficient; express and exact knowledge of its geographical position is required.\n\n\n\nNotably, individuals with some sort of artificial implant \u2014 ranging from surgical screws and plates to complex prosthetics \u2014 appear to have a higher chance of success in locating and entering the anomaly. The purpose and range of this is unclear, but personnel with implants successfully entered SCP-001 in 88% of tests, compared to standard personnel's 62%.\n\n\n\nSCP-001 contains an ancient metropolis partially buried in the sand. Maps and initial sonar testing indicate approximately two thirds of this city are aboveground and largely intact, while the subterranean portion has degraded heavily and is no longer structurally sound. The aboveground portion is made up of skyscrapers and buildings up to half a kilometer high using modern design techniques far beyond those available at the time of construction, which has been carbon dated to approximately 2,400 BCE. The buildings are fully set and furnished, and appear to have served residential, commercial, bureaucratic, and various other uses. The largest and most intricate of these buildings is a large temple structure in the center of the city that extends through all thirds.\n\n\n\nThere are no living organisms inside the city [[span class=\"label\"]](See Section 001.4)[[/span]].\n\n\n\nThe buildings also contain artistic works and large bas-reliefs depicting a variety of scenes ranging from apparently-religious stories to historical events. These contain writing in an unknown language containing elements of Old Arabic [[span class=\"label\"]](See Section 001.2)[[/span]]. Most of these are concentrated in the temple at the heart of SCP-001.\n\n\n\nThe subterranean floors are dominated by extensive, complex machinery. These range from antiquated clockwork systems to vacuum tubes to power generators extremely similar to modern nuclear reactors. However, all machinery is nonfunctional and appears to be in a state of advanced disrepair.\n\n\n\nSCP-001-A is a collective designation for all automata found within the city, chief among which is SCP-001-A1 [[span class=\"label\"]](See Section 001.2)[[/span]].\n\n\n\nSCP-001-A1 has identified the city as being the origin for the Quranic myth of Iram of the Pillars [[span class=\"label\"]](See Section 001.1)[[/span]], but has clarified that its proper name is Amoni-Ram.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Section 001.1\n\n+++ {{HISTORICAL BRIEFING}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe first mention of Iram in mundane literature is in the eighty-ninth chapter of the Quran, lines six through fourteen. They reference \u201dIram \u2013 who had lofty pillars, the likes of whom had never been created in the lands\u201d as a culture subject to divine retribution by God for their oppression of others.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n6: Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with \u2018Aad \u2013\n\n7: [With] Iram \u2013 who had lofty pillars,\n\n8: The likes of whom had never been created in the lands\n\n9: And [with] Thamud, who carved out the rocks in the valley?\n\n10: And [with] Pharaoh, owner of the Pyramids? \u2013\n\n11: [All of] whom oppressed within the lands\n\n12: And increased therein the corruption.\n\n13: So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment.\n\n14: Indeed, your Lord is in observation.\n\n//Surah al-Fajr (6-14)//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=alhambra.jpg|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=From Lord Blackwood's private collection.\n\n]]\n\n\n\nMany theories have been offered on the identity or location of the group or city identified as Iram, but nothing has ever been confirmed by the wider historical community.\n\n\n\nSCP-001 first came to Foundation attention in 1983 upon the containment of [[[SCP-1867]]]. With the seizure of assets in SCP-1867's private vault, a series of journals were recovered detailing its experiences with the French Arm\u00e9e d'Orient during their campaign into the Middle East in 1801. One journal partially dictated an encounter with a vast, ruined city accessible only to those who knew its location, but moisture damage had left it largely unreadable. An interview was conducted.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - JUNE 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=blackwood.jpg|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=Lord Theodore Thomas Blackwood.|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0align=right\n\n]]\n\n**INTERVIEWER:** Doctor Hedvig Nussbaum, Parahistory Division, Special Consultant on Anomalous Cults and Cultures\n\n\n\n**SUBJECT:** SCP-1867 (\"Lord Theodore Thomas Blackwood\")\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Evening, madam!\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Hello, Lord Blackwood.\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** I must say, it's heartening to see someone of the gentler sex in such an academic position. Warms the cockles of my heart.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** ... Right. Well, we would like to talk to you about one of the items recovered from your vault. A journal titled \"Lord Blackwood in the First Cities of Man\".\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Of course, of course. Penned from 1800 to 1824. Does the journal not answer your questions? I recall being very thorough.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Water damage has left it unreadable.\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** I see, that's a shame. Well! It's been quite a while, but I remember that adventure fondly. Initiated by a gift given to me by one Monsieur Jacques Brazeau of //le estate Noir//. Agents of the French crown had recovered it before the revolution from an ancient shipwreck in the Aegean Sea.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What was it?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** A set of six clay tablets, remarkably preserved for their age. Detailing the existence of three empires spanning Asia, thousands of years old and more powerful and advanced than any culture since, even our own. And, of course, their nigh-apocalyptic war.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** You would think something like that would leave evidence.\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Yes, I was similarly skeptical upon my first reading of the tablets. But they addressed those inquiries - these empires were advanced occultists, magicians and magic-users, ruled by sorcerer-nawabs. Hiding their cities from their enemies was a trivial task, and exactly why the //mundane// scholars have found nothing.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** But not you, I take it?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Exactly correct, madam. I believe I have a copy of one of the pages from the journal stashed away somewhere, I'll see if we can't find that. But in simplest terms, the first of the three great cities of Man was Amoni-Ram, located in the sands of Arabia. As luck would have it, Monsieur Brazeau was accompanying General Bonaparte - still a general at the time, thank heavens - on his campaign into Egypt. Simple matter for me and a small expedition to tag along and then diverge into the peninsula.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** So you knew the location of the city at this point?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** In a fashion. You see, the tablets claim Amoni-Ram was hidden after the other empires allied to attack it, as it was a superior center of knowledge and weaponry. Only those who knew its location could enter. And its location happened to be recorded in the tablets. Three days into the desert, we found it. It was like passing into a bubble, and the towers became visible over the horizon.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Towers, you said?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Great buildings fashioned of metal, impossibly tall - easily hundreds of meters. A bronze glow set them alight from the sun overhead. There must have been a dozen of these sky-scraping buildings, between them resting smaller but still grand buildings of marble, stone, clay. Towering minarets and domes like those found in Mohammedan temples. A grand sight, altogether. The city must have been able to hold hundreds of thousands of people - we explored a tiny fraction of the surface portion.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** There was a subterranean area?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Even bigger than the surface, I would say. Again, we could not explore deep - the underground rapidly transitioned from grand hollows and caverns to a winding, labyrinthine tunnel system, metal pipes and doors and rivets all throughout. Machinery I could not begin to guess the purpose of, all still as death.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Did you find any entities inside the city?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** No living ones, though my men repeatedly claimed they heard something skittering about while we stayed in the city. I dismissed it as wildlife, sand rabbits or such. We never saw anything.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What about dead ones?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Yes. Entire sections of the tunnels were impassable - growths of a strange black vine, as thick as a man, winding and knotting entire passageways. It appeared petrified. There were also curious bulbous sacs sticking to the walls and ceiling of many buildings, under and above ground. I prodded these with my sword - they leaked, spewing out a decomposing specimen that smelled like death. An impossibly emaciated man, skin burnt away by the acid. We did not touch them again.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Sounds like something bad happened there.\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** Indeed. Throughout, the city has a very specific.... air, I suppose.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** An air?\n\n\n\n**SCP-1867:** The distinct feeling of walking into a graveyard.\n\n-----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nSCP-1867 surrendered the location of the Aegean Tablets. Translation is ongoing due to the extremely specific dialect of Ancient Greek they are written in. The extant page of the journal mentioned by Blackwood contains a translation of the front of the first tablet.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT -- JULY 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\nIn the beginning, there were three.\n\n\n\nA thousand years before, before man learned of Olympus, before the extinction of the giants, before the sea had full regressed, there were three. Three great cities dividing the world tripartite.\n\n\n\nMamjul and Korar, two dark fortresses resting in the jungles of the subcontinent. The magicians and sorcerer-nawabs allied themselves against the horrors of the jungle, and crossed a pact with something ancient. The Covenant of the Daeva was born, using the first magic gifted to Man - the magic of life and death.\n\n\n\nAdytum, a city thrown into rebellion by a charismatic slave turned lay preacher who promised wealth, freedom, and power to those that would help him. Together they threw off their yokes, slaughtered their oppressors with their new sorcery and rebuilt their collapsed city, all under the name of the Grand Karcist Ion. The N\u00e4lka Empire freed the second magic - carnomancy, the magic of flesh.\n\n\n\nAmoni-Ram, first great Ram of the Mekhanite Empire as it spread like a wildfire from the deserts. A gleaming, shining metropolis rising out of the dunes - a center of knowledge, science, understanding that the world had never seen. The magic of machines became known, the fervor for a new god that sought to uplift men, not subjugate them.\n\n\n\nA thousand years before, the three great nations of men fought a war that destroyed the world.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe Aegean Tablets go on to clarify that Amoni-Ram was ruled by a theocratic cult in the area. The endonym of the group is unknown, but the Greek tablets refer to it exclusively as the Mekhanite Cult or Cult of the Broken God. No other evidence for this group had been discovered thus far.\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Section 001.2\n\n+++ {{INITIAL ENCOUNTER}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nMTF Sigma-3 (\"Magellan Men\") were dispatched to the coordinates provided by SCP-1867 to investigate the location of SCP-001 and, if possible, gain entry to the city.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT -- AUGUST 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n**MAGELLAN-1:** We're coming up to the coordinates now.

Biometrics are lost, audiovisual contact is lost for thirteen seconds. Satellite uplink reestablished, and a video feed from MAGELLAN-4's ocular implants begins coming through. The other three members of MAGELLAN are visible, standing on a sand dune. Several hundred meters ahead of them, a massive glass-and-metal city stands shining in the sunlight. Its skyscrapers are hundreds of meters tall, bordering broad avenues of sandstone.]//\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-2:** Oh, man.\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-4:** That is.... wow. That's beautiful.\n\n\n\n**COMMAND:** Please enter the city and begin initial exploration.\n\n\n\n//[MAGELLAN continues into the streets of Amoni-Ram. The larger skyscrapers are made of a bronze-colored metal and polished glass, while the smaller buildings seem to be constructed from a blend of limestone bricks and concrete. All buildings exhibit an architectural style reminiscent of Islamic and Moroccan architecture. The streets appear to have designated sections for pedestrians and larger traffic.]//\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-2:** This place is thousands of years old, why do they have streets with lanes?\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-4:** The rest of the place looks awfully advanced. Maybe they had early anomalous cars or something, I don't know.\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-3:** //(Exiting a home)// These are all fully furnished, too. It looks lived-in.

They encounter large stairways inset into the ground, leading to the subterranean sections. They return before descending more than a few meters.]//\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-3:** Blackwood wasn't lying, looks like there's a pretty substantial underground part to the city, almost like a metro or something. It's dark and smells musty as hell down there though, I can't see a thing. Wouldn't suggest descending without the Rats.\n\n\n\n**COMMAND:** Noted, thank you.\n\n\n\n//[MAGELLAN continues, arriving in a heavily deteriorated section of the city.

If he's right, there should be plenty around to grab samples from.\n\n\u00a0\n\n//[After two hours of walking through the ruined portion of the city, encountering many more graves, MAGELLAN approaches the low, wide complex in the approximate center of SCP-001. It is only a few stories high, but much more grand, decorated in wide bas-reliefs and illustrated fa\u00e7ades with ceramic tiling.]//\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN-2:** Fancy.

Each is about 500m, a little taller than Sears Tower. A marvel of engineering in and of itself, but not an obviously anomalous one. What they contain, however, is a different story.\n\n\n\nFor my layman's perspective, they appear to be a combination of residential, office, and bureaucratic buildings. Each floor seems to consign itself to one of those three types, and contains appropriate pieces of technology - most are too degraded to be useful, but the fact that they're there at all after thousands of years is incredible. I can discern the purposes of about a quarter of them, though. They're all anomalous to some extent - the drones are writing up detailed reports now, but they variously break laws of thermodynamics, physics, and matter conservation, and often simply use magic to do things as mundane as copy documents or keep food hot or cold.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n\n[[image crab.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n\nSCP-001-A instance.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, the automata. Little machines, made of a golden metal and built to resemble animals that this culture in the middle of the desert could have no possible way of knowing about. Definitely sentient, possibly sapient - fully mechanical (I found a broken-open one on the street and took it as a sample, picture attached) but demonstrating what looks to me like primitive artificial intelligence. There must be hundreds of them, at least - my guess is that they were designed to maintain the city and, for the millenia it's lain abandoned, they've been doing exactly that. They're pretty cute, to be honest.\n\n\n\nWhatever this civilization was, the anomalous was so //pedestrian// to them they were using paratechnology we even now barely understand as household appliances and servants. They were playing with nuclear reactors while the rest of us huddled in caves behind the fire. If this is any indicator of what lies below the streets... Amoni-Ram might be the key to pushing humanity into the future.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT -- SEPTEMBER 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR HEDVIG NUSSBAUM**\n\n[[size 80%]]AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE[[/size]]\n\n----\n\n[[size 110%]]//Personal thoughts on the historical potential of Amoni-Ram//[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nI have to continually pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming. A vast city, undocumented by anyone else in the modern era, hiding a culture that had blended advanced magic and technology to settle half of Asia while the Egyptians had yet to settle the Nile. If the evidence wasn't surrounding me, I'd call myself a liar.\n\n\n\nWe've already discovered much. Some of the researchers are more interested in investigating the individual houses and homes to see what an average citizen lived like - completely understandable. That said, I'm far more intrigued by this 'Cult of Mekhane' that seems to pervade every aspect of Amoni-Ram.\n\n\n\nIn the ruins of Sumer and other ancient cities, religious iconography is common. Here, it's ubiquitous; the palace-temple is the most obvious example of this, with mechanical bas-reliefs that seem to tell a creation myth laid throughout. The buildings, houses, shops, skyscrapers, even the machinery Robert's team is disassembling have this religious significance about them.\n\n\n\nIt's especially fascinating since practically nothing else is known to us about the religion or culture of these 'Mekhanites' beyond the admittedly-questionable statements of Lord Blackwood. Even the name Mekhanite is a Greek epithet used in the Aegean tablets, derivative of //mekhane//; machine. As it stands, their culture is a blackbox, and even with the murals and writings, I doubt we will ever have more than a passing understanding of this once-great civilization - and what happened to them.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nMTF Zeta-9 Fireteam ECHO passed through SCP-001 and arrived in Amoni-Ram on September 6th with no complications.

The documents were as follows:\n\n\n\n* A basic translation guide from the language all records within Amoni-Ram are written in, coined Mekhanite, to English, with some Greek bywords. Digitized and distributed to all members of the archaeological team;\n\n* A map of the undercity, fully annotated with sections of interest and unpassable areas that ECHO team had missed. Combined with the CTM map formed by ECHO team to offer a complete map of the undercity;\n\n* Full schematics of various technologies found within the city. Digitized and distributed to all members of the engineering team;\n\n* In addition, a small mechanical device of unknown function was provided to Doctor Aram;\n\n\n\nWith the assistance provided by SCP-001-A1, research into Amoni-Ram began in earnest on September 12th, 1983.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT - SEPTEMBER 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n**MURAL ANALYSIS**\n\n[[size 80%]]AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nThe temple courtyard contains intricate murals depicting what Dr. Nussbaum theorizes is a creation myth for the extant Mekhanite culture. Accompanying these are plaques bearing an inscription in Mekhanite. While the rest of the archaeological team investigated the rest of the city, a small team was dedicated to translating the courtyard engravings.\n\n----\n\n**Side Description:** First relief depicts a scene of three figures wrestling in a dark void, followed by the figures falling to different corners of a slightly inaccurate[[footnote]] The Indian subcontinent extends much farther into the Indian Ocean, there is a land bridge between China and Japanese archipelago, and there are 7 inland seas of varying size. [[/footnote]] map of Asia. One lands in the far corner of the Indian subcontinent, one lands on the coast of China, and one lands in the center of the Arabian peninsula. This final figure dominates the rest of the scenes; it is revealed to be a massive but lithe figure dressed in golden armor. A shepherd, his wife, and his three lame sheep happen upon it buried in the sand, obviously wounded.\n\n\n\n**Translation of Plaque:** BEFORE THE NEW PANTHEON, BEFORE THE SMOKE AND THE SINGING, THE OLD GODS FOUGHT THEIR WAR OVER NOTHING. THEY WOUNDED EACH OTHER AND FELL, TWISTING AND WRITHING, TO THE LOWEST WORLD. MEKHANE, BLESSED BE HER NAME, ALIGHTED IN THE FAR WEST UNDER THE SCORCHING GAZE OF THE SUN. SHE RESTED IN THE DUNES, UNCOVERED BY THE FLOCK OF A SHEPHERD - BUMARO.\n\n----\n\n**Side Description:** The god reaches out and touches the shepherd and his wife. The shepherd's missing leg is replaced by a metal limb, and his shepherd's crook is replaced by a spear, both made from the golden metal. His wife's eyes glow gold, and large metal wings spring from her back. The sheep are armored over to resemble SCP-001-A instances. Together, the shepherd, his wife, and their flock attempt to raise the god from the sand.\n\n\n\n**Translation of Plaque:** MEKHANE DREW FORTH HER TOUCH AND RAISED THEM. BUMARO'S LAME LEG REPLACED BY A GREAVE, HEDARA'S SIGHT RESTORED AND ALL GIVEN THE FORM OF THE ANGELS. GRATEFUL, THEY SOUGHT TO RAISE THEIR NEW GOD FROM HER TOMB, AND THEY FAILED.\n\n----\n\n**Side Description:** The god digs deeper, lying face down in the sand. It looks up at the shepherd and strips the armor from its massive fist. The shepherd takes the armor and fashions a simple forge, melting and reforging it into a suit of armor in the image of the god and a massive throne. He returns to his village, where the people naturally submit to him. Many are disabled and lacking limbs. They return to the resting place of the god, who touches them all in turn, replacing their shortcomings with its gifts. They rejoice and, as the god strips its armor, use the metal to construct a shining city on its back.\n\n\n\n**Translation of Plaque:** SHE KNEW THAT THE WOUND WAS NOT MORTAL, BUT CRIPPLING. SHE UNDERSTOOD HER FATE - AND ENTRUSTED HER LEGACY TO BUMARO AND HIS BLOOD. HE BECAME THE FIRST BLACKSMITH, SHAPING THE METAL OF HER BODY AS SHE SHAPED LIFE ITSELF. HE MADE HIMSELF IN HER IMAGE, AND THE PEOPLE WERE AWED. FOR THEIR FAITH, THEY WERE UPLIFTED BEYOND THE CHAINS OF HUMANITY, AND FROM HER STRIPPED ARMOR THEY RAISED THE FIRST CITY ON THE BACK OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS - AMONI-RAM, CITY OF FULADH, SHINING GATE OF THE WEST.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT - OCTOBER 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n**MACHINERY LOG**\n\n[[size 80%]]AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nFrom September to February, hundreds of pieces of technology were analyzed and investigated by the engineering team. While many were too degraded to be of any practical use, they were still highly illuminating in determining the technology level of the extant Mekhanite culture. A few particularly notable discoveries are attached:\n\n----\n\n**Description:** Four-meter poles inset into the ground at various intervals through the streets of Amoni-Ram. Six disc-shaped objects, a meter wide, top each pole. When an electrical current is applied to the pole, the discs begin to knock against each other, emitting radio waves of unclear purpose. Currently theorized to be some sort of conductor system for the city, possibly an attempt at creating a free, wireless power system.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** Large, partially subterranean greenhouses occupying a significant portion of the western district of the city. Copper pipes running underground gases alternatingly cool and heat them according to valves, and the greenhouses are several floors tall, utilizing novel organization and irrigation techniques. Operating at maximum efficiency, a large portion of the city's theorized half-a-million population could have been fed by them.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** A series of magnetically charged rails running through the city in a loop, though all the cars have been completely ruined. Applying a specific electrical charge allows rapid, high-speed movement through the city - based on the lack of stations or stopping points, this is believed to have been a \"hop-on, hop-off\" method of mass transit at extraordinarily low overhead.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** Small metal shields with two switches on the handle. When fully powered, one switch projects a rapidly-oscillating energy shield that protects the wearer against fast-moving kinetic objects. The shield can be maintained for up to twenty minutes on a full charge. The other switch projects a skintight shield that camouflages the wearer with their surroundings, effectively rendering them invisible. This is much more power-intensive and can only be maintained for three to six minutes depending on movement.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** Large constructs, two in every district, set into the ground, though not part of the undercity. The locks and seals have been damaged. Inside are large machines that have been investigated to contain radioactive material. Details are currently sealed, but the engineering team is of the opinion that these could have been functional nuclear or possibly cold-fusion reactors, supplying electricity to the city's power grid and 'power poles'.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** Unclear. Large sections of the undercity are inaccessible, making thorough analysis difficult - however, the engineering team agreed that a significant portion of the undercity appears to be one gargantuan machine incorporating mundane technology along with paratechnology. Further research required.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nIn the process of research and excavation, SCP-001-A instances led the archaeological team to a structure within the Southern district that appeared to be a record center, possibly a library or university. While the vast majority of the paper documents contained therein were rotted and illegible, the metal and clay tablets were remarkably well-preserved. The instances further directed personnel to a basement section containing a large metal safe, since rusted off its hinges. Within was a cache of several dozen metal cylinders measuring 10cm in diameter, imprinted with writing in Mekhanite. Due to their form, the language, and several other factors, only one was immediately translated.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"scripture\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT - NOVEMBER 1983\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAnd the Shining Eye of the Empire rose as Bumaro took his anointed Seat on the Fuladh Throne. Amoni-Ram rose from the sands on the back of MEKHANE, her Pieces scattered to the six winds and the five corners of the world. As the slaves marched on Adytum in the East and the Covenants were struck in the South, so too was the holiest and the godliest of magics given freely to Man under the watchful eye of the Sun.\n\n\n\nAnd the Sword of MEKHANE cut a swath through the world, and all those trembled in fear until they saw the light of the Ram. The greatest city of Man, gifted by MEKHANE but built by the hands of the workers, not the demons of the Covenant or the flesh-slaves. The Empire swelled and the Metal Road ferried new people, and Amoni-Ram swelled from their presence, and the world was good as Bumaro watched from his Throne for his reign of centuries.\n\n\n\nAnd when his reign ended and his golden body passed, the Empress Hedara wept, and the city of Amoni-Ram wept with her, and they rested their hope onto the heir. And Hashir Bumaro grew into a wise king under the auspices of his family, and gave his arm and his leg for his empire just as his father had done, and in that way Bumaro lived on, resting in the soul of his son and his son's son and so on forevermore.\n\n\n\nAnd the Emperor Bumaro used the Throne to invoke the wisdom of his past lives, and in that way the Empire conquered and slew its way into the world.

An older man in a finely pressed grey suit stands in front of it, hands in his pockets.]//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Hello, guys. Welcome to my little kingdom.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Where... are we?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** A Leyspace. A virtual projection with no data transfer delay, all powered by the ley lines of the Earth.

I've read the reports, but I want to hear it from the horse's mouth. Doctor Nussbaum? Your progress so far?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes. We've recovered hundreds of tablets and engravings and mosaics across the city, and are in the process of translating them. The vast majority are simple, day-to-day affairs - business and legal records, personal correspondence, //et cetera//. All paint the picture of the Mekhanite culture - a society that was building a metropolis of the future while the glaciers from the Ice Age were still melting. They had a complex legal and justice system, a novel family structure incorporating distant cousins into large households and 'clans'-\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Yes, anthropology, fascinating. I was wondering if you had figured out any more of their later history?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** \"Later history\", sir?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**O5-11:** What happened to them. Between the technological and the archaeological reports, this was a culture that was undisputed as the most advanced in the world at the time, but they also keep mentioning this war with the other two nations, the- this \"Adytum\" of the N\u00e4lka Empire and the Mamjul referenced as the capital of the Daevite Covenant. What that signals to me - and do tell me if I'm wrong, please - is that these two empires were each powerful enough to withstand a war with the Mekhanite culture. And, depending on what happened to Amoni-Ram, bring it to its knees.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I suppose so, sir, but the Aegean tablets do not give a precise location for the other two cities, and if we do want to find them - well, a location could be anywhere, in a shipping record, in a letter to a distant cousin-\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** That's fine, but we need to figure out how this city died. And I'd be pretty goddamn willing to bet that the... //things// you found in the undercity are related. The flesh-thingies and the plants.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Nothing has been confirmed yet. Though it does seem quite likely.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Hmph. Well, in the meantime, see what you can get out of that robot down there... what's its name?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Preserver. SCP-001-A1. And it's not a robot, it's an artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Whatever it is, it's hiding something from you. And speaking of which - this place had artificial intelligence when the Persians were figuring out irrigation?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Far from the only breakthrough. If we can harness their cold fusion technology, their bionics, their power systems - reverse engineering any one of their innovations could change the world.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Well- okay, slow your roll. We don't know what happened to them, like I said. For all we know, their technology led them to their downfall, so let's wait before getting any ideas of dragging the world into the 21st century early. Let's focus on changing the Foundation first, right Robert?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Good. But I suppose that if you want to improve the rate of research, you're going to need more people.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yes. I have a list of requisition requests. All sorts of machinery, excavation equipment, HAZMAT equipment and scientific machinery. Funding, of course.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Naturally. Forward it to my Factotum, we'll take care of anything you need. We're very excited about this over at Site-01, you know. Very excited to see what comes out of Amoni-Ram next.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** We also need... people.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** How many people?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Right now there's about 50 of us, and the security. But we're stretched thin to explore a whole city - I've run the numbers and 200 additional personnel would give us the arms we need.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** That's a lot of arms, Robert. Not something I can make happen with a snap of my fingers.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I have a list of names I can forward. And it is a lot, but we've barely scratched the surface of what the Mekhanites left us, and already are reaping the rewards. Surely it's worth it?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Can't disagree there. You'll have your people within two months. Might need to consider expanding.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm inclined to agree, which is why I wanted to request your permission to see if we can get certain aspects of the city working again.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Like what?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** The power grid, for one. We've mapped it out pretty well and it's surprisingly intact. I'm confident that with the extra arms and 001-A1's help, we could get the reactors online within the month.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Hmph.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** The better situated the city is, the more we can learn about the machinery. And the more we can improve the Foundation.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** I suppose so. Permission granted, just... stay safe. We're still working blind here. You both have your orders, anyway. Good luck.\n\n\n\n//[O5-11 opens the car door and gets inside, starting the engine. Simultaneously, the Leyspace collapses into darkness and ARAM and NUSSBAUM step backward.]//\n\n\n\n**OPERATOR:** Ley connection to Overwatch Command terminated.\n\n----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ Section 001.5\n\n+++ {{LATER RESEARCH}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nThe additional personnel and requisitions arrived via airlift to ARF-01 throughout March and April of 1984. The sudden threefold increase in personnel required immediate expansion - ARF-02 was established in another structurally-intact skyscraper in the Southern district of Amoni-Ram, each site now holding approximately one hundred personnel.\n\n\n\nTo connect the two sites, the disused rail system of Amoni-Ram was brought back into functional condition to ferry materials and personnel. This further necessitated the repair and refurbishment of the city's power grid and reactors, using technical assistance from SCP-001-A1 and its automatons. While the cold fusion reactors required extensive study and repair, the relatively simpler nuclear reactors incorporating paratechnology were slowly brought online using requisitioned nuclear fuel. On April 12th, the first two thaumic reactors came online, providing power to the entire Western and Southern districts of the city, allowing use of lighting, air conditioning, and of the rail system to ferry personnel and materials between the two sites.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - APRIL 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**INTERVIEWERs:** Doctor Hedvig Nussbaum, Doctor Robert Aram\n\n\n\n**SUBJECT:** SCP-001-A1\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n//[SCP-001-A1's head twitches upward.]//\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU ARE REPAIRING MY CITY.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hello to you too.

It's not ruined, it's perfect, the streets are bustling with activity, the markets- people are hawking their wares, shouting - it's a living, breathing fucking city.

Medical personnel found he had a slightly elevated blood pressure and heartbeat, consistent with strenuous physical activity, but was otherwise healthy. He was placed in an infirmary bed; the following day, he was conscious, active, and responsive within normal levels. Closer inspection revealed no lasting physical or neurological damage from the incident, and Doctor Aram indeed expressed a closer interest in the archaeological team's findings in the following days, citing his experience as giving him a newfound interest in the extant Mekhanite culture. While the findings from the Throne test were transcribed and analyzed, other records found in the city were translated.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"scripture\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT - APRIL 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAnd the sweep of the Golden Legion took three long centuries of expansion as the Mekhanite Empire's legates established beautiful, harmonious dominion on the oases and villages of the world. And as they expanded, they found relics - artifacts sheared from MEKHANE during their god's fall from heaven, scattered over the Earth, and with each relic carried back to Amoni-Ram the fervor of the people grew and grew as their leaders rose, warred, and died for their heirs.\n\n\n\nAnd as the Legion marched forward over those long centuries, two other nations of man marched. The Covenant of the Daeva rode forth on their great horrible spirit-beasts, searing a path through the jungle from their twin-city of Mamjul Korar. And they used their black magic to open a gap, stepping from one side of the continent to another, and those that went through established another city - Adytum, that would after another two centuries fall to its own slaves, branding themselves the N\u00e4lka.\n\n\n\nAnd all these parties marched into Asia, only vaguely aware of the existence of the other two until the Battle of Harumar, where they collided. The existence was an affront - the disgusting flesh-beasts of the N\u00e4lka an insult to the steel glory of MEKHANE, and the Covenant's plant-spirits choking and infesting the gears and wheels of the Legion, and so the Legion fired the first mortar, shattering the Covenant's ranks, and thus began a war that would end with the destruction of Asia.\n\n\n\nThe First War raged across the continent in every theater. Fleets of golden-hulled warships constructed in Amoni-Ram and pushed downriver to encounter the Covenant in the Bay. The N\u00e4lka raised an army of the dishonored dead from Adytum and marched them ceaselessly to throw themselves in the front line, choking the vines of the sorcerer-nawabs. There were no laws in war, and there is no honor in death - every corpse was fodder for future battles. Forests were scorched during retreat to deny the Covenant seed, and the warriors of the N\u00e4lka and Covenant chose to throw their weapons in the sea rather than surrender the precious metal to the foundries of the Legion. And the COLOSSI, great thousand-arm-tall goliaths of steel and bronze and fuladh that rent the sky down upon the N\u00e4lkan hordes. Every second man was killed in the fighting, and it raged for three hundred years and would have gone on forever until the Abominate landed his ships on the western coast of Aethiopia and began his march to Amoni-Ram.\n\n\n\nDevastation.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA week later, Doctor Aram once again volunteered to use the Throne, citing his quick recovery and the wealth of potential ancient knowledge hidden in the accounts of the various Emperors Bumaro.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MAY 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Do you feel alright?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Dandy.

I cannot afford to be involved in your affairs, Pharaoh.\" We're arguing - shouting. \"The Abominate is marching on Amoni-Ram, and he will cut a swath through Egypt and stack your corpses to build a bridge across the Nile for his army.\" \"If I rout the Covenant at Thamud, we can stand united-\" He's - I said no. I'm leaving, he's angry. Why doesn't he understand? There are bigger things at stake!\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Robert, focus. What is happening?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Same- no, different scene, different throne room. Different ruler - a man in a robe and turban. Looks Arab or Ottoman or something. He's shaking his head- now it's some sort of tribal chief, in a tent. A Rus prince. We're discussing establishing trade routes, selling our fuladh, the technology - they're willing to trade, but they don't want to get involved with the War and risk the N\u00e4lka or the Covenant.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** So there are contemporaries.

They're scaling the walls - the defenders are- they look Indian almost, they're running in terror, there's - ghosts? Some kind of spirits swirling in the air, mixing with the smoke. We're bringing down the walls and killing the soldiers on the battlements. I'm - there's someone behind me. The general, the woman, in the dragon armor. The troops are looking to her. I'm giving her a nod, and she screams something, and they charge down the bluff, this giant metal armor-suit leading the charge. They're shattering the line - Jesus, it's a fucking massacre. She's holding a sword up- holy shit, lightning just struck it. Now I'm in the city. I'm on my mount, surveying the ruins. The woman is beside me - I touch her head. I can see myself in her helmet. I'm young, I can't be more than 25, but I'm in the intricate battle armor. There's survivors - there's someone dragging themselves across the dirt, holding their guts in- Jesus! Fuck!\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** She just stepped on his head. Something burst out - this spirit-flame thing, just shot into the air. His brains are on the dirt.

We've mapped out the whole device - it occupies 65% of the undercity's volume, practically everything is connected to it that isn't stuff like the sewers. Its components have also become more understandable with our new experience on Mekhanite design architecture and philosophy. The technology is antiquated, but it's almost all paratech - extremely powerful conduits, converters, connections, etc, all terminating in a small chamber emitting extremely high levels of radiation. We sent a protected probe in, warding it - it melted a few minutes later but we ran the pictures and energy signals against the database and got... nothing. We've never seen anything like it.\n\n\n\nBut then, Tenz decided to call in a few favors and run it against the GOC database. Apparently they have seen something like it, and tried to weaponize it - a long-distance, large-scale matter de/reconstructor and emitter. A gigantic teleporter, basically. Apparently big enough to move an entire city hundreds of kilometers. Mekhane's Kiss isn't a superweapon, it's a Hail Mary.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it's completely burned out. It'd require a team months to get it back into remotely working order, and that's ignoring the problem of power. It's way too demanding to pull from the city's power grid - we think it draws directly from the cold fusion reactors, which is another impossibility. Plus we still don't know how it was controlled, or how any of the computation works without... well, computers. In any case, I don't think Amoni-Ram will be teleporting anywhere soon.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"scripture\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - JUNE 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAnd in the sixtieth year of the war, as the fighting reached a crescendo and Thamud burned with the shelling of the Legion on the flesh-hordes of the N\u00e4lka, the Matriarch of the Covenant and the Grand Karcist Ion met under the shadow of night in the black catacombs of Adytum. And there they came to understand a truth - bitter enemies though they might be, the flesh of the N\u00e4lka and the plants of the Covenant were an extension of each other, both extrusions of the natural world. Evenly matched, neither could truly destroy the other. But the Mekhanite blessed steel was something else - a gift from the sky, well capable of crushing each of them. But together, they stood a chance.\n\n\n\nAnd such it was that as the invasion plans were drawn and the great siege engines were constructed and the polearms cooled in the foundries, the Golden Legion marshalled and marched themselves, beginning the long, bloody truck to Adytum. And as they crossed through the desert of Asia, the N\u00e4lka were lending their forces to another invasion, this one raised by the sorcerer-nawabs with the Daeva against Amoni-Ram. A black, wicked army secretly gathering in the jungles of the South, marching on the suddenly-vulnerable First Ram of the Mekhanites. And with them came the magics - the N\u00e4lka offered one of their greatest boons, a plague to infest the city. And the Covenant offered the Song of the Daeva to make the verdant greenery of the desert rebel against its masters.\n\n\n\nAnd even then, their marshaled forces were not enough to dominate the colossi and take the city. But in the Far West, beyond the Gate, another storm was brewing. The Abominate, may his name never be spoken of, stood on the shores of the coast as the Damned Fleet disembarked from their massive ships. And his army assembled itself from his prisoners and his soldiers, and the march to the East, to Amoni-Ram, began. The city settled between two unstoppable forces, neither aware of the other's presence, as the two armies pushed to the walls of the city and the head of its king, queen, and general.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother meeting with O5-11 was scheduled for June 26th to ascertain the progress of the Amoni-Ram Initiative and relay new discoveries regarding the fate of the Mekhanite culture. On June 25th, an unidentified aircraft was detected 10km away from SCP-001. Upon confirmation that the aircraft was approaching SCP-001's entrance, ARF-01 radioed it asking for identification. The aircraft responded with valid Overwatch Command credentials, coming to a close landing and allowing O5-11 to disembark and enter SCP-001, escorted by MTF Alpha-1 \"Red Right Hand\".\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - JUNE 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n//[O5-11 is standing in one of Amoni-Ram's thoroughfares. An Alpha-1 agent stands on every nearby corner and window. The sun is directly overhead, but the cooling and power units on the street corners keep the air at room temperature. A hot, silent wind passes through the broadway. ARAM and NUSSBAUM approach from the north.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** //[Out-of-breath]// Hello, sir.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** O5-11. Sorry about the welcome, we weren't expecting you.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** I arranged a meeting, didn't I?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes, but we didn't expect you to, ah-\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Show up in person? Don't blame you, we're not exactly an outgoing bunch. But I've heard so many great things about this city over the past year. About its secrets, architecture, technology, culture, //history//. I wanted to see it for myself.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Everything you were hoping for?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** That and more. I'll admit it does look a lot nicer now that you've started to rebuild the place.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Thanks. We've managed to get primary power back online, along with the train system and a lot of the undercity's navigation maps and such. The power and climate control as well, obviously. We're going to try and get the city's weaponry back online soon, see what kind of defensive technology they were packing.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Hold that thought. Doctor Nussbaum?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** I'm told your historical team has made several breakthroughs recently. Especially using the Throne-anomaly. Which, if I recall correctly, you're the primary test subject for, Doctor Aram?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** That's correct. We've done about a dozen tests since we discovered it - only a handful have turned up anything substantial, it's mostly fragmented memories from old kings. Watching as the streets swell with citizens and goods flood into the markets. Visions of battlefields as the Mekhanite army takes on the Covenant and the N\u00e4lka.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Right. And of course, you've translated.... how many of the recovered tablets now?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Dozens, over a hundred. But like the Throne records, most are simple, banal correspondence.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** But not the recent ones.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Correct. I have a presentation compiled in my office. Shall we?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Lead the way.\n\n----\n\n//[NUSSBAUM, ARAM, O5-11, and the Alpha-1 operatives enter the office inside ARF-02. It fully covers one of the higher floors of the massive skyscraper. Inside, the furniture is a combination of metal and intricate stonework. A wall of windows looks out over the city. The group takes a seat in front of the desk.]//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Hm. I expected more of a... cantonment. But no, you seem quite comfortably set up here.\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM laughs.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Well, we have been here for nearly a year now. Plenty of time to settle in. And expanding to the second site has also helped free up space. Everyone has their own chambers.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Home sweet home.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Anyway as you know, we have made great strides recently in determining the fate of Amoni-Ram and the Mekhanite culture at large, using translated historical records in tandem with the Throne visions and SCP-001-A1's admittedly limited accounts. It has been established that the Daevic Covenant originate from the Indian subcontinent and the N\u00e4lka are likely from Central or East Asia. But the later records repeatedly mention a fourth party - the so-called 'Abominate'. As of now, we know functionally nothing about who or what this is - only that they were in possession of a fleet of seafaring vessels that landed on the shores west of Amoni-Ram, in the 'Old Country'. My hypothesis is that this is West Africa.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** The records say this figure marched to Amoni-Ram.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** While the Covenant-N\u00e4lka coalition marched from the east, yes.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** An army crossing the entire breadth of the Sahara four-thousand years ago is... hard-to-believe.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** It's not the strangest thing we've seen out here.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Indeed. We also have reason to believe that the Gobi desert was a significant theater in the First War, which would suggest the three primary cultures also had some sort of experience warring in deserts.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** You say three primary cultures - you don't include the Abominate in the equation?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** We are not sure if they're human yet, much less a distinct culture group. The Aegean tablets also do not mention any fourth party in the First war. However, I also have been in contact with some colleagues of mine at King Saud University, researching the mundane Thamud culture in the northwest. They recently unearthed a trove of tablets in the region, apparently detailing a cataclysmic battle between four armies for control of a major city.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Bingo.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes. I already have some people translating it - it is quite complex, but full translations should be ready within the month. In any case, the Mekhanite records we have found indicate that in the later stages of the war, the N\u00e4lka and Daevic Covenant allied themselves to take Amoni-Ram while the Mekhanite's Golden Legion marched across Asia to Adytum, the N\u00e4lka capital. This covers three of our armies, and evidently the Abominate is the fourth. But they also imply that the combined force of the N\u00e4lka and Daevic Covenant was not enough to take the city - that the Abominate, whatever it is, is more responsible for the fall of Amoni-Ram.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Goddamn. That's... disconcerting. But I suppose that there's nothing to do now but wait for translations, yes?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** That would appear to be the case.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Right. Doctor Aram, you said you had updates about the technology?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** That's right. We've discovered a lot of military weapons, it looks like - they range from CQC polearms and swords and what seem to be primitive chainsaws to long-range shoulder-mounted mortars and elephant guns. These were all in ruined warehouses in the sacked portion of the city, but we've also made a few interesting finds in the undercity.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Do tell.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** First, a few suits of functional power armor, of the kind in the Throne records. Exoskeletons to enhance strength, speed, durability, power, some of them even flight-capable through gravity-defying paratechnology. Unfortunately, they were unusable without Mekhanite implants to link to.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Well that's a goddamn shame.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Was. A few days later, SCP-001-A directed us to another chamber in the undercity. This one filled with assembly lines, industrial sections - and crates on crates of Mekhanite implants. Fuladh and steel bionic arms, legs, prosthetics, torso cages, even heads. And of course sensory implants - replacement visuals and sensory suites, just like ours. The Foundation already gives those things out like candy - so I think they're worth experimenting on, with D-Class.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** You... want to outfit D-class with millenia-old cybernetics so you can put them inside highly-destructive mechsuits? You know I can't approve that, Robert.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hm. I... see.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** The risk is just too great.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:**\u00a0\u00a0Sure. Okay. In the meantime, we'd like to try and see if the city's defensive systems still work. The ones I saw in my visions. The mechs, the gun emplacements.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** These... visions. You trust them?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I do. Seen them with my own two- well, not eyes, but you know what I mean. Why wouldn't I?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I don't lay my faith in all the technology quite so easily. I'd be wary. But, if what you said is true, then there's at least two superweapons in the city that the Foundation could deeply benefit from. Those colossuses are... impressive. And, of course, the teleporter. Mekhane's Kiss.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** It's not... yes, sir. I'm going to need lots of supplies. Deuterium and tritium, most importantly. We're going to try and bring those cold fusion reactors online.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** That's a big ask. And a dangerous one. We'd like to know how the city was destroyed before we accidentally blow it up, hah.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** We've already mastered most of the technology we've discovered, and we do have Preserver to assist us still.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** SCP-001-A1, yes. Still...\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Discovering the city's defense - and how effective they are - is crucial to getting an accurate image of the battle. Right, Hedvig?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I...\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes... yes it is. I support the idea.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Hm. Well, if both of you are in agreement, I can make it happen. But be safe, and don't take any needless risks. We don't want anything happening this far in, yes?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Of course.\n\n----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED DOCUMENT - JULY 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR ROBERT ARAM**\n\n[[size 80%]]AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE[[/size]]\n\n----\n\n[[size 110%]]//Personal log//[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nProgress on rebuilding the cold fusion reactors is progressing much, much faster than projections. Normally, I'd be worried, but I'm surprisingly calm. It's obvious - our people are getting familiar with the technology. The fuladh foundries are operating at amazing efficiency, we've worked out how to mold and shape the metal just how we need it, and what last year looked like a bizarre, nonsensical circuit structure and design philosophy now strikes me as beautifully idiosyncratic. A snapshot into a bygone era.\n\n\n\nI've never really been one for history. More of a STEM type - I never looked //down// on those that pursued history. I just didn't see the attraction - machines are in front of you, something tangible you can see and hear and touch and interact with. You can't do that with history, not really.\n\n\n\nThe Fuladh Throne, of course, has changed that. I've spent lifetimes of ancient emperors in minutes. It's staggering. The depth of emotion and personality you can feel from only a few choice minutes in someone's body. Their grief, pain, joy, their story. Fascinating stuff. The technology of the Throne and any possible side effects remain elusive, but we've been testing it for a few weeks now, maybe a dozen times, and while I'm always tired after - not a surprise, at my age - I feel fine otherwise. And now I know Mekhanite, Greek, and Egyptian. Go figure.\n\n\n\nI've gotten a front-seat view to the First War and it is... apocalyptic. There's really no other word for it. Gigantic mech suits crushing cities as the sky itself opens up? Spirit-demons fighting alongside human compatriots? Metal soldiers charging walls? Insanity. A secret, bloody history the world doesn't even remember. But as with all war, it's not quite so black-and-white.\n\n\n\nBeing inside Bumaro's - or, the various Bumaros' bodies - none of them were tyrants, or dictators. Maybe autocrats, but what emperor wasn't? They all wanted to protect their people, to raise them to something beyond human. I can't help but sympathize. Nothing impresses onto you the fragility of your body than nearly losing it - but they understood that and //actively// improved themselves using the bionics and implants. Reach heaven through transhumanism.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of implants and bionics, the cache we discovered some weeks ago along with the Legion armor; O5-11 denied D-class testing. It's frustrating. We can't use the glorious technology here to improve the world, we can't use it to improve ourselves, we can barely use it to improve the damn city. It's devastating, and most of the team agrees with me that we should use it.\n\n\n\nSo we did. I can't use D-class to test the implants, but using myself is a different matter. The new arm is... wonderful. It's smoother, more responsive, more sensitive and durable and it doesn't even hurt at the end of the day. I can sleep with it on. 99% of our personnel in Amoni-Ram are already augmented, so changing out their stainless steel arm for a fuladh one or something is no big deal. Why should Five be the only one that reaps the gifts the Mekhanites left us?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nOn July 29th, 2:05PM, Doctor Nussbaum and four members of the archaeological team were excavating a number of mosaics in the undercity. Over the course of the day, the team progressed further inward, into an unstable section. The ceiling overhead suddenly gave way, causing a minor collapse. Due to a number of strength-enhancing bionic and cybernetic augments, the archaeological team members were able to escape largely unharmed; however, Doctor Nussbaum sustained severe internal and external injuries from the collapse and was rushed into emergency surgery in the ARF-01 infirmary.\n\n\n\nDue to the severity of injuries sustained - including a shattered collarbone, fractured spine, cranial injuries, and hemorrhaging - medical personnel were able to stabilize her in critical condition. Her likelihood of survival was deemed extremely low. At this point, Doctor Aram arrived with several engineering team personnel, an SCP-001-A instance, and a variety of Mekhanite implants and augments. He proposed, to the medical team's agreement, that utilizing the advancing Mekhanite augments to stabilize her and offer her a chance of survival was the ethical option, and was legitimately possible using SCP-001-A1's expertise voiced through the -A instance. A combination of medical and engineering personnel worked for 29 hours to implant 17 pieces of Mekhanite technology across Doctor Nussbaum's body. After 32 hours unconscious, she awoke on July 31st.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - JULY 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** //[Whispering]// Wa-ter.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Wh- Oh!

And even if you didn't, you would've laid in this hospital bed for three agonizing years while your body stitched itself back together. And then you would have to relearn how to walk, sit, breathe. And you would've suffered, in pain, for the rest of your natural life. I understand how you feel, I felt the same way after the accident. That I had been ruined, that I would never be the same.\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** The flesh is weak, Hedvig. Your new body - you'll be up on your feet in a week, maybe less. You may never be the same. You'll be better.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** //[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Get some rest. And, for what it's worth, I don't think you look like a monster at all. These implants are works of art - the spine support is spread like a pair of wings. You look like an angel.\n\n----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Nussbaum continued her recovery for two weeks in SCP-001, refusing medevac to Area-66 in Sinai upon seeing the extremely rapid recuperation offered by the implants. Evaluations by medical personnel provided insight into the enhancements offered by the Mekhanite augmentations. Internally, they integrated with her immune and nervous systems, offering fine, instinctual control and an increase in healing speed. Due to the relative lightness of the fuladh metalwork compared to steel, her body mass did not shift considerably. However, her strength, lift capacity, running speed, pull weight, and a suite of other measurements vastly increased in the weeks following her recovery. She similarly reported significant increases in her sensory ability, well beyond that given by her former Foundation-issue ocular and auditory implants. The spinal brace and its external portion, an artfully crafted pair of wings able to be extended and retracted by the user, allow a limited but notable ability to glide on strong updrafts.\n\n\n\nOn August 28th, Doctor Nussbaum declined an offer of a desk position in Area-66, choosing to continue her work as Project Co-Lead of the Amoni-Ram Initiative.\n\n\n\nDoctor Aram was reprimanded for his unauthorized use of potentially dangerous anomalous artifacts on a colleague and himself, but was not given disciplinary action considering the extenuating circumstances and Doctor Nussbaum's expressed gratitude to him, stating that if she had been conscious, she would have consented to the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\u25b6OPEN ADDENDUM\u25c0\" hide=\"\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - AUGUST 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**INTERVIEWERs:** Doctor Hedvig Nussbaum & Doctor Robert Aram\n\n\n\n**SUBJECT:** SCP-001-A1\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hello, Preserver.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU RETURN.

This one is made of a rougher metal compared to the delicate ceramic of the others.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Where did this come from?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** I HAVE LOOKED UNTO MYSELF. THE HUNDREDS OF CUBITS OF INSCRIBED STEEL AND TUBES THAT HOLD MY ENDURING SOUL. MY MIND IS SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE UNDERCITY, BANKS OF DATA IN EVERY CORNER OF AMONI-RAM AND THE EYES THAT CONNECT THEM. AND I HAVE SEEN, IN THE DEEPEST REACHES OF MYSELF, A SHRINE.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What kind of shrine?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** PIECES OF WAR ARMOR, METICULOUSLY WRAPPED AND PRESERVED. AND WITHIN THEM, THIS. THE CHAMBER HAS BEEN SEALED FOR CENTURIES. OVER THE MILLENIA, MY MIND HAS DETERIORATED - THE CIRCUITRY WAS NOT BUILT TO HOLD ME FOR SO LONG. I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHY IT IS THERE. YOU MUST TELL ME.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** That is... intriguing. Yes, we can experiment with it right away.\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM gingerly takes the cylinder from SCP-001-A1, clasping it in her metal fingers.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You mind taking that up to be catalogued? I'll catch up in just a minute, just need to go over some schematics.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Certainly.\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM exits the chamber.]//\n\n----\n\n//[At this point, official audio ceases. However, scientific equipment in the chamber left by the engineering team contained small microphones that recorded the following conversation. This audio was not recovered until several months later by chance during a routine database sweep.]//\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU ASK ABOUT THE THRONE.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What makes you say that?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU SEEK THE ABILITY TO COMMAND CHANGE. YOU RESENT THE LIMITATIONS OF YOUR STATION.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I've no idea what you're talking about.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** THE FULADH THRONE WAS FORGED FROM THE VERY FIRST SHEETS OF THE METAL SHORN FROM MEKHANE'S BODY. A THRONE IS MORE THAN A SYMBOL OF POWER. IT IS AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU HAVE ALREADY NOTICED IT, HAVEN'T YOU?\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOUR VOICE CARRIES WEIGHT. YOU COMMAND ATTENTION. JUST NOW, SHE DIDN'T EVEN PROTEST - SIMPLY FOLLOWED YOUR ORDER.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm the project head, of course they listen to me.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** LISTENING IS AN ACT. OBEDIENCE IS BEYOND THAT.\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU HAVE SEEN THE ENGRAVINGS. WHEN THE THRONE WAS FORGED AT THE DAWN OF THE ERA, BUMARO'S PEOPLE BOWED TO IT, AND SPREAD FORTH ACROSS ASIA LIKE GLEAMING SWORD. LAYING DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR LORD. THE THRONE CONTAINS THE POWER TO DOMINATE LESSER MINDS. THE KINGS WHO SAT ON IT USED THIS. AND NOW, WITH EVERY SEAT YOU TAKE ON IT, YOU INVOKE THE MEMORIES - THE NAME - THE //POWER// OF THE KINGS OF OLD.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Why are you telling me this?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** SURELY YOU SEE IT BY NOW. THE PARALLEL - TIME IS A FLAT CIRCLE, AND IT SWALLOWS ITS OWN TAIL LIKE A SAND SERPENT. YOU HAVE SEEN BUMARO'S MEMORIES - YOU HAVE SEEN HEDARA'S WINGS. LOOK AROUND YOU.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** This is ridiculous.\n\n\n\n//[ARAM turns to leave.]//\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU SEEK TO CHANGE THE WORLD. MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTING TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND HER.

This cylinder is slightly different, but the process will presumably be the same.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm ready.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Actually, I was thinking perhaps I could handle this one.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I have gotten familiar with the...\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM flexes her prosthetic limbs.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes. -A1 told us that the necessities to use it were augments and the Fist. These implants are original Mekhanite technology dating back to the Empire. It is possible they may let us see more.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I... I guess. But they're an unexpected variable. They could interact differently too.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** We cannot know until we try. And we have not exactly shied away from trying... experimental procedures.\n\n\n\n//[The wing arrangement on her back briefly unfolds and extends to its full width before collapsing back in.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yeah. Fair point. I don't know, I just - I don't know.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Are you alright, Robert? You're acting strange.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm fine. It's fine. You can do it. Just, you know, be safe.\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM takes her seat in the Throne, pulling the Fist onto her left arm and inserting it into the depression. Behind her, ARAM places the cylinder into its socket and turns it. NUSSBAUM's head jerks back and her eyes glow golden, but her reaction is significantly more tempered than ARAM's first exposure.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** OH! Oh. Oh goodness.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You're taking it better than me. I imagine the implants have to do with that. What do you see?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I am- Oh God, it is loud. I'm standing - there, I am standing on the walls of the city, the - yes, the Eastern Gate. It is morning, the sun is beating down on the desert - there are hundreds of us, soldiers, lining the walls and - yes, gun turrets. It is tense, I can feel myself barking out orders, and the soldiers are obeying. Setting up siege engines, loading ammunition, evening out the wall. Preparing for war. We are all in armor - mine is more elaborate than the others.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yeah, the Emperor's armor was-\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** No. I am not the Emperor. Not a Bumaro.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:**\u00a0\u00a0Who, then?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I... I do not know. I can see myself in the metal of a gun turret next to me. I'm a woman, olive-skinned and small. The armor is elaborate, it shows... dragons? Fighting each other.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I've seen her before, she was one of the Legion's generals.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Hold on- oh, //mein gott//.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What is it?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** The colossus. It is.... gargantuan. It just took a step and shook the entire city. It is heading away - towards the horizon. Wait, I see something in the distance. Something kicking up sand. An... army. No, a //horde//. I cannot see individuals. Just a mass of bodies and armor and banners and mounts in a dust storm. They go as far as the eye can see. There must be tens of thousands of them. They are too far to engage. But they are coming. And there is nothing we can do to stop their advance.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** That must be the N\u00e4lka and the Covenant, then. Do you see any sign of what the Abom-\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** It changed. It- the city is on fire. Amoni-Ram is burning. Oh //God// it is loud. I cannot hear myself think. The sky is red, choked with smog. All I can hear is the clashing of steel and screaming. We are in the Southern district - crouching behind a barricade. I am- I leaned up and over and started firing my weapon. I can't see - I hear screaming. The buildings are collapsing, we are under mortar fire - we need to fall back!\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Stay with me. What does the enemy look like?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Beasts. Monstrosities. Great masses of flesh and limbs in a sickly pale purple, dragging themselves through the dirt streets. Spirits in the air, purple fire covering the walls. There are too many, they're advancing. I can hear the beating of their drums and their war-chants. I can hear cannonfire beyond the walls, I can just barely see the colossi in the horizon through the smoke - the streets are wet with blood and slime. We are standing over the ruins of a house now. A mortar hit it. There is.... something in the center. An object.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What is it?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Someone- one of the men touched it, it broke open, he just - his face burst into leaves, screaming and contorting.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** There are vines, spreading outward from him. Creeping from his writhing corpse toward us. It is the petrified plant we discovered in the undercity. A biological weapon.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** We are falling into the undercity, retreating. The Legion holding the entrances and chokepoints against the swarms - the citizens trying to evacuate or dying. Oh God, there's so much death. I just split a man open chin to groin. Beheading one of the flesh-beasts. Blood pooling in the golden channels of my shortsword, splashing across my armor-\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Focus, Hedvig. Try to call up the image of the Emperor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Y-yes. I am... in the palace. The city itself is shaking. The Legion is holding the palace against the horde. Bumaro is on the throne, with his wife. \"My Lord, we must leave. They have taken three of the gates. We will not have a chance for much longer.\"\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** He's not going to leave.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** No. He stands up - he is in his war armor, all gleaming gold and silver plate, big enough to block out the sky. He leans down. \"You must go, sha-hashna.\"\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What did he say?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** \"Sha-hashna\". I do not recognize the word. It seems similar to the words for protect or guard...\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** We can figure it out later.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Yes. \"You must go and activate the Kiss.\" We are arguing - I say the Kiss is dangerous. That it cannot be ready. That it has no control mechanism whatsoever, that activating it manually could be disastrous. \"We have no other choice. Go. Your king commands it.\" I bow. He is- he is preparing to go out and lead the defense. \"I will go and seat myself in the courtyard. This keep will not be breached, not while I draw breath.\"\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Wait...\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** He is sitting in the same spot as the statue we found. Waiting, sword and spear in hand.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Oh, holy shit. It's not a statue.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I- I have left the palace. I am running across the city, to the nearest undercity entrance. The mass of the horde is still beyond\u00a0\u00a0the walls, but so many have breached the city. My blade sings, but I never stop. Slitting one's throat as I run past him. Gutting another beast. Crushing the skull of a Covenant summoner. There are so many. I must keep moving. I - okay. I have jumped into the undercity, sealing the entrance behind me. It is... different. Brightly lit, well-signed. Blood plastering the walls. Corpses lining the passageways. Oh God.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Where are you going?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** To the center. Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth. I encounter resistance. The Covenant and N\u00e4lka's 'gifts' have made it down here. The plant-virus and the mutated flesh-pod-tentacles we have seen. But not petrified and dead. Alive. Throbbing. //Wet.// Many soldiers, moving through the undercity. They do not know the passages like we do. They are confused. They do not last long. There are many families hiding in rooms and warehouses and dormitories and barracks. I cannot help them now. All I can do is keep moving.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Do you recognize any of the routes?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** It's... yes. I just rounded a familiar corner. I... yes, I know where we are going.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Where?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Preserver's chamber. SCP-001-A1. Under the palace itself. It takes some detours, but I arrive where it- what?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What happened?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** It is not here. Preserver is not here. Just the masses of machinery, but no arm or mind or voice. Just soulless vacuum tubes and circuit inscriptions. It hums with an unfamiliar energy. There are automata everywhere. Maintaining the machine. Making sure it works. I look at it - I seal the chamber door behind me. It is just me. I hear a boom from above, and begin stripping off my armor.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Wait, what?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I need to interface with- oh, God. I understand now.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** \"Sha-hashna\". It's close to guard and protect, but in a noun form. It means one who guards. A preserver.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** ... Oh, fuck. That's why Preserver isn't there. Oh, fuck!\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I have disrobed. The armor lies in a heap. I reach out and touch-\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM's eyes glow golden and she writhes in the Throne, her back arching wildly. She lets out a long gasp before going limp, sinking back into the Throne.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hedvig? Hedvig, can you hear me?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Yes. Yes. I can hear you. Oh, //mein gott.// That was horrible.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What the fuck just happened?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I touched the machine and just- agony. So much pain. I felt like someone was cutting me limb from limb. Burning my tongue off and branding my eyes. God.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Are you okay? What do you see now?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I- yes, I am fine. I see... I do not know what I am seeing. Rubble, debris. It is quiet. I- wait, I can move. No- yes, I can move, but I am... small.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** How small?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I- I am inhabiting one of the automata.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Just like how Preserver can control them. That settles that.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I exit out into the city. I can see- oh, God. Oh no.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What happened? What did the Kiss do?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Everyone is dead.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** The horde?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Everyone. There are corpses choking the streets. Not a free patch of dirt to be found. Dead bodies covering every possible surface, both my Legionnaires and the horde and the citizens. No explosive finishes. The quiet death of an entire civilization. Oh god. What have I done?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** It's not you, Hedvig. I know how convincing it gets. Remember, it's not your memory.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** They're all dead, Robert. I destroyed the empire trying to save it. Everyone I ever knew or loved. Everyone.\n\n\n\n//[ARAM motions to the engineering team to cut power to the Throne. They comply, but nothing occurs. ARAM moves to the side of the throne after a few seconds and physically pulls NUSSBAUM's hand, grasping the Fist, from its depression in the armrest. Her body relaxes.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hedvig? You hear me?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Robert. Yes. Thank you.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Thought we lost you for a second there.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** It was... overwhelming.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yeah. But we learned a hell of a lot.\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** Yes. Yes, of course. God. No wonder Preserver cannot remember.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** She obliterated her own civilization while trying to save it. I had a taste of it for just a few seconds and it was too much to take. She has lived with that guilt for nearly three thousand years. Who wouldn't want to forget?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You're saying she did it on purpose?\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I am no engineer, but if I were a betting woman...\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM holds the cylinder to the light.]//\n\n\n\n\u00a0**NUSSBAUM:** I would guess these cylinders are a memory-storage form of some sort. She placed her memories into this to get rid of them, but obviously when she rid herself of her memories - she forgot what it even was.\n\n-----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nUpon the discoveries made in the Throne Report, further testing was temporarily halted until a decision could be made on whether to inform SCP-001-A1 of its past. Until then, routine research into repair of infrastructural elements of the city continued as per regular schedule.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - SEPTEMBER 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR ROBERT ARAM**\n\n[[size 80%]]AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE[[/size]]\n\n----\n\n[[size 110%]]//Personal log//[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\n\n\nPreserver has been integral to the success of the Amoni-Ram Initiative. Far more so than any of the O5s arbitrating on whether //she// deserves to know her own identity. We wouldn't even have the throne if she hadn't led us to it and provided the Fist, the cylinders, everything. We owe her.\n\n\n\nAnd even if we didn't, it's the right thing to do. \"Mad scientist\" is possibly one of the dumbest stereotypes of all time - scientists have ethics. Even in Prometheus, where progress was done for the sake of progress, we had ethics. Expectations of behaviour and morality. Making sure everyone knew exactly what they were signing up for. Not withholding crucial discoveries fundamental to their sense of being. The Foundation is not scientists, it is bureaucrats - and bureaucrats are the ones who will do away with ethics for efficiency.\n\n\n\nI shouldn't get this mad. But it just begs so many questions. It's representative of how they think of this project - not a font of tools to improve the world, but of information that needs to be suppressed and released when the world is ready. Visionaries do not wait for the world to be ready to present their idea, because the world is //never// ready. We force the world to change. In the 60s, augments were a rarity in the Foundation. Agents who got them were freaks. They were a last resort to maintain functionality. Then they realized we were better, faster, smarter, stronger. And look at us now. A project and two Sites staffed entirely by augmented personnel.\n\n\n\nBut they obviously don't trust Preserver, because she's a machine. Even though she's not, really. She was human once, but they can only think of her as a machine - to use, to exploit. The same way they think of me and Hedvig and Tenz and Zaid and all the others. They don't trust us either, not really. We've done more for them and gotten fuck all in return except the //permission// to rebuild what has been our home for nearly a year. It's frustrating.\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about what SCP-001-A1 said. About the Throne. It's not true - there's no paratechnology that can force a psychic connection, that would require a staggering amount of power and all sorts of bullshit. But it makes me wonder. I've been probing Nussbaum, seeing if she responds like Preserver said she would. I don't know whether I'm delusional or looking for what I want to see but I feel like there's something there. She just agrees to whatever. If it is true - and I'm not saying it is - it would logically extend to the others, too. Did they all agree to swapping out their augments with the Mekhanite ones because it was what they wanted? Or was it because it was what I wanted them to do?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nOn September 30th, the O5 Council approved a plan allowing the involvement of SCP-001-A1 in the Siege of Amoni-Ram to be declassified to it, but withholding the details of its activation of Mekhane's Kiss and destruction of the city.

ARE YOU BEHOLDEN TO THEM?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes, in a way.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Well, in any case, we can talk now. We performed the Throne test with the cylinder you provided. It was... illuminating.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** HAVE YOU LEARNT OF MY ORIGIN? MY HISTORY?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** We have, yes. The cylinder allowed me to tap into your memories. At least, we think they are your memories.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU UTILIZED THE THRONE?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Ah, yes. Is that... a problem?\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** NO.

Likely favored by Bumaro due to their close personal relationship. Advising the younger king militarily during the First War, with campaigns into the East in all directions.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** I...

WHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNT? HOW DID THEY DEFEAT US?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** The Legion was marching on Black Adytum at the time, hoping to end the war decisively - the colossi and the home army were the only ones left to defend Amoni-Ram. They used biological weapons, viruses, to attack the city and kill the Legionnaires and civilians. The city was lost as soon as the first colossus fell.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** DID I SERVE MY EMPIRE?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yes. You served your king and your people. You were instrumental in the defense of the city - both before and after the walls fell. You also tried to evacuate Bumaro and Hedara, but he sent you away. As Amoni-Ram burned, you had a different mission.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Robert...\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You were told to hold the North Gate at all costs. Give the civilians a chance to escape the destruction. And you did. As the horde swept over the walls and slaughtered everything in their path, you held the gate against a thousand and a thousand more sorcerers and spirits and flesh-beasts. The only reason people escaped the massacre.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** THEY FLED? MEKHANITES WALK THE EARTH TODAY?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** It's possible.

As Project Co-Lead, I retain executive control over almost all personnel decisions, but my concern today lies with my co-lead, Doctor Robert Silas Aram.\n\n\n\nDr. Aram is a once-in-a-lifetime mind, but recent events regarding the project have left me questioning his suitability for a leadership position in stressful, isolated research environs. I worry he has let his emotions compromise the integrity of the project. In various cases he:\n\n* made an unconsensual medical decision on my behalf.

Sound of an object slamming closed.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hello, Hedvig.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Oh! Hello, Robert. Still awake?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yeah. Needed to get some last-minute reports done. Took the long route back from the digsite. The city's beautiful at night, you know.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes, it is.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** It's crazy to think that a year ago this place was all rubble and debris. Now it almost looks like a proper city.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Are you alright, Robert? You look... pale.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm fine. Just spent a little bit of time tinkering with the Throne.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Relax, nothing serious. Just some investigation, based on some things Preserver told me.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What did you find?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm not sure yet. There's some latent psychokinetic energy emanating from it, but we've been aware of that for a while. Just not sure what it means.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What kind of energy?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Not sure. But it's gotten stronger recently. With every use of the Throne, it seems like.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** That is... concerning.\n\n\n\n//[ARAM walks to the window, looking out over Amoni-Ram.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** It really is beautiful at night. We've built something grand out here, away from the rest of the world's eyes.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** ... I guess we will come back to that later, then. But yes. It is quite nice. It feels like a home.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I don't know how I'm going to go back to bunking on Site dormitories after this, hah.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I am unsure I want to. Foundation politics tire me, and they are omnipresent in the larger Sites. Amoni-Ram is nicer. Everyone here is here because they want to do the work.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Agreed. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Yes?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I think we may need to shift gears a bit, in terms of what we're focusing on, you know?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I... don't follow.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** At this point we're pretty much confident in the timeline of what happened to Amoni-Ram. But the other nations, and the Abominate, we know nothing about them except the battle. So I think it could be beneficial if we focus more on the weapons, the technology used during the Siege. Put the mundane archaeology aside for a little while.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** The \"mundane\" archaeology has already led us to breakthroughs on the technology. We need to know how they lived and thought to see how they fought and died.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm not disputing that. I just think it's not the biggest priority right now, so we could divert resources-\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** My work is just as important as yours, Robert.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** ... Right, yeah.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I didn't say anything!\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Ugh. It is written on your face. You only see the history, the culture as a means to an end. You cannot understand why someone would want to study it for its own sake.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** No, that's not-\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** The same with Eleven. He does not give an ounce of respect to my team and their work. Neither of you do.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I respect your work. I respect you.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Oh, is that so, Robert? Is that why you feel you can come in and tell me what my team should focus on?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hedvig, please.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Is that why you think you can make decisions about my body for me?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** //What?!// You would've died! I saved your life, you said so!\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I was in shock! //Verdammt.// I would have agreed to whatever was put in front of me, I was barely conscious!\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** That doesn't change the fact that you would've died on that operating table if I hadn't stepped in.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** And who gave you the right to make my decisions of life or death, hm? Is that also because you respect me so much?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** //[Sigh]// This is obviously about something bigger. I'm sorry I brought it up.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** No, we will have this discussion now. You changed my life forever and seem to be under the delusion you did me a favor. I will not dispute I am thankful you saved me from death. But I do not owe you anything.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** //Everyone// here owes me. I'm their leader.\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** We are co-leads. Do not forget that.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Bullshit. If it wasn't for me, this project would've been shuttered months ago. I took the risks and they paid off and everyone else looks up to me for it. Why can't you?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** Is that it, Robert? We are //friends//. I do not look up to my friends. They are my equals.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **KINGS DON'T HAVE EQUALS.**\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I- I-\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME. YOUR WORK HAS BEEN SECONDARY. YOU ARE SECONDARY. THE PURPOSE OF THE INITIATIVE WAS TO FIND THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE MEKHANITES. THEIR HISTORY WAS ANCILLARY.**\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **WE HAVE A LIVING ARCHIVE OF THEIR HISTORY WITH US NOW. THE DIRECTIVE OF THE PROJECT HAS CHANGED.**\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** //[Drowsy, semi-conscious]// What are you... how...?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **DO NOT RESIST ME. YOU KNOW THE MISSION HAS CHANGED, DON'T YOU? YOU FELT ITS PRESENCE, WHEN YOU SAT ON THE THRONE?**\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** What...?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **THE EYES. I FELT IT SINCE THE FIRST DAY WE ENTERED THIS CITY. WE HAVE DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF SOMETHING LARGER THAN US, AND ITS EYES HAVE SETTLED ONTO US FOR THE PAST YEAR. BUT NOW WE HAVE ITS NAME. THE ABOMINATE. IT IS NOT DEAD YET.**\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** //[On the verge of tears]// You're... scaring me, Robert.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'd be more scared of other things right now. Like that unsent email on your laptop.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Don't ask me how I know. It is not your place. But delete it.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **I SAID DELETE IT.**\n\n\n\n//[Sounds of laptop opening, clicking.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I... okay. Done.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Good girl. You played the role quite well. But you felt it watching us too, didn't you?\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** ... I felt... something.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** There are bigger things at stake now. And you **will** obey me.\n\n-----\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\n\nATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - OCTOBER 1984\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**INTERVIEWERs:**\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Robert Aram\n\n\n\n**SUBJECT:** SCP-001-A1\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n----\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Evening, Preserver.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** ARAM.

The city's livable now.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** I SAW. I REFER TO YOU.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU HAVE USED THE VOICE. EXTENDED FROM A QUIET WHISPER IN YOUR MIND TO THE BOOMING COMMAND. DEMANDING OBEDIENCE.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Even if I had, I haven't made anyone do anything they wouldn't have done anyway. I haven't.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** I MAKE NO JUDGEMENT. YOU TOOK THE THRONE AT MY ENCOURAGEMENT; THIS WAS NOT AN UNINTENDED RESULT. WHAT HAVE YOU USED IT FOR?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Just... exploring the breadth of it. The limits. How it works.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YES. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO DISCUSS.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What makes you say that?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** THE MOON HANGS IN THE SKY. ALL YOUR MEN SLEEP. SHE IS NOT WITH YOU.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hm. Well, you're right. I didn't come here to ask you questions about the voice.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** THEN SPEAK.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Hedara - did she love Bumaro?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** OF COURSE. DEEPLY. SHE WAS HIS MOST FAVORED WIFE. MOTHER OF HIS HEIR. LIGHT OF HIS LIFE. SYMBOL OF HIS DYNASTY - PURE, SHINING, RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON WITH THE SUN. SHE ATTENDED TO HIM UNTIL HE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK OR BREATHE OR EAT, AND WHEN HE FADED, SHE CALLED UPON HIS WISDOM WHILE HER SON GREW INTO THE THRONE.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I see.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU HAVE MADE HER YOUR QUEEN?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I suppose so. I wouldn't use the word queen, though.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** WHY? SURELY YOU SAW THE PARALLELS. THE PROPHECY. TIME IS A FLAT CIRCLE. LOOK AT YOUR RIGHT HAND AND TELL ME IT IS NOT SO.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm not a king.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** AND NEITHER WAS BUMARO, UNTIL HE WAS GIVEN A CITY OF PEOPLE THAT NEEDED GUIDANCE. THREE THOUSAND YEARS, AND ONE THING NEVER CHANGES: HUMANS CRAVE LEADERSHIP. YOU HAVE HEDVIG AND YOUR SCHOLARS. BUMARO HAD HEDARA AND THE LEGION. AMONI-RAM ITSELF.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** They were all simple farmers before. Shepherds. Peasants.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** AND MEKHANE'S ARRIVAL, HER FALL FROM THE HEAVENS, TURNED THEM INTO A KING AND A QUEEN. THEIR HOME INTO A BASTION. THEIR KIN INTO THE PINNACLE OF HUMANITY.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** So Amoni-Ram - it was a place those people could go? Different people?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YES. THEY WERE NOT DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE AUGMENTATIONS. THEY CHOSE TO BE DIFFERENT. MUNDANITY IS NOT A VIRTUE. THEY CHOSE TO ELEVATE THEMSELVES, BECAUSE THEY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS WERE.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Dissatisfied with being human.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** DISSATISFACTION IS THE MOTHER OF AMBITION.

IN THIS WAY, WE DO NOT CHANGE THE WORLD AROUND US - WE IMPROVE IT.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I lied to you.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** I KNOW.\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What?\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YOU LIED IN FRONT OF ME.

I DID NOT HOLD THE GATE - I DID NOT SAVE OUR CITY.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You did not, no. He told you to go into the undercity. To activate the Mekhane's Kiss. The teleportation device.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** IMPOSSIBLE. IT WAS STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND. UNFINISHED. IT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE CITY. KILLED THOUSANDS.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Look around you. The city //was// destroyed. Thousands did die.\n\n\n\n**SCP-001-A1:** YES. BUT I COULD NOT HAVE ACTIVATED IT ANYWAY. THERE WAS NO CONTROL INTERFACE. NO WAY TO DIRECT THE ENERGY.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** He gave you something. He called it a blessing - it was a vial, of some sort. Told you to smash it and drink it. You took off your armor, you did, and touched the thing, and - I guess you fused with the machine or something. You became the control mechanism, and you fired. Teleported the city from the Sinai to the Arabian desert.

I like what you've done with the place.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Thank you. It hasn't been easy, but we've finally turned it into someplace halfway livable.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Right, yes. But I'm worried, Robert.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Worried?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** About the pace of reporting. Your publishings on the paratechnology in the city have declined by almost half in the past month or two. Doctor Nussbaum's reports on the archaeology and history have met the same fate. Speaking of which, where is Doctor Nussbaum?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** //[Pause.]// Let's walk. I've been in this office so much it's getting hard to think.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Sure.\n\n\n\n//[ARAM and O5-11 exit the office, accompanied by a detachment of MTF Alpha-1 bodyguards. They begin walking through the corridors of the palace and temple.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Nussbaum's just working on some stuff in the southern district, I'm sure she'll join us soon. But you were saying?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** I'm starting to think this project has run its natural course, Robert.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What do you mean? There's still so much more to decipher. We barely know anything about the history, culture, peoples-\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Since when have you ever been interested in that sort of thing? It's the technology, Robert. It was always about unlocking the secrets of the city - and you did that job phenomenally! We've learned so much - every technological report has been pored over by experts at 19 to see how we could put it into practice.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yeah, but that's just the Foundation.\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Robert, not this again. We don't go around replicating 500 to cure cancer just because we can. We have a responsibility to maintain normalcy. We can't become the arbiters of what secrets the world can and can't know - we can only hide all of them equally.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Well, what if it has run its course? What do you plan to do?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** We've already got people in India and China sites looking around for the locations of the other two cities. We've learned all that we can from Amoni-Ram, so it's time to move on to new pastures.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** What'll happen to us?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Reassigned with glowing recommendations to any projects of their choosing.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Well, what if they want to stay here? A lot of them have become attached to the place. We've turned it from a ruin to a home.

They look up to me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Well. In any case, it's unfortunate, but they don't exactly have much say in the matter. It's how it is.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You're being too hasty, Overseer.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Maybe, but the rest of the Council agrees with me. We'll leave a skeleton crew to continue low-priority work, but we need you and Nussbaum's talents elsewhere.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** No.\n\n\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** What?\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm not going. Amoni-Ram was lost once because of people who didn't understand what it had to offer. I'm not going to let that happen again.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** I don't think you understand.

Coming in for a landing.\n\n\n\n//[Convoy lands, three kilometers from the entrance to SCP-001.]//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** We have touchdown, repeat, touchdown. Unloading packages.\n\n\n\n//[Personnel disembark and begin unloading cargo. After final unloading, there are 83 personnel across three MTFs, equipped with small and heavy arms and in armored personnel carriers.]//\n\n\n\n> //**Z9:** Jesus, we brought in an army.//\n\n>\n\n> //**E6:** Yeah, call us the fucking cavalry.//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** Beginning approach to SCP-001. No movement sighted.\n\n\n\n//[The convoy begins slowly advancing towards SCP-001. 41 minutes later, they arrive. The minimal base camp set up outside the entrance is abandoned - a set of tents half-buried in the dunes. A golden curved sword is impaled into the sand.]//\n\n\n\n> //**N34:** That's a message if I ever seen one. \"Abandon all hope\", yadda yadda.//\n\n>\n\n> //**N45:** This guy's not very subtle, is he?//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** Be advised, preparing to-\n\n\n\n//[Radio screeches, flipping through several frequencies.

Clear, over. Still clear for incursion?\n\n\n\n**OVCOM:** You are a go, over.\n\n\n\n//[Convoy turns and advances forward, into the entrance of SCP-001. Several seconds pass until the entrance opens. The forces pass through the threshold, into SCP-001.]//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** Eyes on Amoni-Ram.\n\n\n\n> //**N10:** Holy shit.//\n\n>\n\n> //**N50:** That is god-damn beautiful.//\n\n\n\n//[Amoni-Ram lies ahead of the convoy. Its walls have been considerably repaired, and the Eastern gate that faces the entrance of SCP-001 has been blockaded and reinforced, though it is largely obscured by a sand dune. Figures stand along the massive walls and battlements. Several fly overhead, dipping and swerving through the air.]//\n\n\n\n**OVCOM:** Be advised-\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** Yeah, targets spotted.

The figures on the battlements come into focus. They are a number of individuals dressed in the war armor seen in the reported visions, armed with a mixture of swords, polearms, and long-range rifle-like weapons, all of which are levelled at the advancing force.]//\n\n\n\n> //**N23:** They have high ground and unknown armament.//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** Unfavorable conditions for a firefight, command.\n\n\n\n**OVCOM:** Acknowledged.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** [Through static] As soon as Eleven [static] another cylinder.

You will need [static]. Me.\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** We will place you and Hedvig Nussbaum into custody. Then you can plead your case to the Council as you'd like.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** They're [static] to listen.

If you don't want to have this fight, tell everyone to put down their guns.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** I'm afraid I can't do that.\n\n\n\n//[Two dozen figures crest the sand dune from the other side. They are three to four meters tall, in hulking golden exosuits of plated armor with pneumatic limbs. Helmets obscure their faces. The central two figures are the largest - one is four meters tall in intricately designed and patterned silver and gold armor. ARAM pilots the suit. The other appears to be made of stone, a walking statue of a shirtless bearded man, holding a sword and spear.]//\n\n\n\n> //**N4:** Oh, fuck. Mechs.//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** You might be unwilling to listen to reason. But you will not stop me from changing the world. Saving it.\n\n\n\n//[From above, a figure descends, hovering in the air above ARAM and extending her wings outward.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** When this is over, you will beg for my help.\n\n\n\n//[Distantly, a cannon fires. The sand explodes a few meters from the Alpha-6 line. More cannons fire. Alpha-6 forces duck behind cover and begin returning fire as the war suits charge down the hill. Gunfire continues for several minutes. The engagement is too far from the walls for the troops on the battlement to fire, but the warsuits use a mix of brute strength and oversized ranged weaponry to break the Alpha-6 line. Automatic cannons from the APCs begin firing, and have considerable effect, bringing a number of the warsuits crashing to the ground. The reactor cores from fallen units eject, causing miniature explosions. Shouting and yelling from both sides is audible.]//\n\n\n\n> //**N17:** Fucking hell!//\n\n>\n\n> //**E9:** Spread out! Don't give them easy targets!//\n\n>\n\n> //**Z3:** Hit!//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **DO NOT FAIL YOUR KING.**\n\n\n\n//[Gradually, the superior maneuverability of the Alpha-6 forces begins to turn the tide. While smaller and individually less powerful, the evasive tactics, spread-out formation, and multiple angles of attack wear down the warsuits. Several soldiers lay wounded or dead, but a similar number of Mekhanite warsuits are wrecked or disabled.]//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** Keep firing, evasive formations, keep them off the trucks.\n\n\n\n> //**N28:** I see movement overhead, use the flak!//\n\n\n\n//[Overhead, a number of flying Mekhanites divebomb, causing a squad to scatter. One grabs a soldier by the torso and pulls him into the air, screaming. Moments later, an anti-aircraft emplacement begins firing, sending a number of the flying units crashing to the ground. Nussbaum is considerably faster and more evasive than the others, and gracefully dodges flak while returning fire.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **PULL BACK.**\u00a0\u00a0Hedvig - go ensure Preserver is ready!\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM rockets away from the firefight at extremely high speeds, shooting towards Amoni-Ram itself. ARAM lifts a portion of a destroyed warsuit and heaves it at an anti-aircraft emplacement, crushing it and its operator. The remaining warsuits, roughly a dozen, begin to pull back over the dune as Alpha-6 forces advance, firing on the retreating Mekhanites.]//\n\n\n\n> //**Z7:** Fuck you, assholes!//\n\n>\n\n> //**Z3:** Conserve your ammo.//\n\n>\n\n> //**N57:** Do you guys feel that?//\n\n\n\n//[The ground shakes.]//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** OVCOM, we're getting tremors, standby-\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** **HEAR ME, COLOSSUS. HEAR YOUR KING AND DEFEND YOUR CITY.**\n\n\n\n//[The ground shakes. A massive hand reaches out of the dunes, spilling vast tons of sand to the ground. Another similarly gigantic hand reaches out in the other direction, fingers wrapping around the massive wall of Amoni-Ram. A colossus - humanoid metal golem, easily a hundred meters tall and armored in all locations, peppered with autoturrets - drags itself out of the dunes, turning its gigantic head towards Alpha-6 forces.]//\n\n\n\n> //**N34:** Fuck, fuck fuck! PULL BACK!//\n\n>\n\n> //**Z5:** WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?//\n\n>\n\n> //**E3:** Command, we do not have the armament to take that thing on!//\n\n\n\n**ALPHA-6:** OVCOM, please advise.\n\n\n\n**OVCOM:** Begin a tactical retreat. Heavy armament and air support has been scrambled and is waiting for you outside the entrance to-\n\n\n\n//[The colossus takes a single step after fully dragging itself from the sand dunes. Several Alpha-6 operators and Mekhanites are crushed under its titanic foot. The ground shakes and several buildings in Amoni-Ram visibly shudder at the footfall of the colossus, which is larger than many of them. ARAM does not move, raising his sword to the sky.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Yes. This is how it should be. **HEDVIG?**\n\n\n\n//[NUSSBAUM appears in the air, descending and perching on ARAM's massive shoulder.]//\n\n\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** We are ready. At your command.\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** Excellent. Finally.\n\n\n\n//[The colossus takes another step towards the rapidly retreating force of Foundation personnel, who fire rockets at it and machine gun rounds. They detonate on impact and scorch the armor, but otherwise have no effect.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** [Over radio, addressing OVCOM] You didn't accept my help. You used and threw away this city. I saw something beautiful in it, and we fixed it and brought it back to life. **All of it.**\n\n\n\n**OVCOM:** Robert, please-\n\n\n\n//[A number of operators reach the exit and throw themselves through, landing on the other side. The majority of the forces remain inside SCP-001, moving towards the entrance and pursued by the colossus.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** No. I'll protect the world from the Abominate on my own terms. The Foundation is a relic. If the human race is to survive what is to come, they will need to adapt. To change. To improve.\n\n\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n\n\n**ARAM:** My name is Robert Bumaro, and the world will change for the Church of the Broken God. Because it has no choice.\n\n\n\n----\n\n= **<<ALL COMMUNICATIONS CEASE>>**\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nFollowing this, a massive power surge fried the electronics of awaiting aircraft three kilometers away. All communication in and out of SCP-001 ceased, and subsequent investigation has indicated the entrance to SCP-001 no longer exists in the South Arabian desert. It is theorized that the Mekhanite forces repaired and safely activated Mekhane's Kiss, teleporting Amoni-Ram to an unknown location.\n\n\n\nThe failure of the Amoni-Ram Initiative, the betrayal of Doctors Aram and Nussbaum, and the loss of SCP-001 with its countless amounts of Foundation knowledge, equipment, personnel, and paratechnology, have elevated Global Threat Level to Keneq-4 (considerable potential to disrupt the general population). Foundation policy regarding digital and paratechnological implants and equipment has been frozen pending further review by Overwatch Command.\n\n\n\n'The Church of the Broken God' has been designated GoI-004. All efforts are to be made to locate Robert Aram/Bumaro and Hedvig Nussbaum and bring them into Foundation custody.\n\n\n\nLaboratory samples of Daevite, N\u00e4lkan, and Mekhanite biological weapons used in the Siege of Amoni-Ram have produced viable specimens. They have been provided provisional SCP designations: [[[SCP-697]]], [[[SCP-610]]], and [[[SCP-217]]], respectively.\n\n\n\nProject FORERUNNER TRIAD has been organized to address the consequences of the Amoni-Ram Initiative, and report directly to Overwatch Command. Ascertaining the locations of the N\u00e4lka city of Black Adytum, the Daevic Covenant cities of Mamjul and Korar, and the identity & nature of the entity known as 'the Abominate' have all been elevated to Global Priority Level Alpha.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-navbar\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/lord-blackwood-in-amon-iram\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]PREVIOUS[[/span]]\n\n<< GOLD PRELUDE >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/redtape\"]]REDTAPE[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/interregnum-blackstar\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]NEXT[[/span]]\n\n<< INTERREGNUM I >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"display: none\"]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> | author=Rounderhouse]]\n\n> **Filename:** alhambra.png\n\n> **Name:** Granada.
