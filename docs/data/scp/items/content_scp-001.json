Being an only son, he was always meant to inherit the family fortune and their industrial empire consisting of numerous <a href=\"/scp-6789\">industrial plants</a> once the current holders \u2014 his father and mother \u2014 inevitably died. Highly interested in the history of Fae (<em>Homo sapiens sidhe</em>) and <a href=\"/scp-1000\">Children of the Night</a> (<em>Homo sapiens noctis</em>) ever since his childhood, Rollander had always shown an above-average intelligence, near-perfect memory, and skill in obtaining historical information otherwise thought to be undiscoverable.</p>\n<p>However, when a majority of his family died under unexplained circumstances in 1888 during a fatal shipboard incident (for which he was not present, but had personally financed), PoI-001-A donated all of his stocks and buildings to an unknown thaumaturgic cabal operating in the USA.</p>\n<p>The next day James Rollander was seen leaving America with a ship headed for Great Britain, later traveling to (at that time occupied) Poland. Witnesses of the event reported the man acting highly paranoid and erratic, as if he were afraid someone was observing him, and holding an unidentified tome within his hands. Having disappeared for approximately 10 years following the conclusion of his travels, he reappeared in 1898 near Krak\u00f3w, Poland, with the construction of SCP-001-A starting shortly after.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>SCP-001-A is an industrial megastructure located 25 kilometers south of Krak\u00f3w, Poland, founded and overseen by James Rollander. Acting as the main provider of a plethora of services to the entire country and most of the continent, it currently houses approximately 30\u00a0000 laborers working and living within its confines. Atop its gates the following sentence, written in the Fae language, can be seen:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>The Factory hungers, as the Queen\u2019s move has become her last gambit. Do not leave it in famine.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>SCP-001-B is a room located within SCP-001-A, which can only be found once an individual expresses the wish to find it, be it willingly or subconsciously. So far, attempts to mark it in relation to any other rooms or landmarks within the structure have been unsuccessful; inevitably, all individuals coming into contact with it will describe drastically different details of the place and the path which led them to it.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-C is an entity located within SCP-001-B, fed by human sacrifices delivered to it by PoI-001-A. Further details regarding its nature are presently unavailable.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-001-A was constructed by a currently unidentified group of individuals or force between 1898-1902; no formal records regarding the process of construction exist. Created as the \"ultimate factory,\" it was meant to supply every single possible industrial need of the people.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-A gained Foundation attention in 1908 after exceedingly high levels of thaumaturgic energy were intercepted from it. This energy did not fade over time, instead remaining at a consistently high level. Now theorized to be the date of origin for SCP-001-B, this event sparked a visible period of the highest productivity to date, ultimately resulting in unprecedented profits and the expansion of Rollander's nascent empire.</p>\n<p>To eliminate the possibility that the event was merely a coincidence precipitated by the building's potentially anomalous location, further research was approved. This resulted in the discovery of the ruins of numerous palaces and city structures in the caverns below the factory. Dated at approximately 200\u00a0000 years old, they were immediately identified as structures formed by the Fae Empire prior to its fall.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Despite their anomalous properties, it was later discovered that they had been uninvolved with the event, which had instead been the result of some form of ritual conducted within SCP-001-A.</p>\n<p>Following these discoveries, the Foundation officially classified SCP-001-A as its first full high-priority project following the adoption of the 'SCP' classification, resulting in it acquiring the designation of SCP-001.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-1:</strong> SCP-001-A Exploration</p>\n<p>In light of the thaumaturgic energy's failure to fade, the O5 Council decided that more information regarding SCP-001-A was required. As no SCP-001-A personnel were noted leaving the factory within the previous month, a Foundation-organized exploration mission was orchestrated.</p>\n<p>However, upon entry into the factory, the Task Force immediately lost contact with the Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-2:</strong> SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis</p>\n<p>Following the loss of contact with previous exploration missions, it was decided that further exploration attempts would inevitably end the same way. In order to still obtain further potential information regarding SCP-001, research into the nature and origin of the ruins underneath the factory was immediately approved. The following is a statement by the project's research head following numerous months of focused investigation, released on 14/12/1909. Prior to reading it, personnel are heavily advised to familiarize themselves with the documentation available in the sidebox next to it to understand its full context.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:1%;\"><span style=\"color: transparent\">.</span></span></p>\n<div class=\"limit\">\n<div class=\"anchor\">\n<div class=\"sidebox\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>The Two Great Diasporas</strong></p>\n<hr/></div>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:250px;\"><img alt=\"o5-4.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/ralliston-s-proposal/o5-4.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>O5-4, circa 1904.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The following is a full timeline of the history of human, Fae, and Children of Night conflicts and all events leading to the Two Great Diasporas, as compiled by O5-4.

Utilizing their nigh-limitless ontokinetic and thaumaturgic abilities, they establish a vast empire, connecting all Fae as one nation ruled by the two.

The former are put into gigantic habitats, unaware of their situation and observed by Fae royalty as entertainment, whilst the latter's cities are destroyed and their inhabitants sent to the darkness of the mines to work as slaves.

Exploiting the chaos, Children of the Night break free, uniting with humanity and eventually bringing the conflict to the end by raiding the palaces of the royalty. <a href=\"/a-faerie-tale-of-twin-queens\">Mab murders her sister</a>, but temporarily loses her power in the process, allowing for the rebellion to eliminate her.

Together with the remaining Fae, humanity and its newfound allies destroys the SCP-1000 civilization, eventually wiping their memories of the event. The Second Great Diaspora, also referred to as the Day of the Flowers, makes humanity the dominant species.

And, in a sense, I <em>was right</em>; the building <em>was</em> in fact yet another fortress of the devil Mab is, but this time it was\u2026 different. What we found was, frankly, shocking.</p>\n<p>One room after another, we uncovered the secrets that place had held for so many millennia after the First Slaughter, and, well, after months of relentless work and making sure our interpretations were accurate, we have to come to one final conclusion that we are almost afraid to mutter: she still breathes somewhere outside our reality, biding her time. Just like her sibling.</p>\n<p>We've always thought the other died, trying to stop her monstrous sister \u2014 however, evidence recovered from the SCP-001-A ruins singlehandedly debunks this. We checked all our calculations and interpretations to make sure we're not wrong, for this could change <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>What's even more shocking is that the sister is not only alive, but also <em>active</em>; just like Mab has her own cults trying to find a ritual capable of resurrecting her, so does the sibling. We however discovered something even more alarming: the names of the sisters. Not true names, of course, for the second sister does not even own hers anymore \u2014 but we <em>did</em> discover\u2026 half-names, would be the best way to put it. Words not fully describing the very being of a person, as true Fae names do, but descriptors of important parts of their personalities. For Mab, long associated with lies and deceit, it was \"shvygh\" and \"shfijif\u00e6,\" meaning \"queen\" and \"starlight\" respectively, but for the sister, associated with creation and aid, \"nv\u0304nv\u014b\u0301nfat\" and \"pitfm\u0301je,\" which, upon translation, meant \"inventor\" and\u2026 \"factory.\"</p>\n<p>What's even more alarming is the event that led to the thaumaturgic energy explosion within SCP-001-A. You see, upon further inspection, my teams discovered many truly bizarre signs: high Akiva radiation, as well as a single sentence woven into the rituals binding the room that would eventually become SCP-001-B into our reality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Come, Inventor; come, our Factory. The Queen is ready. Do not leave her waiting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so, it appears, Rollander quite literally called forth a factory. A factory to resurrect <em>the true</em> Factory through regular human sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Identical ritual parts were detected in the magic which created the factory in the first place. What's more, my men report the feeling that these two rituals were merely two parts of a three-act performance. Whatever the hell Rollander did to bring his masterpiece and the room within to life was merely preparation for bringing a third thing, this time presumably an entity, from within it and into our reality.</p>\n<p>Mab has been a danger lurking behind our backs for almost 40 years now, ever since we founded ourselves in those dark halls, swearing to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora that would bring us down again. We did everything we could to stop Mab's influence, but let's face it: our best magicians won't even form a fraction of the power that devil possesses. But the sister does. And we need to do everything in our power to use that to our advantage.</p>\n<p>What I'm trying to say is that I believe SCP-001-B isn't merely a room \u2014 it's a <em>throne</em> room, designed to host royalty. Whatever god resides there \u2014 and let's call it SCP-001-C, for simplicity's sake \u2014 I can feel its hatred for Mab pumping through the veins of the Factory, coming from the pounding heart seated within. And I know only of one entity that hates Mab more than the Nightwalkers.</p>\n<p>We must use this opportunity as best as we can, unless we wish for another genocide to hit, this time targetting <em>us</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-3:</strong> Further Research and Changes</p>\n<p>Two months following the conclusion of the SCP-001-A ruins research, the news regarding it was apparently leaked by an unknown individual to the worldwide anomalous community. Numerous rumors resulted, and as a result, Fae militia organizations were seen taking interest in the factory. This news reached the ever-growing group supporting Mab's actions and planning her resurrection.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, their squads were noted to patrol the outskirts of the factory, apparently seeking to gain access. Successfully doing so, they were then seen sabotaging SCP-001-A, resulting in significant damage to the building. To counteract this action, Rollander decided to double the sacrifice rate towards SCP-001-C, resulting in an extremely high disappearance rate among workers within Krak\u00f3w and surrounding cities. This led to local authorities gaining interest in the case. To counteract a possible Veil-breaking event, on 03/02/1910, the Administrator sent the following urgent message to Rollander:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Honorable James Rollander,</p>\n<p>We are aware of your actions within your factory, and, whilst we realize and appreciate your intentions of keeping Mab at bay through the resurrection of the Inventor, we must ask for an immediate cessation of such activities. We realize that you are left with no other option than to increase your sacrifices following the attacks, but we simply cannot allow you to continue doing so; the only alternative you realistically have is to properly deal with the attacks and continue your work at a normal pace. We hope you will understand our concerns and express a wish to cooperate, for we <em>will</em> engage with force otherwise.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>With respect,<br/>\n<em>\u2014 Krak\u00f3w authorities</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Two days later, the following reply was received by the O5 Council; how PoI-001-A was aware of the location of its members remains unknown.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Silence, foul creatures of darkness. My noble heart shan't listen to your laughable heresies \u2014 I can hear the Queen speaking through your words. And, I want you to know one thing \u2014 I am no Starlight's servant. I swore loyalty to only one Inventor, to one brilliant mind illuminating the skies with its genius like your Star had never had. I forgive your vengeful hearts serving Mab, for the creator forgives, unlike your Queen. Begone, whilst your armies can still walk.</p>\n<p>My Masterpiece is almost done, and I shan't stop with its preparations \u2014 if you wish for a war with our magic, then you shall have it. The Factory is almost ready to emerge, and once it does, her brilliance shall overpower the darkness your Empress wished for the entire world. You cannot stop the rituals feeding Her, for the Inventor can feel your every move. She whispers to my ear, illuminating my mind with a portion of its brilliance, and I know of all you do \u2014 of your horrid servitude to the betrayer of the men of this Earth.</p>\n<p>May the Skies above us have mercy on you.</p>\n<p>You will not stop us.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Immediately after, PoI-001-A took the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tripled the intake of workers to SCP-001-A, effectively resulting in the tripling of the ratio of the rituals feeding SCP-001-C;</li>\n<li>neutralized numerous Mab-aligned Fae organizations, bringing their bodies into SCP-001-A for purposes unknown;</li>\n<li>utilized numerous thaumaturgic rituals within SCP-001-A, disallowing entry into the building without his direct permission;</li>\n<li>hastened the shipment of unknown thaumaturgic and theological apparatus into the factory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Realizing the only way to neutralize the threat of the breaking of the Veil due to Rollander's actions whilst still maintaining the protection from PoI-001-C was taking control of SCP-001-A, Overwatch Command had undertaken the following vote:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> \"Utilize Foundation resources to seize SCP-001-C from James Rollander and establish a Site within.

Further containment and research plans regarding SCP-001 were discussed, eventually landing on the necessity of a Site within the anomaly's proximity to properly contain it. As a result, a proposal was put forward by O5-1 to, over a long period of time, transform the gigantic structure of SCP-001-A into a Foundation Site, acting as the main hub of operations for the Council and its most important project: SCP-001.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-5:</strong> Further SCP-001 Research</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:325px;\"><img alt=\"abandoned.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/ralliston-s-proposal/abandoned.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>SCP-001-A, pictured midway through its transformation into Site-01.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Following the stabilization of the threat of potential civilian discovery of SCP-001-A due to Rollander's decisions and the finalization of Site-01's construction, the O5 Council decided that research into the true nature of SCP-001-B and SCP-001-C as well as the latter's protective nature against PoI-001-C was a priority. Despite previous studies showcasing the fact that SCP-001-C is most likely the half-dead entity referred to as 'The Inventor', further study conducted by O5-4 and his teams revealed that the entity was connected to numerous Fae seers and thaumaturgists in the world, still capable of communication.</p>\n<p>However, despite the aforementioned stabilization, attacks from local Queen Mab-affiliated militias did not stop, instead increasing in frequency; the Foundation attempted contact with said groups on numerous occasions, but the only answer ever received was the following:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>You will <em>not</em> bring her back. Not after everything we've done to try to stop it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Chatter picked up by Foundation moles situated within communities around the world suggested that a \"Fae army, like the world has never seen since the dawn of Mab\" was gathering to attack SCP-001-A. Initially dismissed as mere rumors, this eventually led to the Foundation tripling security measures around Site-01 after numerous previously stationary Fae groups went on the move. Further research into this phenomenon remained pending at the time.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, research into SCP-001-C was officially approved. After months of analysis, it was officially confirmed that following sacrifices to SCP-001-C being done, the percent of Queen Mab's entire being existing in baseline reality did in fact seem to reduce from 5% to 4%, rendering all previous interpretations to be true.</p>\n<p>In order to utilize the fact that SCP-001-C, presumed to be Queen Mab's sibling, was still alive and able to communicate, the following tests were undertaken.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>INPUT</th>\n<th>OUTPUT</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A singular red apple (<em>Malus domestica</em>), delivered to SCP-001-B through thaumaturgic rituals</td>\n<td>No results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A singular red apple (<em>Malus domestica</em>), delivered to SCP-001-B through a D-Class personnel</td>\n<td>Three seconds following input, the following phrase was heard in the minds of all near Site-01 personnel: \"MORE\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A singular, already dead, dog (<em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>)</td>\n<td>\"FRESH BLOOD\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A singular living dog (<em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>)</td>\n<td>\"MORE\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A singular alive D-Class personnel</td>\n<td>\"I AM THE CALL OF THE HEAVENS, BRINGING DOWN GIFTS OF INTELLECT TO THE MINDS OF THE WORTHY\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repeat of the above</td>\n<td>\"I FEND OFF THE EVILS OF DARKNESS AND FEAR, LURKING IN THE SHADOWS OF STARLIGHT\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repeat of the above</td>\n<td>\"I AM THE SENTRY, THE SHIELD AGAINST ALL THAT LIES WITHIN THE LAND OF DARKNESS\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repeat of the above</td>\n<td>No results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repeat of the above</td>\n<td>No results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Three alive D-Class personnel</td>\n<td>\"MY POWER FADES LIKE STARLIGHT IN THE NIGHT MY SISTER IS, BUT IT STILL GRASPS INTO THIS REALM\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repeat of the above</td>\n<td>\"BUT IT SHAN'T FOR MUCH LONGER, FOR THE SERVANT OF DEATH IS STRONG.

The ritual was nearing completion, with the portal approximated to contain individuals numbering in the thousands; a 2-hour window to prepare for the army's arrival was projected. When evacuation was ordered, the area around the building was almost immediately cut off via a thaumaturgic barrier. Numerous anti-magic apparatus set up around the Site did not appear to slow the ritual.</p>\n<p>A Site-wide alert was immediately called, with the entire Council immediately evacuated to the lower levels and appropriate personnel called to duty. A distress call to other Foundation Sites was attempted, but due to no such facilities existing within Poland, no aid was possible within the given time span. Site-01 staff began to prepare for the incoming attack, attempting to eavesdrop on the teleporting army's conversations, yielding the below result.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Due to high ritual instability, most of the intercepted and translated Fae dialogue is heavily corrupted.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[UNKNOWN 1]:</strong> <em>[unintelligible]</em> I'm trying to say is that we <em>[unintelligible]</em> cannot allow them to bring <em>[unintelligible]</em> back, no matter the co\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>[UNKNOWN 2]:</strong> I <em>know</em> that, <em>[unintelligible]</em>; that doesn't mean we <em>[unintelligible]</em> can disobey <strong><span style=\"color: green\">her</span></strong>; this <em>[unintelligible]</em> insanity.

The SCP Foundation was created with three goals in mind: to Secure the human population from Fae and SCP-1000 attacks, Contain the threat of Queen Mab and the gods of the ancient past, and Protect humanity from a Third Great Diaspora. The Foundation's motto would eventually be adapted from these goals.</p>\n<p>Prior to the 1870 summit, plans to integrate the numerous subgroups into one organization were passed among the leaders who would eventually comprise the original O5 Council. Only following that year's discovery that Queen Mab was still alive, however, prompted by research made due to the conclusion of the aforementioned war, was it officially signed. This single discovery proved that research alone wouldn't be enough to deal with the existential threats hanging above humanity, and that a containment policy limiting their spread would eventually become necessary.</p>\n<p>On 29/12/1870, the SCP Foundation was officially created following approval from thirteen consenting parties, as proposed and later led by [ERROR], who gained the position of Administrator by unanimous decision.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> We swore to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora when we banded together those forty years ago,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup> don't any of you remember?! <em>&lt;scoffs&gt;</em> I'd call all of you hypocrites, but that wouldn't reflect even a part of my hatred for you, you pieces of shi\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Maria Jones suddenly stands up, moving her pen and papers aside.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Maria Jones:</strong> Enough!</p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> But\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Jones:</strong> <em>&lt;in a thunderous voice:&gt;</em> <strong>I SAID \u2014 ENOUGH!</strong></p>\n<p><em>O5-4 calms down, walking towards his seat.

Espionage and betrayal amongst Foundation personnel has increased by almost 10%, with overall efficiency down by approximately 40% even two years after the event.</p>\n<p>Throughout the entirety of the post-Diaspora period a severe decrease in the mental stability of numerous Foundation staff, including Maria Jones and [ERROR], has been noted. The most notable case is the aforementioned Administrator, seen engaging in highly uncharacteristic behavior while denying any personal peculiarity. Examples included, but were not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>erratic decisions without authorization from the rest of the Council;</li>\n<li>visible obsession with the occult, despite little to no previous interest in such;</li>\n<li>visible obsession with Fae history, despite little to no previous interest in such;</li>\n<li>paranoia and trust issues;</li>\n<li>patterns of talking to himself on seemingly nonsensical subjects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Said behavior culminated on 30/12/1913 when [ERROR] disappeared, the only evidence left being the following note found on his desk:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>'It' had never been the Inventor. How could I have been so blind?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The only contextual evidence Foundation thaumaturgists have found is an almost unnoticeable mark of magic leading towards SCP-001-B from [ERROR]'s office. The following is the only memory visualization available in the thaumaturgic thoughtspace near SCP-001-B that in any way references the event.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The truthfulness of the following is still pending approval from the rest of the O5 Council.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>\n<p><em>[ERROR] is standing in a short and dimly lit corridor, panting. He is holding the same stone he had used to cause the Third Diaspora in his hand, pointing it at the gigantic green doors in front of him. The entire area is filled with fog and sounds of clockwork turning in the background, as well as voices similar to those of former SCP-001-A workers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[ERROR]:</strong> You\u2026 m-monster!</p>\n<p><em>He comes closer, opening the doors with visible difficulty. As he finishes doing so, powerful wind starts to blow from inside, making him back off. He points the item at the inside of the room, from which green fog is rolling into the area around him.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[ERROR]:</strong> We\u2026 we <em>fed</em> you!</p>\n<p><em>The sound of something stirring within the room fills the air as [ERROR] grabs his head in his hands. He screams with pain, falling on the floor. [UNKNOWN] laughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[ERROR]:</strong> What\u2026 what even <em>are</em> you?!</p>\n<p><em>[ERROR] loses his words, breaking down in tears. He loses hold of the stone, letting it fall on the ground as his entire body shivers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[UNKNOWN]:</strong> <em>&lt;chuckles&gt;</em> DOES THAT EVEN TRULY MATTER?</p>\n<p><em>[ERROR] is suddenly lifted from the ground as green fills his eyes, making him scream. As he continues to do so, he is transported into SCP-001-B.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[UNKNOWN]:</strong> COME.</p>\n<p><em>From underneath [ERROR]'s jacket, animal-like fur starts to explode, eventually filling his entire body. His face distorts, visibly deforming. His continued screaming eventually turns into the gurgling of a hog. He tries to reach for an exit, grabbing one of the doors, but his hands slip away as they turn into hooves. He eventually loses all voice, but the screaming continues as his now fully-converted body begins to twitch violently. The feed disconnects.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> No such individual with the name \"[ERROR]\" was ever a part of the Foundation's personnel. Following a second appearance of such an error following the initial SCP-001-A exploration and the above event, it was decided that it was the effect of SCP-001-C and should be ignored to maintain documentation logic.</p>\n<p>Due to months of no contact with [ERROR] (likely the previous name for the Foundation's Administrator), as well as the nature of the above event, he was presumed dead.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 001-8:</strong> Post-Incident Stabilization Attempts</p>\n<p>As requested by the remaining members of Overwatch Command, now not limited by [ERROR]'s influence, further research into the consequences of the Third Diaspora revealed that despite the 85% of the previously existing Fae populace being murdered, the remaining 15% did not fade, instead forming communities within Nexuses and Free Ports around the globe. No contact with them was attempted at the time of discovery, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>Following the death of [ERROR] in unknown circumstances at the hands of SCP-001-C, the position of the Administrator remained vacant for a significant period of time; to properly deal with this problem as well as the consequences of the Third Diaspora following the death of its perpetrator, a meeting of the O5 Council was called.

Where once had been the damaged office of the now-deceased PoI-001-A is a room filled with Foundation maps, iconography, items of research, and contact apparatus. Among this can be seen a large wooden table with 13 seats, around which 8 visibly tired and saddened individuals are sitting. They are reading letters and other documents on the table. Eleven hurries to the table, clears his throat, and joins the remainder of the Council members in his seat.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Apologies for the delay; Ontokinetics needed my assistance. Shall we begin?</p>\n<p><em>He looks at O5-1, who nods. Eleven smiles almost unnoticeably, nodding back, and he stands up from his seat, looking at the remainder of the Council.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> <em>&lt;sigh&gt;</em> I\u2026 I'm not going to play around the problem; [ERROR] is dead, as you all know, and, well, with him being gone, so is the position of Administrator.</p>\n<p><em>O5-4 groans.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> And so too, the defenses for what he\u2019s done.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Yes, that too.</p>\n<p><em>O5-11 pauses for a moment, trying to find his words; after failing to do so, he grabs his forehead with his right hand, gently massaging it, and sighs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> What I'm ultimately trying to say is that we fucked up. Jesus Christ have we fucked up. We need an Administrator and a way to fix all of this goddamned mess. And we need one <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Dead silence fills the room as Eleven exhales loudly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> So, uhm, any ideas?</p>\n<p><em>The silence is broken by the quiet humming of O5-2's mechanisms as he stands up. The turning clockwork fills the void left by the intrusion.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>MEKHANE ONCE SAID THAT TO BEAR TOTAL POWER WELL, ONE MUST BE OBJECTIVE IN ORDER TO BE JUST.</tt></p>\n<p><em>Two looks around the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>THEREFORE, HUMANITY IS UNABLE TO RULE WELL. TO DEAL WITH\u2014</tt></p>\n<p><em>O5-4 coughs theatrically.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> No. I'm not giving a goddamned Mekhanite power over the rest of us. <em>&lt;pointing at O5-2:&gt;</em> That wasn't the deal with your little master when we built you.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>I\u2014</tt></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Friends, please.</p>\n<p><em>As silence fills the room again, O5-1, who remained both silent and inactive during prior activities, suddenly clears his throat.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I will take it.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Huh?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> No matter how you think about it, the position of Administrator isn't a blessing. <em>&lt;sigh&gt;</em> And I'm the only one here who's too tired to use that curse in any way that would destroy us. I'm an old man, Joseph. You can wage your little wars as much as you want \u2014 but <em>I'm</em> only here to keep the destruction to a minimum.</p>\n<p><em>Eleven tries to speak up, but decides against it. He sighs, and sits down, looking at the rest of the Council.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Anyone against?</p>\n<p><em>No one reacts, silently looking on the ground.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> So it's decided.</p>\n<p><em>One stands up again, throwing the document he's been holding in his hands on the desk. O5-11 raises his eyebrow.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> And that is\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> The results of the Third Diaspora, in numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>I FAIL TO SEE HOW THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC OF OUR MEETING.</tt></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It's relevant, Two, because we have to admit to what we've done.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>I BEG YOUR PARDON?</tt></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We need to fix what we've done, do you understand? Even if [ERROR] had done so, <em>we</em> were one of the reasons it happened, and I'm not about to allow for my first action to be avoiding the consequences of our crimes.</p>\n<p><em>Short pause.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> So, to put it simply, what the hell do we do?</p>\n<p><em>Eleven raises his hand.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Free Ports. We\u2026 We need to find them. Find them, and protect them the best we can do. And, perhaps one day, they might even not want to kill us.</p>\n<p><em>O5-8 scratches her head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> The last I heard about them was when we discovered <a href=\"/the-s-c-plastics-hub\">that one in Wisconsin</a>. And I don't think they have Fairies in there.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> There's been\u2026 rumors of one here in Poland, mostly Fae operated. '<a href=\"/scp-5373\">Esterberg</a>', it's supposedly called. My teams recover more and more records of it being a safe heaven for the anomalous, something like that. And there's always <a href=\"/nx-03\">Hy-Brasil</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Is this\u2026 confirmed?</p>\n<p><em>Four scratches his chin.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> As close as we can get with a rumor, I suppose. But\u2026 establishing a Site wouldn't hurt anyone there. We needed one in Poland anyways. <em>&lt;turning towards Eleven:&gt;</em> Hasn't <a href=\"/scp-5292\">Hannah Rivera been keen on making one recently</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> She\u2026 She has, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> So, what's the problem?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>WE CANNOT JUST ALLOW THINGS TO CHANGE IMMEDIATELY. IT WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS, AND PERSONNEL WOULD REBEL. APPROVING OF HER REQUEST AFTER DENYING IT FOR SO LONG WOULD BE UNWISE.</tt></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Two's right. We need to take our time. Let's send her there, and if she finds something, only then let's allow her Site to happen. It would be\u2026 what, our one-hundred-twentieth?</p>\n<p><em>Four smiles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> And then, once she finds that Esterberg, let's start slowly, until we can fix things. But it will need time. We can't rush this. Sixty years at least.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Sixty years? Have you lost your mind? That's more than half a century\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> <a href=\"/scp-006\">We have time</a>.</p>\n<p><em>One sighs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We can't just make this a one-time thing. We must change our directives, not the ways in which people perceive them.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Nobody can know this, aside from us. Not now, at least; people <em>will</em> resign if they learn of this now. Let's pretend to stay ruthless still, until we can truly change, giving into that change one step yearly.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> <tt>IT WILL NEED TO BECOME OUR FOURTH MOTTO. SECURING, CONTAINING, AND PROTECTING ARE NO LONGER THE VALID WAY.</tt></p>\n<p><em>Four chuckles silently.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> A <em>fourth</em> directive? Why not.</p>\n<p><em>Passionate chatter spawns among the Council, which is quickly stopped by Eleven standing up and clearing his throat.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Let's\u2026 Let's put it to a vote, shall we?</p>\n<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> See the document below.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> \"Through the pursuit of all available information, locate every single Free Port previously unknown to the Foundation across the globe in an attempt to find and aid the remaining members of the <em>Homo sapiens sidhe</em> species.

All Foundation resources are made available to ensure the procedure's proper maintenance.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Following the unanimous passing of the proposal, making amends with the Fae populace has officially started. However, to ensure the continued compliance of Foundation personnel and to not precipitate any resignations due to drastic policy changes, the full process was projected to take over 70 years to complete. Calculations by O5-2 determined that the best way to integrate Fae and SCP-1000 cultures into human societies and structures, allowing for <a href=\"/i-did-not-fade\">peaceful and harmonious coexistence would be gradual and small changes, eventually leading to total integration</a> and, perhaps, the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500/offset/11\">removal of the Foundation as a factor altogether</a>. This process began with the founding of Site-120 to oversee Esterberg, the Free Port of Cz\u0119stochowa.</p>\n<p>However, despite these changes being attempted and, over time, amplified, not all anomalous societies have shown support, with some going as far as violence to oppose them. The most active was and remains to this day GoI-120 (\"Triumvirat\u00e9\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-14\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')\">14</a></sup>), formed amongst the chaos that ensued following the Factory Purge \u2014 as the Third Diaspora was later called \u2014 by the followers of Mab which remained after their slaughter. On the day of its inception, theorized to be within two weeks of 13/08/1911, the original date of the Third Diaspora, the group sent out a message to all Site-01 personnel which resulted in their discovery. A transcript of the message, translated from Fae and without the memetic triggers the original possessed, is available below.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>It's quite funny, seeing your organization and the little Council managing it believing itself to be in control.</p>\n<p>We've seen that attitude ever since we formed in the bowels of the Earths all those hundreds of thousands of years ago \u2014 hubris, that's what we called it. Hubris was the downfall of everything you've built, and ever will build. We'd say we're the bringers of that exact same event, only in recent days, but that would only be half the truth \u2014 as for you, we are also the harbingers of your inevitable and painful deaths.</p>\n<p>There's a certain irony to your situation, but we'll let you figure it out yourselves; it will be quite fun to watch you realize the obvious truth before you. But even then, none of this truly matters \u2014 we are growing in numbers, and we are growing fast. The Third Diaspora left more of us than you thought, and you'll soon find it out the hard way.</p>\n<p>Until then, we will be patiently waiting.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Despite the actions undertaken as a result of Directive Alpha/1911, the threat posed by Queen Mab remained extant. To counter this, a consensus between the Foundation and SCP-001-C was attempted. Despite [ERROR]'s (the entity's prior host) death, the lack of ease in contact with it as a result of the event, and ethical concerns, following numerous days of debate among the Council and approval from O5-11, it was decided that Procedure 001-Corpus needed to be maintained at all costs. As a result of that decision, it was agreed that exactly 13 live humans would be delivered to SCP-001-C on a weekly basis. To cause the least damage to the Foundation via this process, the usage of <a href=\"/scp-2000\">Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR)</a> to form the individuals required for the procedure was unanimously authorized.</p>\n<p>However, despite this, numerous Foundation personnel were found dissatisfied over the ethics of this method as well as the overall ethics of working with a deity. In response, the following message was sent by O5-1 to all Foundation personnel with knowledge of the procedure:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>In recent days, my office and I have been approached by anonymous complaints regarding the\u2026 ethicality of Procedure 001-Corpus, going so far as to ask \"where was the Ethics Committee\" when we approved it. Whilst those complaints are of course understandable given the situation, I need to clear something up: we are not giving a god what it wants. We're merely making sure the sister of said god doesn't massacre us. And giving that bastard corpses is frankly the only thing we can do.</p>\n<p>We can't fix the past.

At the ending of his shift he entered into the room, despite claiming to have possessed no will to find it \u2014 further research revealed that this was due to the cleanup crew's leadership forgetting to relay the anti-SCP-001-C influence pills which each team member is required to take daily.</p>\n<p>Despite successfully entering into SCP-001-B, Majer was able to escape the room due to a sudden awakening of previously dormant ontokinetic abilities, effectively becoming the first recorded person able to leave unaffected. He remained within the corridor through which he found entry into SCP-001-B for the remainder of his shift, only discovered two days later by Site-01 guards patrolling the area. Majer was extremely dehydrated, exhibiting signs of extreme paranoia, fear, and anxiety, and refused to answer any questions. Following numerous hours of the appliance of calming rituals and treatment, however, he began to respond to simple queries. The following is a transcript of the interview which subsequently took place.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 12/08/1918</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Anthony Majer</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> [ERROR]<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-15\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> System Error: unidentified edit lock override detected!

Being an only son, he was always meant to inherit the family fortune and their industrial empire consisting of numerous [[[SCP-6789|industrial plants]]] once the current holders -- his father and mother -- inevitably died. Highly interested in the history of Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) and [[[SCP-1000|Children of the Night]]] (//Homo sapiens noctis//) ever since his childhood, Rollander had always shown an above-average intelligence, near-perfect memory, and skill in obtaining historical information otherwise thought to be undiscoverable.\n\n\n\nHowever, when a majority of his family died under unexplained circumstances in 1888 during a fatal shipboard incident (for which he was not present, but had personally financed), PoI-001-A donated all of his stocks and buildings to an unknown thaumaturgic cabal operating in the USA.\n\n\n\nThe next day James Rollander was seen leaving America with a ship headed for Great Britain, later traveling to (at that time occupied) Poland. Witnesses of the event reported the man acting highly paranoid and erratic, as if he were afraid someone was observing him, and holding an unidentified tome within his hands. Having disappeared for approximately 10 years following the conclusion of his travels, he reappeared in 1898 near Krak\u00f3w, Poland, with the construction of SCP-001-A starting shortly after.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSCP-001-A is an industrial megastructure located 25 kilometers south of Krak\u00f3w, Poland, founded and overseen by James Rollander. Acting as the main provider of a plethora of services to the entire country and most of the continent, it currently houses approximately 30 000 laborers working and living within its confines. Atop its gates the following sentence, written in the Fae language, can be seen:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\nThe Factory hungers, as the Queen\u2019s move has become her last gambit. Do not leave it in famine.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSCP-001-B is a room located within SCP-001-A, which can only be found once an individual expresses the wish to find it, be it willingly or subconsciously. So far, attempts to mark it in relation to any other rooms or landmarks within the structure have been unsuccessful; inevitably, all individuals coming into contact with it will describe drastically different details of the place and the path which led them to it.\n\n\n\nSCP-001-C is an entity located within SCP-001-B, fed by human sacrifices delivered to it by PoI-001-A. Further details regarding its nature are presently unavailable.\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-001-A was constructed by a currently unidentified group of individuals or force between 1898-1902; no formal records regarding the process of construction exist. Created as the \"ultimate factory,\" it was meant to supply every single possible industrial need of the people.\n\n\n\nSCP-001-A gained Foundation attention in 1908 after exceedingly high levels of thaumaturgic energy were intercepted from it. This energy did not fade over time, instead remaining at a consistently high level. Now theorized to be the date of origin for SCP-001-B, this event sparked a visible period of the highest productivity to date, ultimately resulting in unprecedented profits and the expansion of Rollander's nascent empire.\n\n\n\nTo eliminate the possibility that the event was merely a coincidence precipitated by the building's potentially anomalous location, further research was approved. This resulted in the discovery of the ruins of numerous palaces and city structures in the caverns below the factory. Dated at approximately 200 000 years old, they were immediately identified as structures formed by the Fae Empire prior to its fall.[[footnote]] For a full briefing regarding the history of this group, refer to Addendum 001-2. [[/footnote]] Despite their anomalous properties, it was later discovered that they had been uninvolved with the event, which had instead been the result of some form of ritual conducted within SCP-001-A.\n\n\n\nFollowing these discoveries, the Foundation officially classified SCP-001-A as its first full high-priority project following the adoption of the 'SCP' classification, resulting in it acquiring the designation of SCP-001.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-1:** SCP-001-A Exploration\n\n\n\nIn light of the thaumaturgic energy's failure to fade, the O5 Council decided that more information regarding SCP-001-A was required. As no SCP-001-A personnel were noted leaving the factory within the previous month, a Foundation-organized exploration mission was orchestrated.\n\n\n\nHowever, upon entry into the factory, the Task Force immediately lost contact with the Foundation.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-2:** SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis\n\n\n\nFollowing the loss of contact with previous exploration missions, it was decided that further exploration attempts would inevitably end the same way. In order to still obtain further potential information regarding SCP-001, research into the nature and origin of the ruins underneath the factory was immediately approved. The following is a statement by the project's research head following numerous months of focused investigation, released on 14/12/1909. Prior to reading it, personnel are heavily advised to familiarize themselves with the documentation available in the sidebox next to it to understand its full context.\n\n\n\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n**The Two Great Diasporas**\n\n-----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=o5-4.jpg|align=right|caption=O5-4, circa 1904.|width=250px]]\n\n\n\nThe following is a full timeline of the history of human, Fae, and Children of Night conflicts and all events leading to the Two Great Diasporas, as compiled by O5-4. As most of the historical records acting as evidence for these events are either extremely old or severely damaged, precise Gregorian Calendar dates cannot be traced. Approximate dates are given instead.\n\n\n\n* [UNKNOWN] -- consensus baseline reality achieves stability as the result of numerous religious faiths being simultaneously true (due to human belief bestowing power upon them). \"Old Gods\" and numerous other deific entities presumably responsible for the creation and destruction of the era fade away, leaving Earth to its own machinations -- no further outside influence on history is noted from this point forth.\n\n\n\n* 300 000 years BCE -- humans, Fae, and Children of the Night emerge as the three dominant species on the planet, evolving from one (currently unknown) common evolutionary predecessor. As humans live in the plains during the day, the Fae hide in the forests where nature reigns; the remaining Nightwalkers exist in caverns.\n\n\n\n* 280 000 years BCE -- Queen Mab and her sister (name unknown -- all references are anomalously expunged from the record, with similar energy markings to the **##green|removal of one's name##**) are born. Utilizing their nigh-limitless ontokinetic and thaumaturgic abilities, they establish a vast empire, connecting all Fae as one nation ruled by the two. Children of the Night create numerous underground cities, and humans remain as nomadic tribes.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=seal.png|align=right|caption=A tentative recreation of the seal of the Fae Empire.|width=250px]]\n\n\n\n* 275 000 years BCE -- as the two queens' control over their abilities grows to near full understanding, the Fae empire expands worldwide, taking control over both humans and Nightwalkers. The former are put into gigantic habitats, unaware of their situation and observed by Fae royalty as entertainment, whilst the latter's cities are destroyed and their inhabitants sent to the darkness of the mines to work as slaves. The divide between the Fae poor and the aristocrats grows exponentially as the royalty gains power through the exploitation of the working class, treated similarly to the prisoners.\n\n\n\n* 240 000 years BCE -- an all-out war between the two factions of the Fae empire breaks out, with Queen Mab and her sister standing on opposite sides, divided by moral issues. Utilizing her vastly greater power of ontokinetic abilities and the skill to take away Names, Mab swings the conflict in favor of the Fae royalty. Exploiting the chaos, Children of the Night break free, uniting with humanity and eventually bringing the conflict to the end by raiding the palaces of the royalty. [[[a-faerie-tale-of-twin-queens|Mab murders her sister]]], but temporarily loses her power in the process, allowing for the rebellion to eliminate her. The Fae empire falls, with its subjects scattering around the globe. Children of the Night become the dominant species, ending the First Great Diaspora.\n\n\n\n* 220 000 years BCE -- the Nightwalkers create vast, technologically advanced metropolises, coexisting harmoniously with nature. Humanity once again becomes a protected, zoo-like species. Through unknown means, Queen Mab survives between several afterlives, eventually gaining insight into baseline reality.\n\n\n\n* 210 000 years BCE -- Queen Mab persuades humanity to overthrow the Children of the Night, lending them some of her remaining power. Together with the remaining Fae, humanity and its newfound allies destroys the SCP-1000 civilization, eventually wiping their memories of the event. The Second Great Diaspora, also referred to as the Day of the Flowers, makes humanity the dominant species. The remaining Fae scatter across the globe, maintaining an extremely low population, hiding in the forests to not allow Mab to gain further control.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis\n\n+++++ {{A paper by O5-4[[footnote]] Foundation history expert, specializing in the history of the anomalous. [[/footnote]]}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=caverns.png|align=right|caption=A section of the SCP-001-A Ruins.|width=350px]]\n\n\n\nWhen I first arrived at the dig site beneath SCP-001-A, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't expecting the usual findings -- that being yet another gigantic ruined palace of Mab, brought down by the furious First Diasporans desperately trying to find the monster behind their suffering. And, in a sense, I //was right//; the building //was// in fact yet another fortress of the devil Mab is, but this time it was... different. What we found was, frankly, shocking.\n\n\n\nOne room after another, we uncovered the secrets that place had held for so many millennia after the First Slaughter, and, well, after months of relentless work and making sure our interpretations were accurate, we have to come to one final conclusion that we are almost afraid to mutter: she still breathes somewhere outside our reality, biding her time. Just like her sibling.\n\n\n\nWe've always thought the other died, trying to stop her monstrous sister -- however, evidence recovered from the SCP-001-A ruins singlehandedly debunks this. We checked all our calculations and interpretations to make sure we're not wrong, for this could change //everything//.\n\n\n\nWhat's even more shocking is that the sister is not only alive, but also //active//; just like Mab has her own cults trying to find a ritual capable of resurrecting her, so does the sibling. We however discovered something even more alarming: the names of the sisters. Not true names, of course, for the second sister does not even own hers anymore -- but we //did// discover... half-names, would be the best way to put it. Words not fully describing the very being of a person, as true Fae names do, but descriptors of important parts of their personalities. For Mab, long associated with lies and deceit, it was \"shvygh\" and \"shfijif\u00e6,\" meaning \"queen\" and \"starlight\" respectively, but for the sister, associated with creation and aid, \"nv\u0304nv\u014b\u0301nfat\" and \"pitfm\u0301je,\" which, upon translation, meant \"inventor\" and... \"factory.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's even more alarming is the event that led to the thaumaturgic energy explosion within SCP-001-A. You see, upon further inspection, my teams discovered many truly bizarre signs: high Akiva radiation, as well as a single sentence woven into the rituals binding the room that would eventually become SCP-001-B into our reality:\n\n\n\n> Come, Inventor; come, our Factory. The Queen is ready. Do not leave her waiting.\n\n\n\nAnd so, it appears, Rollander quite literally called forth a factory. A factory to resurrect //the true// Factory through regular human sacrifice.\n\n\n\nIdentical ritual parts were detected in the magic which created the factory in the first place. What's more, my men report the feeling that these two rituals were merely two parts of a three-act performance. Whatever the hell Rollander did to bring his masterpiece and the room within to life was merely preparation for bringing a third thing, this time presumably an entity, from within it and into our reality.\n\n\n\nMab has been a danger lurking behind our backs for almost 40 years now, ever since we founded ourselves in those dark halls, swearing to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora that would bring us down again. We did everything we could to stop Mab's influence, but let's face it: our best magicians won't even form a fraction of the power that devil possesses. But the sister does. And we need to do everything in our power to use that to our advantage.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I believe SCP-001-B isn't merely a room -- it's a //throne// room, designed to host royalty. Whatever god resides there -- and let's call it SCP-001-C, for simplicity's sake -- I can feel its hatred for Mab pumping through the veins of the Factory, coming from the pounding heart seated within. And\u00a0\u00a0I know only of one entity that hates Mab more than the Nightwalkers.\n\n\n\nWe must use this opportunity as best as we can, unless we wish for another genocide to hit, this time targetting //us//.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-3:** Further Research and Changes\n\n\n\nTwo months following the conclusion of the SCP-001-A ruins research, the news regarding it was apparently leaked by an unknown individual to the worldwide anomalous community. Numerous rumors resulted, and as a result, Fae militia organizations were seen taking interest in the factory. This news reached the ever-growing group supporting Mab's actions and planning her resurrection.\n\n\n\nIn the coming weeks, their squads were noted to patrol the outskirts of the factory, apparently seeking to gain access. Successfully doing so, they were then seen sabotaging SCP-001-A, resulting in significant damage to the building. To counteract this action, Rollander decided to double the sacrifice rate towards SCP-001-C, resulting in an extremely high disappearance rate among workers within Krak\u00f3w and surrounding cities. This led to local authorities gaining interest in the case. To counteract a possible Veil-breaking event, on 03/02/1910, the Administrator sent the following urgent message to Rollander:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nHonorable James Rollander,\n\n\n\nWe are aware of your actions within your factory, and, whilst we realize and appreciate your intentions of keeping Mab at bay through the resurrection of the Inventor, we must ask for an immediate cessation of such activities. We realize that you are left with no other option than to increase your sacrifices following the attacks, but we simply cannot allow you to continue doing so; the only alternative you realistically have is to properly deal with the attacks and continue your work at a normal pace. We hope you will understand our concerns and express a wish to cooperate, for we //will// engage with force otherwise.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\nWith respect,\n\n//-- Krak\u00f3w authorities//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nTwo days later, the following reply was received by the O5 Council; how PoI-001-A was aware of the location of its members remains unknown.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nSilence, foul creatures of darkness. My noble heart shan't listen to your laughable heresies -- I can hear the Queen speaking through your words. And, I want you to know one thing -- I am no Starlight's servant. I swore loyalty to only one Inventor, to one brilliant mind illuminating the skies with its genius like your Star had never had. I forgive your vengeful hearts serving Mab, for the creator forgives, unlike your Queen. Begone, whilst your armies can still walk.\n\n\n\nMy Masterpiece is almost done, and I shan't stop with its preparations -- if you wish for a war with our magic, then you shall have it. The Factory is almost ready to emerge, and once it does, her brilliance shall overpower the darkness your Empress wished for the entire world. You cannot stop the rituals feeding Her, for the Inventor can feel your every move. She whispers to my ear, illuminating my mind with a portion of its brilliance, and I know of all you do -- of your horrid servitude to the betrayer of the men of this Earth.\n\n\n\nMay the Skies above us have mercy on you.\n\n\n\nYou will not stop us.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nImmediately after, PoI-001-A took the following actions:\n\n* tripled the intake of workers to SCP-001-A, effectively resulting in the tripling of the ratio of the rituals feeding SCP-001-C;\n\n* neutralized numerous Mab-aligned Fae organizations, bringing their bodies into SCP-001-A for purposes unknown;\n\n* utilized numerous thaumaturgic rituals within SCP-001-A, disallowing entry into the building without his direct permission;\n\n* hastened the shipment of unknown thaumaturgic and theological apparatus into the factory.\n\n\n\nRealizing the only way to neutralize the threat of the breaking of the Veil due to Rollander's actions whilst still maintaining the protection from PoI-001-C was taking control of SCP-001-A, Overwatch Command had undertaken the following vote:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Proposal:** \"Utilize Foundation resources to seize SCP-001-C from James Rollander and establish a Site within. Effectively gain control over the protection from PoI-001-C offered by sacrifices to SCP-001-C whilst still maintaining the secretive nature of the SCP Foundation's operations.\"\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ ADMINISTRATOR'S NOTE[[footnote]] Added to the documentation as per his direct request. [[/footnote]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWhen, all those years ago, I brought the thirteen talented mages and theologists that would eventually become my Council before myself, I swore one thing -- to never resort to meaningless violence. For all those 40 years we've operated together now, I stayed true to my promise -- even if I was among the few of us that //did// keep it, I kept it. Never have I approved an operation that would result in the deaths of people who didn't need to die for the world to become safe.

But it must be done. We simply cannot allow ourselves to lose the only known mechanism to defend against Mab in the entire universe. We must strike quickly and ruthlessly, because we need to keep Mab away from baseline reality, no matter what it takes.

Her hands are extended widely, just 5 centimeters away from the doors to the room, and she is visibly struggling in deep focus. She opens her deep and burning purple eyes[[footnote]] Natural sign of a fully-realized Class III or above reality bender. [[/footnote]] and, with a silent scream, tears the doors apart, revealing entry into the office. Panting, she nods towards the rest of the group, made up of [ERROR] and O5-4, and they enter into it.//\n\n\n\n//The room is extremely large and packed with numerous bookcases, chests, and containers, with magical items of unknown purpose scattered throughout. In the corner, behind a large wooden desk, Rollander is cowering. He is shivering, with a shadow formation akin to a crown forming above his head. Sobbing, in a panicked state, he attempts to hide from the intruders behind the chair.//\n\n\n\n**O5-8:** //<in a powerful tone:>// **JAMES JOSEPH ROLLANDER.**\n\n\n\n//PoI-001-A screams, falling to the ground. The shadows above him start to disappear; noticing this, Rollander panics. He attempts to grab the formation, but fails, eventually losing all of it. He starts to scour the floor around him, looking for something, frantically talking to himself but finding nothing.//\n\n\n\n//O5-8 comes closer, extending her hand. Rollander notices this, and widens his eyes.//\n\n\n\n**Rollander:** No no no no no, no no.

COME HOME AND SUFFER NO MORE.\n\n\n\n//The smoke suddenly clears, revealing that PoI-001-A's body has disappeared; where it once laid, only his clothing remains to be seen. O5-4 inhales sharply, and turns towards the rest of the group.//\n\n\n\n**O5-4:** [ERROR]?\n\n\n\n**[ERROR]:** Yes?\n\n\n\n**O5-4:** Tell the people the factory has fallen.\n\n\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n-----\n\n**Afterword:** Following the events described above, the SCP Foundation had officially taken control of the factory.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nTo fully discuss further actions following the above, a summit of the O5 Council was called. Further containment and research plans regarding SCP-001 were discussed, eventually landing on\u00a0\u00a0the necessity of a Site within the anomaly's proximity to properly contain it. As a result, a proposal was put forward by O5-1 to, over a long period of time, transform the gigantic structure of SCP-001-A into a Foundation Site, acting as the main hub of operations for the Council and its most important project: SCP-001.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-5:** Further SCP-001 Research\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=abandoned.jpg|align=right|caption=SCP-001-A, pictured midway through its transformation into Site-01.|width=325px]]\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the stabilization of the threat of potential civilian discovery of SCP-001-A due to Rollander's decisions and the finalization of Site-01's construction, the O5 Council decided that research into the true nature of SCP-001-B and SCP-001-C as well as the latter's protective nature against PoI-001-C was a priority. Despite previous studies showcasing the fact that SCP-001-C is most likely the half-dead entity referred to as 'The Inventor', further study conducted by O5-4 and his teams revealed that the entity was connected to numerous Fae seers and thaumaturgists in the world, still capable of communication.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite the aforementioned stabilization, attacks from local Queen Mab-affiliated militias did not stop, instead increasing in frequency; the Foundation attempted contact with said groups on numerous occasions, but the only answer ever received was the following:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\nYou will //not// bring her back. Not after everything we've done to try to stop it.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nChatter picked up by Foundation moles situated within communities around the world suggested that a \"Fae army, like the world has never seen since the dawn of Mab\" was gathering to attack SCP-001-A. Initially dismissed as mere rumors, this eventually led to the Foundation tripling security measures around Site-01 after numerous previously stationary Fae groups went on the move. Further research into this phenomenon remained pending at the time.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, research into SCP-001-C was officially approved. After months of analysis, it was officially confirmed that following sacrifices to SCP-001-C being done, the percent of Queen Mab's entire being existing in baseline reality did in fact seem to reduce from 5% to 4%, rendering all previous interpretations to be true.\n\n\n\nIn order to utilize the fact that SCP-001-C, presumed to be Queen Mab's sibling, was still alive and able to communicate, the following tests were undertaken.\n\n\n\n||~ INPUT ||~ OUTPUT||\n\n|| A singular red apple (//Malus domestica//), delivered to SCP-001-B through thaumaturgic rituals || No results ||\n\n|| A singular red apple (//Malus domestica//), delivered to SCP-001-B through a D-Class personnel || Three seconds following input, the following phrase was heard in the minds of all near Site-01 personnel: \"MORE\" ||\n\n|| A singular, already dead, dog (//Canis lupus familiaris//) || \"FRESH BLOOD\" ||\n\n|| A singular living dog (//Canis lupus familiaris//) || \"MORE\" ||\n\n|| A singular alive D-Class personnel || \"I AM THE CALL OF THE HEAVENS, BRINGING DOWN GIFTS OF INTELLECT TO THE MINDS OF THE WORTHY\" ||\n\n|| Repeat of the above || \"I FEND OFF THE EVILS OF DARKNESS AND FEAR, LURKING IN THE SHADOWS OF STARLIGHT\" ||\n\n|| Repeat of the above || \"I AM THE SENTRY, THE SHIELD AGAINST ALL THAT LIES WITHIN THE LAND OF DARKNESS\" ||\n\n|| Repeat of the above || No results ||\n\n|| Repeat of the above || No results ||\n\n|| Three alive D-Class personnel || \"MY POWER FADES LIKE STARLIGHT IN THE NIGHT MY SISTER IS, BUT IT STILL GRASPS INTO THIS REALM\" ||\n\n|| Repeat of the above ||\u00a0\u00a0\"BUT IT SHAN'T FOR MUCH LONGER, FOR THE SERVANT OF DEATH IS STRONG.

The ritual was nearing completion, with the portal approximated to contain individuals numbering in the thousands; a 2-hour window to prepare for the army's arrival was projected. When evacuation was ordered, the area around the building was almost immediately cut off via a thaumaturgic barrier. Numerous anti-magic apparatus set up around the Site did not appear to slow the ritual.\n\n\n\nA Site-wide alert was immediately called, with the entire Council immediately evacuated to the lower levels and appropriate personnel called to duty. A distress call to other Foundation Sites was attempted, but due to no such facilities existing within Poland, no aid was possible within the given time span. Site-01 staff began to prepare for the incoming attack, attempting to eavesdrop on the teleporting army's conversations, yielding the below result.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Foreword:** Due to high ritual instability, most of the intercepted and translated Fae dialogue is heavily corrupted.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n\n\n**[UNKNOWN 1]:** //[unintelligible]// I'm trying to say is that we //[unintelligible]// cannot allow them to bring //[unintelligible]// back, no matter the co--\n\n\n\n**[UNKNOWN 2]:** I //know// that, //[unintelligible]//; that doesn't mean we //[unintelligible]// can disobey **##green|her##**; this //[unintelligible]// insanity.

In the middle of the vortex, a portal black as night appears, sucking those present into it as more and more of them sob in pain, their transformations continuing. Seconds later, a number greater than what was originally standing in the hills falls into the forming hole as the portal leading to an [[[taboo|unknown place]]] closes, leaving [[[they-had-names|no one standing in front of SCP-001-A]]].

O5-4 is browsing them quickly, trying to read as much as he can. The other Council members and Maria Jones are visibly impatient, as if waiting for someone.//\n\n\n\n//Minutes later, the doors to the room open, revealing [ERROR].

The SCP Foundation was created with three goals in mind: to Secure the human population from Fae and SCP-1000 attacks, Contain the threat of Queen Mab and the gods of the ancient past, and Protect humanity from a Third Great Diaspora. The Foundation's motto would eventually be adapted from these goals.\n\n\n\nPrior to the 1870 summit, plans to integrate the numerous subgroups into one organization were passed among the leaders who would eventually comprise the original O5 Council. Only following that year's discovery that Queen Mab was still alive, however, prompted by research made due to the conclusion of the aforementioned war, was it officially signed. This single discovery proved that research alone wouldn't be enough to deal with the existential threats hanging above humanity, and that a containment policy limiting their spread would eventually become necessary.\n\n\n\nOn 29/12/1870, the SCP Foundation was officially created following approval from thirteen consenting parties, as proposed and later led by [ERROR], who gained the position of Administrator by unanimous decision.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\u00a0**O5-4:** We swore to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora when we banded together those forty years ago,[[footnote]] For full context regarding the founding of the SCP Foundation, refer to the summary available in the sidebox.

Espionage and betrayal amongst Foundation personnel has increased by almost 10%, with overall efficiency down by approximately 40% even two years after the event.\n\n\n\nThroughout the entirety of the post-Diaspora period a severe decrease in the mental stability of numerous Foundation staff, including Maria Jones and [ERROR], has been noted. The most notable case is the aforementioned Administrator, seen engaging in highly uncharacteristic behavior while denying any personal peculiarity. Examples included, but were not limited to:\n\n\n\n* erratic decisions without authorization from the rest of the Council;\n\n* visible obsession with the occult, despite little to no previous interest in such;\n\n* visible obsession with Fae history, despite little to no previous interest in such;\n\n* paranoia and trust issues;\n\n* patterns of talking to himself on seemingly nonsensical subjects.\n\n\n\nSaid behavior culminated on 30/12/1913 when [ERROR] disappeared, the only evidence left being the following note found on his desk:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n'It' had never been the Inventor.

Following a second appearance of such an error following the initial SCP-001-A exploration and the above event, it was decided that it was the effect of SCP-001-C and should be ignored to maintain documentation logic.\n\n\n\nDue to months of no contact with [ERROR] (likely the previous name for the Foundation's Administrator), as well as the nature of the above event, he was presumed dead.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 001-8:** Post-Incident Stabilization Attempts\n\n\n\nAs requested by the remaining members of Overwatch Command, now not limited by [ERROR]'s influence, further research into the consequences of the Third Diaspora revealed that despite the 85% of the previously existing Fae populace being murdered, the remaining 15% did not fade, instead forming communities within Nexuses and Free Ports around the globe. No contact with them was attempted at the time of discovery, for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\nFollowing the death of [ERROR] in unknown circumstances at the hands of SCP-001-C, the position of the Administrator remained vacant for a significant period of time; to properly deal with this problem as well as the consequences of the Third Diaspora following the death of its perpetrator, a meeting of the O5 Council was called. The following is its transcript, as provided by Maria Jones.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=o5-11.jpg|align=right|caption=O5-11, circa 1880.|width=280px]]\n\n\n\n**Date:** 25/07/1914\n\n\n\n**Parties Present:**\n\n* O5-1;\n\n* O5-2;\n\n* O5-3;\n\n* O5-4;\n\n* O5-5;\n\n* O5-8;\n\n* O5-11;\n\n* O5-13;\n\n* Maria Jones.\n\n\n\n**Foreword:** As, at the time of recording, the position of Administrator remained vacant, no supreme leadership over the Foundation was granted to any individual; despite this, the Council unanimously agreed a summit was necessary, without any outside pressure to attend.\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n\n\n//O5-11 enters into the now-fully renewed hall of the Council's meetings. Where once had been the damaged office of the now-deceased PoI-001-A is a room filled with Foundation maps, iconography, items of research, and contact apparatus. Among this can be seen a large wooden table with 13 seats, around which 8 visibly tired and saddened individuals are sitting. They are reading letters and other documents on the table. Eleven hurries to the table, clears his throat, and joins the remainder of the Council members in his seat.//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Apologies for the delay; Ontokinetics needed my assistance.

I'm an old man, Joseph. You can wage your little wars as much as you want -- but //I'm// only here to keep the destruction to a minimum.\n\n\n\n//Eleven tries to speak up, but decides against it. He sighs, and sits down, looking at the rest of the Council.//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** Anyone against?\n\n\n\n//No one reacts, silently looking on the ground.//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** So it's decided.\n\n\n\n//One stands up again, throwing the document he's been holding in his hands on the desk. O5-11 raises his eyebrow.//\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** And that is...?\n\n\n\n**O5-1:** The results of the Third Diaspora, in numbers.\n\n\n\n**O5-2:** {{I FAIL TO SEE HOW THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC OF OUR MEETING.}}\n\n\n\n**O5-1:** It's relevant, Two, because we have to admit to what we've done.\n\n\n\n**O5-2:** {{I BEG YOUR PARDON?}}\n\n\n\n**O5-1:** We need to fix what we've done, do you understand?

And I don't think they have Fairies in there.\n\n\n\n**O5-4:** There's been... rumors of one here in Poland, mostly Fae operated. '[[[SCP-5373|Esterberg]]]', it's supposedly called. My teams recover more and more records of it being a safe heaven for the anomalous, something like that. And there's always [[[nx-03|Hy-Brasil]]].\n\n\n\n**O5-1:** Is this... confirmed?\n\n\n\n//Four scratches his chin.//\n\n\n\n**O5-4:** As close as we can get with a rumor, I suppose. But... establishing a Site wouldn't hurt anyone there. We needed one in Poland anyways. //<turning towards Eleven:>// Hasn't [[[SCP-5292|Hannah Rivera been keen on making one recently]]]?\n\n\n\n**O5-11:** She... She has, yes.\n\n\n\n**O5-4:**\u00a0\u00a0So, what's the problem?\n\n\n\n**O5-2:** {{WE CANNOT JUST ALLOW THINGS TO CHANGE IMMEDIATELY. IT WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS, AND PERSONNEL WOULD REBEL.

Let's send her there, and if she finds something, only then let's allow her Site to happen. It would be... what, our one-hundred-twentieth?\n\n\n\n//Four smiles.//\n\n\n\n**O5-4:** And then, once she finds that Esterberg, let's start slowly, until we can fix things. But it will need time.

All Foundation resources are made available to ensure the procedure's proper maintenance.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nFollowing the unanimous passing of the proposal, making amends with the Fae populace has officially started. However, to ensure the continued compliance of Foundation personnel and to not precipitate any resignations due to drastic policy changes, the full process was projected to take over 70 years to complete. Calculations by O5-2 determined that the best way to integrate Fae and SCP-1000 cultures into human societies and structures, allowing for [[[i-did-not-fade|peaceful and harmonious coexistence would be gradual and small changes, eventually leading to total integration]]] and, perhaps, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500/offset/11 removal of the Foundation as a factor altogether]. This process began with the founding of Site-120 to oversee Esterberg, the Free Port of Cz\u0119stochowa.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite these changes being attempted and, over time, amplified, not all anomalous societies have shown support, with some going as far as violence to oppose them. The most active was and remains to this day GoI-120 (\"Triumvirat\u00e9\"[[footnote]] A corruption of the root Fae word \"Tr\u00e6m\u0301veraty,\" meaning \"we will prevail.\" [[/footnote]]), formed amongst the chaos that ensued following the Factory Purge -- as the Third Diaspora was later called -- by the followers of Mab which remained after their slaughter. On the day of its inception, theorized to be within two weeks of 13/08/1911, the original date of the Third Diaspora, the group sent out a message to all Site-01 personnel which resulted in their discovery. A transcript of the message, translated from Fae and without the memetic triggers the original possessed, is available below.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nIt's quite funny, seeing your organization and the little Council managing it believing itself to be in control.\n\n\n\nWe've seen that attitude ever since we formed in the bowels of the Earths all those hundreds of thousands of years ago -- hubris, that's what we called it. Hubris was the downfall of everything you've built, and ever will build. We'd say we're the bringers of that exact same event, only in recent days, but that would only be half the truth -- as for you, we are also the harbingers of your inevitable and painful deaths.\n\n\n\nThere's a certain irony to your situation, but we'll let you figure it out yourselves; it will be quite fun to watch you realize the obvious truth before you. But even then, none of this truly matters -- we are growing in numbers, and we are growing fast. The Third Diaspora left more of us than you thought, and you'll soon find it out the hard way.\n\n\n\nUntil then, we will be patiently waiting.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nDespite the actions undertaken as a result of Directive Alpha/1911, the threat posed by Queen Mab remained extant. To counter this, a consensus between the Foundation and SCP-001-C was attempted. Despite [ERROR]'s (the entity's prior host) death, the lack of ease in contact with it as a result of the event, and ethical concerns, following numerous days of debate among the Council and approval from O5-11, it was decided that Procedure 001-Corpus needed to be maintained at all costs. As a result of that decision, it was agreed that exactly 13 live humans would be delivered to SCP-001-C on a weekly basis. To cause the least damage to the Foundation via this process, the usage of [[[SCP-2000|Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR)]]] to form the individuals required for the procedure was unanimously authorized.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite this, numerous Foundation personnel were found dissatisfied over the ethics of this method as well as the overall ethics of working with a deity. In response, the following message was sent by O5-1 to all Foundation personnel with knowledge of the procedure:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nIn recent days, my office and I have been approached by anonymous complaints regarding the... ethicality of Procedure 001-Corpus, going so far as to ask \"where was the Ethics Committee\" when we approved it. Whilst those complaints are of course understandable given the situation, I need to clear something up: we are not giving a god what it wants. We're merely making sure the sister of said god doesn't massacre us. And giving that bastard corpses is frankly the only thing we can do.\n\n\n\nWe can't fix the past. But we just might be able to make the future a little brighter. And to do that, we cannot allow Mab to repeat what we've done, slaughtering the world for the Fourth Time. And the only way to make sure that doesn't happen is Procedure 001-Corpus.\n\n\n\nKnow I say this with a heavy heart -- but the ritual remains as it is. It simply must.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n//-- O5-1, current Administrator of the SCP Foundation//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nWith current information, it is believed that the total fulfillment of the Foundation's new subdirective will be possible by approximately 1980, with containment of PoI-001-C being indefinitely sustainable.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++++ **[END OF FILE]**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++++\u00a0\u00a0**ONE (1) FILE UPDATE AVAILABLE.

At the ending of his shift he entered into the room, despite claiming to have possessed no will to find it -- further research revealed that this was due to the cleanup crew's leadership forgetting to relay the anti-SCP-001-C influence pills which each team member is required to take daily.\n\n\n\nDespite successfully entering into SCP-001-B, Majer was able to escape the room due to a sudden awakening of previously dormant ontokinetic abilities, effectively becoming the first recorded person able to leave unaffected.
