All containment efforts are to be focused towards a Grade 3 <em>Omission</em> cover-up, coupled with the discouragement or sabotage of exploration and research missions that attempt to study cis-Mercurian space and orbits that go through it.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-179 is a humanoid entity located at a constant distance of approximately 40,000\u00a0km from the South polar region of the solar photosphere, locked to the rotation axis of Sol. However, it does not orbit it; the most recent recordings of SCP-179 indicate that it seems to maintain a continuous orbit around the center of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Through the combined effort of 43 years of continuous surveying, the external appearance of SCP-179 has been defined as a human female of undetermined ethnic group of between twenty and forty years of age. Its entire bodily surface is covered in or composed of a matte black material. Its hair appears to be composed of this material, measures over 34\u00a0km long and is constantly pushed away by solar wind. However, this part of SCP-179 seems to reflect variable amounts of sunlight \u2014 this reflection being the phenomenon that indicated its existence to Foundation astrophysicists during 1940. Several markings or tattoos are placed throughout its bodily midline. Judging from their brightness, these markings might be of metallic composition and of a golden hue.</p>\n<p>These tattoos include several symbols that have been identified as those typically representing the Sun and the six innermost planets of the Solar System according to medieval alchemy, including, in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The symbol of gold in the subject's forehead, right underneath the hair line.</li>\n<li>The symbol of mercury under the nose, circling both lips.</li>\n<li>The symbol of copper between the medial ends of its clavicles.</li>\n<li>[DATA EXPUNGED - AUTOCENSOR LEVEL SC 4 - NON-TRIVIAL COGNITOHAZARD DETECTED] with the anatomically correct shape of a human heart placed over the location where a heart would be in a female human of the same apparent age and bodily proportions.</li>\n<li>The symbol of iron in the upper abdominal region.</li>\n<li>The symbol of tin in the lower abdominal region.</li>\n<li>Part of a final symbol in the pelvic region. While the anatomy of this region makes its clear observation difficult, it has been hypothesized that the symbol of lead is also present and complete in the perineum region.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-179 keeps its ventral side oriented towards Earth most of the time, but it has been observed to look towards other areas on occasion.

Only one instance of SCP-179 communication with Foundation personnel has occurred thus far, where SCP-179 proved to be fluent in French. As this contact did not result in a clear statement of SCP-179's intentions towards the Foundation and its mission, all efforts must be made to prevent contact by any known Groups of Interest with SCP-179. Misinformation operations and other preemptive measures have been deployed.</p>\n<p>Most recorded movements performed by SCP-179 have been related to extraterrestrial threats, both anomalous or non-anomalous in nature, on a collision or orbital insertion course with the Earth. These threatening items have been identified as capable of causing CK-Class Reconfiguration events of diverse impact on human societies and earthly life in general if allowed to reach Earth. If impact with Earth or orbital insertion occurs without proper response and containment by Foundation operatives, these items of interest may be capable of causing XK-Class end-of-the-world scenarios.</p>\n<p>SCP-179 will usually address an item or items of interest by pointing at them with an arm and, when more than one item of interest is present, will be able to generate additional limbs anatomically identical to its arms, as needed. Survey data indicates that SCP-179 performs other motions specific to each item of interest addressed \u2014 such as raising different fingers or moving its arms in an array of as of yet undecipherable patterns at fixed intervals \u2014, but whether these motions contain any information or not has not been determined to date.</p>\n<p>The limits of SCP-179's detection capacities have not been clearly ascertained. While SCP-179 has been able to detect potentially harmful objects beyond the trans-Neptunian region, those threats had been detected by other surveillance and exploration systems (usually under Foundation control) or, in at least three separate instances, were visible to the naked eye from Earth. However, they had not been immediately recognized as threats. It has been hypothesized that SCP-179 may only detect and react to active threats that remain detectable to other observing parties without the cis-Neptunian region, while being able to unerringly determine their harmful nature. All items of interest approaching Earth within cis-Neptunian space that had considerable destructive capacity have been detected by SCP-179 without failure, often when no observers known to the Foundation were aware of them.</p>\n<p>As such, SCP-179 and all personnel, orbital equipment and facilities dedicated to its surveillance remain the most reliable early warning system the Foundation possesses to detect and, when possible, prevent, potentially dangerous incursions within surveyed space. SCP-179 is able to determine which interplanetary objects pose a threat to Earth, humankind or the earthly biosphere, which makes it a critical asset for the Composite Orbital Early Warning System (COEWS) project of the Foundation, which currently involves SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, XCPOA-003 to -042<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, Site-34, Site-103, Site-98, Area-08, Site-\u2588\u2588, Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588, \u2588 and \u2588 and Command Site-\u2588\u2588, as well as several personnel embedded within different space agencies and international consortia related to space exploration. All data of interest related to or obtained through SCP-179 will be marked COEWS-179, which will be considered high priority information to all Foundation departments.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-179-01: Notable Movements of SCP-179.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&lt;13/12/1940&gt;</strong> First recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity, that had remained with both arms crossed, raises an arm towards a previously undetected interplanetary object on a collision course with Earth. After its impact, in an event that damaged the city of [DATA EXPUNGED] extensively with large quantities of an anomalous mucous secretion and left more than one thousand and three hundred dead which, combined with the anomalous phenomena related to [REDACTED AS PER PREVIOUS EXPUNGEMENT] Remaining central item reclassified SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-179 returned to its original position.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;22/09/1942&gt;</strong> Sixth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards [REDACTED], on a collision course with Earth. Item of interest crashes nearby Auckland, New Zealand, on 04/10/1942. Item separates upon impact into several devices of mechanical nature. [DATA EXPUNGED] recently formed sub-entities with minimal civilian casualties. Once Foundation operatives contain the item proper, which is reclassified [REDACTED] and terminating most sub-entities, SCP-179 returns to its original position. Mobile Task Forces [REDACTED, ALL DATA ON INVOLVED ASSETS EXPUNGED FROM RECORDS] proceeds to track and destroy all remaining sub-entities.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588&gt;</strong> Eighteenth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises its right arm towards [DATA EXPUNGED]. Up to this date, the entity has kept one of its primary arms \u2014 shifting from one to the other as necessary \u2014 pointing in the same direction.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;01/03/1949&gt;</strong> 23<sup>rd</sup> recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards an Amor-class asteroid, that has adopted a collision course with Earth. The Foundation uses a combination of several SCP objects to launch a remote-controlled interplanetary vehicle that acts as a gravitatory towline; this mission is announced a success on 03/05/1951; at this time, SCP-179 returns to its original position. <em><strong>Note:</strong> Surveying elements observed that the entity performed a motion that could have been a nod. Reclassification request to Euclid status filed and denied.</em></li>\n<li><strong>&lt;13/12/1998&gt;</strong> 403<sup>rd</sup> recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity stops watching the Earth for two days and thirteen hours, when it looks towards the Jovian system. Once this interval is over, SCP-179 looks at Earth again.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;09/09/2002&gt;</strong> 487<sup>th</sup> recorded movement of SCP-179. SCP-179 points at an armed Type-11 Dimensional Weapon [FURTHER DATA ON XCP-11-DW EXPUNGED AS PER 05-11 EXECUTIVE COMMAND] launched from Area-08 to test SCP-179's detection capacities. Item remains in a primed configuration for \u2588\u2588 minutes, ready to be launched at a test location on Earth. It is not identified by SCP-179 until it is 3,670 kilometers above the Earth's surface, when SCP-179 reacts to it as a threat and points at it. Device subsequently reconfigured to a stand-by configuration and redirected towards its primary target, [DATA EXPUNGED] still in transit from the Kuiper Belt. SCP-179 returns to its previous position.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;16/10/2003&gt;</strong> Contact with SCP-179 is achieved via the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe. Subsequent movements registered in Addendum SCP-179-02. SCP-179 reclassified Thaumiel. See Addendum SCP-179-02.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-179-02: Events of 16/10/2003.</strong></p>\n<p>SCP-179 was first approached by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe, a microsatellite equipped with multiple recording, analysis and communications devices incorporated into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe in a clandestine operation. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe acted as a relay for the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe and Foundation Mission Control.</p>\n<p>Contact and communication with the entity were not foreseen nor programmed. When visual contact with SCP-179 was established (obtaining an unprecedentedly clear, very high resolution image of its surface), the entity begins to move its lips, forming the phonemes of a greeting in spoken French. What follows is a complete translation of the exchange.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:34:23&gt;:</strong> Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:39:38&gt;:</strong> I'm the lookout.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:42:38&gt;:</strong> My name is Sauelsuesor. Do you like my brother? I like him too. He is big, so big.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:43:01&gt;:</strong> And so very warm.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:43:11&gt;:</strong> If you want to talk to me, please use your satellite to weave-talk to me. It'll be easier than coming here. Probably. (Entity remains immobile until &lt;17:55:53&gt;)</p>\n<p>(Researchers assigned to SCP-179 detect this movement. Level 3 Researcher Tomas Graham, who is fluent in French, is selected by Head Researcher [REDACTED] to conduct a possible exchange with SCP-179. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe is used as a radio relay from this point onward; SCP-179 is able to receive, understand and transmit radio communications. SCP-179's transmissions read as a monotone, featureless human voice that speaks in French. The subsequent exchange occurs with a 16 minutes and 39.6 seconds delay between each message, corresponding to the distance between SCP-179 and Earth and return, that will be omitted in the rest of this document.)</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> Who are you?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> My name is Sauelsuesor. I am the lookout. I behold. I often see. I often warn. Almost always, when I have to. That way, there is further life.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> What do you mean, the \"lookout\"?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> It's me. (smiles)</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> We have noticed the significance of your movements. Who do you report to?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> To those who know where to look. To you. To those who want to look. Not just you.

All containment efforts are to be focused towards a Grade 3 //Omission// cover-up, coupled with the discouragement or sabotage of exploration and research missions that attempt to study cis-Mercurian space and orbits that go through it.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-179 is a humanoid entity located at a constant distance of approximately 40,000 km from the South polar region of the solar photosphere, locked to the rotation axis of Sol. However, it does not orbit it; the most recent recordings of SCP-179 indicate that it seems to maintain a continuous orbit around the center of the galaxy.\n\n\n\nThrough the combined effort of 43 years of continuous surveying, the external appearance of SCP-179 has been defined as a human female of undetermined ethnic group of between twenty and forty years of age. Its entire bodily surface is covered in or composed of a matte black material. Its hair appears to be composed of this material, measures over 34 km long and is constantly pushed away by solar wind. However, this part of SCP-179 seems to reflect variable amounts of sunlight -- this reflection being the phenomenon that indicated its existence to Foundation astrophysicists during 1940. Several markings or tattoos are placed throughout its bodily midline. Judging from their brightness, these markings might be of metallic composition and of a golden hue. \n\n\n\nThese tattoos include several symbols that have been identified as those typically representing the Sun and the six innermost planets of the Solar System according to medieval alchemy, including, in this order:\n\n* The symbol of gold in the subject's forehead, right underneath the hair line.\n\n* The symbol of mercury under the nose, circling both lips.\n\n* The symbol of copper between the medial ends of its clavicles.\n\n* [DATA EXPUNGED - AUTOCENSOR LEVEL SC 4 - NON-TRIVIAL COGNITOHAZARD DETECTED] with the anatomically correct shape of a human heart placed over the location where a heart would be in a female human of the same apparent age and bodily proportions.\n\n* The symbol of iron in the upper abdominal region.\n\n* The symbol of tin in the lower abdominal region.\n\n* Part of a final symbol in the pelvic region. While the anatomy of this region makes its clear observation difficult, it has been hypothesized that the symbol of lead is also present and complete in the perineum region.\n\n\n\nSCP-179 keeps its ventral side oriented towards Earth most of the time, but it has been observed to look towards other areas on occasion.

All involved personnel with a clearance level below 4/179 will be either promoted or reassigned to fit this new classification, depending on their relevance for the continuated surveillance and cover-up operations as directed by the current Head Researcher for SCP-179. All reassigned personnel will be subject to POLYMATH-08 Memory Redaction Therapy or D-class amnestics (in a high dosage grade, with a maximum retrograde effect of ten years of experience), depending on the time spent working in SCP-179 prior to its reclassification.\n\n\n\nSCP-179's existence will be subject to an //Orbital Misinformation Standardized Intelligence Obstruction and Neutralization// campaign. As per //Omission// Protocol 4 (items 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7), most documentation related to SCP-179 has been classified Level 4 (Top Secret). Any further data related to SCP-179 has been classified Level 5 (Thaumiel), and will be made available only to authorized 5/179 personnel. \n\n\n\n**BE ADVISED THAT:** Unauthorized access to SCP-179 research materials will be considered a Type-3-B offense (Unauthorized Data Management While Lacking Appropriate Global Clearance), punishable by compulsory memory redaction therapy with immediate reassignment and/or demotion. \n\n[[/==]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"++ WARNING! UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WILL BE EXPOSED TO A MEMETIC DEFENSE AGENT\" hide=\"-- GENERATING MEMETIC DEFENSE - GESTALT ABRADER ACTIVE\"]] \n\n\u00a0\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[image SCP-AN-ME-993.png width=\"600px\"]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\u00a0\n\nSCP-179 is sensitive to all radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, intelligent and able to communicate through multiple anomalous means, including but not limited to radio and laser communications interference. Only one instance of SCP-179 communication with Foundation personnel has occurred thus far, where SCP-179 proved to be fluent in French. As this contact did not result in a clear statement of SCP-179's intentions towards the Foundation and its mission, all efforts must be made to prevent contact by any known Groups of Interest with SCP-179. Misinformation operations and other preemptive measures have been deployed.\n\n\n\nMost recorded movements performed by SCP-179 have been related to extraterrestrial threats, both anomalous or non-anomalous in nature, on a collision or orbital insertion course with the Earth. These threatening items have been identified as capable of causing CK-Class Reconfiguration events of diverse impact on human societies and earthly life in general if allowed to reach Earth. If impact with Earth or orbital insertion occurs without proper response and containment by Foundation operatives, these items of interest may be capable of causing XK-Class end-of-the-world scenarios. \n\n\n\nSCP-179 will usually address an item or items of interest by pointing at them with an arm and, when more than one item of interest is present, will be able to generate additional limbs anatomically identical to its arms, as needed. Survey data indicates that SCP-179 performs other motions specific to each item of interest addressed -- such as raising different fingers or moving its arms in an array of as of yet undecipherable patterns at fixed intervals --, but whether these motions contain any information or not has not been determined to date.\n\n\n\nThe limits of SCP-179's detection capacities have not been clearly ascertained. While SCP-179 has been able to detect potentially harmful objects beyond the trans-Neptunian region, those threats had been detected by other surveillance and exploration systems (usually under Foundation control) or, in at least three separate instances, were visible to the naked eye from Earth. However, they had not been immediately recognized as threats. It has been hypothesized that SCP-179 may only detect and react to active threats that remain detectable to other observing parties without the cis-Neptunian region, while being able to unerringly determine their harmful nature. All items of interest approaching Earth within cis-Neptunian space that had considerable destructive capacity have been detected by SCP-179 without failure, often when no observers known to the Foundation were aware of them.\n\n\n\nAs such, SCP-179 and all personnel, orbital equipment and facilities dedicated to its surveillance remain the most reliable early warning system the Foundation possesses to detect and, when possible, prevent, potentially dangerous incursions within surveyed space. SCP-179 is able to determine which interplanetary objects pose a threat to Earth, humankind or the earthly biosphere, which makes it a critical asset for the Composite Orbital Early Warning System (COEWS) project of the Foundation, which currently involves SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, XCPOA-003 to -042[[footnote]]Experimental Foundation Orbital Assets (XCPOA).[[/footnote]], Site-34, Site-103, Site-98, Area-08, Site-\u2588\u2588, Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588, \u2588 and \u2588 and Command Site-\u2588\u2588, as well as several personnel embedded within different space agencies and international consortia related to space exploration. All data of interest related to or obtained through SCP-179 will be marked COEWS-179, which will be considered high priority information to all Foundation departments.\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-179-01: Notable Movements of SCP-179.**\n\n* **<13/12/1940>** First recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity, that had remained with both arms crossed, raises an arm towards a previously undetected interplanetary object on a collision course with Earth. After its impact, in an event that damaged the city of [DATA EXPUNGED] extensively with large quantities of an anomalous mucous secretion and left more than one thousand and three hundred dead which, combined with the anomalous phenomena related to [REDACTED AS PER PREVIOUS EXPUNGEMENT] Remaining central item reclassified SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-179 returned to its original position. \n\n* **<22/09/1942>** Sixth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards [REDACTED], on a collision course with Earth. Item of interest crashes nearby Auckland, New Zealand, on 04/10/1942. Item separates upon impact into several devices of mechanical nature. [DATA EXPUNGED] recently formed sub-entities with minimal civilian casualties. Once Foundation operatives contain the item proper, which is reclassified [REDACTED] and terminating most sub-entities, SCP-179 returns to its original position. Mobile Task Forces [REDACTED, ALL DATA ON INVOLVED ASSETS EXPUNGED FROM RECORDS] proceeds to track and destroy all remaining sub-entities. \n\n* **<\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588>** Eighteenth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises its right arm towards [DATA EXPUNGED]. Up to this date, the entity has kept one of its primary arms -- shifting from one to the other as necessary -- pointing in the same direction. \n\n* **<01/03/1949>** 23^^rd^^ recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards an Amor-class asteroid, that has adopted a collision course with Earth. The Foundation uses a combination of several SCP objects to launch a remote-controlled interplanetary vehicle that acts as a gravitatory towline; this mission is announced a success on 03/05/1951; at this time, SCP-179 returns to its original position. //**Note:** Surveying elements observed that the entity performed a motion that could have been a nod. Reclassification request to Euclid status filed and denied.//\n\n* **<13/12/1998>** 403^^rd^^ recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity stops watching the Earth for two days and thirteen hours, when it looks towards the Jovian system. Once this interval is over, SCP-179 looks at Earth again.\n\n* **<09/09/2002>** 487^^th^^ recorded movement of SCP-179. SCP-179 points at an armed Type-11 Dimensional Weapon [FURTHER DATA ON XCP-11-DW EXPUNGED AS PER 05-11 EXECUTIVE COMMAND] launched from Area-08 to test SCP-179's detection capacities. Item remains in a primed configuration for \u2588\u2588 minutes, ready to be launched at a test location on Earth. It is not identified by SCP-179 until it is 3,670 kilometers above the Earth's surface, when SCP-179 reacts to it as a threat and points at it. Device subsequently reconfigured to a stand-by configuration and redirected towards its primary target, [DATA EXPUNGED] still in transit from the Kuiper Belt. SCP-179 returns to its previous position.\n\n* **<16/10/2003>** Contact with SCP-179 is achieved via the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe. Subsequent movements registered in Addendum SCP-179-02. SCP-179 reclassified Thaumiel. See Addendum SCP-179-02.\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-179-02: Events of 16/10/2003.**\n\n\n\nSCP-179 was first approached by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe, a microsatellite equipped with multiple recording, analysis and communications devices incorporated into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe in a clandestine operation. The\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe acted as a relay for the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe and Foundation Mission Control.\n\n\n\nContact and communication with the entity were not foreseen nor programmed. When visual contact with SCP-179 was established (obtaining an unprecedentedly clear, very high resolution image of its surface), the entity begins to move its lips, forming the phonemes of a greeting in spoken French. What follows is a complete translation of the exchange. \n\n\n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:34:23>:** Hello. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:39:38>:** I'm the lookout. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:42:38>:** My name is Sauelsuesor. Do you like my brother? I like him too. He is big, so big. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:43:01>:** And so very warm. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:43:11>:** If you want to talk to me, please use your satellite to weave-talk to me. It'll be easier than coming here. Probably. (Entity remains immobile until <17:55:53>)\n\n> \n\n> (Researchers assigned to SCP-179 detect this movement. Level 3 Researcher Tomas Graham, who is fluent in French, is selected by Head Researcher [REDACTED] to conduct a possible exchange with SCP-179. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe is used as a radio relay from this point onward; SCP-179 is able to receive, understand and transmit radio communications. SCP-179's transmissions read as a monotone, featureless human voice that speaks in French. The subsequent exchange occurs with a 16 minutes and 39.6 seconds delay between each message, corresponding to the distance between SCP-179 and Earth and return, that will be omitted in the rest of this document.)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** Who are you?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** My name is Sauelsuesor.

(smiles)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** We have noticed the significance of your movements. Who do you report to?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** To those who know where to look. To you. To those who want to look. Not just you. But you, too.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** When you say brother, are you referring to the Sun?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** He is my brother, Sauel. He warms me up. He is caring fire and loving light. He caresses me with his arcs and his voice and renews me. He is the source of all true light. He is your source.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** Where do you come from?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I was born a child. (the entity nods towards Earth.)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** For how long have you been in your current location?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I do not want to tell you.

Sharing all the information you have, not just about the dangerous threats against humankind and Earth, could be of great benefit to all parts involved.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I am too big, and you are too small. There is a sea of nothing and islands of light. I am their shore. To you\u00a0\u00a0come the monsters. The pounding fists of void. The longing gods beyond our knowledge. I am the lookout. I see the ripples in their wake. You want me to pledge my sight-know to you, only to you, so you, only you, can be greater. Even if you find, restrain, defend. You want me to be yours. That is not why I am here. There are others. Others I assist. Others I warn. Others beyond your thin walls of grey, dry paste-rock. Others beyond the reach of your weary satellites. Others beyond the home, our home. Others I know. Others I love. Others you won't care for. Others that came before.

Due to the subject's poor health, a maintenance crew must monitor the subject all day and should immediately respond to any health problems observed. In this case, anyone approaching the subject must have a Cognition Resistance Viability (CRV) over 3.0.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the terminal research for the subject's psychoanalysis, Dr Grace \"Noraemine\" Choi volunteered for the overall nursing and hollow-attachment formation. However, if the subject emits a cognitohazard over 5.0, she must be replaced with an antimeme-trained caretaker.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1953-KO is a one-month-old (at the time of the writing of this document) female child whose parts of her body (especially the ears and near the tailbone) resemble that of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes).</p>\n<p>In addition to human ears, the subject possesses pointy ears and a tail covered thinly with fur, both those of a fox. Moreover, various parts of her body are damaged due to the poor environment during her birth. Most notably, her right pinky and ring finger, left leg below the calf, human right ear's earlobe, and eyes are missing.</p>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO sporadically emits powerful cognitohazards. In most cases, the hazard will inflict hunger, anxiety, interest in various stimuli, and a craving for affection in nearby people. Like most infants, the subject has not reached cognition, and most of her actions are merely a reflex. Therefore, the cognitohazard effects are primitive and irregular. This seems to be a direct reflection of her mental state on cognitohazardous methods.</p>\n<p>The subject displayed poor health since her discovery, in addition to an unstable mental state due to a long separation from her parents. The compromised mental state, especially, combined with her cognitohazardous characteristics, can have dire consequences. Therefore, temporary caretakers are employed for the speedy recovery and mental stability of the subject.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Discovery</span></h3>\n<p>Evidence of SCP-1953-KO's existence was found while Dr Noe Sujong of the Muism Department collected data about ancient Muist instances in the Korean peninsula. Many pieces of data pointed to multiple paranormal instances involving psycho and cognitohazards along with cannibalism, which happened in the mountain ranges of Gwacheon-Hyeon, Gyeonggi-do, in the mid-Joseon dynasty.</p>\n<p>In response, Dr Noe Sujong and Dr Grace Choi of the Korea Regional Command were dispatched for investigation. They soon discovered a strong Muist seal in a mountain utilising Bagua signs, which the Igumwi commonly used. The team discovered that the seal adds a strong space-time momentum, greatly slowing time.</p>\n<p>Dr Grace was permitted to unlock the seal, as the expedition team had ample Muist response measures and an MTF team.</p>\n<p>She then discovered SCP-1953-KO in a coma, lying in the cave.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<h4 id=\"toc1\"><span>Dr Grace's personal journal</span></h4>\n<hr/>\n<p>The inside was literally in shambles.</p>\n<p>The stench of blood, rotting flesh, and burnt ashes filled the cave. Human bones amounting to about tens of people, some still with flesh on them, piled up like mountains, and the walls were charred black here and there.</p>\n<p>Five hundred years passed outside, but time flowed much slower inside, so the corpses were still decaying. Several everyday items of that period (like combs, wooden clogs, and coins), half-burnt human bodies, and a trace of a fire pit were in the cave.</p>\n<p>On the ash pile next to the fire pit were two dead infants just born. I couldn't determine if the cave dweller ate them or didn't in hesitation. The bodies were so heavily damaged and charred that I could barely figure out what they used to look like. One of them had body parts that resembled a beast than a human. Next to the bodies were charred placentas stuck to the ground and traces of the ash pile being dug up. It seems like where the third baby lay, judging from the shape of the crater. My gut instinct told me that the person who sealed this place must have taken the still-living child.</p>\n<p>It was then I noticed the child with tails and animal ears panting. Her breath was too faint for most people to notice. She must have been in a critical condition. I utilised every method I could to save her life. She received first aid in the ambulance. The hardest part was over. She was still unconscious, but her resilience was astounding.</p>\n<p>Despite Dr Noe Sujong's opposition, I returned to Site-01K, holding my kin in my arms. The medical department told me that she wouldn't last a day, but she had strength. Parts of her body were damaged beyond recovery, but she became healthy over time. She even regained consciousness again shortly before.</p>\n<p>Many people in Site-01K are amazed and inspired by her will to live. I hope she keeps it to the end.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span>Abstract for Anomalous Entity Longitudinal Research Plan</span></h3>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Proposed by:</strong> Dr Yun Geumseon, Site-01K Analytic Psychology Department</p>\n<p><strong>Approved by:</strong> Kim Jeonghoe, SCP Foundation Korea Regional Command Administrative Director</p>\n<p><strong>Attendees:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research of entity's developmental psychology: Dr Yun Geumseon, Analytic Psychology Dep.</li>\n<li>Research of entity's anomalous interactions: Dr Chiika, Anomalous Entity Cooperation Dep.</li>\n<li>Nursing and healthcare of the entity: Dr Grace \"Noraemine\" Choi<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In light of the discovery of an unusually young humanoid entity, the SCP Foundation Korea Regional Command applied the previously planned longitudinal study<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> for anomalous entities' psyche on SCP-1953-KO.</p>\n<p><strong>Contents:</strong> This research will study how SCP-1953-KO - under regular care by a caretaker - as an individual recognises and controls her anomaly and what developmental psychological changes arise in the process, following the lead of Site-01K Developmental Psychology Department and Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Dr Grace is in charge of overall containment.

Hence, there is no research done on how the anomaly affects the pre-pubertal human psyche, how the entity finds a way to control it, or how it collapses from the lack of control.</p>\n<p>It's hard to study pre-pubertal anomalies because they usually fall into two categories. First, the anomaly did not develop enough to be noticeable. Second, the entity is born with powerful anomalous traits, inflicting critical damage on people around them, resulting in the instance's early death.</p>\n<p>However, SCP-1953-KO is one of the rare cases discovered in infants. With proper care, she can answer our questions as she grows.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\u2014 Dr Yun Geumseon, Analytical Psychology Department</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>1953-KO Research Log 1</span></h3>\n<p>The following documents are hand-written research logs from Dr Grace about SCP-1953-KO's developments during its longitudinal study. The log covers her regaining consciousness to 12 months after birth.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>It's been a week since SCP-1953-KO regained consciousness. She stays mostly inactive in the incubator, but her basic reflexes, like the grasping and sucking reflex and turning her head in response to external stimuli, were intact. The scars on her body haven't healed completely yet, but they've improved significantly.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO recovered a lot, so she was taken out of the incubator. At first, she couldn't adapt to the sudden change in environment, crying frequently and being stressed. For basic hollow affection, SCP-1953-KO was given a stuffed doll, and visits from the caretaker (i.e. Me) became more frequent. After the affection was formed, her heart rate and mental state stabilised.<br/>\nHowever, she grew anxious when I wasn't with her. I should see her more often to deal with it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO started to crawl and babble. With her one eye, seven fingers, and one leg, she sees and ventures the world.<br/>\nBefore, she needed my help to sit. Now, she can sit on her own and starts to grab and put stuff into her mouth. Whenever I'm looking away from her, she's sucking on my pen, hiding in that small containment chamber, or drooling on my clothes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO sporadically emits cognitohazards. This is done reflexively and unconsciously. Most likely, she delivers her raw emotions or projects the incomplete worldview she constructed to other people. It was frustrating to be affected by them, but it was a helpful experience to see the world in an infant's eyes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO starts to stand alone. I asked for a prosthetic leg for SCP-1953-KO. It can't be comfortable for her, but she can now stand with two legs when she's holding my hand.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>1953-KO developed object permeance. This is two weeks faster than the average child.</p>\n<p>Object permeance is to know an object still exists, even when it's out of sight. When their mother is out of sight, infants without object permeance will think that their mom is dead and will never come back, hence the crying. However, with it, they will believe their mom is not dead and will return, even when she's out of sight.</p>\n<p>Now, the kid doesn't cry like before when I'm not with her. Now, I feel a hair less worried when I leave the containment chamber.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Today's cognitohazard emitted by SCP-1953-KO was the strongest. Luckily, I only suffered minor consequences: some nosebleed, that's all. It's nothing. 1953-KO was sent to a temporary caretaker as per the protocols, but I heard she kept crying and looking for me. I felt oddly proud.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Today, 1953-KO called my 'mommy' - which I denied. Though, what will a kid just born know?</p>\n<p>A mother is the first other. The fact that she called me mommy means that she started to distinguish herself and me. I.e., she developed sentience.</p>\n<p>The team decided to let her think I was her mom until her sentience was consolidated and she recognised surrounding objects and concepts.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>Follow-up research regarding SCP-1953-KO</span></h3>\n<p>On 27/06/2021, Dr Noe Sujong discovered a document written by the philologist, Professor Jang Hayeong containing information about <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-953\">SCP-953</a> and her child. According to the literature, SCP-953 is a demon fox that lived in ancient Korea, staying alive for at least 1500 years, sustaining herself by cannibalism and EVE draining, accumulating shamanistic energy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, information about SCP-953's child was found. The person is PoI-DH-001 \"Hoya\", who was involved in a conflict against Foundation agents during document retrieval. She is currently the head of the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/dinodon-s-hand\">\"Dinodon's hand\"</a>, the Korean branch of the GoI Serpent's Hand. The subject is seen to possess a personality and anomalous traits similar to SCP-953.</p>\n<p>The document contained detailed information about a location presumed to be SCP-953's last habitat. The location matched that of the cave excavated by Dr Noe Sujong and Dr Grace.</p>\n<p>Such circumstances suggest that SCP-1953-KO is the child of SCP-953 and, moreover, the sister of PoI-DH-001 \"Hoya\".</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc5\"><span>1953-KO Research Log 2</span></h3>\n<p>The log covers 12 to 24 months after birth.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>SCP-1953-KO's tail grew pretty fluffy, as did its ears. That's right. I was forgetting this, but SCP-1953-KO is a demon fox. But the discrepancy between this kid and the other one at Site-17\u2026 makes it hard to believe that the two are the same species. Would 1953-KO turn out to be like her when she grows up? Or will she become the Foundation's child raised by us?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The kid can now play on her own. She was a bit slower than others because of the prosthetics, but her adaptation is outstanding. Moreover, she's become quite active, moving around inside the containment chamber. She loves to play with the toys we provide. 1953-KO seems to prefer the yellow ones.<br/>\nIn addition, the inner walls of the chamber were covered with a softer lining to compensate for her increased activity.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>We now gave 1953-KO some children's storybooks. She focuses on the book when I slowly read it to her. She also tries to mimic some simple words that I say. Now she can understand and say words like \"yes\", \"no\", \"mom\", \"What?\", \"Who\" and \"Where?\". Being the curious child she is, she points out almost everything in the book and asks what it is. Well, it was natural of her to do so - she'd never seen them before.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>An aspiring artist, 1953 is. She used up all the crayons we gave her in two days. The inner walls of the chamber make you wonder if this is a baby's room or an AWCY exhibition.<br/>\nWe were going to replace the dirty bed sheets and lining anyway, so we let her draw whatever she wanted. However, she's yet to draw anything concrete.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Today, I became the Korean Regional Command's Administrator after Administer Kim Jeonghoe. Now, it's not Dr Grace Choi, but Administrator Choi. I gotta get used to it fast, but it's not now.</p>\n<p>Most exploits were from before when I found 1953-KO, and recently, my work was mostly about 1953-KO. It seems I'm gonna get quite busier from now on.</p>\n<p>I wonder if the position of Administrator is too big for me. Nevertheless, I hope I can juggle that along with the longitudinal study of 1953-KO.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>1953-KO gained self-consciousness. When I praise her, she smiles; she understands the person in the mirror is herself and that the kid in the book's pictures is different from herself. Also, if things go as scheduled, I'll not be called her mother anymore.</p>\n<p>However, such change will cause much confusion to the child - something that she recognised and gave a name to suddenly becomes something else because some people she doesn't know agree with it. 1953-KO still wants to call me mom, so I begged the research team to let her call me that a little longer. That'll be until she develops logical thinking enough for her to understand I'm not her birth mother, but a mere 'surrogate' that raised her.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Her anomalous powers grow stronger every day. She struggles to control it, but she is growing more meticulous at a remarkable pace. I had an emergency meeting with the longitudinal study team. The subject was to decide whether to accept and help her hone her skills or to deny and repress it instead.</p>\n<p>We exchanged many opinions, and Dr Yoon Geumseon's proposal was selected. She claimed that suppressing the kid's powers would only leave them festering and inflating in her subconscious. Our decision was to start training the kid how to exert and control her anomaly. Though, the methodology is hard to come about yet.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>We talked a lot about the training method. Following the learning psychology model, we could provide positive reinforcement when she exerts cognitohazards under a threshold and provides negative reinforcement when she goes above it. This is a method used for other anomalous instances. In most cases, the positive reinforcement is given as a form of food, and the negative one is given as an electric shock. However, the objective of the longitudinal study of 1953-KO is to study a child growing up in a typical (and, moreover, ideal) family. Naturally, I was sternly against that proposal.</p>\n<p>However, the problem of 'so what should we do' remains. Suppose there aren't any bright ideas that option can't be used. And I say this with great regret: We are the Foundation; therefore, we are bound to do this if we don't find an adequate solution.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc6\"><span>Archived Document: Message from Dr. Clef</span></h3>\n<div class=\"box\">\n<p>First of all, congratulations on being Administrator. May you find peace in your life.</p>\n<p>I am sending this email to discuss some issues pertinent to SCP-1953-KO.</p>\n<p>First, I express great concern about Administrator Grace Choi's choice regarding SCP-1953-KO.<br/>\nIt is perceived that you have grown blind to the Foundation's purpose and protecting SCP-1953-KO for your personal emotions. It is irresponsible for the Regional Branch Administrator, with practical authority over the entire Korean Regional Branch, to personally come in contact with an SCP and form a bond.</p>\n<p>Second, you are well aware that SCP-953 is SCP-1953-KO's mother. As a participant in the SCP-953 retrieval mission and the containment expert of said subject, I can personally feel the bone-chilling evil and savageness the subject possesses. 1953-KO has a much stronger cognitohazardous effect than that of SCP-953. Despite its current physical abilities being weaker than a human, the psychological risk that 1953-KO may pose when it reaches adulthood must not be overlooked.</p>\n<p>I hope your empathy lasts. I also hope such empathy does not lead to another tragedy. Of course, you must acknowledge and prepare for it to prevent the tragedy from being a reality.</p>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO is not your child. Neither should it be.<br/>\nPlease do not forget that we all die in the dark for those in the light.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\u2014 Dr. Alto Clef</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc7\"><span>1953-KO Research Log 3</span></h3>\n<p>The following document is the personal journal of Administrator Grace Choi, covering the subject's development from age 2 to 5.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>SCP-1953-KO now speaks clearly and well. She expresses what she likes or dislikes without hesitation. Day by day, she became more skilled at naming things she could see around her. Teddy bear, fairy tale book, pen, keycard, camera, security guard. There were many items that other children could not easily see or pronounce, but seeing SCP-1953-KO speak them with such clarity makes me feel proud.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO really likes fairy tales. She likes oral folk tales, especially the Sun and the Moon. She is scared of the part with the tiger and covers her eyes with both hands whenever it comes up. Once, I playfully imitated the tiger's dialogue in a scary way, and it made her cry.</p>\n<p>Every day when I come, she shows me a fairy tale book and explains the characters: who these characters are, what they like, and what they did. Time flies when I listen to her. It reminded me how interesting fairy tale books can be.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>1953-KO didn't cry when I left the chamber.<br/>\nI am worried whether she is growing premature, or if she's grown used to to such farewells.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>This was the first time SCP-1953-KO strongly asked me for something. She wanted to see a tree - the fairy tales always mentioned trees and forests. I showed her pictures of trees and forests on my phone, but she threw a tantrum, insisting on seeing them in person. It was the first time she cried so vehemently. Seeing her cry so loudly made me think that at least she was healthy.</p>\n<p>However, the cognitohazard rating skyrocketed to 10.0. This was more than double my cognitive resistance capacity, 5.0 (which is above average), and the psychological strike made my nose bleed. Startled by blood, she became scared and started to cry. I hugged and comforted her.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>After the incident, the girl grew extremely wary of her anomalous nature and tried to hide it. The incident must have been very traumatic to her.</p>\n<p>She never speaks of going out again. My heart is heavy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Ethics Committee and Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department finally caved into my nagging and gave me clearance for an outing. First, my (and AEC Dep. Dr Chiika's) bold claims that an outing is essential for terminal research; second, my proposal to let the Ethics Committee experiment with SCP-1953-KO; and lastly, Assistant Director Killie's small help - all this to barely get this precious clearance. I owe them a meal now. We can't exit Site-01K grounds, and we're restricted to 2 hours once every month, but it's surely a huge progress.</p>\n<p>The Committee's experiments are a long time away, so I could be relieved for now. However, what's urgent is to build infrastructure to enable the limited outing. It'd be a while by then, working overtime.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Finally, I trekked up a hill near Site-01K with the kid.</p>\n<p>The kid finds everything in the mountain wonderful and new. With every step, she asks me, 'What is this?' 'What's that?' 'What happens if you do this?' 'And that?' I diligently answer her questions, helping her embrace this new world. Even after returning to the containment chamber, she kept talking to me about what happened during our outing. She must have loved it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The kid grew much more energetic than usual. She became more active, never seeming to get tired, no matter how long we played. She still stumbles because of her lack of an eye and depth perception, but now she runs, catches, and throws quite well. Especially during walks, she shows an incredibly energetic. Today, during our walk, she was very interested in picking up and throwing stones. I'm thinking of playing catch with her when she gets a bit bigger.</p>\n<p>I remember an interesting incident that happened during our walk. She threw a rock, striking a pigeon by accident and making it fly away. It seemed to have shocked her a lot. On our way back to the containment room, she kept talking about how much the pigeon must have been hurt, with teary eyes.</p>\n<p>That was when it dawned on me - her soul is different from that demon fox's in Site-17.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc8\"><span>Incident Log: Neutralization of SCP-953 Due to Intervention by External Forces</span></h3>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Neutralisation Target:</strong> SCP-953<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> SCP-953 Containment Chamber, Hall A, Wing B, Site-17<br/>\n<strong>Containment Officer:</strong> Dr Alto Clef</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><em>The footage shows SCP-953 in containment.</em></p>\n<p><em>SCP-953 just devoured a goat provided to her as food.

I didn't know how to inform the kid. I decided to tell her a more dulled-down version of the event, hiding her bloodline and disguising it as another story.</p>\n<p>She showed raw terror at the story. The kid must think she's some kind of scary tiger.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It has been 100 days since the kid's cognitohazard ratings stayed under 2.0. She's excelling at controlling her anomalous nature. It must be the memory of my nose bleeding and the scary story.</p>\n<p>I met up with Dr Geumseon Yoon, who I hadn't met in a while since the Analytic Psychology Department moved to Site-21K. Well, it's Professor Yoon Geumseon now. She showed concern about the kid growing afraid of her own powers. The initial intent was to prevent her from pressing her anomaly in until it festers and bursts. However, it's only where the pressure is coming from, external or internal. After a long discussion, we agreed to make a simple facility to allow her to unleash some of her anomalies on her own.</p>\n<p>That facility was a box full of rats. She could assume control of the rats' minds and play with them, but she should do so at just the right strength so that the rats are unharmed. This play will serve as a great control training for her anomalous abilities. It's like an anomalous \"red light, green light\" of sorts. Just like how regular kids learn how to physically control their bodies via moving and stopping on command, 1953-KO controls the impulses and movement of the rats to control her own abilities.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The kid's ego grows more sophisticated as the days pass. She now knows she doesn't look like other kids and tries to mimic them. She anti-memifies her fox ears and tail, rendering them invisible, and dawns an illusion of two eyes, two legs, and ten fingers on herself.</p>\n<p>They aren't that detailed yet, but the fact that she can exert such a level of cognitohazards is noteworthy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Now, the kid's in her period where socialisation is important. This means two things. First, the child needs to have her first contact with another child who can potentially harm her. Second, through interactions with peers, we can assess how well the child understands and follows rules and turn-taking, and how much her sense of morality has developed.</p>\n<p>These present their respective problems. The former is that it's so vague how to allow contact with 1953-KO with her peers, and the latter is that the morality testing from the Ethics Committee that we've been sweeping under the rug cannot be ignored anymore.</p>\n<p>This gives me a headache in so many ways.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I had to beg the D-Class HR department. The chief was firmly against it initially, but I literally begged on my knees, which he reluctantly obliged.</p>\n<p>Life is born in D-Class bunkers, tragically. The kids born are raised communally in the Foundation nursery to become D-Class or Class 0 clearance personnel. When an infant or kid is needed for containment, they are often recruited as containment personnel. I managed to smuggle some of those D-Class children out to be put in 1953-KO's containment chamber.</p>\n<p>Four (4) children were picked who had lower violence rates than average D-Class children, similar to that of civilian children. Well, except for one of them. A social experiment involving using the kids and observing the situation is planned.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It's time. Three (3) pre-selected D-Class children were introduced, along with a caretaker from the Foundation. The experiment went as follows: 1953-KO used cognitohazards to hide her tail and ears and created an illusion of two eyes, ten fingers, and two legs. Only the caretaker, but not the children, were informed that 1953-KO is an anomalous entity. The caretaker will order the children to perform various activities according to the routine nursery schedule. My research team and I will observe her socialising through a camera.</p>\n<p>First experiment. SCP-1953-KO was very shy around other children her age. She did not try to join in the activities of the children and often looked for her mother. During this process, the cognitohazard level rose to 1.2. One of the more sensitive children complained of a headache, and SCP-1953-KO's tail was briefly exposed, but nobody noticed.</p>\n<p>The caregiver tried to encourage SCP-1953-KO to join the activities, but it was not easy. She strongly refused to participate in all activities, such as puzzle solving, block building, charades, and tag.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the next experiment, I suggested the caregiver go on a walk. Fortunately, 1953-KO showed great interest in the walk. This time, they went outside the grounds of the 01K base, and the child was excited to go to places she had never been before. When they arrived at a wide-open field, the children started playing tag, a game they had learned in a previous session, and 1953-KO was able to participate smoothly in the game this time.</p>\n<p>It was observed that when SCP-1953-KO was being chased, the child who was 'it' suddenly stopped dead in their tracks. The child seemed momentarily confused and then resumed playing, but it was obvious. SCP-1953-KO began to use her abilities on humans.</p>\n<p>I don't know what to tell her about this. Should I tell her not to use her anomalous powers on other people? Or should I lecture her for using her abilities instead of playing fair?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the end, I told her to play fair. Anomalies can be a useful tool or a weapon, depending on how it is used. Rather than blindly suppressing the anomaly, it is more important to instil the right values in the child.</p>\n<p>It was decided to continue with a walk in the next session. Once the child becomes closer to her friends, they will return to the containment chamber to resume activities.</p>\n<p>I informed the caretaker about the situation. As the play progressed, SCP-1953-KO started to get along well with the other children. She did not use her abilities even when at a disadvantage in the game of tag.</p>\n<p>A snack time was given to the children so that the caregivers and research team could have a meeting. During the meeting, loud crying was heard, and we had to pause the meeting. When we went outside, SCP-1953-KO was crying with a bruise on her cheek. I held and comforted SCP-1953-KO and ended the socialisation experiment.</p>\n<p>It was only after returning to the containment chamber and watching the recorded footage that we could understand what had happened in the meantime.</p>\n<p>While we were in the meeting, a fight broke out between two children when one snatched another's snack. The snatcher was bigger and stronger, making it difficult for others to confront him. However, the kid who had the snack taken was the type to always stand up for themselves, which led to a fight. The verbal altercation quickly escalated into a physical one. SCP-1953-KO, not knowing what to do, watched but eventually got caught up in the fight. When the child threw a punch at SCP-1953-KO, the cognitohazard level briefly spiked to 3.0, and her eyes flashed red, but she closed her eyes and took the punch. Then, she began to cry loudly.</p>\n<p>Why did she prioritise suppressing her anomaly over defending herself at that moment? Was it because she took my words as absolute, or was it because she became afraid of her abilities once again? So many thoughts are flooding my mind; it feels like it could burst.</p>\n<p>Such is the hardships of raising a kid.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The socialisation experiment reached its final stages. 1953-KO has successfully made amends with the child she fought with and participated much more actively in play. She patiently waits for her turn and follows the rules she set with her peers. Watching the children play is like observing a miniature version of both the normal and the anomalous society. There is a demon fox among them, yet the human children are blissfully unaware. Every morning, 1953-KO diligently ensures that her tail and ears remain hidden from others and cautiously participates in the games.</p>\n<p>Then, a thought suddenly struck me: what if we had introduced 1953-KO's true form to the children from the beginning? If children, not afraid of anomalies, could grow up and play together if only such a society could exist where the normal and the anomalous coexist in harmony. Perhaps that would be a world where the SCP Foundation is no longer necessary.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Chiika concluded that enough data had been gathered from the experiment and decided to end it. Professor Yoon Geumseon agreed, but the caregiver showed a hint of discomfort. When asked why, she told me that one of the children involved was scheduled to be deployed in the containment procedure of an entity once the experiment concluded. She came to me, pleading to extend the experiment a bit longer. I was torn, but ultimately I refused. We couldn't continue the experiment indefinitely.</p>\n<p>I apologised to her. In response, she threw various accusations at me. She claimed that everyone at Site-01K, as well as the higher-ups, knew that I had become emotionally attached to SCP-1953-KO, that Director Grace Choi treats a SCP she was containing as her own daughter, even giving it a name. I didn't deny it. Yes, I was sorry to admit to Professor Yoon Geumseon and Dr Chiika, but the terminal research was just a pretence. It was bound to be revealed eventually\u2026 And it's an undeniable fact that SCP-1953-KO, being the daughter of a Regional Command Administrative Director, received such protection, while the children of Class D personnel are thrown to monsters, assigned to tasks adults can't do, and disposed of as needed.</p>\n<p>\"This is the Foundation, what can be done?\" This phrase is probably the easiest way to rationalise in the world. And I don't want to rationalise this way. That's why I could only repeatedly say sorry to him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It's time. We now must address a long-postponed task.</p>\n<p>Firstly, a notice from the Ethics Committee has arrived. It states that the child's moral compass is now sufficiently developed to be assessed. They aim to determine whether the barbarity observed in SCP-953 is inherent in the child and whether their moral values align with the Foundation's principles.</p>\n<p>Secondly, as initially promised and to regain trust within the regional command, I must ensure that SCP-1953-KO no longer refers to me as 'mother'. The child has matured enough to think logically and understand relationships and circumstances, including ours. I'm concerned about how well she'll take this. However, this will be addressed only after the upcoming meeting with the Ethics Committee, as premature action might render the child unstable.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc10\"><span>Ethics Committee Interview Log</span></h3>\n<p>The following record is a recording of an ethics experiment conducted on SCP-1953-KO.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Experimental:</strong> Ethics committee member Kiara Shamalan</p>\n<p><strong>Observer:</strong> Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department Dr Chiika, Analytic Psychology Department Prof. Yoon Geumseon, Site-01K Director Grace 'Noraemine' Choi</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-1953-KO (9 y.o.)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> SCP-1953-KO?</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yes?

To eat the jam, Henry climbed up the table, but a glass cup fell down and broke.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Now, who is worse? John or Henry?</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Hmm\u2026 (Hesitates for a while)</p>\n<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> The previous questions were to check for 'heteronomous morality', which is following a set of fixed rules. This time, it's to check for 'autonomous morality' if they could figure out an intent that precedes the rules. Her peers haven't developed autonomous morality yet. Therefore, they focus only on the results.</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> I think John is worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> He broke a lot of cups.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> The subject hasn't developed autonomous morality yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Then what about this case?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John was walking down the street when he saw Henry's house on fire.

You shouldn't break something that another person likes.</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> But I still want to save him. If he doesn't, both John and Henry will be sad.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> Interesting response.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> It fits the part where she can break the rules for her own happiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> It could be for happiness or just to 'feel good'.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> So, is Piaget's Ethics Development all over?</p>\n<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> Yes, it seems so.

The greatest happiness of the greatest number. She understands it. This is something that even children on the third level of Piaget's developmental stage can barely grasp.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> And it fits with the Foundation doctrine, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> It's more important how much she can follow it. Now, 1953-KO? Can you go on?</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On a straight track is a bridge.

The details of the order are a special secret, classified for those outside of Site-01K personnel.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1953-KO is the last remaining demon fox. The subject is the daughter of former Korea Regional Command Administrator Grace \"Noraemine\" Choi, who is currently a member of Dinodon's Hand. For these reasons, the subject retains a friendly relationship with the SCP Foundation.</p>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO possesses non-human physical features such as fox ears and tail, and some parts of her body have been lost due to adverse conditions after childbirth. However, she conceals these characteristics by utilising its anomalous abilities to manipulate perception.</p>\n<p>Proposals were made to use the subject for Foundation diplomatic advantages, leveraging her abilities with the assistance of a group of individuals. However, this proposal was rejected by the following personnel:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrator Killie of the Korean Regional Command</li>\n<li>Professor Noe Su-jong of the Muism Department</li>\n<li>Professor Yoon Geum-sun of the Analytical Psychology Department</li>\n<li>Dr. Chiika of the Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department</li>\n<li>Dr. Clef, Site-17 Containment Expert</li>\n<li>Kiara Shamlan, Ethics Committee member</li>\n<li>And 42 others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Subsequently, containment procedures were established and are currently maintained with these individuals at the centre.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc15\"><span>History</span></h3>\n<p>SCP-1953-KO was designated for a terminal research plan for the study of the psychology of anomalous entities shortly after its discovery. As part of the research, the subject was raised under the protection of Director Grace Choi and acquired social skills and values. However, a PoI showing hostility to the subject attacked her, resulting in the death of Director Grace Choi while protecting it. Consequently, overall containment duties for SCP-1953-KO were transferred to Director Killie, the newly appointed Administrator of Korean Regional Command.</p>\n<p>Following this, PoI-DH-016 (known as \"Kang Na-ru,\" a member of \"Dinodon's hand\"), appeared in the subject's containment chamber. PoI-DH-016 was severely injured at the time and appeared to have made a difficult journey to reach SCP-1953-KO's containment chamber. PoI-DH-016 whispered something to SCP-1953-KO, and the subject nodded in agreement, then escaped the containment chamber with PoI-DH-016. A note asking for forgiveness was left behind immediately after the escape, addressed to Director Killie and the containment staff.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Security\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Level\u00a04/01K\u00a0Required:\u00a0Requires\u00a0authentication\u00a0of\u00a0personnel\u00a0for\u00a0Site-01K.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Not long after the containment breach occurred, SCP-1953-KO reappeared during the funeral of former Director Grace. The funeral was attended by Professor Noe Su-Jong, Professor Yoon Geum-Seon, Dr. Chiika, and Dr. Alto Clef. The subject expressed gratitude and paid respects to these individuals. The funeral proceeded with SCP-1953-KO. After the ceremony concluded, SCP-1953-KO left the facility.</p>\n<p>During this time, all individuals who attended the funeral escorted SCP-1953-KO.</p>\n<p>As per Administrator Killie's direct orders, all information related to this funeral ceremony is protected by Security Clearance Level 4/01K.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"sh\">\n<p>\u300cAre you sure you're ready?

Frequencies known to be used by SCP-206 are to be monitored, and all images relayed to Earth via other probes or satellites deleted from non-Foundation assets after they have been retrieved. Technology and astronomy websites, journals and periodicals are to be monitored for discussion of the rover or the receipt of unusual photographs (see Document 206-AA12 for complete list). Persons who become aware of the existence of SCP-206 are to be administered amnestics.</p>\n<p>UPDATE - 30/11/20\u2588\u2588: As orbital observation of SCP-206 has proven possible, agents within satellite and aerial imaging organizations are directed to keep watch for instances of SCP-206, and remove the images concerned. Deployment of 'image corruption' cover story suggested.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-206 is a Martian exploratory rover (Designation - <em>Invictus</em>) launched on 12/08/20\u2588\u2588 as part of a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. (Exact object specifications are listed in Document 206-AA1.) Despite a successful launch aboard a <em>Soyuz-FG</em> rocket, telemetry data was lost on 16/01/20\u2588\u2588, roughly halfway to Mars. Attempts to re-establish communication failed, and on 10/02/20\u2588\u2588 the craft was declared lost.</p>\n<p>On 08/06/20\u2588\u2588 (a day after <em>Invictus</em> was planned to arrive on the Martian surface) a connection was established with ESA flight control on the rover's assigned frequency. Before terminating at the source, 38 photographs were transmitted, appearing to show views of the expected landing zone in the Victoria Crater. Three days later, a further batch of 11 images was received, showing a drastically different location (later determined to be in the Cydonia Mensae, roughly 2500km due south).</p>\n<p>The Foundation was informed of the incidents by operatives at the ESA shortly thereafter, and moved to investigate. Containment procedures were instituted on 21/06/20\u2588\u2588, when ESA Control received a batch of 5 images showing panoramic views of the Martian surface, apparently taken from its satellite Deimos. How the rover (which, as designed, is rated at maximum speed of 90m per hour on flat ground) traveled between these locations is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>SCP-206 contacts Earth sporadically, utilizing its original channel, [DATA REDACTED]. Once a connection is established, it uploads a number of images in varying formats. Pictures received do not always correspond to the hardware originally installed on <em>Invictus</em>, though the signature and session initiation packets match those programmed.</p>\n<p>Tracking stations have received a total of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 images. A large number of these images (roughly 38%) appear to have been taken on Earth, or worlds similar to it (differing in some detail). The remaining photographs seem to have been taken on, or in the region of, various celestial bodies, only a small percentage of which are currently identified. Periods between transmission vary considerably; the shortest registered to date is 26 hours, the longest 511 hours.</p>\n<p>Despite visual confirmation of the existence of something resembling the rover (see Addendum 206-1) no trace of it has been found in the received images, even when the scene includes a reflective surface. Further, a number of photographs show locations exceedingly difficult, if not impossible for a rover the size and shape of <em>Invictus</em> to access.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 206-01:</strong> At the time containment procedures were instituted, it was unknown whether the transmissions originated from the probe itself, or if an unknown entity had simply co-opted the frequency and was impersonating the rover.</p>\n<p>However, on 13/08/20\u2588\u2588, SCP-206 transmitted a photograph of what was identified as a portion of a Lunar Ranging Retro Reflector. Nearby orbital assets were re-tasked to survey the relevant regions, revealing tracks closely resembling those a rover the size and shape of <em>Invictus</em> could be expected to leave. On 30/11/20\u2588\u2588 Japanese lunar orbiter <em>SELENE</em> captured the vehicle itself during a camera calibration session over the Copernicus Crater. Four hours later, SCP-206 uploaded a new image showing a view of the same region. Since then, SCP-206 has been captured by several satellites in various locales - see Sighting Log SCP-206.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 206-02:</strong> Though SCP-206 generally uses [DATA REDACTED], on at least 5 occasions images have been transmitted to (or via) civilian or military space assets. No connection between the image sets in question has been found. See Incident Log SCP-206 for more details.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Archive\u00a0of\u00a0images\u00a0sent\u00a0by\u00a0SCP-206</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Archive\u00a0of\u00a0images\u00a0sent\u00a0by\u00a0SCP-206</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Number of Images</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Images</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07/06/20\u2588\u2588</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>The image sent appears to document SCP-206's landing on Mars.

Frequencies known to be used by SCP-206 are to be monitored, and all images relayed to Earth via other probes or satellites deleted from non-Foundation assets after they have been retrieved. Technology and astronomy websites, journals and periodicals are to be monitored for discussion of the rover or the receipt of unusual photographs (see Document 206-AA12 for complete list). Persons who become aware of the existence of SCP-206 are to be administered amnestics.\n\n\n\nUPDATE - 30/11/20\u2588\u2588: As orbital observation of SCP-206 has proven possible, agents within satellite and aerial imaging organizations are directed to keep watch for instances of SCP-206, and remove the images concerned. Deployment of 'image corruption' cover story suggested.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-206 is a Martian exploratory rover (Designation - //Invictus//) launched on 12/08/20\u2588\u2588 as part of a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. (Exact object specifications are listed in Document 206-AA1.) Despite a successful launch aboard a //Soyuz-FG// rocket, telemetry data was lost on 16/01/20\u2588\u2588, roughly halfway to Mars. Attempts to re-establish communication failed, and on 10/02/20\u2588\u2588 the craft was declared lost.\n\n\n\nOn 08/06/20\u2588\u2588 (a day after //Invictus// was planned to arrive on the Martian surface) a connection was established with ESA flight control on the rover's assigned frequency. Before terminating at the source, 38 photographs were transmitted, appearing to show views of the expected landing zone in the Victoria Crater. Three days later, a further batch of 11 images was received, showing a drastically different location (later determined to be in the Cydonia Mensae, roughly 2500km due south).\n\n\n\nThe Foundation was informed of the incidents by operatives at the ESA shortly thereafter, and moved to investigate. Containment procedures were instituted on 21/06/20\u2588\u2588, when ESA Control received a batch of 5 images showing panoramic views of the Martian surface, apparently taken from its satellite Deimos. How the rover (which, as designed, is rated at maximum speed of 90m per hour on flat ground) traveled between these locations is currently unknown.\n\n\n\nSCP-206 contacts Earth sporadically, utilizing its original channel, [DATA REDACTED]. Once a connection is established, it uploads a number of images in varying formats. Pictures received do not always correspond to the hardware originally installed on //Invictus//, though the signature and session initiation packets match those programmed.\n\n\n\nTracking stations have received a total of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 images. A large number of these images (roughly 38%) appear to have been taken on Earth, or worlds similar to it (differing in some detail). The remaining photographs seem to have been taken on, or in the region of, various celestial bodies, only a small percentage of which are currently identified. Periods between transmission vary considerably; the shortest registered to date is 26 hours, the longest 511 hours. \n\n\n\nDespite visual confirmation of the existence of something resembling the rover (see Addendum 206-1) no trace of it has been found in the received images, even when the scene includes a reflective surface. Further, a number of photographs show locations exceedingly difficult, if not impossible for a rover the size and shape of //Invictus// to access.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 206-01:** At the time containment procedures were instituted, it was unknown whether the transmissions originated from the probe itself, or if an unknown entity had simply co-opted the frequency and was impersonating the rover. \n\n\n\nHowever, on 13/08/20\u2588\u2588, SCP-206 transmitted a photograph of what was identified as a portion of a Lunar Ranging Retro Reflector. Nearby orbital assets were re-tasked to survey the relevant regions, revealing tracks closely resembling those a rover the size and shape of //Invictus// could be expected to leave. On 30/11/20\u2588\u2588 Japanese lunar orbiter //SELENE// captured the vehicle itself during a camera calibration session over the Copernicus Crater. Four hours later, SCP-206\u00a0\u00a0uploaded a new image showing a view of the same region. Since then, SCP-206 has been captured by several satellites in various locales - see Sighting Log SCP-206.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 206-02:** Though SCP-206 generally uses [DATA REDACTED], on at least 5 occasions images have been transmitted to (or via) civilian or military space assets. No connection between the image sets in question has been found. See Incident Log SCP-206 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Archive of images sent by SCP-206\" hide=\"Archive of images sent by SCP-206\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n||~ Date ||~ Number of Images||~ Description ||~ Images ||\n\n|| 07/06/20\u2588\u2588 || 38 || The image sent appears to document SCP-206's landing on Mars.

SCP-2104-A is located inside SCP-2104-B, and seems to be unable to leave this area or act outside it.(See Addendum 004/1.)</p>\n<p>SCP-2104-A is able to partially control its physical appearance, and usually takes the form of a child between 7 and 9 years old. Based on previous interactions recorded during reconnaissance missions, SCP-2104-A presents symptoms of intellectual disability. Its body is covered by different kinds of organic materials (such as fur, sticks, and mud) and small living organisms, including birds, insects, rodents, and lichens.</p>\n<p>SCP-2104-A displays a positive emotional response to interaction with children, but shows fear when approached by adults.</p>\n<p>SCP-2104-A is typically found in the same location, under a holm oak tree <em>(Quercus ilex)</em> with a weathered straw rope hanging from one of the tree's branches.</p>\n<p>SCP-2104-B is an extra-dimensional space that occupies an approximate geographic surface of 0.15\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>. To date, 32 entries to SCP-2104-B have been identified and documented. Entrances are always centered on natural terrain features such as rocks or trees, and are effectively invisible to the naked eye.</p>\n<p>Entrances to SCP-2104-B are normally inactive, but will activate if approached by prepubescent children. Adults approaching an entrance do not cause it to activate.</p>\n<p>SCP-2104-A is able to alter reality inside SCP-2104-B to a certain extent, changing the composition of matter and considerably affecting the behavior of indigenous fauna and flora of the area. During the last 50 years, SCP-2104-A has modified SCP-2104-B to reflect a series of themes from Aesop\u2019s fables, along other unidentified manifestations. Some animals within the area have shown the ability to speak, and commonly refer to SCP-2104-A as \"the king by the tree.\"</p>\n<p>According to the results of field analysis, SCP-2104-B is geographically identical to the area it covers in this reality construct.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Reconnaissance\u00a0Report\u00a02104-5</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Excerpt from Reconnaissance Report 2104-5, \u2588/\u2588/97</strong></p>\n<p><em>Subject-5 (male, 9 years old), equipped with a helmet with an integrated video camera, accesses SCP-2104-B through Entrance 7.</em></p>\n<p><em>Recording begins.

SCP-2104-A is located inside SCP-2104-B, and seems to be unable to leave this area or act outside it.(See Addendum 004/1.)\n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A is able to partially control its physical appearance, and usually takes the form of a child\u00a0\u00a0between 7 and 9 years old. Based on previous interactions recorded during reconnaissance missions, SCP-2104-A presents symptoms of\u00a0\u00a0intellectual disability. Its body is covered by different kinds of organic materials (such as fur, sticks, and mud) and small living organisms, including birds, insects, rodents, and lichens.\n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A displays a positive emotional response to interaction with children, but shows fear when approached by adults. \n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A is typically found in the same location, under a holm oak tree //(Quercus ilex)// with a weathered straw rope\u00a0\u00a0hanging from one of the tree's branches. \n\n\n\nSCP-2104-B is an extra-dimensional space\u00a0\u00a0that occupies an approximate geographic surface of 0.15 km^^2^^. To date, 32 entries to SCP-2104-B have been identified and documented. Entrances are always centered on natural terrain features such as rocks or trees, and are effectively invisible to the naked eye.\n\n\n\nEntrances to SCP-2104-B are normally inactive, but will activate if approached by prepubescent children. Adults approaching an entrance do not cause it to activate.\n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A is able to alter reality inside SCP-2104-B to a certain extent, changing the composition of matter and considerably affecting the behavior of indigenous fauna and flora of the area. During the last 50 years, SCP-2104-A has modified SCP-2104-B to reflect a series of themes from Aesop\u2019s fables, along other unidentified manifestations.\u00a0\u00a0Some animals within the area have shown the ability to speak, and commonly refer to SCP-2104-A as \"the king by the tree.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the results of field analysis, SCP-2104-B is geographically identical to the area it covers in this reality construct.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Excerpt from Reconnaissance Report 2104-5\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n> **Excerpt from Reconnaissance Report 2104-5, \u2588/\u2588/97**\n\n> \n\n> //Subject-5 (male, 9 years old), equipped with a helmet with an integrated video camera, accesses SCP-2104-B through Entrance 7.//\n\n> \n\n> //Recording begins.

There is a large platter filled with vines of grapes. SCP-2104-A displays the appearance of a 7-10 year old child, dressed in what appear to be vine leaves. Upon seeing the subject, both entities address him.//\n\n> \n\n> **Fox:** You came! We were awaiting for an illustrious guest, and my king was feeling hungry.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2104-A:** H-hello, friend!\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-2104-A watches the subject with expectation and points to a seat.

These grapes are ripe and ready to eat!\n\n> \n\n> //The fox growls threateningly at the subject. SCP-2104-A appears nervous, and intervenes.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2104-A:** Go away! Bad fox!\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-2104-A then proceeds then to gather pebbles and mud from the ground around the table, and places them into an empty dish. Afterwards, he offers the dish to the subject in a friendly manner.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2104-A:** T-tasty meatballs and mashed pot-tatoes.\n\n> \n\n> //The pebbles and mud are replaced by meatballs and mashed potatoes.//\n\n> \n\n> //The subject is given further instructions to leave the area.

While resting seated by the shore, the subject is approached by two storks, wearing a typical head scarf from the rural region where SCP-2104-B entrances are located, and voluminous bags. The following conversation takes place://\n\n> \n\n> **Stork 1:** Clack-cackclack! A little princess has come to see the king.\n\n> \n\n> **Stork 2:** But the king is sad and has climbed the tree.

The ants are of a much larger size than usual, measuring up to 40 cm in length (estimated by subject). They carry small cloth packages on their backs.//\n\n> \n\n> //The subject is told to approach the ants. Some of the insects express interest for the subject, and they slow down to talk to her.//\n\n> \n\n> **Ant 1:** The princess has arrived just in time for the king's feast!\n\n> \n\n> **Ant 2:** But when the king is up the tree he does not touch our delicacies!

The video feed shows SCP-2104-A, hanging from the rope in the tree. The body does not show external signs of decay. Standing on the ground near SCP-2104-A there are two humanoid entities resembling a human adult in shape and size, male and female. They appear to be composed of clay. Both objects have acorns embedded on their surface, arranged in resemblance of simplified facial features.//\n\n> \n\n> //The subject points out that the objects are emitting sounds.

If it was up to you, in one week the rest of the town would have seen your son doing those things.\n\n> \n\n> **Object 2:** Ascen, what do you want? I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Oh\u00a0\u00a0god, just leave him with your aunt.

Eventually someone would know, and then what? You saw that thing yesterday with the ants. It\u2019s getting worse. Please, listen to me. Go get the kid. We\u2019ll do this together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Object 2:** Oh, god. Okay. Just\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll go. Go get everything, you. //(shouting)// Mateo! Mateo! Where are you?

SCP-2195 includes biological samples preserved through various methods, demonstration and test articles, prototypes, and a variety of documents. The sum of documentation recovered was enough to fill 19 (nineteen) shipping containers at the moment of discovery.</p>\n<p>Analysis of said evidence has shown that the project took place in political, historical and socio-cultural circumstances inconsistent with known reality, which suggests extradimensional or otherwise anomalous origin.</p>\n<p>Although no fully formed SCP-2195-1 were discovered within SCP-2195, recovered materials provide enough information to give a complete description of their appearance. SCP-2195-1 are living, genetically altered human infants of indeterminate sex (SCP-2195-1 allosomes are identical, and contain genetic information from both X and Y chromosomes).</p>\n<p>SCP-2195-1 body structure is radically different from that of normal infants; SCP-2195-1 are presumed to have the shape of an ellipsoid roughly 60\u00a0cm long and 50\u00a0cm in circumference, and mass of 9 to 9.5\u00a0kg. The physiology of tissues covering the front and back ends is identical to that of somewhat calloused human skin; the rest of the skin is sphacelated, metamorphised, parchment-like and fused with the underlying bone (no muscles and/or fat tissues are present). Ribs grow away from the whole length of the spine (55 to 56 pairs of ribs in total); the ribs are flattened and fused along their whole length, which creates a solid bone capsule with the pelvis and the skull fused immovably to its respective ends.</p>\n<p>The skull is small, streamlined forwards and has radial symmetry. The only orifice facing outside is a large eye socket on the front end of the body, which contains an anatomically normal eye with a transparent protective membrane. No auditory apparatus is present, but the inner ear vestibular system is extremely developed.</p>\n<p>The pelvic section also has radial symmetry and serves as an attachment point for four identical limbs facing upwards and downwards diagonally. These limbs are around 10 centimeters long and contain a single pointed bone, which is connected to the pelvis by a ball-and-socket joint, resembling the human hip joint or shoulder joint. Their freedom of movement is severely restricted by the joint's position within the body, as well as rigid tendons; nonetheless they are fitted with powerful muscles intended to turn the limb around its axis. An orifice with a sphincter is located between these limbs, which leads to a small dead-end cavity with richly innervated walls.</p>\n<p>Inner organs are mostly either rudimentary or missing, which makes SCP-2195-1's life expectancy to be 10 to 15 minutes, unless sustained by an external life support system. Apart from the aforementioned sensory organs, central nervous system and muscles, only the circulatory system is developed, which includes major vessels, the heart and an organ that resembles a radically altered spleen; said organ has thick, myoglobin-rich walls that can accumulate a certain amount of oxygen and release it into the blood, and filters carbon dioxide out of the blood. There is also a small cluster of electrocytes, which is connected via nerves to the cardiac conducting system.</p>\n<p>Aside from the front and back ends, the majority of SCP-2195-1 body is occupied by tissue that structurally resembles liver tissue with extreme adipose degeneration (vacuoles amount for 97% of its volume and even more than that in mass); instead of fat, the vacuoles contain a complex organic substance that has pronounced explosive properties.</p>\n<p>Its exact parameters cannot be determined due to the irregularity of the remaining biological components' amount within tissues, as well as due to the the substance's own nature (supposedly, a mix of several compounds with similar properties in varying proportions). Approximate properties can be described as such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Density: 1.8-1.9\u00a0g/cm<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>Specific energy of explosion: 9.2\u00a0MJ/kg</li>\n<li>Explosive strength (measured by Trauzl test): 670\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>Brisance (measured by Kast test): 8\u00a0mm</li>\n<li>Detonation velocity: 8300-8500\u00a0m/s</li>\n<li>Sensitivity: 70% explosions with a 10\u00a0kg weight dropped from a height of 25\u00a0cm.</li>\n<li>Amount of tissue in an instance of SCP-2195-1: 7.5 to 8\u00a0kg, explosive yield up to 25\u00a0kg of TNT equivalent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the documents, SCP-2195-1 have a gestation time of 40 weeks which is normal to humans. They were also naturally born, but subject to the following operative treatment immediately after birth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>catheterization of 2 major vessels for connection to life support system;</li>\n<li>installation of a metal clamp along the spine which acts as a band for a suspension mount;</li>\n<li>mounting of reinforced plastic fins on the limbs;</li>\n<li>fitting the front end with a transparent nose cone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that SCP-2195-1 were subject to three-week training in a wind tunnel fitted with elastic suspension systems and an image projector to display various battlefield scenes as seen from above.

Biological samples preserved through plastic infusion or stored in a solid synthetic resin block, as well as non-biological samples do not require any special containment procedures. Three low-level security vaults in Site 7 are designated for SCP-2195 storage.\n\n\n\nNon-deactivated late-term SCP-2195-1 samples are to be handled by trained personnel as per standard Foundation guidelines for handling bulk primary explosive substances. \n\n\n\nResearch has shown that explosive materials contained within SCP-2195-1 degrade over time, therefore they are granted a storage period of 20 years and are to be incinerated afterwards.\n\n\n\nDocuments acquired as part of SCP-2195 are to be digitalized and uploaded into the SCP-2195 documentation database; original documents are archived.\n\n\n\nAccess to SCP-2195 documentation is restricted to personnel of 2-2195 clearance or higher.\n\nAccess to SCP-2195 samples is restricted to personnel of 3-2195 clearance or higher.\n\nExperiments that involve reproduction of SCP-2195-1 require Ethics Committee approval.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2195 is a collective designation for documental and material evidence, specifically collected by unidentified individuals, that is related to a large-scale government project which involves mass reproduction of SCP-2195-1 for military purposes, specifically targeting the drawbacks of said project. SCP-2195 includes biological samples preserved through various methods, demonstration and test articles, prototypes, and a variety of documents. The sum of documentation recovered was enough to fill 19 (nineteen) shipping containers at the moment of discovery. \n\n\n\nAnalysis of said evidence has shown that the project took place in political, historical and socio-cultural circumstances inconsistent with known reality, which suggests extradimensional or otherwise anomalous origin.\n\n\n\nAlthough no fully formed SCP-2195-1 were discovered within SCP-2195, recovered materials provide enough information to give a complete description of their appearance. SCP-2195-1 are living, genetically altered human infants of indeterminate sex (SCP-2195-1 allosomes are identical, and contain genetic information from both X and Y chromosomes).\n\n\n\nSCP-2195-1 body structure is radically different from that of normal infants; SCP-2195-1 are presumed to have the shape of an ellipsoid roughly 60 cm long and 50 cm in circumference, and mass of 9 to 9.5 kg. The physiology of tissues covering the front and back ends is identical to that of somewhat calloused human skin; the rest of the skin is sphacelated, metamorphised, parchment-like and fused with the underlying bone (no muscles and/or fat tissues are present). Ribs grow away from the whole length of the spine (55 to 56 pairs of ribs in total); the ribs are flattened and fused along their whole length, which creates a solid bone capsule with the pelvis and the skull fused immovably to its respective ends.\n\n\n\nThe skull is small, streamlined forwards and has radial symmetry. The only orifice facing outside is a large eye socket on the front end of the body, which contains an anatomically normal eye with a transparent protective membrane. No auditory apparatus is present, but the inner ear vestibular system is extremely developed.\n\n\n\nThe pelvic section also has radial symmetry and serves as an attachment point for four identical limbs facing upwards and downwards diagonally. These limbs are around 10 centimeters long and contain a single pointed bone, which is connected to the pelvis by a ball-and-socket joint, resembling the human hip joint or shoulder joint. Their freedom of movement is severely restricted by the joint's position within the body, as well as rigid tendons; nonetheless they are fitted with powerful muscles intended to turn the limb around its axis. An orifice with a sphincter is located between these limbs, which leads to a small dead-end cavity with richly innervated walls.\n\n\n\nInner organs are mostly either rudimentary or missing, which makes SCP-2195-1's life expectancy to be 10 to 15 minutes, unless sustained by an external life support system. Apart from the aforementioned sensory organs, central nervous system and muscles, only the circulatory system is developed, which includes major vessels, the heart and an organ that resembles a radically altered spleen; said organ has thick, myoglobin-rich walls that can accumulate a certain amount of oxygen and release it into the blood, and filters carbon dioxide out of the blood. There is also a small cluster of electrocytes, which is connected via nerves to the cardiac conducting system.\n\n\n\nAside from the front and back ends, the majority of SCP-2195-1 body is occupied by tissue that structurally resembles liver tissue with extreme adipose degeneration (vacuoles amount for 97% of its volume and even more than that in mass); instead of fat, the vacuoles contain a complex organic substance that has pronounced explosive properties.\n\n\n\nIts exact parameters cannot be determined due to the irregularity of the remaining biological components' amount within tissues, as well as due to the the substance's own nature (supposedly, a mix of several compounds with similar properties in varying proportions). Approximate properties can be described as such:\n\n* Density: 1.8-1.9 g/cm^^3^^\n\n* Specific energy of explosion: 9.2 MJ/kg\n\n* Explosive strength (measured by Trauzl test): 670 cm^^3^^\n\n* Brisance (measured by Kast test): 8 mm\n\n* Detonation velocity: 8300-8500 m/s\n\n* Sensitivity: 70% explosions with a 10 kg weight dropped from a height of 25 cm.\n\n* Amount of tissue in an instance of SCP-2195-1: 7.5 to 8 kg, explosive yield up to 25 kg of TNT equivalent.\n\n\n\nAccording to the documents, SCP-2195-1 have a gestation time of 40 weeks which is normal to humans. They were also naturally born, but subject to the following operative treatment immediately after birth:\n\n* catheterization of 2 major vessels for connection to life support system;\n\n* installation of a metal clamp along the spine which acts as a band for a suspension mount;\n\n* mounting of reinforced plastic fins on the limbs;\n\n* fitting the front end with a transparent nose cone.\n\n\n\nAfter that SCP-2195-1 were subject to three-week training in a wind tunnel fitted with elastic suspension systems and an image projector to display various battlefield scenes as seen from above. For that purpose, a device for electrical nerve stimulation was inserted into the orifice at the rear end of SCP-2195-1; the higher the achieved targeting precision, the greater the stimulation. The SCP-2195-1 specimens were thus trained to\u00a0\u00a0develop visual recognition skills for various targets, and trained to control their flight using limb-mounted aerofoil planes. During the training, the electric organ, which functions as a detonator, was to be temporarily disabled by means of paralytic agent injections.\n\n\n\nFollowing the training SCP-2195-1 was to be tattooed with an emblem of the target it was trained for, put into a state of suspended animation and packed into a shipping container for later use as a homing high explosive bomb.\n\n\n\nThe documentation found as part of SCP-2195 is mostly typewritten in a language having minute differences with modern French, although the origin of names and toponyms mentioned within seems to be more English. No similarities with modern geography were found. The name of the state is never mentioned; instead, \u00abNotre Patrie\u00bb (\u00abOur Fatherland\u00bb) is listed even in official office, position and department names, which is often abbreviated to NP (e.g., \u00abPr\u00e9sident de NP\u00bb).\n\n\n\nAccording to the information contained within, the state waged a long and slaughterous offensive war on another state's territory, which was not popular among its populace. State propaganda efforts were not sufficient to subdue the growing pacifist movement which was especially strong among the soldiers' mothers. The arms industry was also on the verge of decline. The documented project was proposed in order to solve both problems, and was meant to implant embryos of SCP-2195-1 into all fertile women under the guise of various mandatory medical procedures. The surge of \"living bombs\" born afterwards was announced as a natural event, a manifestation of mass consciousness, the will of the people, and an evidence of charitability[[footnote]]Original documents use a specific philosophical term which, according to the context, should mean predetermination or being destined by a higher force, whose will it is immoral and unnatural for a human being to resist.[[/footnote]] of the military intervention taking place. Another important factor was the mother's blood relationship which required a mother to unconditionally support her child's \"voluntary effort\", which in turn demanded her to abolish any pacifist beliefs and/or made her an indirect participant of the bombings, with personal responsibility forced on her later on.\n\n\n\n//Note: this shows drastic differences of ethical norms between our society and the one described.

Despite several complications and the need for a cesarean section delivery, the specimen was fully formed and quite healthy, save for some minute anatomical deviations.\n\n\n\nA series of tests and experiments was conducted, culminating in a successful bombing of a target in the firing range, which completely confirmed the information contained within SCP-2195.\n\n\n\nHowever, the test committee pointed out the immense financial and labor costs to reproduce the sample and its life support system, as well as the sample being generally effective but having no outstanding features, SCP-2195-1 was declared having no practical value to the Foundation.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-2194]]] | SCP-2195 | [[[SCP-2196]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=theTBAPb, translated by Gene R]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Original Article:** http://scpfoundation.net/scp-2195\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** 1195-1.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Something strange\n\n> **Author:** Mysterious Stranger\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/187534264@N02/49848281113/in/dateposted-public/|Link]]]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-2194", "scp-2196", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-2195", "scp_number": 2195, "series": "international", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "_ru", "airborne", "alive", "biological", "humanoid", "international", "safe", "scp"], "title": "SCP-2195", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2195"}, "SCP-2470": {"created_at": "2016-02-11T09:42:00", "creator": "Dr Kostyankyn", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Kostyankyn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kostyankyn", "comment": "", "date": "2016-02-11T09:42:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kostyankyn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kostyankyn", "comment": "", "date": "2016-02-11T09:43:00"}, {"author": "Dr Kostyankyn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-kostyankyn", "comment": "Added tags: ru, translation.

Walls and floor structures are doubled: the outer walls, no less than 4.5 meters thick, are made of high-density pre-stressed concrete; the inner ones, 1.5 meters thick, are made of special \"adamant\" brand high-alloy steel (produced by Plant-45). The containment volume is fitted with two (2) sets of service entrance airlocks with class VI explosion resistance blast doors and an additional emergency quick-hardening compound sealing system.</p>\n<p>In the center of the containment volume there are two concentric icosahedron-shaped shells<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> installed, the diameters of their circumspheres being 8 and 12 meters respectively. The shells are supported by a two-spool suspension system and are additionally surrounded by a Faraday cage made of superconducting cable with cells no larger than 5\u00a0cm across.</p>\n<p>High vacuum inside the shells and the containment volume is maintained by two (2) main and six (6) backup heavy-duty turbomolecular pumps. The space between the inner and outer walls of the containment volume acts as forevacuum space and is pumped by four (4) main and four (4) reserve rotary vane pumps, which are capable of operating in an accelerated mode for no less than one (1) hour. Pumps are to be checked for serviceability on a weekly basis; preventive replacements and scheduled maintenance are to be conducted every two (2) months.</p>\n<p>Area-141's electric power supply consists of no fewer than two (2) independent external sources and two (main and reserve) stand-alone power systems with at least a 100% margin of capacity each.</p>\n<p>The central shells are identical in structure (except for respective dimensions) and both are constructed of 20 triangular titanium plates 1.5\u00a0cm thick, mounted on a steel skeleton and adjusted to minimize gap size along matching edges. One of the plates of each shell is to be mounted on a guide rail serving as an access port, which can only be opened from the outside. The frames in question are to be connected to a stabilized voltage supply, maintaining a potential difference of 120V across the structure.</p>\n<p>The inner surfaces of the shells are covered with luminophore compounds that radiate when conducting electricity and produce afterglow for 20 min in case of power failure. Luminophores of different colors make up an image \u2014 a memetically active visual representation of a so-called \"Wei\u00dfschatten's imperceivable extradimensional paradox\" that irreversibly destroys general perception processes upon being perceived. Another board with the same image is located behind the outer shell access hatch, placed in such a way so as to obstruct the view of the region within three (3) metres of the shell's geometric center, should the outer shell access hatch be opened while the inner shell is compromised. Shell integrity checkup is to be conducted at least once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>Inside the containment volume the following objects are also situated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 spontaneous decoherence generators<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> (spec. product 2470-a)</li>\n<li>3 zero-veil generators<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> (spec. product 2470-b)</li>\n<li>a telepathy suppression device, created using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (spec. product 2470-c)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is essential to maintain a full stock of the aforementioned devices.

Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.<br/>\n<strong>6.</strong> After finishing the procedure #5 the employees, considering the time left, make a decision on entering the inner shell. In case a negative decision is reached, see #10. In case of a positive decision:<br/>\n<strong>7.</strong> Opening the hatch of the inner shell. Starting the 15-minute countdown. One of the employees enters the inner shell; the other remains inside the external shell and locks the hatch from the outside.<br/>\n<strong>8.</strong> Examination of the inner surface by the incomer. It is essential to avoid any contact with the area within 3 meters of the geometrical center during the examination. Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.<br/>\n<strong>9.</strong> Regardless of the outcome of procedure #8, when finishing the 15-minute countdown, the incomer is to be in front of the hatch, being ready to leave. The hatch is to be opened by the employee outside exactly by the time the countdown is finished and only for 20 seconds, and closed and locked afterwards, regardless of circumstances.<br/>\n<strong>10.</strong> By the time the 35-minute countdown is finished, both employees are to stay near the external shell\u2019s hatch.

However, it should also be kept in mind that a deviation from the routine containment mode, as long as it remains stable, is preferable to frequent and sudden changes of the object\u2019s surroundings; for this reason, containment restoration is to be conducted through decisive action, guaranteeing solid and sustainable results.</p>\n<p>In case of pressurization of the main containment volume, all turbomolecular pumps are to be shut off in order to prevent overload; all rotary vane pumps are to operate in overdrive mode to sustain a maximally achievable vacuum during recovery operations. If the air pressure inside of the containment volume exceeds 1\u00a0mbar, all the operations are to be conducted in sound dampening mode.</p>\n<p>In case of visible integrity loss in any of the central shells, said shell is considered beyond repair. Instead, a new shell with a diameter 2m greater than the current outer shell is to be constructed around the central shells, if the outer shell is intact, or two successive shells if both current shells are damaged. After a new shell is put into operation, the old one is to be dismantled, removed and remelted. The current dimensions of the containment volume allow to conduct the procedure as many as five (5) times; hence, after fourth occurence of shell integrity loss and subsequent recontainment as described above, site personnel is to initiate work on containment volume expansion.</p>\n<p>In case of significant damage to both of the shells and thus an inevitable breach of containment volume, protocol 2470-Alpha is to be engaged. High Command must be notified of the situation immediately through a special hotline. Contained objects of little avail classified as \u201cSafe\u201d or \u201cEuclid\u201d, preferably extradimensional, info- or cognitohazardous, self-replicating upon destruction, or having a particularly complex structure (see: approved SCP list), are to be brought to the breach zone before any containment restoration procedures take place.</p>\n<p>This measure is supposed to mitigate the object's destructive influence by forcing it to spend a significant amount of time fully analyzing the complexity and inconsistencies of the aforementioned objects, while their unique properties should not allow SCP-2470 to make any substantial conclusions regarding the properties and laws of baseline reality. Any risks related to object interactions are considered justified. Permanent deployment of some of the objects from the approved SCP list inside the facilities of Area-141 is currently under review.</p>\n<p>In case of a BI (Before Invasion) class or TCF (Total Containment Failure) class scenarios, if any local factors directly compromise the safety of Area-141, or by the order of the O5 Council, protocol 2470-Beta must be engaged in order to neutralize SCP-2470. Four executors (2 main, 2 backup) are to be selected from the approved list and delivered to Area-141. The subjects must receive instruction and conduct test procedures on D-class personnel. The main and backup pairs afterwards stand on duty with a five-minute notice to start the procedure, until protocol 2470-Beta is cancelled by a direct order from O5 Council.</p>\n<p>At the order of High Command, or in case of sudden aggravation of the situation and loss of communication with the headquarters, the neutralization procedure is to be enacted under Area Command responsibility. After it is confirmed to be successful, the executors (both pairs) and all the D-class personnel located in Area-141 are to be terminated, any documentation relevant to SCP-2470 is to be destroyed, and Area-141 is to be evacuated and destroyed via thermonuclear charge.</p>\n<p>Neutralization of the object, regardless of all the complexities of its containment, is the very last resort and is to be avoided until absolutely necessary. For this reason, subjects from the potential executors list are not to be present in Area-141 unless protocol 2470-Beta is engaged.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Organizational\u00a0aspects</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Due to the containment procedure complexity and unacceptable potential cost of error, a training complex has been established on Area 141 grounds for the purpose of general simulation of the containment volume and the containment area. All personnel involved with containment are to regularly practice under supervision of an authorized employee with level 3 clearance and take qualification tests at least monthly. Any non-routine works and procedures can only be carried out after training course simulations and rehearsals show a 100% success rate. Exceptions to this rule are permissible only on private order of Area Director in situations of extreme time pressure.</p>\n<p>Medical staff are to conduct physical examination of the working group prior to entering the containment volume and examine all Area-141 personnel monthly. Prior to deployment in Area-141, each member of the medical staff is to read, understand and sign the classified document 2470-x (attached) with a level 4 clearance employee as witness.</p>\n<p>Significant psychological tension caused by a large amount of important and demanding procedures associated with every entry into the containment volume (such as wearing and checking a full-body suit, passing through the four airlocks, calibrating numerous systems, working inside the shells under severe time pressure and others) necessitates extra attention to personnel\u2019s mental health. Engineers assigned to the containment volume are to be given additional vacations.</p>\n<p>Any and all research of SCP-2470 is currently forbidden. Access to the archive of previously gained/retrieved information for purposes of analysis is allowed for employees with level 3 clearance or above by direct approval of at least two O5 members.</p>\n<p>As it is suspected that some members of the sect presumably responsible for the object's appearance or connected to it may be still alive and at large, Area-141 is considered to be under aggressive threat. Although there is no reason to believe the aforementioned cultists to have any significant forces at their disposal, they possess information about the object that may potentially help them attract the interest of, and gain support from, other potentially dangerous radical organizations. Because of that, MTF \u2588-\u2588\u2588 and \u2588-\u2588\u2588, apart from their main duties, are charged with monitoring the activity of any pro-apocalyptic groups and to actively instigate cultists to contact them by creating front radical organizations and sects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2470 is a specific existential entity, or a perceptive element, which is objectively an initial manifestation of a ZK-class scenario. Due to insuperable obstacles related to its perception, the object's appearance, if it has any, remains unknown. Its current locus is determined indirectly, based on the area of effect it produces.</p>\n<p>Said effect is manifested through the instantaneous disappearance of any object or event perceived by SCP-2470 from objective reality. First and foremost this applies to the most proximate aspects, which are directly accessible to the object\u2019s senses. Thereafter, as the object accumulates knowledge, gains abstract understanding of the nature of things, and makes generalizations, the effect extends to the phenomena themselves, their direct and later indirect consequences.</p>\n<p>For instance, during the initial recovery operation, it was noted that the sound of the agents' footsteps (said agents were obstructed from sight by smokescreens) was starting to drown out due to sonic oscillations having stopped. Soon afterwards, large volumes of the air itself started to spontaneously disappear, which caused hypobaric effects. This was followed by the disappearance of several agents' legs, and finally the agents disappeared wholly and completely. In a similar fashion, at first several clots of the aforementioned smokescreen disappeared, but the effect soon spread to whole smoke clouds, followed by all active smoke grenades at the operation site. This culminated with disappearance of all smoke grenades of that specific type at the operation site, regardless of their being within range of the object's perception.</p>\n<p>Disappearance of soil caused a crater up to 200 meters deep to manifest at the location of the object's discovery (apparently, the object was somehow confused that every demanifested volume of soil brought more into view, and that slowed the process down; it did not manage to realize the Earth as a limited and finite entity). Due to constant disappearances of air, atmospheric pressure has dropped at the operation site and a steady high-current cyclone has formed.</p>\n<p>Since any generalizations of reasons behind any phenomena inevitably lead to using abstract concepts and eventually lead to logically reasoning the universe's existence per se, SCP-2470 is classified as a potential ZK-class hazard.</p>\n<p>According to the analysis of gathered data it was reliably established that the object possesses the following senses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a perception of electromagnetic radiation in an extremely wide frequency range, including the visible spectrum, which is analogous to vision;</li>\n<li>a highly sensitive perception of mechanical stimuli, which is analogous to tactile sense and hearing;</li>\n<li>a perception of [DATA EXPUNGED]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following senses are reasonably likely to be possessed by the object:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a direct, yet severely limited, telepathic perception;</li>\n<li>a perception of certain quantum effects, particularly quantum superposition of states as a singular phenomenon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter hypothesis is related to the events that happened during [REDACTED], as well as damage and demanifestation of (at least) equipment sensors and human sensory organs during attempts to perceive the object directly, which is apparently related to the wave function collapse that inevitably accompanies an act of perception and is seemingly perceivable by SCP-2470.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this hypothesis combined with the conclusion regarding [DATA EXPUNGED] provides an explanation to how the object manages to avoid exposure to \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d: apparently, the effect of quantum entanglement of the object in present time with itself in an immediate future, allows it to foresee the damaging effect of the memetic agent without even having a concept of its nature, and, based on that information, allows SCP-2470 to refuse to perceive it (\"to close its eyes\", metaphorically speaking). However, the fact that this <em>modus operandi</em> remains its only manner of existence for \u2588 years in containment counts in favor of the paradox's adequacy and the proficiency of the developed neutralization procedure, which is based on a forceful inoculation of a destructive meme bypassing the object's senses.</p>\n<p>[INFORMATION IS REMOVED FROM PUBLIC ACCESS.

Actually, the origin of the effect resulting in a ZK-class scenario lies not within the object, as we got used to thinking, but within the whole outer world. It is not the object that tears fragments away from reality, but the reality itself discharging these fragments and casting them into the most fitting place \u2014 into the unfillable unbeing that is SCP-2470 \u2014 as soon as they form a strong enough causal connection with it.</p>\n<p>Unbeing, as the true nature of the object, originates as a result of every successful attempt to perceive it. Thus, as unbeing is a priori singular, part of the object manifests on the information medium or inside the perceiver's mind, destroying it directly. Under this hypothesis, this explains the above-referenced effects on perception.</p>\n<p>From this perspective the cognizing nature of the object appears to be merely an illusion, caused by its dualistic position relative to the \"forgetting\" nature of the universe, though a virtual cogniton<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> related to the object, created by this impact, appears to be indistinguishable from a real one (moreover, the concepts of \"real\" and \"objective\" appear to be conventional and hardly applicable in the given context). This is what determines the object's inability to perceive \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d, but in this case it appears to be an objective and natural limitation, not related to a willed refusal to perceive. From this point of view the effectiveness of the developed neutralization procedure seems very dubious.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> The first report of the object's anomalous activity came on \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.20\u2588\u2588 at about \u2588\u2588:00 from an airplane observer of FGU \u201cAvialesookhrana\u201d<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup>, who was conducting fire safety monitoring in the [REDACTED] area. The pilot reported a huge deforested area centered around a wide, deep cavity. Communication with the pilot ceased soon afterwards. The report was intercepted by undercover Foundation agents in the MES and a reconnaissance operation with \u2588 mobile task forces was arranged.</p>\n<p>Initial hypotheses regarding the object's nature were defining it as something akin to a miniature black hole. However, primary analysis disproved this point of view and demonstrated the true nature of the anomaly. Several methods of containment and/or neutralization, such as [DATA EXPUNGED] had been applied unsuccessfully, and were followed by a proposal to use \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d in order to neutralize the object. This attempt was a partial success. Neutralization was not achieved; however, it was discovered that the paradox\u2019s carrier was not susceptible to the object\u2019s effect, which allowed the Foundation to capture SCP-2470 after several unsuccessful attempts and to develop the current containment protocols. Total losses throughout the whole operation amount to \u2588\u2588\u2588 employees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Excerpt from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's report:</strong></p>\n<p>There was a remarkable episode during one of the first attempts of neutralization, when, at the suggestion of agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a mirror was placed within the object\u2019s field of view. It seemed logical that, after seeing its own reflection, the object would neutralize itself. However, though the other things reflected in the mirror were subjected to its effect to the full, the object itself did not undergo any changes. Instead, it destroyed the mirror, although this action took it 12 seconds more than it usually took for items of similar scale. Also, it is obvious that the object has not been self-destructing due to self-awareness for \u2588 years already. This can be rationalized by one of the following hypotheses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the object is either able to apply its effects selectively or is passively non-susceptible to them;</li>\n<li>the object is either unable to perceive itself, or is avoiding that;</li>\n<li>the object itself is uncognizable;</li>\n<li>the cognizable nature of the object is actually the object itself; any sort of cognition results in the object's duplication, which equals to the object growing due to its indivisible nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last hypothesis [DATA EXPUNGED] for more precise control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the data gathered later on, a small village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which had been abandoned since at least the late 80s had been situated at the initial discovery site. However, a few years before the anomaly appeared, it had been occupied with members of an unidentified, radical pro-apocalyptic religious community.

Why are we not engaging it?</p>\n<p>The reason is because the containment itself is of a huge strategic value to us. The thing is, according to research on this subject, simultaneous occurrence of <em>two</em> ZK-class scenarios is fundamentally impossible. Therefore, as long as one of them is being contained, we guarantee that the others, which might not be so easily controlled anyhow, will not happen.</p>\n<p>In fact, we were very lucky that this object took a form that can be contained at acceptable cost, so it would not be sensible to lose such opportunity.

Due to the extremely hazardous nature of SCP-2470,\u00a0\u00a0as well as the potential threat from pro-apocalyptic religious-mystical movements and sects, on-site personnel are responsible for both containing the object, and protecting Area-141 from any and all outside threats.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Containment Zone structure\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nThe central containment volume of Area-141 headquarters is a hyperboloid-shaped room with a lower base diameter of 55 meters, upper base diameter of 42 meters, and 36 meters in height. Walls and floor structures are doubled: the outer walls, no less than 4.5 meters thick, are made of high-density pre-stressed concrete; the inner ones, 1.5 meters thick, are made of special \"adamant\" brand high-alloy steel (produced by Plant-45). The containment volume is fitted with two (2) sets of service entrance airlocks with class VI explosion resistance blast doors and an additional emergency quick-hardening compound sealing system.\n\n\n\nIn the center of the containment volume there are two concentric icosahedron-shaped shells[[footnote]] polyhedron with 20 faces [[/footnote]] installed, the diameters of their circumspheres being 8 and 12 meters respectively. The shells are supported by a two-spool suspension system and are additionally surrounded by a Faraday cage made of superconducting cable with cells no larger than 5 cm across.\n\n\n\nHigh vacuum inside the shells and the containment volume is maintained by two (2) main and six (6) backup heavy-duty turbomolecular pumps. The space between the inner and outer walls of the containment volume acts as forevacuum space and is pumped by four (4) main and four (4) reserve rotary vane pumps, which are capable of operating in an accelerated mode for no less than one (1) hour. Pumps are to be checked for serviceability on a weekly basis; preventive replacements and scheduled maintenance are to be conducted every two (2) months.\n\n\n\nArea-141's electric power supply consists of no fewer than two (2) independent external sources and two (main and reserve) stand-alone power systems with at least a 100% margin of capacity each.\n\n\n\nThe central shells are identical in structure (except for respective dimensions) and both are constructed of 20 triangular titanium plates 1.5 cm thick, mounted on a steel skeleton and adjusted to minimize gap size along matching edges. One of the plates of each shell is to be mounted on a guide rail serving as an access port, which can only be opened from the outside. The frames in question are to be connected to a stabilized voltage supply, maintaining a potential difference of 120V across the structure. \n\n\n\nThe inner surfaces of the shells are covered with luminophore compounds that radiate when conducting electricity and produce afterglow for 20 min in case of power failure. Luminophores of different colors make up an image -- a memetically active visual representation of a so-called \"Wei\u00dfschatten's imperceivable extradimensional paradox\" that irreversibly destroys general perception processes upon being perceived. Another board with the same image is located behind the outer shell access hatch, placed in such a way so as to obstruct the view of the region within three (3) metres of the shell's geometric center, should the outer shell access hatch be opened while the inner shell is compromised. Shell integrity checkup is to be conducted at least once every two weeks.\n\n\n\nInside the containment volume the following objects are also situated:\n\n* 2 spontaneous decoherence generators[[footnote]] destruction of the phenomenon of quantum entaglement[[/footnote]] (spec. product 2470-a)\n\n* 3 zero-veil generators[[footnote]]a code name; used as a means of suppression of [REDACTED].[[/footnote]] (spec. product 2470-b)\n\n* a telepathy suppression device, created using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (spec. product 2470-c)\n\n\n\nIt is essential to maintain a full stock of the aforementioned devices. In case stock supplies diminish, replacement devices are to be manufactured by the Foundation's corresponding facilities upon first request, as soon as possible, and with the highest priority. The operation procedures are explained in the corresponding manuals attached therein.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Work regulations in the containment area\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nAll works inside the containment volume are carried out by groups of no fewer than three (3) grade IV engineers, who received appropriate training and passed qualifying examination.\n\n\n\nAny works that have to be performed outside the central shells are to be conducted preferably using robots controlled remotely via a fiber-optic cable; in case human intervention is necessary, personnel must operate wearing full-body suits with fiber-optic communication. All types of wireless devices are forbidden to be handled and/or used inside the containment volume.\n\n\n\nInternal examination of the central shells is conducted only by people wearing special \u201cDissonance\u201d full-body suits (spec. product 2470-d). The suit includes: \n\n* a \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d memetic agent displaying system with 100% external area coverage;\n\n* a spectrum-correcting system built into the HUD; said system is attuned to the wavelengths the luminophore compound cells radiate in and makes the memetic agent safe for perception by suppressing specific colors;\n\n* a spatial image filtration system with high precision inertial control, that blocks the view of the area within 3 meters of the shell's geometrical center;\n\n* a chronometer with voice countdown for preset periods.\n\n\n\nAny forms of interaction between the personnel inside and outside the shells are forbidden. Staff members inside the shells communicate between each other using a set of hand signals.\n\n\n\nThe procedure of planned internal examination of the shells is performed along the following steps:\n\n**1.** Synchronizing chronometers (may be done immediately before entering the containment volume).\n\n**2.** Inertial control system calibration. It is to be done right in front of the external shell\u2019s hatch to avoid error accumulation. \n\n**3.** Activating the image filtration system, switching on the memetic agent display.\n\n**4.** Opening the external shell\u2019s hatch, starting 35-minute countdown. Two employees enter the external shell, the third one stays outside and locks the hatch behind them.\n\n**5.** One of the incomers examines the inner surface of the external shell for any integrity violations; the second examines the outer surface of the inner shell. Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.\n\n**6.** After finishing the procedure #5 the employees, considering the time left, make a decision on entering the inner shell. In case a negative decision is reached, see #10. In case of a positive decision:\n\n**7.** Opening the hatch of the inner shell. Starting the 15-minute countdown. One of the employees enters the inner shell; the other remains inside the external shell and locks the hatch from the outside.\n\n**8.** Examination of the inner surface by the incomer. It is essential to avoid any contact with the area within 3 meters of the geometrical center during the examination. Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.\n\n**9.** Regardless of the outcome of procedure #8, when finishing the 15-minute countdown, the incomer is to be in front of the hatch, being ready to leave. The hatch is to be opened by the employee outside exactly by the time the countdown is finished and only for 20 seconds, and closed and locked afterwards, regardless of circumstances.\n\n**10.** By the time the 35-minute countdown is finished, both employees are to stay near the external shell\u2019s hatch. The hatch is to be opened by the employee outside exactly by the time the countdown finishes and only for 40 seconds, and closed and locked afterwards, regardless of circumstances.\n\n**11.** Leaving the containment volume. Debriefing and progress report to the operator. In case procedures were not carried out in full, another team is to be prepared for second examination. The second examination is to be conducted completely, regardless of progress of the previous team. \n\n\n\nEmployees failing to leave the shells on time are considered KIA; no rescue missions are to be attempted under any circumstances. In case said employees are found during subsequent examinations, they are to be removed from the shells and remanded to medical staff immediately; taking off the suit and providing medical care is forbidden for any employees other than medical staff.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Emergency protocols\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nTransmission of information about the outside world into the shells in a form perceivable by the object (see description), even if not having observable consequences, is to be classified as a containment breach and aborted as soon as possible; termination of any employee is permitted if required to enact such. However, it should also be kept in mind that a deviation from the routine containment mode, as long as it remains stable, is preferable to frequent and sudden changes of the object\u2019s surroundings; for this reason, containment restoration is to be conducted through decisive action, guaranteeing solid and sustainable results.\n\n\n\nIn case of pressurization of the main containment volume, all turbomolecular pumps are to be shut off in order to prevent overload; all rotary vane pumps are to operate in overdrive mode to sustain a maximally achievable vacuum during recovery operations. If the air pressure inside of the containment volume exceeds 1 mbar, all the operations are to be conducted in sound dampening mode.\n\n\n\nIn case of visible integrity loss in any of the central shells, said shell is considered beyond repair. Instead, a new shell with a diameter 2m greater than the current outer shell is to be constructed around the central shells, if the outer shell is intact, or two successive shells if both current shells are damaged. After a new shell is put into operation, the old one is to be dismantled, removed and remelted. The current dimensions of the containment volume allow to conduct the procedure as many as five (5) times; hence, after fourth occurence of shell integrity loss and subsequent recontainment as described above, site personnel is to initiate work on containment volume expansion.\n\n\n\nIn case of significant damage to both of the shells and thus an inevitable breach of containment volume, protocol 2470-Alpha is to be engaged. High Command must be notified of the situation immediately through a special hotline. Contained objects of little avail classified as \u201cSafe\u201d or \u201cEuclid\u201d, preferably extradimensional, info- or cognitohazardous, self-replicating upon destruction, or having a particularly complex structure (see: approved SCP list), are to be brought to the breach zone before any containment restoration procedures take place.\n\n\n\nThis measure is supposed to mitigate the object's destructive influence by forcing it to spend a significant amount of time fully analyzing the complexity and inconsistencies of the aforementioned objects, while their unique properties should not allow SCP-2470 to make any substantial conclusions regarding the properties and laws of baseline reality. Any risks related to object interactions are considered justified. Permanent deployment of some of the objects from the approved SCP list inside the facilities of Area-141 is currently under review.\n\n\n\nIn case of a BI (Before Invasion) class or TCF (Total Containment Failure) class scenarios, if any local factors directly compromise the safety of Area-141, or by the order of the O5 Council, protocol 2470-Beta must be engaged in order to neutralize SCP-2470. Four executors (2 main, 2 backup) are to be selected from the approved list and delivered to Area-141. The subjects must receive instruction and conduct test procedures on D-class personnel. The main and backup pairs afterwards stand on duty with a five-minute notice to start the procedure, until protocol 2470-Beta is cancelled by a direct order from O5 Council.\n\n\n\nAt the order of High Command, or in case of sudden aggravation of the situation and loss of communication with the headquarters, the neutralization procedure is to be enacted under Area Command responsibility. After it is confirmed to be successful, the executors (both pairs) and all the D-class personnel located in Area-141 are to be terminated, any documentation relevant to SCP-2470 is to be destroyed, and Area-141 is to be evacuated and destroyed via thermonuclear charge. \n\n\n\nNeutralization of the object, regardless of all the complexities of its containment, is the very last resort and is to be avoided until absolutely necessary. For this reason, subjects from the potential executors list are not to be present in Area-141 unless protocol 2470-Beta is engaged.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Organizational aspects\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nDue to the containment procedure complexity and unacceptable potential cost of error, a training complex has been established on Area 141 grounds for the purpose of general simulation of the containment volume and the containment area. All personnel involved with containment are to regularly practice under supervision of an authorized employee with level 3 clearance and take qualification tests at least monthly. Any non-routine works and procedures can only be carried out after training course simulations and rehearsals show a 100% success rate. Exceptions to this rule are permissible only on private order of Area Director in situations of extreme time pressure.\n\n\n\nMedical staff are to conduct physical examination of the working group prior to entering the containment volume and examine all Area-141 personnel monthly. Prior to deployment in Area-141, each member of the medical staff is to read, understand and sign the classified document 2470-x (attached) with a level 4 clearance employee as witness. \n\n\n\nSignificant psychological tension caused by a large amount of important and demanding procedures associated with every entry into the containment volume (such as wearing and checking a full-body suit, passing through the four airlocks, calibrating numerous systems, working inside the shells under severe time pressure and others) necessitates extra attention to personnel\u2019s mental health. Engineers assigned to the containment volume are to be given additional vacations.\n\n\n\nAny and all research of SCP-2470 is currently forbidden. Access to the archive of previously gained/retrieved information for purposes of analysis is allowed for employees with level 3 clearance or above by direct approval of at least two O5 members.\n\n\n\nAs it is suspected that some members of the sect presumably responsible for the object's appearance or connected to it may be still alive and at large, Area-141 is considered to be under aggressive threat. Although there is no reason to believe the aforementioned cultists to have any significant forces at their disposal, they possess information about the object that may potentially help them attract the interest of, and gain support from, other potentially dangerous radical organizations. Because of that, MTF \u2588-\u2588\u2588 and \u2588-\u2588\u2588, apart from their main duties, are charged with monitoring the activity of any pro-apocalyptic groups and to actively instigate cultists to contact them by creating front radical organizations and sects.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2470 is a specific existential entity, or a perceptive element, which is objectively an initial manifestation of a ZK-class scenario. Due to insuperable obstacles related to its perception, the object's appearance, if it has any, remains unknown. Its current locus is determined indirectly, based on the area of effect it produces.\n\n\n\nSaid effect is manifested through the instantaneous disappearance of any object or event perceived by SCP-2470 from objective reality. First and foremost this applies to the most proximate aspects, which are directly accessible to the object\u2019s senses. Thereafter, as the object accumulates knowledge, gains abstract understanding of the nature of things, and makes generalizations, the effect extends to the phenomena themselves, their direct and later indirect consequences.\n\n\n\nFor instance, during the initial recovery operation, it was noted that the sound of the agents' footsteps (said agents were obstructed from sight by smokescreens) was starting to drown out due to sonic oscillations having stopped. Soon afterwards, large volumes of the air itself started to spontaneously disappear, which caused hypobaric effects. This was followed by the disappearance of several agents' legs, and finally the agents disappeared wholly and completely. In a similar fashion, at first several clots of the aforementioned smokescreen disappeared, but the effect soon spread to whole smoke clouds, followed by all active smoke grenades at the operation site. This culminated with disappearance of all smoke grenades of that specific type at the operation site, regardless of their being within range of the object's perception.\n\n\n\nDisappearance of soil caused a crater up to 200 meters deep to manifest at the location of the object's discovery (apparently, the object was somehow confused that every demanifested volume of soil brought more into view, and that slowed the process down; it did not manage to realize the Earth as a limited and finite entity). Due to constant disappearances of air, atmospheric pressure has dropped at the operation site and a steady high-current cyclone has formed. \n\n\n\nSince any generalizations of reasons behind any phenomena inevitably lead to using abstract concepts and eventually lead to logically reasoning the universe's existence per se, SCP-2470 is classified as a potential ZK-class hazard.\n\n\n\nAccording to the analysis of gathered data it was reliably established that the object possesses the following senses:\n\n* a perception of electromagnetic radiation in an extremely wide frequency range, including the visible spectrum, which is analogous to vision;\n\n* a highly sensitive perception of mechanical stimuli, which is analogous to tactile sense and hearing;\n\n* a perception of [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\nThe following senses are reasonably likely to be possessed by the object: \n\n* a direct, yet severely limited, telepathic perception;\n\n* a perception of certain quantum effects, particularly quantum superposition of states as a singular phenomenon.\n\n\n\nThe latter hypothesis is related to the events that happened during [REDACTED], as well as damage and demanifestation of (at least) equipment sensors and human sensory organs during attempts to perceive the object directly, which is apparently related to the wave function collapse that inevitably accompanies an act of perception and is seemingly perceivable by SCP-2470.\n\n\n\nMoreover, this hypothesis combined with the conclusion regarding [DATA EXPUNGED] provides an explanation to how the object manages to avoid exposure to \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d: apparently, the effect of quantum entanglement of the object in present time with itself in an immediate future, allows it to foresee the damaging effect of the memetic agent without even having a concept of its nature, and, based on that information, allows SCP-2470 to refuse to perceive it (\"to close its eyes\", metaphorically speaking). However, the fact that this //modus operandi// remains its only manner of existence for \u2588 years in containment counts in favor of the paradox's adequacy and the proficiency of the developed neutralization procedure, which is based on a forceful inoculation of a destructive meme bypassing the object's senses.\n\n\n\n[INFORMATION IS REMOVED FROM PUBLIC ACCESS. DELETION PENDING. LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE IS REQUIRED TO CONTINUE] \n\n[[collapsible show=\"Enter validation code: [_\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0]\" hide=\"Enter validation code: [*******] \u2013 Access granted.\"]]\n\nAccording to another hypothesis, the idea of SCP-2470 being a cognizing entity is not quite correct, as a ZK-class scenario can leave behind neither any knowledge of the current existence, nor any entities possessing such knowledge. Actually, the origin of the effect resulting in a ZK-class scenario lies not within the object, as we got used to thinking, but within the whole outer world. It is not the object that tears fragments away from reality, but the reality itself discharging these fragments and casting them into the most fitting place -- into the unfillable unbeing that is SCP-2470 -- as soon as they form a strong enough causal connection with it.\n\n\n\nUnbeing, as the true nature of the object, originates as a result of every successful attempt to perceive it. Thus, as unbeing is a priori singular, part of the object manifests on the information medium or inside the perceiver's mind, destroying it directly. Under this hypothesis, this explains the above-referenced effects on perception.\n\n\n\nFrom this perspective the cognizing nature of the object appears to be merely an illusion, caused by its dualistic position relative to the \"forgetting\" nature of the universe, though a virtual cogniton[[footnote]]\u00aba cognoscitive quantum\u00bb, a quasiparticle, introduced in the theory of [REDACTED] as an elementary particle, a model mind mediator[[/footnote]] related to the object, created by this impact, appears to be indistinguishable from a real one (moreover, the concepts of \"real\" and \"objective\" appear to be conventional and hardly applicable in the given context). This is what determines the object's inability to perceive \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d, but in this case it appears to be an objective and natural limitation, not related to a willed refusal to perceive. From this point of view the effectiveness of the developed neutralization procedure seems very dubious.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Recovery Log:** The first report of the object's anomalous activity came on \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.20\u2588\u2588 at about \u2588\u2588:00 from an airplane observer of FGU \u201cAvialesookhrana\u201d[[footnote]] a Russian government agency charged primarily with the aerial management of forest fires [[/footnote]], who was conducting fire safety monitoring in the [REDACTED] area. The pilot reported a huge deforested area centered around a wide, deep cavity. Communication with the pilot ceased soon afterwards. The report was intercepted by undercover Foundation agents in the MES and a reconnaissance operation with \u2588 mobile task forces was arranged.\n\n\n\nInitial hypotheses regarding the object's nature were defining it as something akin to a miniature black hole. However, primary analysis disproved this point of view and demonstrated the true nature of the anomaly. Several methods of containment and/or neutralization, such as [DATA EXPUNGED] had been applied unsuccessfully, and were followed by a proposal to use \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d in order to neutralize the object. This attempt was a partial success. Neutralization was not achieved; however, it was discovered that the paradox\u2019s carrier was not susceptible to the object\u2019s effect, which allowed the Foundation to capture SCP-2470 after several unsuccessful attempts and to develop the current containment protocols. Total losses throughout the whole operation amount to \u2588\u2588\u2588 employees.\n\n\n\n> **Excerpt from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's report:**\n\n> \n\n> There was a remarkable episode during one of the first attempts of neutralization, when, at the suggestion of agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a mirror was placed within the object\u2019s field of view. It seemed logical that, after seeing its own reflection, the object would neutralize itself. However, though the other things reflected in the mirror were subjected to its effect to the full, the object itself did not undergo any changes. Instead, it destroyed the mirror, although this action took it 12 seconds more than it usually took for items of similar scale. Also, it is obvious that the object has not been self-destructing due to self-awareness for \u2588 years already. This can be rationalized by one of the following hypotheses:\n\n>\n\n> * the object is either able to apply its effects selectively or is passively non-susceptible to them;\n\n> * the object is either unable to perceive itself, or is avoiding that;\n\n> * the object itself is uncognizable; \n\n> * the cognizable nature of the object is actually the object itself; any sort of cognition results in the object's duplication, which equals to the object growing due to its indivisible nature.\n\n> \n\n> The last hypothesis [DATA EXPUNGED] for more precise control.\n\n\n\nAccording to the data gathered later on, a small village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which had been abandoned since at least the late 80s had been situated at the initial discovery site. However, a few years before the anomaly appeared, it had been occupied with members of an unidentified, radical pro-apocalyptic religious community. The evidence of their activity is sketchy and inconsistent, though it suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The O5-\u2588\u2019s memorandum to Area-141 personnel\" hide=\"The transcript of O5-\u2588\u2019s message to the personnel of Area-141 (hide)\"]]\n\n> Dear colleagues!\n\n> After the command of Area-141 informed me of certain popular perceptions among your community, I saw it right to explain certain particularities regarding our policy on SCP-2470.\n\n> \n\n> Yes, this object is exactly as dangerous as you were told or, probably, even more. Thus far our only salvation was the fact that the embryonic state of its mind cannot comprehend many of the things we consider obvious: that air is not nothingness and exists not just when it feels a breeze, that Earth is a celestial body of a finite size, that the Sun is not a flat shining spot on the horizon, that people, despite how different they are, all represent humankind as a whole, and so on.\n\n> \n\n> Yes, it is essential to keep the object in complete isolation and to avert any transmission of the most insignificant information at any cost. It learns very fast and we can never be sure which grain of knowledge it lacks to be given a nudge to the ideas of space, time, infinity and universe.\n\n> \n\n> Yes, it is both difficult and dangerous to contain such an object, and yes, we do possess a procedure of its neutralization. Why are we not engaging it?\n\n> \n\n> The reason is because the containment itself is of a huge strategic value to us. The thing is, according to research on this subject, simultaneous occurrence of //two// ZK-class scenarios is fundamentally impossible. Therefore, as long as one of them is being contained, we guarantee that the others, which might not be so easily controlled anyhow, will not happen.\n\n> \n\n> In fact, we were very lucky that this object took a form that can be contained at acceptable cost, so it would not be sensible to lose such opportunity. Therefore, containment will be carried out as long as we can manage, with neutralization being planned only for such an extreme case when the object's direct threat will be big enough to negate all of our prospects of carrying this policy out in the future, along with the future itself.\n\n> \n\n> Through thick and thin you have to know that your work guarantees humanity's continued existence. Treat it properly.\n\n> \n\n> Secure. Contain. Protect.\n\n> \n\n> Sincerely yours, \u041e5-\u2588.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The list of enactors and the methodology for procedure of the object's neutralization\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n\nThe procedure is to be performed by two (2) subjects possessing confirmed telepathic abilities rated at no less than 9 points on the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 scale, with a satisfactory result for 2470-qt spatial awareness test, no history of earlier exposure and no impairments (such as color-blindness) that affect visual and color perception. In case the list is down to 30 positions or fewer for whatever reason, use of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for development of telepathic abilities in suitable candidates is authorized for the purpose of replenishing the list. As of today \u2588\u2588 individuals are on the list, namely:\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nImmediately after protocol 2470-Beta is engaged, there is a preliminary measure that consists of building an additional shell according to the requirements for inner shell breach scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe executors must be kept in ignorance of the true purpose of the Area; a cover story of it being a telepathy research center and the process being a test of their abilities is to be adhered to. Additionally the subjects must not know about each other\u2019s existence; violation of this condition is grounds for immediate termination and a selection of new candidates.\n\n\n\nThe neutralization procedure is performed using an adapted version of \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d, divided into two subcomponents, both safe to be perceived separately. The subjects\u2019 task is to memorize one of the subcomponents and to implant it synchronously into the mind of the entity, which is located in the center of the shell, demonstrated to them using live transmission. The active 2470-c telepathy suppression device is to be switched off five (5) seconds before the subjects are authorized to act, and should be kept offline for at least 15 but no more than 25 seconds. Trial runs for this procedure are conducted at the on-site training complex using a Class D test subject; at least three successful trial runs in succession are required before the performers are cleared for work. When taking part in the actual procedure, the subjects must not know it is not a trial run.\n\n\n\nAfter the procedure is performed, the first inspection is conducted by switching off the the inner shell power for 30 (thirty) minutes. In case the inner shell shows no change in its electrical performance and has no other signs of structural damage, the inspection is considered passed. The second inspection is conducted visually, by means of employees entering the central shell wearing protective suits with the spatial image filtration system turned off. If the procedure is successful, the shell should not have anything inside.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3: document 2470-x.**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Medical staff only.\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n//This document is intended for the medical staff of Area 141 only. Divulgence of any details contained herein is to result in termination. Any other employee displaying knowledge of the contents of this document is to be (aside from an appropriate disciplinary action) treated with an A-class amnestic and transferred to another Foundation facility.//\n\n\n\nThe medical staff of Area 141 are to pay extra attention to psychological health assessment of employees during periodical personnel surveys. Aside from disorders that are natural for conditions of strenuous work, special effort must be put into discovering the following complex of symptoms:\n\n* repetitive dreams featuring an abstract pulsing and growing black mass, identified as SCP-2470 by the examinee;\n\n* total lack of any dreams soon thereafter (in less than a week);\n\n* flattening of affects, progressive indifference to surroundings, and reactions becoming mechanical;\n\n* repeating episodes in which the examinee looks at a common everyday object for a long time with an uncommon curiosity.\n\n\n\nA lack of any discernible dreams lasting for two weeks is considered a sufficient warrant for a suspension and quarantine assessment. The quarantine implicates a termination of any forms of communication with any personnel not involved in the process of assessment.\n\n\n\nTo ensure reliable diagnosis, a trust relationship with the personnel is to be set and maintained. It is recommended to present the practice of regular discussions of dreams as a preliminary phase of psychological survey, aimed at distraction from the current situation and relaxation. The keen interest in nightmares can be explained as a search for hidden reasons for nervousness and analysis of suppressed fears.\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned diagnosis should be given top priority for personnel involved in procedures taking place inside the containment volume and central shells, and especially for those who spent unscheduled time inside for whatever reasons. The latter are to be quarantined immediately and thoroughly examined for no less than two weeks. Everyone who spent more than an hour and a half inside the outer shell or more than an hour inside the inner shell are to be considered to fail the inspection, regardless of observed state.\n\n\n\nAll diagnosed cases are to be processed as soon as possible. Employees with diagnosed symptoms are to be put in an artificial coma under pretense of an insignificant surgical intervention, given two complete cycles of D-class amnestic treatment, and subsequently euthanized by a neurotoxin injection and cremated. The rest of personnel are to be given a cover story implicating that the employee is dismissed for medical reasons and transferred to another Foundation facility.\n\n\n\nYou will receive the instructions on covering the above-referenced activity from your ISD case officers.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-2469]]] | SCP-2470 | [[[SCP-2471]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=theTBAPb, translated by Gene R, Dr Kostyankyn]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Original Article:** https://scpfoundation.net/scp-1001-ru\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-2469", "scp-2471", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "scp": "SCP-2470", "scp_number": 2470, "series": "international", "tags": ["_licensebox", "_ru", "infohazard", "international", "k-class-scenario", "keter", "mind-affecting", "observational", "religious", "scp", "telepathic"], "title": "SCP-2470", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2470"}, "SCP-4194": {"created_at": "2019-05-27T06:35:00", "creator": "deleted", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2019-05-27T06:35:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2019-05-27T08:59:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2019-05-27T09:09:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2019-05-27T09:51:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2019-05-27T10:16:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "", "date": "2019-06-04T14:31:00"}, {"author": "Accelerando", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/accelerando", "comment": "Added tags: alive, animal, avian, euclid, hive-mind, k-class-scenario, scp, species.

This lack of perception extends to depictions of humans as well, including photos, drawings, and mannequins. No genetic or cognitive cause for this anomaly has yet been discovered.\n\n\n\nDue to their anomalous effects, SCP-4194 instances have an extreme disadvantage in the wild. While estimating the original date of SCP-4194 extinction is difficult due to their similarity to passenger pigeons, evidence suggests it may have been as early as 1898, about 16 years before the extinction of common passenger pigeons.\n\n\n\nThe SCP-4194 instances now contained by the Foundation are clones of original instances, produced by a civilian organization that experimented on extinct species, such as passenger pigeons. Instances were first thought to be the result of an unknown genetic flaw developed during the cloning process, but cognitive testing revealed their anomalous effects when attempting to perceive humans, resulting in the intervention of Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** In 12/15/2017, the following document was found in the revision history of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 documentation during a routine check of the Foundation database. The document was severely corrupted. Research to reveal possible connections between this document and SCP-4194 is ongoing.\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> **Object Class:** Keter\n\n> \n\n> **Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Epsilon-3 (\"Tyltyl And Mytyl\") are to terminate every instance of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. If it is considered impossible to terminate all instances in a given area, MTF Epsilon-3 is to abandon the area and terminate any civilians. Containment fails if a million instances are extant, [DATA CORRUPTED].\n\n> \n\n> **Description:** SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are [DATA CORRUPTED], alike to passenger pigeons (//Ectopistes migratorius//). Objects have a collective consciousness, increasing their intelligence as their numbers grow.\n\n> \n\n> The growth rate of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is proportional to the number of human or human-like things (photos and pictures describing humans, mannequins, etc) they recognize, which is almost per \u25883\u2588. As a result, a group of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 instances in an urban area poses a significant threat to human life after one day. Instances are aware of this fact, so they actively seek out human beings.\n\n> \n\n> A sufficient number of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 instances are likely capable of surpassing the cognitive abilities of all mankind, combined. Also [DATA CORRUPTED], a SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario is deemed likely.\n\n> \n\n> **Addendum:** The current growth rate of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 projects a containment breach within \u25889 days. To prevent this situation, p\u2588\u2588\u2588o\u2588\u2588l b\u2588\u2588t has been proposed, which would destroy '[DATA CORRUPTED]', altering the idea of 'humanity'. This will cause a intentional IK-Class Idea Failure Scenario.\n\n> \n\n> It is not certain at this time if this proposal will neutralize all SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It is possible said action may doom humanity in an unforeseen way. Unfortunately, the Foundation sees no alternative. Only we can assume this burden. [DATA CORRUPTED], we will never miss that again.\n\n> \n\n> God help our ideas.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-4193]]] | SCP-4194 | [[[SCP-4195]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n", "references": ["scp-4193", "scp-4195"], "scp": "SCP-4194", "scp_number": 4194, "series": "international", "tags": ["_ko", "alive", "animal", "bird", "euclid", "hive-mind", "international", "k-class-scenario", "scp", "species"], "title": "SCP-4194", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4194"}, "SCP-5240": {"created_at": "2020-10-28T14:23:00", "creator": "LanceRadioactive", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "LanceRadioactive", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lanceradioactive", "comment": "Initial commit", "date": "2020-10-28T14:23:00"}, {"author": "LanceRadioactive", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lanceradioactive", "comment": "SCP number fix", "date": "2020-10-28T14:24:00"}, {"author": "LanceRadioactive", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lanceradioactive", "comment": "Uploaded multiple files.", "date": "2020-10-28T14:26:00"}, {"author": "LanceRadioactive", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lanceradioactive", "comment": "Fixed Morgenstern (non-)link", "date": "2020-10-28T14:36:00"}, {"author": "deleted", "author_href": false, "comment": "Added tags: scp, thaumiel.

The object's distinction lies in complete lack of information pertaining to it in any historical or contemporary records. This is achieved by widespread use of anomalously programmed chemical agents causing varied effects of amnesia and altered cognition.</p>\n<p>On \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.19\u2588\u2588 the object came into contact with the Foundation in person on one of its former operating frequencies and offered a mutually beneficial agreement; in exchange for supply of food and technical goods SCP-5240 provides the Foundation a wide assortment of amnestics and accepts requests to release vast quantities of \"Ennui\"- and \"Global\"-class programmable substances into the atmosphere. A two-way communication device was assembled to that purpose, which is used by SCP-5240 to relay schedules of required produce and by the Foundation to request delivery of amnestics. Despite lack of knowledge pertaining to the object's location, mutual delivery chains have been established and operate without de-masking SCP-5240. The agreement also lists a non-interference clause, in accordance with which the Foundation does not perform active search for the object, and the object acts upon the Foundation's requests to release amnestics without objection.</p>\n<p>To enhance mutual trust and to alleviate any technical difficulties, SCP-5240 has allowed a single Foundation representative to enter its territory - logistics specialist Alfred Bruske. The subject has been allowed to send service correspondence and photographs under agreement not to perform acts of industrial or other sabotage.</p>\n<p>The Foundation has only limited general intelligence pertaining to SCP-5240, acquired by Alfred Bruske:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the moniker of \"the City\" is used in common talk and official documents. Rarely the citizens mention the name \"Fehlerstadt\";</li>\n<li>the City's population count is unknown; by estimation of an agent with no prior knowledge of investigative analytics, it can be estimated at 500-650 thousand people. The size of the City's suburban regions is unknown;</li>\n<li>the City's citizens converse in German. Their cultural specificities are so negligible (imperceptible) that it is not possible to reliably attribute them to the German or any other nation;</li>\n<li>the City is located in hilly terrain; low mountains are visible on the horizon. A river flows through the object's territory. The outer perimeter of the city's developed area is lined with an abandoned and unguarded complex of engineered obstacles in the form of a concrete wall, crooked watchtowers and rows of rusted barbed wire;</li>\n<li>the City's information development, transport and other technologies are approximately in line with the middle of the XX century.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-5240 has massive industrial potential by way of abundance of chemical plants chaotically dispersed throughout the City's territory. The majority of citizenry is employed in these facilities, the only function of which is production of a wide spectrum of amnestic substances. Some of them are dispersed into the atmosphere in gaseous form, or into the river in liquid form. It is supposed that such measures are required for the City in order to maintain concealment of its existence from the worldwide community, to protect itself against diplomatic pressure (or military intervention), and to halt outwards cultural expansion.</p>\n<p>The chemical plants are supplied by large produce storage sites, as well as interlinked with a branching network of large and small pipes that route through the entirety of the City: along streets, above houses, through buildings and apartments (some heated precursors are used as conductors for central heating systems). SCP-5240's metro system is likewise adapted to the needs of the industrial complex. The metro and above-ground rail lines connect all the main amnestic factories; stations are named after the neighbouring chemical plants (\"Combine \u21167\", \"Factory \u211616\" etc.; the only exception is the \"Ministry\" station).</p>\n<p>The medium industry and car manufacture work in the interest of the chemical sector. Only a small portion of the City's factories creates consumer goods, which is why the society of SCP-5240 experiences a perpetual deficit. More than half of consumer labels are distributed under directive.</p>\n<p>Ubiquitous factory exhaust pipes are always in use, creating multicoloured smog and scented fog; constant leaks from overused pipelines and factory accidents additionally worsen the ecological situation. SCP-5240's citizenry is unanimously afflicted with respiratory illnesses.</p>\n<p>Periodically, in accordance with the Ministry's schedule (or by the Foundation's request), a \"dispersal event\" is announced in SCP-5240. The City's siren and loudspeaker system is activated, warning the citizens about the time and duration of the event, the amnestic used and the prescribed order of actions for personal protection.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> The object's citizens always carry a bag with a gas mask and a set of filters in their possession, every person learns the names of all amnestics, their composition, locale of production, approximate production cycle structure, identification and counteraction measures by heart. The standard citizen rations include a mnestics package distributed in the form of drag\u00e9 pellets and dissoluble powders.</p>\n<p>SCP-5240 maintains a set of outdated (but never repealed) restrictions on its territory, enforced by \"the Central Department for City Rasure\" (Stadtvergessenheitshauptamt, SVHA). Despite the citizenry's lack of memory regarding the cause for such restrictions, the following items are prohibited within Fehlerstadt: historical photographs and portraits of people, documentary movies, diaries, biographies and books on history, antiquities, weapons, blazons, flags, any and all recording or retelling of information regarding the City's \"previous epoch\", as well as overall interest to it. The citizens are neutral in regards to the restrictions, and abide by them habitually with no resistance. The rare violators are reported by their peers and neighbours to the SVHA. Restricted items are burned in pyres, found criminals are permanently taken away in an unknown direction. All of the City's monuments, memorials, bas-reliefs and other historic cites have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>Alfred Bruske's official reports are under classification code \"Clearance level 5\".

It was dark, and rain drummed loudly out the window. I barely managed to find the switch to the lamp by touch, and turn it on. Two tall men in dark leather coats appeared from the darkness. One of them spoke in German and presented himself as my \"curator\". I almost thought that I've been captured by the Stasi Section XXV, but no, I've been briefed on the matter: I am on the grounds of some city concealed from public eyes, and I represent the SCP Foundation in the matters of developing mutual arrangements in the chemical sector. I am to relay cursory information about production of some sort of chemicals in this city, and I am to negotiate delivery of equipment and metalworks. So I've been made an ambassador of sorts and allowed to send private letters to the Foundation once per day under condition that I will not blatantly spy on them. All my questions about how I ended up here and who even sanctioned this in the first place remained unanswered. One of the tall men said that I will need to undergo prolonged acclimatization to the city's conditions, then they had me take a couple pills and go back to sleep.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-1\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#4 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>It's been three days now\u2026 They've finally graced me with permission to go outside. I am indeed sickly, the air is just filled with all manners of smells that cause anything from vomit reflexes to absolute bliss. Depends on which way the wind's blowing.</p>\n<p>Occasionally I'm down with dry cough. The air in this place is almost visible on occasion, it hangs like smoke. Today it's kinda violet.</p>\n<p>It's a truly fascinating view. I've observed the City only through a murky window up until now, and saw only dense rows of apartment buildings with uncountable factory pipes belching many-coloured wisps of smoke between them. The streets are thoroughly shadowed by massive cistern towers lined with carcasses of ladder and walkway. Clouds hang low in the sky, shimmering with rainbow hues like spilled kerosene on asphalt. And there's pipes. Pipelines, pipelines, pipelines. Valves, throttles, bell cranks, four-ways. They're everywhere here. The network of pipes is like a multileveled web hanging above the streets and the dwellings, it enters directly into homes, my own bed stands on one such pipe. Sometimes, here or there, thin white streams breach out of them. My curator said that's just working gas from the overworked pneumatic system and that there's nothing to worry about - amnestic leaks are rather rare.</p>\n<p>Amnestics. Yes, I heard that right. That's what they produce in such enormous volume that it'd be enough to coat the whole globe in rainbow clouds. What the best minds of the Foundation spent a decade on and what we produce in such precious little quantity is mass-produced here. And that's not all. The local amnestics exceed all comparison with ours. They are more stable, more effective, their duration can be varied, their effects - programmed. It's obvious some anomalous tech it involved. The curator told me that the Foundation will receive it all at its disposal in exchange for providing goods that I, as a logistics specialist, will need to arrange. A small price to pay for such possibilities, isn't that so?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-2\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#6 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>I've been assigned a separate office in the Ministry. Every day I rise at 6\u00a0o'clock, drag through the pink mist and get on the metro on the \"Combine \u21166\". It's only two stations' ride away from the Ministry, but there's plenty of time to have a good look at the locals. Ashen-grey stares and rough skin, worker overalls often stained or burnt by chemicals. The people mostly talk trifle, usually discussing their colleagues and their quotas. There's something strange in their language, though, I can't figure out what. They speak seemingly normal German, but their way of speaking is unnatural. As if there's something missing. As if something's been removed.</p>\n<p>Oh, and food at home's all out, I was given meal tickets. Very generous, by the way, compared to the locals' rations. I feel sort of guilty spending them all in one place, and I don't want to attract attention, so I do my shopping in pieces all over the place - and I get to walk the City along the way. This is it - the socialist utopia. Are you sure I'm not in the GDR? No, it's far too backwards - no Trabants, no Spreewaldgurkens. None of the products have labels or names or colourful packaging. Only \"Beer\", only \"Porridge\", only \"Flour\". No salt at all, by the way, but there's plenty of matches. Oh, and the rations include mnestics, and I get them in extra large supply. According to what the cashier from one of the shops under a giant rusted pipe told me off the record, the nearby \"Combine \u21166\" is a record holder when it comes to monthly amnestic and precursor spill accidents. That's why the populace are given these pills. And they take them all the time, for the City has planned dispersals, too. And who knows what else is in the air, anyhow.</p>\n<p>Ah, something else. Had an interesting situation happen to me today. I had to pass a medical check-up against symptoms of chemical poisoning. The nurse asked me for my date of birth, and I replied. Then she picked up the phone, called into the \"Ministry Information Department\", and asked to give her today's date. Once she got it, she put my birth date and today's date into a special brass arithmometer, which handed out my age after a few cranks of the handle. In years, precision down to a tenth. \"Why?\" - I asked. - \"I could've just told you my age myself\". \"Really?\" - the woman replied in surprise, - \"That's just amazing. Oh well - we always do this, no big deal.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-3\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#8 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Everything's going fine, overall. We've designed a way of exchanging produce that would technologically satisfy the City and keep its location in secret at the same time. The first batch of chemical component canisters has arrived from outside - soon they will be emptied, deactivated, and filled with freshly made amnestics. The headquarters requested aerosol and liquid compounds of limited effective duration, a few days, for a first test run. If this stuff passes field testing, the Foundation will begin buying it en masse immediately. Injections costing upwards of thousands of dollars? Forget that. We'll be able to cover whole settlements in months, maybe in weeks. And yes, I'm currently in talks about using their mass atmospheric amnestic dispersal systems. It's too early to say anything about that, though.</p>\n<p>Other than designing deliveries, I've started to work on amnestic and mnestic classificators. It's a very important project, I think, because the City produces - think about it - 63 different types of amnestics and 27 types of mnestics. All of those are produced in different forms - pills, gasses, liquids. All of them have different effects, storage, usage and safety requirements\u2026 It's a lot of work, in short. Strangely enough, the local specialists live just fine without any classification or guidance. Or not even specialists - ordinary people! There was a boy riding by me on a bike with a toy gas mask on his hip - in response to my simple question about where his father worked he spouted out half the production queue of four different short-term amnestics! He'd tell me more if men in black hadn't arrived out of nowhere to guide him home. It turned out they were agents of the SVHA - a local special service whose purpose is to not only maintain law and order, but, as my curator explained, \"to prevent recollection poisoning\". I have no idea what that could mean.</p>\n<p>Weird folk. Amnestics are a sort of national idea for them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-4\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#12 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Stable food supply lines have been established. Already, thanks to the Foundation, the city has cancelled tickets for bread and meat, and a few more types of goods are planned in the future.</p>\n<p>The citizens' leisure comes in the form of pubs and clubs, where they consume alcohol in abundance, play cards and watch the only TV channel available. Conversations revolve around the everyday grind. I've decided to exchange a few words with the local workers in one of those places, find out how they like living without meat tickets. What do you know? Nobody even remembered tickets were a thing despite having to stand in queues only a week ago.</p>\n<p>And there it got to me. Now I understand what I've found so odd in their speech. It's difficult to formulate, their manner of speaking is entirely different. Basically, they actively avoid any lexical constructions that have so much as a tint of past tense. There's no \"was\", only \"is\", \"now\", \"always\". They don't think of the past, don't talk about the past, don't perceive the past, don't use it as a foundation to compare to the present.</p>\n<p>There is a very unique relation to time here. As in, there is none. The passage of time is only remembered when it is really necessary. Usually that entails duration of chemical processes, issues of pension and so on. They have no calendars. The City lacks any and all celebrations or days off, official or not. No New Year's, no Christmas, no birthdays. And every time I ask \"What day of the week is it?\", I always receive the answer \"Monday\".</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-5\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#16 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Today I got hit by a dispersal event for the first time.</p>\n<p>Back on my first day I was given a bag with a gas mask and a collection of 8 small filters with differently-coloured markings. Occasionally, in one district or another, they held mock dispersal events or combine accidents. The people ran here and there, put on gas masks, put the \"poisoned\" under IV drips. They came up to me, too. \"Citizen, there's an accident involving Berhin-C at \"Combine \u21166\", you are poisoned and have lost the capacity for long-term memory.\" All of that was moreso amusing to me. These events happened far too often. Still, I couldn't help but admire the precision and coordination of these people in an emergency.</p>\n<p>And there it was for real, this time. Sirens roared up everywhere, loudspeakers on the lampposts started reading through the dispersal message in a raspy voice. I fumbled, not knowing what to do. While everyone grabbed their gas masks and started looking for the right filters, I just stood there and stared, fascinated. Then everyone ran for the metro, and a person from the SVHA ran to me and started shouting something like \"Are you mad? Mask on, magenta filter, right now! Run for the metro!\". The agent grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the nearest station's vestibule. In the meanwhile, everything around started vibrating ever so slightly, a rumbling hum emanated from the pipes, it felt like the tension in the system was about to rip it apart from the inside. But no, none of that happened. 15 minutes later, with a quiet pop and a long, pangent roar, the dispersal went off. Everything quieted down, while we had to remain underground for two hours more until the all-clear.</p>\n<p>When I returned home, I saw how my downstairs neighbour casually went to the lady across from me, as if there was his home. And he remained there overnight, even though his wife and two kids lived a flight below there. Something tells me this dim mechanic from the third combine isn't having sordid affairs, but just forgets where and with whom he lives. Or maybe he doesn't care. I don't know. Nobody chases him off, regardless.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-6\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#27 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>My negotiations have successfully concluded and I've been permitted to the holiest place of all - into the dispersal control centre, up atop the tower of Combine \u21161 - the oldest of the City, from the looks of it. A test dispersal was to happen on request from the Foundation. A functional compound, but the only program imprinted upon it was memory deletion from those who would register it in air tests (aside from the Foundation, of course). A dud designed to test the effectiveness of the procedure.</p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time rising in an old-timey manual elevator among brown-old metallic constructions and finally ended up in a spacious room, filled to the brim with levers, pipes, manometers and buttons. A giant schematic of the city resided on the far wall, dotted with different blinking lights representing the chemical plants. The operators took their positions and waited in place.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, after a short alarm, an automatic typing machine whirred horridly and dispensed a paper with a filled out dispersal request log from the Foundation. The shift foreman ripped out half of it (with the amnestic program), signed it and threw it into the pneumatic mail. I'll try to describe all the dialogues on the \"bridge\" from memory from here on (with approximate numbers, of course):</p>\n<p>- Dispersal request! Class \"T\", fuliruline, 1700 tonnes per hour, 15 minutes, height - 13 kilometers! Calculate dispersal readiness! Calculate meteorological conditions! Test gas feed into the atmosphere!</p>\n<p>People began running around in a rush, some clacked their counting machines, some started making phone calls, some began studying the weather station readings, some selectively called different combines and information bureaus. The operators pressed different buttons with dutiful expressions.</p>\n<p>- Fuliruline stores satisfactory, Combines 1, 4, 7, 9, as well as Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 all stand ready for dispersal! - an employee reported.</p>\n<p>- Atmospheric conditions satisfactory, wind is N-N-W, 7 metres per second, surface-level pressure is 757 milimetres of mercury, temperature is 17 degrees Celcius, working height pressure is 120 milimetres of mercury, temperature is -56 degrees Celicus! All parameters meet fuliruline use requirements! - the weather station worker reported.</p>\n<p>- CHPP 1, CHPP 2, CHPP 3! Dispersal systems operating normally, ready to provide working pressure to the system, - a rasping voice called out from the radio station.</p>\n<p>- Beginning dispersal procedure, proceed with performing operations according to checklist! - the foreman commanded.</p>\n<p>- Declare emergency! \u2013 the foreman assistant read out the first point of the list. The worker at the panel pressed a few buttons and began reading out the warning text into the microphone. Sirens started blaring throughout the City. The citizens, not much more than small black dots from so far up above, began scattering in all directions.</p>\n<p>- Emergency in effect!</p>\n<p>- Working shift, put on your masks! Teal filter! \u2013 shouted the assistant, and a minute later everyone looked at each other through mask lenses.</p>\n<p>- Check channel functionality!</p>\n<p>- Leak in pipeline 271-A, ordering to use pipeline 271-B! Pressure critical in cistern 67, failure of both throttles, ordering to vent and redirecting to Combine \u21161.</p>\n<p>Dozens of manometers and sensors came to life on the walls, their readings climbing up monotonously. One after another, control lamps began to light up.</p>\n<p>- System pressure at 40%! Pumping amnestic now! \u2013 reported an employee, having turned away from the gas-discharge indicator.</p>\n<p>- Test civil service readiness! \u2013 the foreman's assistant went down the line.</p>\n<p>- Evacuation underway, all ill persons, the children and the elderly are secure in basement shelters. All executives are at their posts.</p>\n<p>- Test amnestic program!</p>\n<p>- Program ready!</p>\n<p>- System pressure at 60%! Feeding programmable fuliruline precursor!</p>\n<p>The pipes began shaking noticeably. The manometer arrows climbed into the red. A low monotonous hum pressed down on the ears, even the thick gas mask offered no protection.</p>\n<p>- Test control line closure!</p>\n<p>- Line is closed! No disruptions present!</p>\n<p>- System pressure at 80%! Decision point!</p>\n<p>- Continue!</p>\n<p>The floor began shaking intensely, thin trails of whitewash flaked off from above. The City outside was covered in hundreds of small vapor trails, erupting here and there from the runoff valves.</p>\n<p>- Readiness report! \u2013 the assistant shouted into the radio. The receiver screeched voices in response.</p>\n<p>- Combine 1 ready!</p>\n<p>- Combine 4 ready!</p>\n<p>- Combine 7 ready!</p>\n<p>- Combine 9 ready!</p>\n<p>- Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 ready!</p>\n<p>- System pressure 100%! Amnestic has been pumped, programmed and is ready for use, - the assistant foreman reported loudly.</p>\n<p>The whole room was shaking as if in a 6-point earthquake, the manometer arrows slammed viciously into the redlines. It was difficult to stand. The whole tableau shone with lights, several sirens and alarms struggled to overpower the low drone of overloaded pipes.</p>\n<p>Everyone present on the bridge stood at attention in silence. The foreman turned to a mysterious old man, who spent the entire procedure quietly sitting in his chair on a small pedestal.</p>\n<p>- Ready for dispersal. Awaiting your command.</p>\n<p>The man looked at the foreman, his blue-tinted gas mask glasses shining, calmly rose and approached the central control desk. After taking an unusual key hanging on a string off his neck, the stranger plugged it into the panel's keyhole and turned it. Among the hundreds of blinking lights a big one, marked \"Ready\", lit up. The panel's large metallic cover opened up, revealing a breaker lever beneath it. The man grasped the lever, cast his eyes out the window, and declared loudly:</p>\n<p>- Disperse!</p>\n<p>The whole area jolted. I failed to hold steady and fell to a knee with a painful thud against the metal floor. The manometer readings calmed down and began to slowly climb their way down, lights on the schematic dimmed one by one. Swirling violet gas rose in mighty streams into the sky from the multitudes of pipes and cisterns.</p>\n<p>My report to the Foundation today is going to be fabulous.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-7\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#35 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>An agit-prop brigade wheeled around on the street today. An old-looking truck with medical crosses on the side and loudspeakers on the roof rallied something about \"recollection poisoning\", preliminary symptoms and methods of curing the disease (by taking amnestics, naturally). The nurses in dusty white robes handed out booklets to the passersby, and a group of SVHA agents followed, updating the worn lists of forbidden items hanging around on billboards. Some of the agents approached those standing about and asked something along the lines of \"does anything cause you sensations of vague anxiety, guilt, fear or despair\"? Those who couldn't clearly answer warranted a search. By the evening the event concluded in destruction of prohibited items. Since none such were actually found, they had to resort to a symbolic pyre of old workbooks and unneeded truss rods from a nearby construction site. People brought seats out with them and lounged about to watch the fire. Children played about noisily, playing \"SVHA\" (throwing \"prohibited\" rocks into the fire) or \"dispersal\". It seems there are celebrations in this City after all.</p>\n<p>P.S. From a conversation between a nurse and a SVHA lad I got to overhear a different name of the city - \"Fehlerstadt\", and also that the SVHA, in their line of duty, is allowed to \"remember a bit more\".</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-8\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#47 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>The Ministry.</p>\n<p>It's interesting to observe this regime. It's a unique specimen of a decentralised bureaucratic dictatorship. Matter-of-factly, there are several leading titles with enormous privileges, but they are not actually taken by anyone, since there is no hierarchy leading up to them. There are normative acts describing the rights and duties of these roles, but there are no instructions on their appointment. The giant cabinets with oak doors on the top floors of the Ministry are empty to this day, and although cleaning is done daily, the dust gathering there does not get any less.</p>\n<p>There is no \"upper class\", no \"party\", no coalition or ruling caste. Nothing. Only a giant bureaucratic machine operating on decades-old and very rarely corrected rules and directives. Instructions. Those set the ball here, without them everything would come apart in instants. The structure of the governing system is complex and confusing, there is no familiar hierarchy \"tree\" or \"pyramid\". The links between manager and underling are interwoven, contradictory, inconsistent and often circular. It is not rare to witness mutual command (where two employees are both bosses and subordinates to each other), or cases of \"I am the boss of my boss's boss\".</p>\n<p>The career trajectory here is not a ladder but a Mobius band, tens of them, interwoven in a terrible, logic- and geometry-defying knot. Everyone always moves forward only to end up where they started. The bureaucrats climb their way up without stopping, change cabinets and titles, but their efforts are futile. In time, everyone returns to their old place from where they started, yet that won't be a failure or regression, no, it's a great achievement. They will be tapped on the shoulder, congratulated for attaining such high rank, such trust. People will reacquaint themselves with old colleagues, maybe only with a change of seats or positions. For a while. Until next time they are reassigned, until next time they part, until next time they meet.</p>\n<p>And moving back on the Mobius band is no different. Same applies here. Except you'll be berated, not congratulated. Although, even then, it's all the same.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-9\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#51 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Finally home, I need to write something stat</p>\n<p>I was walking down the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and suddenly found it. It was on the facade of an old house, pincushioned with pipes jotting out everywhere, but still beautiful and imposing. They tried to break it off and did a good job at it, it wouldn't have been visible at all on a cloudy day, but today the sun peeked out, the shadows fell just right and revealed this guilty secret. It was a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Yes, it was exactly it, it's difficult to mistake these right-angle hooks for something else. There was a broken round border around it - probably an oaken wreath. While a storm of thoughts was blowing through my head, I got to a different alley. \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Why is it here? It shouldn't be here. It shouldn't. No. It NEEDS to be here. Why have I decided that? I don't know, but I feel it in my insides\". I then swayed, bent over in half and nearly fell, just barely caught some valve on a gas pipe. I started retching. Passersby ran over to me along with SVHA agents coming out of nowhere. Now I'm completely certain they \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 everywhere and all the time.</p>\n<p>For a fraction of a second a vision came over me, or a hallucination, rather. The faces of those around became distorted inhuman grimaces for a moment. I jolted and crawled back a bit, startled. \"What did you see? - asked one of the SVHA, - Those are primary recollection poisoning symptoms. Tell us the source and we'll destroy it\". I didn't tell them the truth. \"What are you talking about? I didn't see anything, I'm just unwell\". The agents side-eyed me, but decided not to argue and just handed out a package of amnestics \"just in case\". After coming together, I ran home post-haste to write this letter. We know for certain, now, the City was under \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I don't know how this will affect our work. Luckily, I don't think any problems came up at all.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-10\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#52 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Something horrible happened tonight.</p>\n<p>I was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly heard screams. Screams and moans of hundreds melding together into one ensemble of horror. There was a crash at the stairs, and in a moment my curator from SVHA broke into the room, bolted the door behind him and backed it up by a drawer for good measure.</p>\n<p>- It's them! Do you hear them!? IT'S THEM! \u2013 the curator spoke in a trembling voice, grabbing me by the sleeve.</p>\n<p>- Who are \"they\"?</p>\n<p>- Nobody. They don't exist. They don't! And never have! \u2013 he replied in hysteria. \u2013 But oh, how they scream!</p>\n<p>- What does that\u2026 What do they need?</p>\n<p>- They need to scream. Scream! And knock! Why scream, why knock!? - and then long shadows started flickering in the band of light under the door. The curator noticed that and began to beg, pale with fright, - Just don't let them in. Don't let them in!</p>\n<p>A pounding noise joined the unbearable chorus of screaming people. They beat on the door, so much that it felt like it was about to break off the hinges. The curator fell to the floor and covered his head with his hands. He was in convulsions, blood poured in thin streams out of his ears.</p>\n<p>I didn't know what to do. The maddening noise was not ceasing at all. To my horror, I noticed that they started beating from inside the walls. The window was my only retreat. Ready to vault off the 4th floor, I cast open the curtain and saw a thick brick wall instead of the lights of distant chemical plants. Refusing to believe my eyes, I hit it with my hand, hoping to destroy it. A white handprint remained on it. My hand somehow got stained with something greyish-yellow.</p>\n<p>- One, two, three, four\u2026 screamers banging at the door\u2026 - the SVHA man counted, barely audibly, on the floor. - Three-four, two-and-one, bring amnestics here right now.</p>\n<p>With a sharp turn I dashed to the bedside drawer, which should have still held that package of amnestics they gave in the day.</p>\n<p>- Pump the gasses faster yet, breathe it deep and just forget. Turn the valves up faster still, we won't have no judge nor king. Oh, the pink clouds floating free, take away our ennui.</p>\n<p>I grabbed the pills that I refused to drink in the evening and took them all in one gulp. My legs gave out, and I fell into darkness.</p>\n<p>Yes, it turns out that was just a dream. The whole package was where it belonged once morning came.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-11\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#54 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Had nightmares again. Screams, screech of fingernails and dull thrumming from inside the walls. I woke again and again only to find that I was still dreaming and that the screaming people never went away. Only the rays of morning light woke me up for good, breaking me out of the clutches of terror. My pillow was soaked.</p>\n<p>I went there again. To the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I saw the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 there on a building, and my nightmares began then. I felt this wouldn't end well, but at the same time it was like I was pulled there by an unseen force.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, I \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. At a distance, two \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 trail.

The bas-relief that shone a crooked \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, almost forgotten in our world, was shattered with something heavy and blunt. They knew. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had their hand here. Either surveyed the surroundings or \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. What about my promise that my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 would be private? I don't know if there as a reason to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 these \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 now.

Precisely that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of its \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 they are trying to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, throw into \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. And it's somehow connected to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 people.</p>\n<p>I think I know a way to figure it out.

As soon as I throw this letter into the \"diplomatic pneumatic mail pipe\", I'll take the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

I saw it! I saw everything, I know! I\u2026 what even to start with. I need to write this down even if this gets in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>I took the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and went to bed. Then someone gently knocked on my door. I stood up, opened it just a bit, then exited to the stairway landing. What I witnessed cast me in shock. I was in endless emptiness. The whole building, the whole world was as if it was torn asunder. What was left of my home was just the room, a small portion of the stairwell platform hanging over the abyss, and a corridor of shattered walls. Everywhere, above and below, was complete blackness, filled with calmly floating fragments of broken rooms. Out of nowhere, from some invisible source, shone a bright pale light, drawing sharp shadows on the cracked tiles. And there were no pipes here.</p>\n<p>After turning around I yelped, and my scream rebounded in echo hundredfold off the emptiness. A dark figure with no eyes, ears or mouth stood by the steps. It was standing still and \"stared\" in my direction. I looked about, saw there was nowhere to run, and stepped towards it. The figure turned silently and went down the stairwell with no sound at all, and I followed it.</p>\n<p>We went along destroyed corridors lit by moonlight, only the sound of my steps breaking the silence. Sometimes I could see forgotten, dust-covered things in the wall breaches: kids' toys, baby carriages, opened books, musical instrument cases. A broken phonograph stood by one of the doors, playing some quiet tune. Sometimes I witnessed painting frames hanging on the walls, some empty, some holding weird geometric abstractions scribbled in grey strokes. On some open landings I felt a cool, soundless breeze.</p>\n<p>I don't know how much time we spent wandering the labyrinth of rooms and crooked stairs. An hour or two, maybe more? Sometimes I thought I saw the corridors we've already passed hanging overhead. My boots and trousers were white with dust kicked up in trespassing.</p>\n<p>Our journey concluded at a solid metal door. The figure quietly took a key ring with a single key off its belt and opened a massive iron lock with it. Then, this strange companion turned around and wandered off in silence. I stood there for a long time, alone, not ready to open the door and leave this strange, dreadful place.</p>\n<p>I came to senses in some bushes. It was dark around, a fresh nightly wind ran across my face. I was in the City once more, but somewhere on the outskirts, as far as I could understand by the distant lights of Combine \u21161. Strangely enough, I was fully dressed and hand some of my belongings with me. It appears that my sleepwalking led me here.</p>\n<p>I looked around and noticed a rickety fence with barbed wire and an iron sign. After feeling around for a flashlight in my pocket, I lit it up and witnessed German writing: \"Warning! Extremely high level of recollection poisoning!\" I recognised that I ended up at some important site and hid myself, waiting to be found by guards. After a few minutes of wait and a walk down the fence, however, I realized that I'm alone. Somehow, in my sleep, I was able to evade the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 waiting for me on the streets.</p>\n<p>Then something clanked on my belt, and I caught that same ring with a key that the figure in my vision held. A few moments later I found the door of a warehouse for it, set into a high stone wall. The writing \u00ab<a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/morgenstern\">Morgenstern</a>\u00bb was engraved upon it along with the number \"44\". With a strained creak the lock opened, and I was able to enter the pitch-black room.</p>\n<p>I couldn't see anything with my eyes. A stale odour hit my nostrils - nobody's been here for a very long time. I walked forward in uncertainty and did my best to listen, unwilling to turn on the light. After about twenty steps I hit a pile of something metallic and caused it to loudly clatter over the floor. There was no use hiding then. I turned the flashlight on.</p>\n<p>Out of the dark I saw the edge of a giant, about thrice my own height, pile of empty metal cans, akin to paint cans. My errant kick caused the side of that pile to slide. I bent down and picked one of the cans up. After raising it to my eyes, I tried to read the half-rotten label with a skull and crossbones.</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588.</p>\n<p>Immediately, I cast the can away as far as I could, causing another stream of noises, and rubbed my hands off on the legs. Blood began pulsing fervently in my ears, my breathing became heavy and sharp. In horror, I sent the flashlight side to side, finding more and more mounds of empty \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 cans. The whole area was filled with them to the brim.</p>\n<p>The reserves here would've been enough to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 millions of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. That's what was produced earlier here. All the combines\u2026 They only switched to amnestics later, out of\u2026 what? Shame? Fear? To live amidst the gasses\u2026 They wanted to run, but from what or whom? From themselves? The past? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? Justice?</p>\n<p>And there I heard them again. Millions of voices. Moaning and gurgling in the dark. From everywhere. Some shadow blinked in the spot of light, and then the flashlight treacherously went out. I stood there, frozen, until I heard someone drop the empty cans behind my back.</p>\n<p>I ran across the City, the wind screaming in my ears. Clear air, free of the usual horrid pollution, filled my lungs. The answer was far too much for me to bear. I'll write this letter, I'll send it into the mail pipe, then take my amnestics and let it be as it may. Take \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-14\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n<p>I'm better now.<br/>\nI've been found unconscious by our colleagues at SVHA.

The duty shift of the primary normalcy monitoring centre \"Global-0\" has the right to use said device in critical situations (VEDIST level 1) [[footnote]]VEil DISruption Threat-1: Global leak and universal state of emergency. Preparation to launch the Ennui Protocol.[[/footnote]]. The messages are to be relayed according to the rules described in the logbook manual attached to the communication device.\n\nThe location of SCP-5240 is unknown. In accordance with established treaties the Foundation is to make no attempt to locate the object. On accidental discovery of SCP-5240 Foundation personnel is to immediately report all acquired information up the command chain; no additional investigation and personal action pertaining to the object is permitted. Due to limited access to the SCP-5240 dossier, all responsible parties are only provided information outlined in this paragraph of the Special Containment Procedures as well as Addendum 4 [[footnote]] outlining the key triggers that allow to concretely identify SCP-5240 with minimal elucidation of the object's qualities [[/footnote]]. On object discovery the Special Containment Procedures will be reevaluated by decision of the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n--A Foundation representative is present in the premises of SCP-5240.-- The fact of the Foundation representative's existence/loyalty is currently under question.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5240 is a socio-political formation existing in the form of a \"city-state\". The object's distinction lies in complete lack of information pertaining to it in any historical or contemporary records. This is achieved by widespread use of anomalously programmed chemical agents causing varied effects of amnesia and altered cognition.\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.19\u2588\u2588 the object came into contact with the Foundation in person on one of its former operating frequencies and offered a mutually beneficial agreement; in exchange for supply of food and technical goods SCP-5240 provides the Foundation a wide assortment of amnestics and accepts requests to release vast quantities of \"Ennui\"- and \"Global\"-class programmable substances into the atmosphere. A two-way communication device was assembled to that purpose, which is used by SCP-5240 to relay schedules of required produce and by the Foundation to request delivery of amnestics. Despite lack of knowledge pertaining to the object's location, mutual delivery chains have been established and operate without de-masking SCP-5240. The agreement also lists a non-interference clause, in accordance with which the Foundation does not perform active search for the object, and the object acts upon the Foundation's requests to release amnestics without objection.\n\n\n\nTo enhance mutual trust and to alleviate any technical difficulties, SCP-5240 has allowed a single Foundation representative to enter its territory - logistics specialist Alfred Bruske. The subject has been allowed to send service correspondence and photographs under agreement not to perform acts of industrial or other sabotage.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation has only limited general intelligence pertaining to SCP-5240, acquired by Alfred Bruske:\n\n\n\n* the moniker of \"the City\" is used in common talk and official documents. Rarely the citizens mention the name \"Fehlerstadt\";\n\n* the City's population count is unknown; by estimation of an agent with no prior knowledge of investigative analytics, it can be estimated at 500-650 thousand people. The size of the City's suburban regions is unknown;\n\n* the City's citizens converse in German. Their cultural specificities are so negligible (imperceptible) that it is not possible to reliably attribute them to the German or any other nation;\n\n* the City is located in hilly terrain; low mountains are visible on the horizon. A river flows through the object's territory. The outer perimeter of the city's developed area is lined with an abandoned and unguarded complex of engineered obstacles in the form of a concrete wall, crooked watchtowers and rows of rusted barbed wire;\n\n* the City's information development, transport and other technologies are approximately in line with the middle of the XX century.\n\n\n\nSCP-5240 has massive industrial potential by way of abundance of chemical plants chaotically dispersed throughout the City's territory. The majority of citizenry is employed in these facilities, the only function of which is production of a wide spectrum of amnestic substances. Some of them are dispersed into the atmosphere in gaseous form, or into the river in liquid form. It is supposed that such measures are required for the City in order to maintain concealment of its existence from the worldwide community, to protect itself against diplomatic pressure (or military intervention), and to halt outwards cultural expansion.\n\n\n\nThe chemical plants are supplied by large produce storage sites, as well as interlinked with a branching network of large and small pipes that route through the entirety of the City: along streets, above houses, through buildings and apartments (some heated precursors are used as conductors for central heating systems). SCP-5240's metro system is likewise adapted to the needs of the industrial complex. The metro and above-ground rail lines connect all the main amnestic factories; stations are named after the neighbouring chemical plants (\"Combine \u21167\", \"Factory \u211616\" etc.; the only exception is the \"Ministry\" station).\n\n\n\nThe medium industry and car manufacture work in the interest of the chemical sector. Only a small portion of the City's factories creates consumer goods, which is why the society of SCP-5240 experiences a perpetual deficit.\u00a0\u00a0More than half of consumer labels are distributed under directive.\n\n\n\nUbiquitous factory exhaust pipes are always in use, creating multicoloured smog and scented fog; constant leaks from overused pipelines and factory accidents additionally worsen the ecological situation. SCP-5240's citizenry is unanimously afflicted with respiratory illnesses.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, in accordance with the Ministry's schedule (or by the Foundation's request), a \"dispersal event\" is announced in SCP-5240. The City's siren and loudspeaker system is activated, warning the citizens about the time and duration of the event, the amnestic used and the prescribed order of actions for personal protection. [[footnote]] Example of a typical \"dispersal event\" alert: \"Warning! Following is a message from the Ministry's announcement department. Citizens! The City declares a dispersal event! Period of dispersal: 18:30 to 18:45, amnestic - berhin, blue gas with strong garlic odour, lighter than air. Equip your gas masks with yellow marking ribbons. Repeat: yellow marking ribbons. Vacate the rooftops and upper floors of buildings. Act according to instruction until the \"all-clear\" signal. Refrain from harvesting crops from trees and ground plots for the following two days.\" The message repeats. [[/footnote]] The object's citizens always carry a bag with a gas mask and a set of filters in their possession, every person learns the names of all amnestics, their composition, locale of production, approximate production cycle structure, identification and counteraction measures by heart. The standard citizen rations include a mnestics package distributed in the form of drag\u00e9 pellets and dissoluble powders.\n\n\n\nSCP-5240 maintains a set of outdated (but never repealed) restrictions on its territory, enforced by \"the Central Department for City Rasure\" (Stadtvergessenheitshauptamt, SVHA). Despite the citizenry's lack of memory regarding the cause for such restrictions, the following items are prohibited within Fehlerstadt: historical photographs and portraits of people, documentary movies, diaries, biographies and books on history, antiquities, weapons, blazons, flags, any and all recording or retelling of information regarding the City's \"previous epoch\", as well as overall interest to it. The citizens are neutral in regards to the restrictions, and abide by them habitually with no resistance. The rare violators are reported by their peers and neighbours to the SVHA. Restricted items are burned in pyres, found criminals are permanently taken away in an unknown direction. All of the City's monuments, memorials, bas-reliefs and other historic cites have been destroyed.\n\n\n\nAlfred Bruske's official reports are under classification code \"Clearance level 5\". Below are some of the agent's personal letters, sent to his direct manager and Foundation colleagues:\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab 1]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#1 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nThis morning I awoke not in my bed in Zone 16, but in a small flat with a very old-timey outfit. It was dark, and rain drummed loudly out the window. I barely managed to find the switch to the lamp by touch, and turn it on. Two tall men in dark leather coats appeared from the darkness. One of them spoke in German and presented himself as my \"curator\". I almost thought that I've been captured by the Stasi Section XXV, but no, I've been briefed on the matter: I am on the grounds of some city concealed from public eyes, and I represent the SCP Foundation in the matters of developing mutual arrangements in the chemical sector. I am to relay cursory information about production of some sort of chemicals in this city, and I am to negotiate delivery of equipment and metalworks. So I've been made an ambassador of sorts and allowed to send private letters to the Foundation once per day under condition that I will not blatantly spy on them. All my questions about how I ended up here and who even sanctioned this in the first place remained unanswered. One of the tall men said that I will need to undergo prolonged acclimatization to the city's conditions, then they had me take a couple pills and go back to sleep.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 4]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n\n\n#4 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nIt's been three days now... They've finally graced me with permission to go outside. I am indeed sickly, the air is just filled with all manners of smells that cause anything from vomit reflexes to absolute bliss. Depends on which way the wind's blowing.\n\n\n\nOccasionally I'm down with dry cough. The air in this place is almost visible on occasion, it hangs like smoke. Today it's kinda violet.\n\n\n\nIt's a truly fascinating view. I've observed the City only through a murky window up until now, and saw only dense rows of apartment buildings with uncountable factory pipes belching many-coloured wisps of smoke between them. The streets are thoroughly shadowed by massive cistern towers lined with carcasses of ladder and walkway. Clouds hang low in the sky, shimmering with rainbow hues like spilled kerosene on asphalt. And there's pipes. Pipelines, pipelines, pipelines. Valves, throttles, bell cranks, four-ways. They're everywhere here. The network of pipes is like a multileveled web hanging above the streets and the dwellings, it enters directly into homes, my own bed stands on one such pipe. Sometimes, here or there, thin white streams breach out of them. My curator said that's just working gas from the overworked pneumatic system and that there's nothing to worry about - amnestic leaks are rather rare.\n\n\n\nAmnestics. Yes, I heard that right. That's what they produce in such enormous volume that it'd be enough to coat the whole globe in rainbow clouds. What the best minds of the Foundation spent a decade on and what we produce in such precious little quantity is mass-produced here. And that's not all. The local amnestics exceed all comparison with ours. They are more stable, more effective, their duration can be varied, their effects - programmed. It's obvious some anomalous tech it involved. The curator told me that the Foundation will receive it all at its disposal in exchange for providing goods that I, as a logistics specialist, will need to arrange. A small price to pay for such possibilities, isn't that so?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 6]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#6 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nI've been assigned a separate office in the Ministry. Every day I rise at 6 o'clock, drag through the pink mist and get on the metro on the \"Combine \u21166\". It's only two stations' ride away from the Ministry, but there's plenty of time to have a good look at the locals. Ashen-grey stares and rough skin, worker overalls often stained or burnt by chemicals. The people mostly talk trifle, usually discussing their colleagues and their quotas. There's something strange in their language, though, I can't figure out what. They speak seemingly normal German, but their way of speaking is unnatural. As if there's something missing. As if something's been removed. \n\n\n\nOh, and food at home's all out, I was given meal tickets. Very generous, by the way, compared to the locals' rations. I feel sort of guilty spending them all in one place, and I don't want to attract attention, so I do my shopping in pieces all over the place - and I get to walk the City along the way. This is it - the socialist utopia. Are you sure I'm not in the GDR? No, it's far too backwards - no Trabants, no Spreewaldgurkens. None of the products have labels or names or colourful packaging. Only \"Beer\", only \"Porridge\", only \"Flour\". No salt at all, by the way, but there's plenty of matches. Oh, and the rations include mnestics, and I get them in extra large supply. According to what the cashier from one of the shops under a giant rusted pipe told me off the record, the nearby \"Combine \u21166\" is a record holder when it comes to monthly amnestic and precursor spill accidents. That's why the populace are given these pills. And they take them all the time, for the City has planned dispersals, too. And who knows what else is in the air, anyhow. \n\n\n\nAh, something else. Had an interesting situation happen to me today. I had to pass a medical check-up against symptoms of chemical poisoning. The nurse asked me for my date of birth, and I replied. Then she picked up the phone, called into the \"Ministry Information Department\", and asked to give her today's date. Once she got it, she put my birth date and today's date into a special brass arithmometer, which handed out my age after a few cranks of the handle. In years, precision down to a tenth. \"Why?\" - I asked. - \"I could've just told you my age myself\". \"Really?\" - the woman replied in surprise, - \"That's just amazing. Oh well - we always do this, no big deal.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 8]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#8 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nEverything's going fine, overall. We've designed a way of exchanging produce that would technologically satisfy the City and keep its location in secret at the same time. The first batch of chemical component canisters has arrived from outside - soon they will be emptied, deactivated, and filled with freshly made amnestics. The headquarters requested aerosol and liquid compounds of limited effective duration, a few days, for a first test run. If this stuff passes field testing, the Foundation will begin buying it en masse immediately. Injections costing upwards of thousands of dollars? Forget that. We'll be able to cover whole settlements in months, maybe in weeks. And yes, I'm currently in talks about using their mass atmospheric amnestic dispersal systems. It's too early to say anything about that, though.\n\n\n\nOther than designing deliveries, I've started to work on amnestic and mnestic classificators. It's a very important project, I think, because the City produces - think about it - 63 different types of amnestics and 27 types of mnestics. All of those are produced in different forms - pills, gasses, liquids. All of them have different effects, storage, usage and safety requirements... It's a lot of work, in short. Strangely enough, the local specialists live just fine without any classification or guidance. Or not even specialists - ordinary people! There was a boy riding by me on a bike with a toy gas mask on his hip - in response to my simple question about where his father worked he spouted out half the production queue of four different short-term amnestics! He'd tell me more if men in black hadn't arrived out of nowhere to guide him home. It turned out they were agents of the SVHA - a local special service whose purpose is to not only maintain law and order, but, as my curator explained, \"to prevent recollection poisoning\". I have no idea what that could mean.\n\n\n\nWeird folk. Amnestics are a sort of national idea for them.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 12]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#12 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nStable food supply lines have been established. Already, thanks to the Foundation, the city has cancelled tickets for bread and meat, and a few more types of goods are planned in the future.\n\n\n\nThe citizens' leisure comes in the form of pubs and clubs, where they consume alcohol in abundance, play cards and watch the only TV channel available. Conversations revolve around the everyday grind. I've decided to exchange a few words with the local workers in one of those places, find out how they like living without meat tickets. What do you know? Nobody even remembered tickets were a thing despite having to stand in queues only a week ago.\n\n\n\nAnd there it got to me. Now I understand what I've found so odd in their speech. It's difficult to formulate, their manner of speaking is entirely different. Basically, they actively avoid any lexical constructions that have so much as a tint of past tense. There's no \"was\", only \"is\", \"now\", \"always\". They don't think of the past, don't talk about the past, don't perceive the past, don't use it as a foundation to compare to the present.\n\n\n\nThere is a very unique relation to time here. As in, there is none. The passage of time is only remembered when it is really necessary. Usually that entails duration of chemical processes, issues of pension and so on. They have no calendars. The City lacks any and all celebrations or days off, official or not. No New Year's, no Christmas, no birthdays. And every time I ask \"What day of the week is it?\", I always receive the answer \"Monday\". \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 16]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#16 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nToday I got hit by a dispersal event for the first time.\n\n\n\nBack on my first day I was given a bag with a gas mask and a collection of 8 small filters with differently-coloured markings. Occasionally, in one district or another, they held mock dispersal events or combine accidents. The people ran here and there, put on gas masks, put the \"poisoned\" under IV drips. They came up to me, too. \"Citizen, there's an accident involving Berhin-C at \"Combine \u21166\", you are poisoned and have lost the capacity for long-term memory.\" All of that was moreso amusing to me. These events happened far too often. Still, I couldn't help but admire the precision and coordination of these people in an emergency.\n\n\n\nAnd there it was for real, this time. Sirens roared up everywhere, loudspeakers on the lampposts started reading through the dispersal message in a raspy voice. I fumbled, not knowing what to do. While everyone grabbed their gas masks and started looking for the right filters, I just stood there and stared, fascinated. Then everyone ran for the metro, and a person from the SVHA ran to me and started shouting something like \"Are you mad? Mask on, magenta filter, right now! Run for the metro!\". The agent grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the nearest station's vestibule. In the meanwhile, everything around started vibrating ever so slightly, a rumbling hum emanated from the pipes, it felt like the tension in the system was about to rip it apart from the inside. But no, none of that happened. 15 minutes later, with a quiet pop and a long, pangent roar, the dispersal went off. Everything quieted down, while we had to remain underground for two hours more until the all-clear.\n\n\n\nWhen I returned home, I saw how my downstairs neighbour casually went to the lady across from me, as if there was his home. And he remained there overnight, even though his wife and two kids lived a flight below there. Something tells me this dim mechanic from the third combine isn't having sordid affairs, but just forgets where and with whom he lives. Or maybe he doesn't care. I don't know. Nobody chases him off, regardless.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 27]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#27 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nMy negotiations have successfully concluded and I've been permitted to the holiest place of all - into the dispersal control centre, up atop the tower of Combine \u21161 - the oldest of the City, from the looks of it. A test dispersal was to happen on request from the Foundation. A functional compound, but the only program imprinted upon it was memory deletion from those who would register it in air tests (aside from the Foundation, of course). A dud designed to test the effectiveness of the procedure.\n\n\n\nWe spent a lot of time rising in an old-timey manual elevator among brown-old metallic constructions and finally ended up in a spacious room, filled to the brim with levers, pipes, manometers and buttons. A giant schematic of the city resided on the far wall, dotted with different blinking lights representing the chemical plants. The operators took their positions and waited in place. \n\n\n\nTen minutes later, after a short alarm, an automatic typing machine whirred horridly and dispensed a paper with a filled out dispersal request log from the Foundation. The shift foreman ripped out half of it (with the amnestic program), signed it and threw it into the pneumatic mail. I'll try to describe all the dialogues on the \"bridge\" from memory from here on (with approximate numbers, of course): \n\n\n\n- Dispersal request! Class \"T\", fuliruline, 1700 tonnes per hour, 15 minutes, height - 13 kilometers! Calculate dispersal readiness! Calculate meteorological conditions! Test gas feed into the atmosphere! \n\n\n\nPeople began running around in a rush, some clacked their counting machines, some started making phone calls, some began studying the weather station readings, some selectively called different combines and information bureaus. The operators pressed different buttons with dutiful expressions.\n\n\n\n- Fuliruline stores satisfactory, Combines 1, 4, 7, 9, as well as Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 all stand ready for dispersal! - an employee reported.\n\n\n\n- Atmospheric conditions satisfactory, wind is N-N-W, 7 metres per second, surface-level pressure is 757 milimetres of mercury, temperature is 17 degrees Celcius, working height pressure is 120 milimetres of mercury, temperature is -56 degrees Celicus! All parameters meet fuliruline use requirements! - the weather station worker reported. \n\n\n\n- CHPP 1, CHPP 2, CHPP 3! Dispersal systems operating normally, ready to provide working pressure to the system, - a rasping voice called out from the radio station.\n\n\n\n- Beginning dispersal procedure, proceed with performing operations according to checklist! - the foreman commanded.\n\n\n\n- Declare emergency! \u2013 the foreman assistant read out the first point of the list. The worker at the panel pressed a few buttons and began reading out the warning text into the microphone. Sirens started blaring throughout the City. The citizens, not much more than small black dots from so far up above, began scattering in all directions.\n\n\n\n- Emergency in effect!\n\n\n\n- Working shift, put on your masks! Teal filter! \u2013 shouted the assistant, and a minute later everyone looked at each other through mask lenses.\n\n\n\n- Check channel functionality!\n\n\n\n- Leak in pipeline 271-A, ordering to use pipeline 271-B! Pressure critical in cistern 67, failure of both throttles, ordering to vent and redirecting to Combine \u21161.\n\n\n\nDozens of manometers and sensors came to life on the walls, their readings climbing up monotonously. One after another, control lamps began to light up.\n\n\n\n- System pressure at 40%! Pumping amnestic now! \u2013 reported an employee, having turned away from the gas-discharge indicator.\n\n\n\n- Test civil service readiness! \u2013 the foreman's assistant went down the line.\n\n\n\n- Evacuation underway, all ill persons, the children and the elderly are secure in basement shelters. All executives are at their posts. \n\n\n\n- Test amnestic program!\n\n\n\n- Program ready!\n\n\n\n- System pressure at 60%! Feeding programmable fuliruline precursor! \n\n\n\nThe pipes began shaking noticeably. The manometer arrows climbed into the red. A low monotonous hum pressed down on the ears, even the thick gas mask offered no protection.\n\n\n\n- Test control line closure!\n\n\n\n- Line is closed! No disruptions present!\n\n\n\n- System pressure at 80%! Decision point!\n\n\n\n- Continue!\n\n\n\nThe floor began shaking intensely, thin trails of whitewash flaked off from above. The City outside was covered in hundreds of small vapor trails, erupting here and there from the runoff valves.\n\n\n\n- Readiness report! \u2013 the assistant shouted into the radio. The receiver screeched voices in response. \n\n\n\n- Combine 1 ready!\n\n\n\n- Combine 4 ready!\n\n\n\n- Combine 7 ready!\n\n\n\n- Combine 9 ready!\n\n\n\n- Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 ready!\n\n\n\n- System pressure 100%! Amnestic has been pumped, programmed and is ready for use, - the assistant foreman reported loudly.\n\n\n\nThe whole room was shaking as if in a 6-point earthquake, the manometer arrows slammed viciously into the redlines. It was difficult to stand. The whole tableau shone with lights, several sirens and alarms struggled to overpower the low drone of overloaded pipes.\n\n\n\nEveryone present on the bridge stood at attention in silence. The foreman turned to a mysterious old man, who spent the entire procedure quietly sitting in his chair on a small pedestal.\n\n\n\n- Ready for dispersal. Awaiting your command.\n\n\n\nThe man looked at the foreman, his blue-tinted gas mask glasses shining, calmly rose and approached the central control desk. After taking an unusual key hanging on a string off his neck, the stranger plugged it into the panel's keyhole and turned it. Among the hundreds of blinking lights a big one, marked \"Ready\", lit up. The panel's large metallic cover opened up, revealing a breaker lever beneath it. The man grasped the lever, cast his eyes out the window, and declared loudly:\n\n\n\n- Disperse!\n\n\n\nThe whole area jolted. I failed to hold steady and fell to a knee with a painful thud against the metal floor. The manometer readings calmed down and began to slowly climb their way down, lights on the schematic dimmed one by one. Swirling violet gas rose in mighty streams into the sky from the multitudes of pipes and cisterns. \n\n\n\nMy report to the Foundation today is going to be fabulous.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 35]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#35 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nAn agit-prop brigade wheeled around on the street today. An old-looking truck with medical crosses on the side and loudspeakers on the roof rallied something about \"recollection poisoning\", preliminary symptoms and methods of curing the disease (by taking amnestics, naturally). The nurses in dusty white robes handed out booklets to the passersby, and a group of SVHA agents followed, updating the worn lists of forbidden items hanging around on billboards. Some of the agents approached those standing about and asked something along the lines of \"does anything cause you sensations of vague anxiety, guilt, fear or despair\"? Those who couldn't clearly answer warranted a search. By the evening the event concluded in destruction of prohibited items. Since none such were actually found, they had to resort to a symbolic pyre of old workbooks and unneeded truss rods from a nearby construction site. People brought seats out with them and lounged about to watch the fire. Children played about noisily, playing \"SVHA\" (throwing \"prohibited\" rocks into the fire) or \"dispersal\". It seems there are celebrations in this City after all. \n\n\n\nP.S. From a conversation between a nurse and a SVHA lad I got to overhear a different name of the city - \"Fehlerstadt\", and also that the SVHA, in their line of duty, is allowed to \"remember a bit more\".\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 47]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#47 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nThe Ministry.\n\n\n\nIt's interesting to observe this regime. It's a unique specimen of a decentralised bureaucratic dictatorship. Matter-of-factly, there are several leading titles with enormous privileges, but they are not actually taken by anyone, since there is no hierarchy leading up to them. There are normative acts describing the rights and duties of these roles, but there are no instructions on their appointment. The giant cabinets with oak doors on the top floors of the Ministry are empty to this day, and although cleaning is done daily, the dust gathering there does not get any less. \n\n\n\nThere is no \"upper class\", no \"party\", no coalition or ruling caste. Nothing. Only a giant bureaucratic machine operating on decades-old and very rarely corrected rules and directives. Instructions. Those set the ball here, without them everything would come apart in instants. The structure of the governing system is complex and confusing, there is no familiar hierarchy \"tree\" or \"pyramid\". The links between manager and underling are interwoven, contradictory, inconsistent and often circular. It is not rare to witness mutual command (where two employees are both bosses and subordinates to each other), or cases of \"I am the boss of my boss's boss\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe career trajectory here is not a ladder but a Mobius band, tens of them, interwoven in a terrible, logic- and geometry-defying knot. Everyone always moves forward only to end up where they started. The bureaucrats climb their way up without stopping, change cabinets and titles, but their efforts are futile. In time, everyone returns to their old place from where they started, yet that won't be a failure or regression, no, it's a great achievement. They will be tapped on the shoulder, congratulated for attaining such high rank, such trust. People will reacquaint themselves with old colleagues, maybe only with a change of seats or positions. For a while. Until next time they are reassigned, until next time they part, until next time they meet.\n\n\n\nAnd moving back on the Mobius band is no different. Same applies here. Except you'll be berated, not congratulated. Although, even then, it's all the same. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 51]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#51 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nFinally home, I need to write something stat\n\n\n\nI was walking down the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and suddenly found it. It was on the facade of an old house, pincushioned with pipes jotting out everywhere, but still beautiful and imposing. They tried to break it off and did a good job at it, it wouldn't have been visible at all on a cloudy day, but today the sun peeked out, the shadows fell just right and revealed this guilty secret. It was a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Yes, it was exactly it, it's difficult to mistake these right-angle hooks for something else. There was a broken round border around it - probably an oaken wreath. While a storm of thoughts was blowing through my head, I got to a different alley. \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Why is it here? It shouldn't be here. It shouldn't. No. It NEEDS to be here. Why have I decided that? I don't know, but I feel it in my insides\". I then swayed, bent over in half and nearly fell, just barely caught some valve on a gas pipe. I started retching. Passersby ran over to me along with SVHA agents coming out of nowhere. Now I'm completely certain they \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 everywhere and all the time.\n\n\n\nFor a fraction of a second a vision came over me, or a hallucination, rather. The faces of those around became distorted inhuman grimaces for a moment. I jolted and crawled back a bit, startled. \"What did you see? - asked one of the SVHA, - Those are primary recollection poisoning symptoms. Tell us the source and we'll destroy it\". I didn't tell them the truth. \"What are you talking about? I didn't see anything, I'm just unwell\". The agents side-eyed me, but decided not to argue and just handed out a package of amnestics \"just in case\". After coming together, I ran home post-haste to write this letter. We know for certain, now, the City was under \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I don't know how this will affect our work. Luckily, I don't think any problems came up at all.\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp2.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 52]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#52 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nSomething horrible happened tonight.\n\n\n\nI was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly heard screams. Screams and moans of hundreds melding together into one ensemble of horror. There was a crash at the stairs, and in a moment my curator from SVHA broke into the room, bolted the door behind him and backed it up by a drawer for good measure.\n\n\n\n- It's them! Do you hear them!? IT'S THEM! \u2013 the curator spoke in a trembling voice, grabbing me by the sleeve.\n\n\n\n- Who are \"they\"?\n\n\n\n- Nobody. They don't exist. They don't! And never have! \u2013 he replied in hysteria. \u2013 But oh, how they scream!\n\n\n\n- What does that... What do they need?\n\n\n\n- They need to scream. Scream! And knock! Why scream, why knock!? - and then long shadows started flickering in the band of light under the door. The curator noticed that and began to beg, pale with fright, - Just don't let them in. Don't let them in!\n\n\n\nA pounding noise joined the unbearable chorus of screaming people. They beat on the door, so much that it felt like it was about to break off the hinges. The curator fell to the floor and covered his head with his hands. He was in convulsions, blood poured in thin streams out of his ears.\n\n\n\nI didn't know what to do. The maddening noise was not ceasing at all. To my horror, I noticed that they started beating from inside the walls. The window was my only retreat. Ready to vault off the 4th floor, I cast open the curtain and saw a thick brick wall instead of the lights of distant chemical plants. Refusing to believe my eyes, I hit it with my hand, hoping to destroy it. A white handprint remained on it. My hand somehow got stained with something greyish-yellow. \n\n\n\n- One, two, three, four... screamers banging at the door... - the SVHA man counted, barely audibly, on the floor. - Three-four, two-and-one, bring amnestics here right now. \n\n\n\nWith a sharp turn I dashed to the bedside drawer, which should have still held that package of amnestics they gave in the day. \n\n\n\n- Pump the gasses faster yet, breathe it deep and just forget. Turn the valves up faster still, we won't have no judge nor king. Oh, the pink clouds floating free, take away our ennui. \n\n\n\nI grabbed the pills that I refused to drink in the evening and took them all in one gulp. My legs gave out, and I fell into darkness.\n\n\n\nYes, it turns out that was just a dream. The whole package was where it belonged once morning came.\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp2.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 54]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#54 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nHad nightmares again. Screams, screech of fingernails and dull thrumming from inside the walls. I woke again and again only to find that I was still dreaming and that the screaming people never went away. Only the rays of morning light woke me up for good, breaking me out of the clutches of terror. My pillow was soaked.\n\n\n\nI went there again. To the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I saw the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 there on a building, and my nightmares began then. I felt this wouldn't end well, but at the same time it was like I was pulled there by an unseen force.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, I \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. At a distance, two \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 trail. They were \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, so I didn't spot them immediately.\n\n\n\nAnd so I arrived at the place. The bas-relief that shone a crooked \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, almost forgotten in our world, was shattered with something heavy and blunt. They knew. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had their hand here. Either surveyed the surroundings or \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. What about my promise that my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 would be private? I don't know if there as a reason to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 these \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 now.

Precisely that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of its \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 they are trying to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, throw into \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. And it's somehow connected to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 people. \n\n\n\nI think I know a way to figure it out.

As soon as I throw this letter into the \"diplomatic pneumatic mail pipe\", I'll take the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

I saw it! I saw everything, I know! I... what even to start with. I need to write this down even if this gets in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\nI took the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and went to bed. Then someone gently knocked on my door. I stood up, opened it just a bit, then exited to the stairway landing. What I witnessed cast me in shock. I was in endless emptiness. The whole building, the whole world was as if it was torn asunder. What was left of my home was just the room, a small portion of the stairwell platform hanging over the abyss, and a corridor of shattered walls. Everywhere, above and below, was complete blackness, filled with calmly floating fragments of broken rooms. Out of nowhere, from some invisible source, shone a bright pale light, drawing sharp shadows on the cracked tiles. And there were no pipes here.\n\n\n\nAfter turning around I yelped, and my scream rebounded in echo hundredfold off the emptiness. A dark figure with no eyes, ears or mouth stood by the steps. It was standing still and \"stared\" in my direction. I looked about, saw there was nowhere to run, and stepped towards it. The figure turned silently and went down the stairwell with no sound at all, and I followed it.\n\n\n\nWe went along destroyed corridors lit by moonlight, only the sound of my steps breaking the silence. Sometimes I could see forgotten, dust-covered things in the wall breaches: kids' toys, baby carriages, opened books, musical instrument cases. A broken phonograph stood by one of the doors, playing some quiet tune. Sometimes I witnessed painting frames hanging on the walls, some empty, some holding weird geometric abstractions scribbled in grey strokes. On some open landings I felt a cool, soundless breeze.\n\n\n\nI don't know how much time we spent wandering the labyrinth of rooms and crooked stairs. An hour or two, maybe more? Sometimes I thought I saw the corridors we've already passed hanging overhead. My boots and trousers were white with dust kicked up in trespassing.\n\n\n\nOur journey concluded at a solid metal door. The figure quietly took a key ring with a single key off its belt and opened a massive iron lock with it. Then, this strange companion turned around and wandered off in silence. I stood there for a long time, alone, not ready to open the door and leave this strange, dreadful place.\n\n\n\nI came to senses in some bushes. It was dark around, a fresh nightly wind ran across my face. I was in the City once more, but somewhere on the outskirts, as far as I could understand by the distant lights of Combine \u21161. Strangely enough, I was fully dressed and hand some of my belongings with me. It appears that my sleepwalking led me here.\n\n\n\nI looked around and noticed a rickety fence with barbed wire and an iron sign. After feeling around for a flashlight in my pocket, I lit it up and witnessed German writing: \"Warning! Extremely high level of recollection poisoning!\" I recognised that I ended up at some important site and hid myself, waiting to be found by guards. After a few minutes of wait and a walk down the fence, however, I realized that I'm alone. Somehow, in my sleep, I was able to evade the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 waiting for me on the streets. \n\n\n\nThen something clanked on my belt, and I caught that same ring with a key that the figure in my vision held. A few moments later I found the door of a warehouse for it, set into a high stone wall. The writing \u00ab[[[Morgenstern]]]\u00bb was engraved upon it along with the number \"44\". With a strained creak the lock opened, and I was able to enter the pitch-black room.\n\n\n\nI couldn't see anything with my eyes. A stale odour hit my nostrils - nobody's been here for a very long time. I walked forward in uncertainty and did my best to listen, unwilling to turn on the light. After about twenty steps I hit a pile of something metallic and caused it to loudly clatter over the floor. There was no use hiding then. I turned the flashlight on.\n\n\n\nOut of the dark I saw the edge of a giant, about thrice my own height, pile of empty metal cans, akin to paint cans. My errant kick caused the side of that pile to slide. I bent down and picked one of the cans up. After raising it to my eyes, I tried to read the half-rotten label with a skull and crossbones. \n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588.\n\n\n\nImmediately, I cast the can away as far as I could, causing another stream of noises, and rubbed my hands off on the legs. Blood began pulsing fervently in my ears, my breathing became heavy and sharp. In horror, I sent the flashlight side to side, finding more and more mounds of empty \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 cans. The whole area was filled with them to the brim.\n\n\n\nThe reserves here would've been enough to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 millions of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. That's what was produced earlier here. All the combines... They only switched to amnestics later, out of... what? Shame? Fear? To live amidst the gasses... They wanted to run, but from what or whom? From themselves? The past? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? Justice? \n\n\n\nAnd there I heard them again. Millions of voices. Moaning and gurgling in the dark. From everywhere. Some shadow blinked in the spot of light, and then the flashlight treacherously went out. I stood there, frozen, until I heard someone drop the empty cans behind my back.\n\n\n\nI ran across the City, the wind screaming in my ears. Clear air, free of the usual horrid pollution, filled my lungs. The answer was far too much for me to bear. I'll write this letter, I'll send it into the mail pipe, then take my amnestics and let it be as it may. Take \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp2.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab ???]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n\n\nI'm better now.\n\nI've been found unconscious by our colleagues at SVHA.

Considering that non-equilibrium processes play essential roles in the sustaining of life, progression of SCP-5814 over time may cause a CC-Class \"Collapse of Chemistry\" scenario, with the result that carbon-based chemistry will no longer provide conditions suitable for life.</p>\n<p>Although the potential destructive effects of SCP-5814 has never been directly observed, studies have revealed that SCP-5814 may have initiated several CC-Class Scenarios in the past, resulting in the current ecology of the universe. Based on observations, SCP-5814 currently has limited negative impacts on carbon-based biology, but its effect will be unignorable in the time scale of millions of years.</p>\n<p>The effects of SCP-5814 within its range of influence are embodied by a specific medium, SCP-5814-A. SCP-5814-A behaves like an ideal gas physically and is speculated to be composed of a kind of previously unknown boson<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>.

SCP-5814-A can spatially penetrate all known solids, liquids, and gases, but its effects only manifest at atomic scales. For interactions at subatomic scales, SCP-5814-A will not cause any obvious effects.</p>\n<p>SCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility anomalously increases over time. As SCP-5814-A can penetrate through all known forms of matter, changes in its electric susceptibility affect the polarity of nearby matter, increasing the macroscopic dielectric constant of causing polar materials. It is proven that the rate of change in electric susceptibility follows the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 equation. Based on theoretical computation, the current value of SCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum I.</strong> The discovery of SCP-5814</p>\n<p>In 1972, Foundation researcher Dr. Arnold Freking discovered a change in the measured speed of light in the air while reviewing earlier measurements of the speed of light. Though insignificant, the measured speed of light in air was found to have decreased in the past 100 years. This effect was shown to be more observable in water, in which the speed of light has decreased by \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588% in the last 100 years. Observations of other physical constants, such as measurements of the rate of nuclear reactions, have shown that speed of light in vacuum has not changed. Analysis based on observations, Hubble's law<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>, and virial theorem<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup> has shown that an unknown medium is distributed across certain regions of the Laniakea Supercluster. This medium had a certain degree of electric susceptibility and increased the dielectric constant of polar substances such as water upon interaction.</p>\n<p>Analysis based on observed values showed that under the effects of SCP-5814-A, the speed of light observed in different media over time follows the equation c=c<sub>0</sub>\u00d7(b<sub>F</sub>+k<sub>F</sub>t)<sup>-1/2</sup>, now called Freking's law. This result implies that SCP-5814-A causes the relative dielectric constant of matter to change linearly with time. Dr. Freking deemed such phenomenon enough to declare SCP-5814 an anomaly. He reported his observation result to the Physics and Mathematics Research Institution of the Foundation (SCP-PMRI), who then classified the phenomenon on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/1980.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum II.</strong> Extract SCP-5814 research report, submitted to the Overseer Council by PMRI (\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2000)</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"EA\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/EA\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Under the effect of SCP-5814, the activation energy of some reactions will be significantly lowered, which allows the corresponding reactions to proceed at a relatively low temperature.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026\u2026By applying computational methods, we have proven that the cumulative impact of SCP-5814 has greatly changed the equilibrium pattern of chemical reactions within its region of effect in the Laniakea supercluster, especially reactions involving heavy elements and/or driven by electrostatic interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main observable effect of SCP-5814 is to increase the dielectric constant of solvents, which is largely deleterious to most biochemical reactions. An illustrative example of the anomaly's impact is the stability of all-silicon analogs of biochemical molecules in water. Despite the fact that silicon dioxide is more thermodynamically stable than aqueous solutions of silicon biochemical analogues at any time, 8 billion years ago, the precipitation of silicon dioxide from these molecules and water would require a significantly higher activation energy. As a result, they could exist stably in aqueous environments even at room temperature.<br/>\n<br/>\nVia theoretical calculations, we determined that the chemistry of silicon 8 billion years ago may have been as diverse and stable as modern organic chemistry. It was possible to design a whole set of stable silicon-based life-forming molecules. We could compute silicon analogs of amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides. They are capable of aggregating and forming silicon-based life which is similar to modern carbon-based life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we know, as one of the most abundant substances in the universe, water would be the most appropriate solvent for life. If we keep pushing back in time, we may discover more varieties of life based on different chemistries. Phosphorus, sulfur, even metals. The tolerance of these systems towards water would be significantly increased, which would greatly increase the possibility of evolving life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on such discoveries, we believe that we have already reached a conclusion about the potential hazards of SCP-5814. In the past 8 billion years, the dielectric constant of water has already increased significantly because of SCP-5814. SCP-5814 will lower the tolerance of certain compounds towards water, leading to rapid hydrolytic destruction<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup> of the potential life-forming molecules, and finally reach the inert state of thermodynamic equilibrium.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoomsday, for us, is inevitable, like what silicon-based life went through billions of years ago. We will become the nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water in Earth's atmosphere, become part of this planet's natural environment, and hand the baton of life to the next kind of life form.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanization or digitization of our bodies may perpetuate the existence of the human species for a short period of time, but these methods still rely on physical mediums, which we expect to be destroyed by water given that the effect of SCP-5814 strengthens as time passes. We now believe that these options will remain vulnerable to SCP-5814 and cannot be regarded as a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will meet the end of all life even without SCP-5814, but it will accelerate this process. Due to its properties, we currently hold the pessimistic view that we cannot contain the effects of SCP-5814, just as how we cannot resist the second law of thermodynamics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum III.</strong> Archaeological Exploration History in Greenland</p>\n<p>In year 1986, giant groups of supracrustal rock pillars were discovered beneath the tundra in Greenland while quarrying.

Some contents of the exploration activities are summarized in the extract of the related report shown below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026\u2026These ancient rock pillars are quite unusual. They were very well preserved by the surface tundra, which allowed us to investigate structural details even after billions of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have discovered complicated, intercrossing caves within these pillars, unexplainable by any known natural causes. These special cave-like structures may have specific functions in the past, such as an ancient city built by prehistoric civilizations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fourth operation has brought back a 2.4\u00a0mL sample of an unidentified amber-colored liquid and a cuboid sample of diamond containing regular etched patterns with stored information. The liquid was later identified to be polysiloxane compounds dissolved with low amounts of silicon-oxygen clusters, likely to be the remains of organisms based on silicon-oxygen chemistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering that the pillars were formed 3.8 billion years ago, it is unlikely that the structures were built by terrestrial carbon-based organisms. This point of time is earlier than the earliest carbon-based life. We can confirm that we have discovered direct evidence of form of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds, which is different from almost all known carbon-based organisms. This area may be ruins of a colony of these silicon-oxygen-based organisms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Si\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/Si\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>A specimen of silicon-oxygen-based organisms discovered in the operation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Direct evidence of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds was discovered in nearby sedimentary rock layers during the sixth exploration operation.

To cultivate these organisms, a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should be used to replace water. The relative dielectric constant of DMSO is 48, significantly lower than the value of water (around 80). The need for DMSO for this organism could be explained by the effect of SCP-5814, which has raised the dielectric constant of water.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum IV.</strong> Extract from PMRI's report on the latest progress about the clay hypothesis<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup>\uff08\u2588/\u2588/2019\uff09</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some hypotheses postulate that clay minerals have played essential roles in the formation of carbon-based life on Earth. There is already literature documenting that clay minerals can store energy from mechanical force and cosmic rays, and may enable the formation of primordial organic molecules with such energy.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-10\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')\">10</a></sup>. There have been recent multiple publications focusing on this hypothesis. Several pieces of evidence have supported the hypothesis that porous structures inside clay minerals may absorb carbon-containing molecules that can create life e.g. amino acids, allowing them to react in the clay hydrogel, resulting in important biomacromolecules.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-11\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')\">11</a></sup><br/>\n<br/>\nRecent results from internal research have also shown that the formation of carbon-based lifeforms is likely to be based within vesicles of clay minerals containing transition metal elements. The formation of such vesicles in a silicon-rich environment is not difficult. They raise carbon-based life, like alchemists' flasks raised homunculi.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-12\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')\">12</a></sup><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, from alternative perspective, another possibility emerges. As fungi live on the nutrition in dead wood, could carbon-based organisms be born on the corpses of silicon-based life?<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, the team studying SCP-5814 has reported some notable discoveries. They analyzed ore samples collected in Greenland since 1991 and unexpectedly discovered some polysiloxane liquids within, which contain a high content of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and silicon-oxygen clusters with unusually complex structures. In inorganic synthesis chemistry, such compounds are considered precursors to the synthesis of silicate minerals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never discovered such compounds in nature previously, as according to current experimental results, such compounds should be unstable under the conditions for hydrothermal mineralization. But if we consider SCP-5814's effects, then we must conclude that such molecules belonged to the corpses of a lifeform based on a silicon-oxygen biology.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe silicates in the region have existed for about 3.7 billion years. The formation of silicates generally indicates the collapse of complex systems based on silicon-oxygen clusters; in other words, the domination of silicon-based lifeforms on Earth, if it ever happened, would have ended about 3.7 billion years ago. Modern biology hypothesizes that this is the time period when carbon-based lifeforms originated on the Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking Freking's law into consideration, we determined that when the Earth was just formed, carbon-containing compounds were too inert to evolve life. But approximately 3.7 billion years ago, SCP-5814 made the chemistry of carbon close to the edge of being able to evolve life. Under those conditions, the formation of life would require assistance from some catalysts, such as the aforementioned clay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum V.</strong> Interpretation of information contained within recovered diamond</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"kaleidoscope\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/kaleidoscope\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Microscopic observation of the internal pattern of the diamond sample.

Considering that non-equilibrium processes play essential roles in the sustaining of life, progression of SCP-5814 over time may cause a CC-Class \"Collapse of Chemistry\" scenario, with the result that carbon-based chemistry will no longer provide conditions suitable for life.\n\n\n\nAlthough the potential destructive effects of SCP-5814 has never been directly observed, studies have revealed that SCP-5814 may have initiated several CC-Class Scenarios in the past, resulting in the current ecology of the universe. Based on observations, SCP-5814 currently has limited negative impacts on carbon-based biology, but its effect will be unignorable in the time scale\u00a0\u00a0of millions of years.\n\n\n\nThe effects of SCP-5814 within its range of influence are embodied by a specific medium, SCP-5814-A. SCP-5814-A behaves like an ideal gas physically and is speculated to be composed of a kind of previously unknown boson[[footnote]]A class of particles. The main features of these particles is that they have integer spin, and an infinite number of bosons can occupy the same quantum state.[[/footnote]]. Particles that constitute SCP-5814-A are electrically neutral, but has a measurable electric susceptibility and behaves as a dielectric material in the presence of an electric field, manifesting an induced dipole [[footnote]]Electric susceptibility is the strength of a material's electric polarization when an external electric field is applied. The dielectric constant is a physical quantity reflecting the strength of this response.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5814-A can spatially penetrate all known solids, liquids, and gases, but its effects only manifest at atomic scales. For interactions at subatomic scales, SCP-5814-A will not cause any obvious effects.\n\n\n\nSCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility anomalously increases over time. As SCP-5814-A can penetrate through all known forms of matter, changes in its electric susceptibility affect the polarity of nearby matter, increasing the macroscopic dielectric constant of causing polar materials. It is proven that the rate of change in electric susceptibility follows the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 equation. Based on theoretical computation, the current value of SCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n**Addendum I.** The discovery of SCP-5814\n\n\n\nIn 1972, Foundation researcher Dr. Arnold Freking discovered a change in the measured speed of light in the air while reviewing earlier measurements of the speed of light. Though insignificant, the measured speed of light in air was found to have decreased in the past 100 years. This effect was shown to be more observable in water, in which the speed of light has decreased by \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588% in the last 100 years. Observations of other physical constants, such as measurements of the rate of nuclear reactions, have shown that speed of light in vacuum has not changed. Analysis based on observations, Hubble's law[[footnote]]A law used to determine the velocity of galaxies.[[/footnote]], and virial theorem[[footnote]]A physical law describing the relation between potential energy and kinetic energy of a system. The existence of unobservable substances (such as dark matter) was postulated based on unusual values obtained by Hubble's law and virial theorem.[[/footnote]] has shown that an unknown medium is distributed across certain regions of the Laniakea Supercluster. This medium had a certain degree of electric susceptibility and increased the dielectric constant of polar substances such as water upon interaction.\n\n\n\nAnalysis based on observed values showed that under the effects of SCP-5814-A, the speed of light observed in different media over time follows the equation c=c,,0,,\u00d7(b,,F,,+k,,F,,t)^^-1/2^^, now called Freking's law. This result implies that SCP-5814-A causes the relative dielectric constant of matter to change linearly with time. Dr. Freking deemed such phenomenon enough to declare SCP-5814 an anomaly. He reported his observation result to the Physics and Mathematics Research Institution of the Foundation (SCP-PMRI), who then classified the phenomenon on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/1980.\n\n\n\n**Addendum II.** Extract SCP-5814 research report, submitted to the Overseer Council by PMRI (\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2000)\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/EA|align=center|caption=Under the effect of SCP-5814, the activation energy of some reactions will be significantly lowered, which allows the corresponding reactions to proceed at a relatively low temperature.]]\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u2026By applying computational methods, we have proven that the cumulative impact of SCP-5814 has greatly changed the equilibrium pattern of chemical reactions within its region of effect in the Laniakea supercluster, especially reactions involving heavy elements and/or driven by electrostatic interactions.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> The main observable effect of SCP-5814 is to increase the dielectric constant of solvents, which is largely deleterious to most biochemical reactions. An illustrative example of the anomaly's impact is the stability of all-silicon analogs of biochemical molecules in water. Despite the fact that silicon dioxide is more thermodynamically stable than aqueous solutions of silicon biochemical analogues at any time, 8 billion years ago, the precipitation of silicon dioxide from these molecules and water would require a significantly higher activation energy. As a result, they could exist stably in aqueous environments even at room temperature.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Via theoretical calculations, we determined that the chemistry of silicon 8 billion years ago may have been as diverse and stable as modern organic chemistry. It was possible to design a whole set of stable silicon-based life-forming molecules. We could compute silicon analogs of amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides. They are capable of aggregating and forming silicon-based life which is similar to modern carbon-based life.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> As we know,\u00a0\u00a0as one of the most abundant substances in the universe, water would be the most appropriate solvent for life. If we keep pushing back in time, we may discover more varieties of life based on different chemistries. Phosphorus, sulfur, even metals. The tolerance of these systems towards water would be significantly increased, which would greatly increase the possibility of evolving life.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Based on such discoveries, we believe that we have already reached a conclusion about the potential hazards of SCP-5814. In the past 8 billion years, the dielectric constant of water has already increased significantly because of SCP-5814. SCP-5814 will lower the tolerance of certain compounds towards water, leading to rapid hydrolytic destruction[[footnote]]Collapse of molecular structure due to reacting with water.[[/footnote]] of the potential life-forming molecules, and finally reach the inert state of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Doomsday, for us, is inevitable, like what silicon-based life went through billions of years ago. We will become the nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water in Earth's atmosphere, become part of this planet's natural environment, and hand the baton of life to the next kind of life form.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Mechanization or digitization of our bodies may perpetuate the existence of the human species for a short period of time, but these methods still rely on physical mediums, which we expect to be destroyed by water given that the effect of SCP-5814 strengthens as time passes. We now believe that these options will remain vulnerable to SCP-5814 and cannot be regarded as a solution.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> We will meet the end of all life even without SCP-5814, but it will accelerate this process. Due to its properties, we currently hold the pessimistic view that we cannot contain the effects of SCP-5814, just as how we cannot resist the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n\n\n**Addendum III.**\u00a0\u00a0Archaeological Exploration History in Greenland\n\n\n\nIn year 1986, giant groups of supracrustal rock pillars were discovered beneath the tundra in Greenland while quarrying. These rock pillars may be among the oldest landscapes on the Earth, estimated to have existed for over 3.8 billion years, but internally displaying excavation marks unexplainable by natural phenomena.\n\n\n\nSite-\u2588\u2588 acquired ownership of the land on \u2588/\u2588/1986 and cordoned off surrounding regions. Exhumations completed on \u2588/\u2588/1990.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/800px-Uummannaq-mountain-southeastern-pillar-trabants.jpg|align=center|caption=Part of rock pillars in Greenland Region after completion of exhumation.]]\n\n\n\nDuring 1991~2013, MTF-\u2588-\u2588\u2588 carried out multiple explorations of the area and revealed more clues about the previous effects of SCP-5814 on Earth. Some contents of the exploration activities are summarized in the extract of the related report shown below.\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u2026These ancient rock pillars are quite unusual. They were very well preserved by the surface tundra, which allowed us to investigate structural details even after billions of years.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> We have discovered complicated, intercrossing caves within these pillars, unexplainable by any known natural causes. These special cave-like structures may have specific functions in the past, such as an ancient city built by prehistoric civilizations.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> The fourth operation has brought back a 2.4 mL sample of an unidentified amber-colored liquid and a cuboid sample of diamond containing regular etched patterns with stored information. The liquid was later identified to be polysiloxane compounds dissolved with low amounts of silicon-oxygen clusters, likely to be the remains of organisms based on silicon-oxygen chemistry.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Considering that the pillars were formed 3.8 billion years ago, it is unlikely that the structures were built by terrestrial carbon-based organisms. This point of time is earlier than the earliest carbon-based life. We can confirm that we have discovered direct evidence of form of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds, which is different from almost all known carbon-based organisms. This area may be ruins of a colony of these silicon-oxygen-based organisms.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/Si|caption=A specimen of silicon-oxygen-based organisms discovered in the operation.]]\n\n\n\nDirect evidence of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds was discovered in nearby sedimentary rock layers during the sixth exploration operation. Fossil-like fragments of a previously unknown organism were found, along with the existence of silicate particles encapsulating some catalytically-active cluster molecules, mainly composed of silicon and oxygen.\n\n\n\nThese particles were confirmed to be spore-like propagules of a silicon-based lifeform, which survives on silicate minerals. To cultivate these organisms, a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should be used to replace water. The relative dielectric constant of DMSO is 48, significantly lower than the value of water (around 80). The need for DMSO for this organism could be explained by the effect of SCP-5814, which has raised the dielectric constant of water.\n\n\n\n**Addendum IV.**\u00a0\u00a0Extract from PMRI's report on the latest progress about the clay hypothesis[[footnote]]A hypothesis about the origin of life. This theory proposes that the primitive form of cells is small bubbles in aluminosilicate clay minerals containing biomacromolecules. The clay minerals are capable of catalyzing the formation of these macromolecules and protecting them against hydrolytic decomposition.[[/footnote]]\uff08\u2588/\u2588/2019\uff09\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0Some hypotheses postulate that clay minerals have played essential roles in the formation of carbon-based life on Earth. There is already literature documenting that clay minerals can store energy from mechanical force and cosmic rays, and may enable the formation of primordial organic molecules with such energy.[[footnote]]Reference: Coyne, L. M., Lawless, J., Lahav, N., Sutton, S., & Sweeney, M. (1981). Clays as prebiotic photocatalysts. In Origin of life (pp. 115-124). Springer, Dordrecht.[[/footnote]]. There have been recent multiple publications focusing on this hypothesis. Several pieces of evidence have supported the hypothesis that porous structures inside clay minerals may absorb carbon-containing molecules that can create life e.g. amino acids, allowing them to react in the clay hydrogel, resulting in important biomacromolecules.[[footnote]]Reference: Yang, D., Peng, S., Hartman, M. R., Gupton-Campolongo, T., Rice, E. J., Chang, A. K., ... & Luo, D. (2013). Enhanced transcription and translation in clay hydrogel and implications for early life evolution. Scientific reports, 3, 3165.[[/footnote]]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Recent results from internal research have also shown that the formation of carbon-based lifeforms is likely to be based within vesicles of clay minerals containing transition metal elements. The formation of such vesicles in a silicon-rich environment is not difficult. They raise carbon-based life, like alchemists' flasks raised homunculi.[[footnote]]Artificial human-like creatures in alchemical legends.[[/footnote]]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> However, from alternative perspective, another possibility emerges. As fungi live on the nutrition in dead wood, could carbon-based organisms be born on the corpses of silicon-based life?\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Recently, the team studying SCP-5814 has reported some notable discoveries. They analyzed ore samples collected in Greenland since 1991 and unexpectedly discovered some polysiloxane liquids within, which contain a high content of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and silicon-oxygen clusters with unusually complex structures. In inorganic synthesis chemistry, such compounds are considered precursors to the synthesis of silicate minerals.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> We have never discovered such compounds in nature previously, as according to current experimental results, such compounds should be unstable under the conditions for hydrothermal mineralization. But if we consider SCP-5814's effects, then we must conclude that such molecules belonged to the corpses of a lifeform based on a silicon-oxygen biology.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> The silicates in the region have existed for about 3.7 billion years. The formation of silicates generally indicates the collapse of complex systems based on silicon-oxygen clusters; in other words, the domination of silicon-based lifeforms on Earth, if it ever happened, would have ended about 3.7 billion years ago. Modern biology hypothesizes that this is the time period when carbon-based lifeforms originated on the Earth.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Taking Freking's law into consideration, we determined that when the Earth was just formed, carbon-containing compounds were too inert to evolve life. But approximately 3.7 billion years ago, SCP-5814 made the chemistry of carbon close to the edge of being able to evolve life. Under those conditions, the formation of life would require assistance from some catalysts, such as the aforementioned clay.\n\n\n\n**Addendum V.**\u00a0\u00a0Interpretation of information contained within recovered diamond\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/kaleidoscope|caption=Microscopic observation of the internal pattern of the diamond sample. Colors observed in the photo were caused by interference of light between etched patterns.]]\n\n\n\nDuring the 4^^th^^ operation exploring the area in Greenland, a finely polished black moissanite[[footnote]]A type of hard mineral composed primarily of silicon carbide.[[/footnote]] sphere was discovered. Using center of gravity, it was determined that one side of the moissanite sphere was hollow and the other was solid. After breaking the sphere's hollow side, a cuboid sample of colorless diamond with dimensions 1.2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 0.8 cm was recovered, with etched traces inside. The etching method for such patterns is currently unknown.\n\n\n\nOn \u2588/\u2588\u2588/2020, decryption work on information stored within diamond crystal was finished. The stored content was a quintuply mathematically encrypted radio wave signal, with a frequency of \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588GHz. Excluding environment noise, a complicated periodic signal was be identified, speculated to be an analytic language; vocabulary was only partially translated. The wave record lasted for 17 minutes and 24 seconds.\n\n\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n>[(expressing negative emotion)]-[individual]-[death]-[(unidentifiable, speculated to be a noun)]-[information]-[conserve]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [prehistoric]-[life]-[Laniakea Supercluster?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [5]-[13]-[14]-[15]-[16]-[23,8]-[26,27,28,44,76]-[42,74,8][[footnote]]Spectulated to be atomic numbers of elements that constitutes backbones of the corresponding forms of life.[[/footnote]]-[\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]-[life]-[civilization? culture? technology?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [live? survive?]-[competition]-[planet? galaxy?]-[water]-[dependence]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(possibly expressing relation between subjects)]-[war? conflict? anger?]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14]-[(expressing active voice)]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[weapon]-[release? generate?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [water]-[deadly]-[hydrolysis?]-[oxidation]-[life]-[destroy? kill? stop?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [release? generate?]-[control]-[(expressing negation)]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [extinction? collapse?]-[(expressing order)]-[\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]-[13]-[5]-[26,27,28,44,76]-[23,8]-[16]-[15]-[42,74,8]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [aimless spatial movement?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[14][[footnote]]14 is the atomic number of silicon.[[/footnote]]-[throughout]-[Laniakea Supercluster?]-[numerous]-[planet? galaxy?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[avoid happening of a certain incident?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [planet? galaxy?]-[other]-[14]-[machanilization?]-[body]-[oxidation]-[(expressing causality)]-[extinction? collapse?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [planet? galaxy?]-[other]-[14]-[hydrolysis?]-[(expressing causality)]-[extinction? collapse?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [corpse? remains?]-[14]-[hydrolysis?]-[(expressing causality)]-[body]-[formation]-[life]-[14,8][[footnote]]8 is the atomic number of oxygen.[[/footnote]]-[(first person plural?)]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [evolving]-[life]-[14,8]-[civilization? culture? technology?]-[time scale expression]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [**Earth's coordinates**]-[(expressing a certain moment?)]-[14]-[arrive? reach?]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[arrive? reach?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(expressing a certain moment?)]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14]-[inevitable]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [hydrolysis?]-[corpse? remains?]-[14]-[mantle?]-[formation]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0[(expressing a certain moment?)]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14,8]-[start]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [aimless spatial movement?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[14,8]-[throughout]-[Laniakea Supercluster?]-[numerous]-[planet? galaxy?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[avoid happening of a certain incident?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [**Earth's coordinates**]-[(expressing a certain moment?)]-[14,8]-[arrive? reach?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(expressing a certain moment?)]-[(unidentifiable, speculated to be a noun)]-[hydrolysis?]-[death]-[individual]-[all]-[inevitable]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [future form expression?]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14,8]-[inevitable]-[corpse? remains?]-[14]-[earth crust?]-[formation]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(expressing negative emotion)]-[information]-[record]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-5813]]] | SCP-5814 | [[[SCP-5815]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Re_spectators, translated by Jochoi]]\n\n=====\n\n[[<]]\n\n> **Original Article:** http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/re-spectator-s-proposal\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** Laniakea.jpg\n\n> **Name:**Laniakea.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Andrew Z.

The storage space above (8-E) is currently being cleared of its contents and is considered to be part of SCP-6260's containment area. Other objects may be kept in the aforementioned area with Research Curator approval, with the exclusion of any data storage devices, including magnetic, digital, physical, biological (cellular material, brain tissue and other objects containing information encoded on a molecular level). This restriction does not apply during experimentation. Storage space 9-E has been retooled into a cinema hall for the purpose of testing.</p>\n<p>No personnel are allowed within a 4.5 metre radius of SCP-6260, with operation involving the object taking place with mechanical equipment free of electronic computation devices (such as hydraulic manipulators). All personnel are allowed to examine the motion-picture, provided they maintain notes or video recordings of everything on screen past the 218 second mark.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6260 is a metallic film reel case with 16-mm celluloid and optical soundtrack inside. The object bears a sticker note reading \"Experiment recordings. Site 44. #153. 1974. For internal use. Safe for display\" in English. This information is redoubled in Russian on the opposite side of the case, along with all the inventory data. The tape is 1800 metres long. Manual frame-by-frame analysis of SCP-6260 without use of a projector has determined that the projected image corresponds to that on the reel up to frame 5241 (218 seconds in), but what follows after is random footage, unique to every showing of SCP-6260. All attempts to reproduce the film or extract separate frames have failed.</p>\n<p>The main anomalous effect of the object (referred to as SCP-6260-A) is that prolonged storage of any form of data - audio, video, static imagery, text, or biological information - in proximity of the object causes degradation of said data. The effect presents itself in the form of soundtrack corruption, disappearance of objects or whole frames from video footage (digital or film-recorded), deformation of images on paper (up until complete unrecognizability), disappearance or distortion of text. This influence results in irreversible retrograde amnesia and dysfunction of biological processes on human beings due to mutation of DNA and RNA. Prolonged human presence within 4.5 metres of SCP-6260 results in the following consequences (averaged and dependent on distance from SCP-6260 and degree of continuity):</p>\n<p>1) Long-term memory failure during the first 2 hours of contact, progressing and irreversible retrograde amnesia during the first 5 hours of contact, irreversible loss of higher skills and aptitudes after 12 hours of contact, complete degradation of base cognitive processes after 50-60 hours of contact;</p>\n<p>2) Extremely weak DNA mutations (replication failure) during the first 10 hours of contact. Considerable destructive biological processes in test subjects' organisms, coupled with acute apoptosis of actively proliferating cells from 10 to 55 hours of contact. Breaking contact at this stage consequently causes formation and development of malignant neoplasms. Catastrophic degenerative changes on cellular and generic levels will occur, with DNA sequence destruction, total cell death of hepatobiliary and blood-vasculary systems, as well as cell apoptosis of the central neural system following after. Subjects will expire after 70 to 80 hours from time of contact.</p>\n<p>SCP-6260-A appears to be highly related to the effect known as SCP-6260-B, which is the appearance of some data lost to the effect of the anomaly in SCP-6260 as played within a film projector, suggesting a kind of \"absorption\" of said data by the object. Past 218 seconds in, the movie contains fragments of information destroyed as a result of the object's influence. Examination of various versions of the movie has yielded several distinct characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All versions of the movie are monochrome;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The presence of a background audio scale unique to each viewing of the movie and conveying feelings described as \"oppressive\", \"tedious\", \"cacophonic\". Many viewers noted a distinct pervasiveness of the sounds, reporting being unable to mentally distance themselves from them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The presence of \"men in white coats\", SCP-6260-N (not including the persons within the fragment up to 218 seconds in) as central actors in the movie's storyline. These persons will move around the scene without using normal limb movement. Their legs will always be pressed together, and no visible use of muscles has been observed. Their arms remain static while the person moves (pressed close to the body or held in the position they assumed before initiating movement). The subjects move in short, barely observable shifts, \"vibrating\" slightly, which cannot be written off as artefacts of otherwise smooth and stable playback. Likewise, the subjects do not use their necks to turn their heads, instead turning the whole body in place as needed, without vibration or shifts. No blinking or movement of pupils has been observed. In a number of cases, SCP-6260-N's uniform bears heraldry of the Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-6260 was located within the archives of Site 7. The Foundation's practitioners were assigned to the film libraries for the purpose of viewing archived movies for planned inventory inspection and acquisition of knowledge. On 31.08.2018, archivist E. Povishev proceeded with the showing of films from the \"International archives\" section, containing declassified materials transferred around 1990s by foreign colleagues during formation of the Russian branch of the SCP Foundation. During the viewing, racks of seemingly light-struck film have been found; SCP-6260 was located among them.</p>\n<p>The relations between \"SCP objects\" demonstrated in the movie and the real ones [REDACTED]. However, a number of portions of the movie contains noticeable references to the existing objects numbered \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as well as objects, documentation of which was held in the damaged section of the Site 7 archives (see report 6260-18-9-AA for full list). Full analysis of archived data loss is currently in progress.</p>\n<p>The relations between storylines demonstrated in the movie and memories lost by employees under the effect of the object are currently being ascertained.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0main\u00a0fragment\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-6260</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Seconds</th>\n<th>Synopsis</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-4</td>\n<td>Frames denoting the film as belonging to the Central Foundation Archive in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cave complex, viewing safety mark.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-6</td>\n<td>Film cut.

The subject's face is concealed by numerous electronic sensors. A painting with a portrait of a man is located nearby. The accouterments and equipment used appear consistent with 1970's standards.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>37-56</td>\n<td>The face on the portrait begins distorting in a soundless scream, creating the impression that it is alive.

The mouth of the portraits expands to unnatural size. The eyes fall \"inwards\", leaving large dark openings in their place.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90-125</td>\n<td>Disturbance is visible among the personnel, medical equipment registers arrest of bodily functions. The operator affixes the camera to its stand and rushes to assist his colleagues. The portrait's canvas deforms and curves outwards to conform with the features of the face depicted on it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>125-180</td>\n<td>Medical equipment registers the death of the child on the surgical table. The anomaly of the painting disappears, the face appears normal and unmoving for a time, but the canvas soon begins to stretch with uncharacteristic elasticity, forming the shape of a human face pushed out of the painting by approximately 1 meter.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>181-215</td>\n<td>The portrait tears, revealing nothing behind it. The men in coats observe the object. Suddenly, all light bulbs explode. Light of a kerosene lamp and the silhouette of the employee holding it appears from the darkness.

Several specimen of SCP-6260-N manipulate unknown instruments. One SCP-6260-N instance turns in place with no visible use of their motor system and begins to look into the camera. After several seconds it begins to move toward the camera in short bursts.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>280-346</td>\n<td>Spacious laboratory. A large group of men in coats with a defunct logo of the Foundation on their chevrons inspects flasks and test tubes filled with various liquids and powders. Some of the glassware bears labels \"H2O\", \"Cocoa\", \"Very dangerous acid\".</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>347-378</td>\n<td>Sudden change in frame. The same SCP-6260-N instances stand in two rows in the same lab space, holding each other by the shoulders and performing a sort of \"sirtaki\" dance. The rows fluently shift side to side in opposite directions from each other. Their legs are closed, forming a visual sensation of \"unseen levitation\".</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>379-384</td>\n<td>Film cut. Article containing information about SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>385-431</td>\n<td>A man is attached to the wall inside a drawn circle and a square inscribed within it. A plaque reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\" hangs above his head. A man in a coat stands nearby and semi-periodically throws and raises a switch in unnatural motions using only the bend of his elbow. The image of the man on the wall changes to a comical schematic caricature of a bright vibrating skeleton on dark background. Sets of symbols and punctuation marks appear in the air, similar to depictions of foul language in cartoon media.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>432-518</td>\n<td>Film cut. A city park, two children walk along the alley. The monochrome colour scheme prevents attempts to ascertain the time of day. Silhouettes of three swaying men moving with legs closed appear in the distance; one of them is holding balloons. The children run away in panic, the camera follows them. A woman-like figure appears in front of them. The children run to it, but notice that it also does not move its legs, though it doesn't sway like the \"men in coats\" either. The woman moves monotonously, as if sliding, statue-like. The camera turns around and films the SCP-6260-N instances in close proximity. [This fragment bears some resemblance to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 childhood memories, which he cited during employment discussions as his first personal contact with the anomalous (that being the woman-like figure). When presented the similarity by his colleagues, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 denied all claims of making such a citation and stated having witnessed nothing of the sort.]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>519-734</td>\n<td>Film cut. A SCP-6260-N instance shows a sign reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. 05/18/1974\", then leaves. The camera shows another SCP-6260-N instance standing beside a human lying down (identified as D-63574, deceased after 72 hours of contact with SCP-6260). After five seconds of stillness SCP-6260-N's mouth begins to sharply open and close unnaturally. The process can be described as part of the lower jaw detaching between chin and lower lip, with two vertical black stitches forming along the edges of the deformed area. The process continues with various levels of intensity for about a minute, before the instance begins to perform manipulations with unknown equipment. The instance begins to attempt to apply an IV with an extremely long needle to the man, who resists and screams inaudibly.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>734 - 1218</td>\n<td>Film cut. The scene corresponds to block 4 of Site 7, where a number of experiments on the SCP-6260 took place. A SCP-6260-N instance sits at the table across a 16-year old child. Both subjects proceed to play chess, with the instance appearing to lack even basic rule knowledge of the game. In response to the opponent's valid moves it throws two figures off the board, ingests one and partially inserts another into his nostril. After breaking the chess clock with repeated presses of the button, the instance puts the chess away and places two pens and a piece of paper on the table. The subjects proceed to play tic-tac-toe. The coated person places both a nought and a cross during one match, often misses the cells or even draws on the table itself. In their last match the instance loses their pen and attempts to draw a cross using its finger. Despairing, SCP-6260-N instance rips the paper apart, eats it, then begins monotonously beating the teen on the head with a fist, bending only the elbow.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1219 - 1249</td>\n<td>No film cut. A short fragment of film depicts a person in an exposure suit running through a dark tunnel. After several seconds a large group of pursuers appears out of the dark from off-screen, consisting of SCP-6260-N instances with the faces of different people, among which have been found: Leslie Nielsen, Benny Hill, Louis de Fun\u00e8s, Bill Murray, archivist Povishev, D-63574, Dr. Heffelbaum (curator of SCP-6260) and several of the research team staff. All these instances wear white coats. Leslie Nielsen waves a screw driving machine above his head menacingly, Benny Hill runs with a large potted ficus in his hands, archivist Povishev pushes a cart of film reels with Bill Murray sitting in it. The scene is accompanied by the default oppressive audio sequence with an overlaid laugh track.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1250 - 1401</td>\n<td>Film cut. Extremely low video quality. The oppressive audio background has been replaced with a pleasant musical composition. Scene unknown. A teenager sits at the table takes turns using a screwdriver and soldering tools. A large toy robot resides nearby. After a short period of work the teenager unscrews the robot's head, installs a part inside, drips in a portion of liquid from his oil can, then screws the head back on. The robot's eyes light up one after the other, the mouth opens and closes a few times. The child stands up from his seat, the robot follows with its legs closed, waddling from side to side. Sudden change of scene. Home environment. Both of the subjects mentioned above sit on the floor of a living room corresponding to the style of the USA's seventies. The robot is playing with a toy rocket, the boy is drawing the portrait of a girl, displaying a high level of artistic skill. After some time the child and the robot sit on the sofa and turn on an old-looking television, which proceeds to play cartoons. The child laughs, with the robot often widely opening and closing its mouth. The TV screen suddenly displays a splash picture with the logo of the Foundation on white with undiscernable writing, the usual oppressive audio background returns. The child begins to cry, the robot proceeds to assiduously destroy the TV.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>s.s.s.

The subject hysterically asks to stop the experiment (likely addressing what is happening on the screen). The image deformation scene causes genuine fright to the subject. Suddenly, the fragment is cut short. A scene with a boy holding an encyclopedia appears on screen, the subject calms down and approaches close to the screen. The subject begins to talk with the movie projection, the boy on the screen mutely opens his mouth in response. (The following is a transcript of the recording procured by a lip reader after the Incident.) S.s.s. Ryabov is in the meanwhile only able to observe D-22434's responses and urgently attempts to phone the linguistics department. &gt;<br/>\n<em>Boy: Hello. I'm Victor.</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> Hi. And I'm \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. What are you doing?<br/>\n<em>Boy: I'm reading about rockets. I like reading a lot. I have a lot of books. I have a book about ships, too &lt;demonstrates the book&gt;, and about stars. Do you know how long it takes for sunlight to reach us?</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> No.<br/>\n<em>Boy: Almost 8 minutes. If it disappears, we'll learn about it after 8 minutes. Then it'll be dark. And then we'll be cold.</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> Did you read that in the book?<br/>\n<em>Boy: Mhm. And I have a big strong robot, Titan. He came from the Prometheus nebula to save the galaxy from the evil aliens from planet Scipio-44.</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> Aliens?<br/>\n<em>Boy: Yes. They kidnap people, especially kids, and make strange, meaningless experiments on them.</em><br/>\n<strong>s.s.s. Ryabov &lt;in the observation post&gt;:</strong> Hello? Hello! Korobov? Send me someone who can read lips\u2026 what? Didn't hear you\u2026<br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> Why do they do that?<br/>\n<em>Boy: I don't know. Maybe they just like\u2026 to cause pain.</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> And what do they look like?<br/>\n<em>Boy: They pretend to be people. Wear white coats. They sometimes have a sign, like a circle with arrows pointing in.</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434 &lt;shows fear&gt;:</strong> No! They're here! Right here! A lot of them! They asked me to watch this scary movie!<br/>\n&lt;S.s.s. Ryabov pulls away from the call and puts the phone down.&gt;<br/>\n<em>Boy: They'll torture you too! They will! Titan couldn't save me in time! Run from them, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, before they cut your head open to see what's inside! They're evil, run!</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434 &lt;screaming in panic&gt;:</strong> Where? Where do I run?<br/>\n&lt;S.s.s. Ryabov presses the alarm button and runs out of the post, heading for the viewing hall. His route is interrupted by a cart hauling SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 through a corridor for experimentation. Ryabov thus loses approx. a minute of his time.&gt;<br/>\n<em>Boy: Run to the projector, there, where the light shines from! Rip the reel out and press it close to your chest!</em><br/>\n<strong>D-22434:</strong> But they told me not to touch it!<br/>\n<em>Boy: Yes, it'll burn you, but you'll end up here, with me. We'll play with Titan and read books and watch cartoons. They won't leave you alone, they'll do something to you. Do you want me to show what they do? Do you?</em><br/>\n&lt;A rapidly shifting montage containing sped up portions of SCP-6260 appears on the screen. D-22434 complies and runs to the projector. At the same time s.s.s. Ryabov rushes into the room and approaches the subject.&gt;<br/>\n<strong>s.s.s. Ryabov:</strong> Don't touch it! You hear me! Stop right now!<br/>\n&lt; D-22434 presses the film reel to his chest. Full biological decay happens to the body of the subject within two seconds, excluding only the skeleton on the floor. Ryabov panickedly rushes away from SCP-6260, security personnel armed with batons break into the room.&gt;<br/>\n&lt;Despite the film reel being ripped out from the projector, the movie continues on for a time.

The storage space above (8-E) is currently being cleared of its contents and is considered to be part of SCP-6260's containment area. Other objects may be kept in the aforementioned area with Research Curator approval, with the exclusion of any data storage devices, including magnetic, digital, physical, biological (cellular material, brain tissue and other objects containing information encoded on a molecular level). This restriction does not apply during experimentation. Storage space 9-E has been retooled into a cinema hall for the purpose of testing.\n\n\n\nNo personnel are allowed within a 4.5 metre radius of SCP-6260, with operation involving the object taking place with mechanical equipment free of electronic computation devices (such as hydraulic manipulators). All\u00a0\u00a0personnel are allowed to examine the motion-picture, provided they maintain notes or video recordings of everything on screen past the 218 second mark.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-6260 is a metallic film reel case with 16-mm celluloid and optical soundtrack inside. The object bears a sticker note reading \"Experiment recordings. Site 44. #153. 1974. For internal use. Safe for display\" in English. This information is redoubled in Russian on the opposite side of the case, along with all the inventory data. The tape is 1800 metres long. Manual frame-by-frame analysis of SCP-6260 without use of a projector has determined that the projected image corresponds to that on the reel up to frame 5241 (218 seconds in), but what follows after is random footage, unique to every showing of SCP-6260. All attempts to reproduce the film or extract separate frames have failed.\n\n\n\nThe main anomalous effect of the object (referred to as SCP-6260-A) is that prolonged storage of any form of data - audio, video, static imagery, text, or biological information - in proximity of the object causes degradation of said data. The effect presents itself in the form of soundtrack corruption, disappearance of objects or whole frames from video footage (digital or film-recorded), deformation of images on paper (up until complete unrecognizability), disappearance or distortion of text. This influence results in irreversible retrograde amnesia and dysfunction of biological processes on human beings due to mutation of DNA and RNA. Prolonged human presence within 4.5 metres of SCP-6260 results in the following consequences (averaged and dependent on distance from SCP-6260 and degree of continuity):\n\n\n\n1) Long-term memory failure during the first 2 hours of contact, progressing and irreversible retrograde amnesia during the first 5 hours of contact, irreversible loss of higher skills and aptitudes after 12 hours of contact, complete degradation of base cognitive processes after 50-60 hours of contact;\n\n\n\n2) Extremely weak DNA mutations (replication failure) during the first 10 hours of contact. Considerable destructive biological processes in test subjects' organisms, coupled with acute apoptosis of actively proliferating cells from 10 to 55 hours of contact. Breaking contact at this stage consequently causes formation and development of malignant neoplasms. Catastrophic degenerative changes on cellular and generic levels will occur, with DNA sequence destruction, total cell death of hepatobiliary and blood-vasculary systems, as well as cell apoptosis of the central neural system following after. Subjects will expire after 70 to 80 hours from time of contact.\n\n\n\nSCP-6260-A appears to be highly related to the effect known as SCP-6260-B, which is the appearance of some data lost to the effect of the anomaly in SCP-6260 as played within a film projector, suggesting a kind of \"absorption\" of said data by the object. Past 218 seconds in, the movie contains fragments of information destroyed as a result of the object's influence. Examination of various versions of the movie has yielded several distinct characteristics:\n\n\n\n* All versions of the movie are monochrome;\n\n\n\n* The presence of a background audio scale unique to each viewing of the movie and conveying feelings described as \"oppressive\", \"tedious\", \"cacophonic\". Many viewers noted a distinct pervasiveness of the sounds, reporting being unable to mentally distance themselves from them.\n\n\n\n* The presence of \"men in white coats\", SCP-6260-N (not including the persons within the fragment up to 218 seconds in) as central actors in the movie's storyline. These persons will move around the scene without using normal limb movement. Their legs will always be pressed together, and no visible use of muscles has been observed. Their arms remain static while the person moves (pressed close to the body or held in the position they assumed before initiating movement). The subjects move in short, barely observable shifts, \"vibrating\" slightly, which cannot be written off as artefacts of otherwise smooth and stable playback. Likewise, the subjects do not use their necks to turn their heads, instead turning the whole body in place as needed, without vibration or shifts. No blinking or movement of pupils has been observed. In a number of cases, SCP-6260-N's uniform bears heraldry of the Foundation.\n\n\n\nSCP-6260 was located within the archives of Site 7. The Foundation's practitioners were assigned to the film libraries for the purpose of viewing archived movies for planned inventory inspection and acquisition of knowledge. On 31.08.2018, archivist E. Povishev proceeded with the showing of films from the \"International archives\" section, containing declassified materials transferred around 1990s by foreign colleagues during formation of the Russian branch of the SCP Foundation. During the viewing, racks of seemingly light-struck film have been found; SCP-6260 was located among them.\n\n\n\nThe relations between \"SCP objects\" demonstrated in the movie and the real ones [REDACTED]. However, a number of portions of the movie contains noticeable references to the existing objects numbered \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as well as objects, documentation of which was held in the damaged section of the Site 7 archives (see report 6260-18-9-AA for full list). Full analysis of archived data loss is currently in progress.\n\n\n\nThe relations between storylines demonstrated in the movie and memories lost by employees under the effect of the object are currently being ascertained.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transcript of the main fragment of SCP-6260\" hide=\"- Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n\n||~ Seconds ||~ Synopsis ||\n\n|| 1-4 || Frames denoting the film as belonging to the Central Foundation Archive in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cave complex, viewing safety mark.

A large group of men in coats with a defunct logo of the Foundation on their chevrons inspects flasks and test tubes filled with various liquids and powders. Some of the glassware bears labels \"H2O\", \"Cocoa\", \"Very dangerous acid\".||\n\n|| 347-378 || Sudden change in frame. The same SCP-6260-N instances stand in two rows in the same lab space, holding each other by the shoulders and performing a sort of \"sirtaki\" dance. The rows fluently shift side to side in opposite directions from each other. Their legs are closed, forming a visual sensation of \"unseen levitation\". ||\n\n|| 379-384 || Film cut.

A plaque reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\" hangs above his head. A man in a coat stands nearby and semi-periodically throws and raises a switch in unnatural motions using only the bend of his elbow. The image of the man on the wall changes to a comical schematic caricature of a bright vibrating skeleton on dark background. Sets of symbols and punctuation marks appear in the air, similar to depictions of foul language in cartoon media. ||\n\n|| 432-518 || Film cut. A city park, two children walk along the alley. The monochrome colour scheme prevents attempts to ascertain the time of day. Silhouettes of three swaying men moving with legs closed appear in the distance; one of them is holding balloons. The children run away in panic, the camera follows them. A woman-like figure appears in front of them. The children run to it, but notice that it also does not move its legs, though it doesn't sway like the \"men in coats\" either. The woman moves monotonously, as if sliding, statue-like. The camera turns around and films the SCP-6260-N instances in close proximity. [This fragment bears some resemblance to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 childhood memories, which he cited during employment discussions as his first personal contact with the anomalous (that being the woman-like figure).

A SCP-6260-N instance shows a sign reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. 05/18/1974\", then leaves. The camera shows another SCP-6260-N instance standing beside a human lying down (identified as D-63574, deceased after 72 hours of contact with SCP-6260). After five seconds of stillness SCP-6260-N's mouth begins to sharply open and close unnaturally. The process can be described as part of the lower jaw detaching between chin and lower lip, with two vertical black stitches forming along the edges of the deformed area. The process continues with various levels of intensity for about a minute, before the instance begins to perform manipulations with unknown equipment. The instance begins to attempt to apply an IV with an extremely long needle to the man, who resists and screams inaudibly. ||\n\n|| 734 - 1218\u00a0\u00a0|| Film cut. The scene corresponds to block 4 of Site 7, where a number of experiments on the SCP-6260 took place. A SCP-6260-N instance sits at the table across a 16-year old child. Both subjects proceed to play chess, with the instance appearing to lack even basic rule knowledge of the game. In response to the opponent's valid moves it throws two figures off the board, ingests one and partially inserts another into his nostril. After breaking the chess clock with repeated presses of the button, the instance puts the chess away and places two pens and a piece of paper on the table. The subjects proceed to play tic-tac-toe. The coated person places both a nought and a cross during one match, often misses the cells or even draws on the table itself. In their last match the instance loses their pen and attempts to draw a cross using its finger. Despairing, SCP-6260-N instance rips the paper apart, eats it, then begins monotonously beating the teen on the head with a fist, bending only the elbow. ||\n\n|| 1219 - 1249|| No film cut. A short fragment of film depicts a person in an exposure suit running through a dark tunnel. After several seconds a large group of pursuers appears out of the dark from off-screen, consisting of SCP-6260-N instances with the faces of different people, among which have been found: Leslie Nielsen, Benny Hill, Louis de Fun\u00e8s, Bill Murray, archivist Povishev, D-63574, Dr. Heffelbaum (curator of SCP-6260) and several of the research team staff. All these instances wear white coats. Leslie Nielsen waves a screw driving machine above his head menacingly, Benny Hill runs with a large potted ficus in his hands, archivist Povishev pushes a cart of film reels with Bill Murray sitting in it. The scene is accompanied by the default oppressive audio sequence with an overlaid laugh track. ||\n\n|| 1250 - 1401 || Film cut. Extremely low video quality. The oppressive audio background has been replaced with a pleasant musical composition. Scene unknown. A teenager sits at the table takes turns using a screwdriver and soldering tools. A large toy robot resides nearby. After a short period of work the teenager unscrews the robot's head, installs a part inside, drips in a portion of liquid from his oil can, then screws the head back on. The robot's eyes light up one after the other, the mouth opens and closes a few times. The child stands up from his seat, the robot follows with its legs closed, waddling from side to side. Sudden change of scene. Home environment. Both of the subjects mentioned above sit on the floor of a living room corresponding to the style of the USA's seventies. The robot is playing with a toy rocket, the boy is drawing the portrait of a girl, displaying a high level of artistic skill. After some time the child and the robot sit on the sofa and turn on an old-looking television, which proceeds to play cartoons. The child laughs, with the robot often widely opening and closing its mouth. The TV screen suddenly displays a splash picture with the logo of the Foundation on white with undiscernable writing, the usual oppressive audio background returns. The child begins to cry, the robot proceeds to assiduously destroy the TV.||\n\n||\u00a0\u00a0|| s.s.s.
